              position luckily im not claustrophobic but 
              on rainy days i still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder so now that my stepmothers 
              pregnant i understand what the babys going 
              through and im not jealous at all really 
              not at all

       shelly are seated shelly is very pregnant

                     nervous

              thats been dead for a couple of days and 
              they havent found it yet cause it was in an 
              apartment and noone came to visit or 
              floating in a river and then the body starts 
              turning this weird shade of green you know 
              like watery pea soup the arms and legs 
              deteriorate first the body looks like a 
              raisin with four fat legs anyway this is why 
              im seriously considering cremation judy

       front door closes

              judy

              grammoos rooms a lot bigger and you get a 
              view of the whole neighborhood

       vada looks a little put out

                                   vada

       outside on the deck harry is playing his tuba shelly 
       comes out

                                   shelly
                     at the door

                     closer a little louder
              harry 
                     in harrys ear

              harry

       harry gets a fright and blows a foul note

              im sorry to interrupt honey but vadas 
              upset

              maybe vadas trying to tell us something too

       bowling alley vada and harry are bowling close up of 
       harry holding up his ball

                                   harry
              the thing to remember is you must visualize a 
              spare the parabola of the arcing ball must 
              intersect with the pyramid of the pins at 
              precisely this angle of attack

       harry bowls his ball which goes straight into the side 
       ditch

              shit

       harry walks back to vada

                                   vada
              visualize a spare

                                   harry
              well you know what i mean

              my mind

              bowling youve gotta have an angle

                                   vada

       vada returns and sits down

              own apartment  

       thud harry drops his ball and turns around looking 
       staggered then sees that vada is definitely kidding

       vada and judy are in a shop smelling perfumes

                                   judy
              my mother cant have any more kids

                                   judy

                     raising wrist to vadas nose
              what do you think

       vada smells judys wrist

                                   vada
              i think im leaning towards passionflower it 
              combines the traditional floral scent with the 
              musty aroma of samba wood

       a group of teenage guys enter the shop

                                   vada
              what are you staring at

                                   judy
              its kevin i dont want him to see me

                                   vada
              see you he can smell you from there

                                   judy
              oh god hes coming over here act natural 
              totally natural

       vada and judy stand close to a rack of sunglasses kevin 
       and his two friends approach

                                   judy
                     looks at kevin with a large smile 
                     and slowly takes her sunglasses off

              hi kevin

                                   kevin
              hi

       vada turns around wearing sunglasses with enormous lenses

                                   kevin
                     to vada
              real cool sultenfuss you look like a 
              grasshopper

       his group of friends laugh and move off

                                   vada
              whats the matter

                                   judy
              he likes you

                                   vada
              likes me he said i looked like a 
              grasshopper

                                   judy
              boys always pretend they hate you when they 
              really like you

                                   vada
              thats ridiculous so if you really cant 
              stand someone then you pretend that youre 
              really crazy about them

                                   judy
              i dont know and i dont care kevins a 
              jerk and i dont like him anymore hes all 
              yours

                                   vadas thoughts
              if grasshopper is a term of endearment ive 
              got a lot to learn

       bedroom in sultenfuss house arthur shelly harry and 
       vada are moving around doing various things

                                   arthur
              so have you guys thought of any new names for 
              the baby

       vada looks annoyed and drops with a thud the load of books 
       she is carrying

                                   shelly
              umm yeah if its a girl im kinda leaning 
              toward esme

                                   arthur
              esme

                                   harry
              yeah you know that kinda sounds like a noise 
              your nose makes 
                     nasalised

              oh harry junior of course

                                   vada
              dad when a boy likes you does he pretend 
              that he doesnt like you and if he pretends 
              that he doesnt like you how can you tell that 
              he likes you

                                   harry
              what boy likes you

                                   vada

              vada i think what youre talking about is 
              the fear of rejection you see men will do 
              anything to avoid looking foolish

                                   harry
              oh shell thats ridiculous where are my 
              needle nosed pliers

                                   shelly
              listen if a boy wants to do homework with 
              you it really means he didnt have nerve to 
              ask you out on a date so youll get your 
              homework together and pretend to be studying 
              and the next thing you know youre ordering 
              pizza and talking about your favorite movie 
              stars

                                   vada

              honey ahh guys dont wanna appear over 
              anxious so if you think theres a boy that 
              might like you let him know that you like 
              him so he wont feel hes taking such a risk 
              when hes thinking of asking you out

              okay

       outside vada is riding her bike down the pavement and 
       arrives at judys house

       vada presses the doorbell judy opens the door

                                   judy

       kevin appears from inside the house holding a carton of 
       juice

       vada goes to her locker and opens it exchanging books

                                   vadas thoughts
              how come guys talk so much when they have 
              nothing to say and girls have plenty to say 
              but noone will listen

              plays

              dad said that when she was on stage she held 
              the audience in the palm of her hand

                                   shelly

              disaster disaster lurks behind every
                     hesitates
              palm tree

                                   shelly
              youre being narrowminded

       harry begins to move up the stairs

                                   harry
              look maybe when shes a little older id be 
              more then happy to bring up

       vada approaches from upstairs

                     to vada
              ohhhi vada we were just having a 
              little

                                   vada
              you were just having a fight about me 
              wouldnt you like to hear my opinion

                                   harry
              of course

                                   vada
              i think that if im old enough to accept a 
              new baby and if im old enough to accept a 
              new room im old enough to go to california

                                   harry
              honey i know its fun to think about these 
              things but

                                   vada
              i already bought a ticket

                                   harry
              what

                                   vada
              i used my own money and got a great deal 
              its a q47nr five day fare which means that i 
              have to change planes in dallas and stay over 
              a saturday

              theres no exchanges or refunds soif you 
              dont let me go then i will have wasted my 
              entire life savings

                                   harry
              ah uh uh bubutbut i i isnt it 
              against the law to sell airline tickets to 
              minors

       harry looks at shelly who looks guilty

              dont tell me you aided and abetted this 
              little scheme

                                   shelly
              well vada needed me

       vada leaves the room

              besides the airline requires the signature of 
              an adult

                                   harry
              yeah and they forgot to ask for one who 
              wasnt having hormone surges

                                   shelly
              oh come on harry were talking about five 
              days here

                                   harry
              i really think were going overboard for just 
              a simple school assignment

       vada is back in living room rubbing her hand on the 
       pumpkin stain spot we can hear harry and shelly in the 
       background

                                   shelly
              but its not a little school assignment i 
              think maybe all of this is happening for a 
              reason

                                   harry
              reason what reason

       vada lies down and puts her head on the spot

                                   shelly
              phils moving to la grammoos passing the 
              baby being born vadas report i think

       camera is back on shelly and harry

              maybe all of these are signs signs that 
              its time for vada to take this trip

                                   harry
              signs oooooooooooh let me get the loch ness 
              monster on the phone you two have a lot to 
              talk about no im sorry vada is not going 
              to los angeles now i have made my decision 
              and that is final

       at the airport vada and harry are walking out towards the 
       check in desk

                                   harry
              and remember dont talk to anyone even if a 
              nun sits next to you dont talk to her

                                   vada
              no nuns got it

                                   harry
              and no boys promise me oh those la people 
              are all so corrupt youll end up pregnant and 
              on drugsand dont come running to me when 
              you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on 
              your toe having been beaten up into an 
              unrecognizable pulp by some surferand dont 
              make eye contact it communicates an implied 
              vulnerability

       vada hands her ticket to the attendant

                                   vada
              what does that mean

                                   harry
              it meansim a paranoid nitwit whos never 
              let his baby girl out of his sight for the 
              simple reason hes a paranoid nitwit so why 
              dont you just say oh dad and get on the 
              damn plane already

       vada gives harry a hug

                                   vada
              bye dad ill miss you

                                   harry

       vada waves as she boards the plane

              not too much

       outside view of airborne plane switches to inside view of 
       vada at her window seat she gets out her box and looks 
       through it again

                                   vadas thoughts
              its hard to believe that my mothers whole 
              life fits into this box ive just gotta think 
              of this stuff as cluesor good luck charms

              but i need more than luck to solve this 
              puzzle i need a miracle

       conveyor belt at airport in la vadas bag drops onto belt 
       and begins to move along at first attempt vada misses her 
       bag then she gets it

       vada has her bag and stands in the middle of the terminal 
       waiting a boy is seen running into the building he stops 
       and looks around passing straight by vada then turning and 
       trying to get a look at her vada will not allow this as she 
       keeps turning away from him

                                   boy
              are you waiting for someone

       vada stays turned away and does not reply

       vada turns nervously and looks at him

       vada and nick get off the bus and walk towards an empty 
       field there is a plaque standing near them so vada goes to

       the couch and jeffrey is sitting behind her operating it

              we called ourselves the appearing nightly 
              players

                                   maggie
                     on screen in french accent

              summerhaeverything went wrong

       then maggie in a doughnutfloatie in the sea with an 
       umbrella then playing volleyball then sitting at a table 
       surrounded by friends she is convinced to sing by her 
       friends which she begins to do

                                   maggie

              smile though your heart is aching

              smile even though its breaking

              when there are clouds

              in the sky youll get by

              if you smile through your fears and sorrows

              smile and maybe tomorrow

              youll see the sun come shining through if 
              you

              light up your face with gladness

              hide every trace of sadness

              although a tear may be ever so near

              thats the time you must keep on trying

              smile whats the use of crying

              youll find that life is still worthwhile

              if you just smile

       the group that maggie sang for start to complement her and 
       chatter away then the reel ends jeffrey turns off the 
       projector gets up and turns on the light

       object far away there is only one word to describe how he 
       looks
              stoned on love

       inside plane vada in her seat she removes her seatbelt 
       and opens her backpack

       she finds a little box which she opens and finds contained 
       in it a note and a pair of earrings she looks at the 
       earrings and then reads the note

                                   vadas thoughts
                     reading note
              in memory of barbaric customs love nick

              they all end with a kiss like that

       as vada disembarks she makes her way into the crowd of 
       people waiting to pick up others arthur is standing there 
       waiting vada approaches

              brother about my mom how i got to meet her 
              friends and find out how special she was i 
              meanshe may not have her footprints in 
              cement but she definitely left her imprint on 
              the worldand i told them that even though
