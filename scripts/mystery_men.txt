                         held high
                              singing
                         and dont be afraid of the dark

               tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the fully 
               orchestrated strains of when you walk through a storm 
               swell

               series of shots  as the music continues

               a hand stamps casanovas file cured casanova shakes 
               hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board 
               finishing with a paternal hug from doctor bierce

               in his cell a guard delivers casanova his favorite old disco 
               suit thats been waiting far him for twenty years

               casanova dressed in the suit walks down the central aisle 
               of the lockup a moment later he steps out of the massive 
               gates of the hospital and takes his first deep breath of 
               freedom while in an office window high above bierce and 
               the members of the review board stand watching very proud

               but suddenly the music changes to seventies disco as a black 
               ferrari drives up and doctor leek now dressed very sexily 
               gets out as the review board watches in stunned silence 
               casanova and anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl 
               finishing with a very lewd kiss

               bierce watching realizes hes been duped as casanova 
               grinning up at him puts a long gold chain his favorite 
               weapon around his neck

               anabel get in the car

               int the car  a moment later

               seen through the rear window behind them as casanova calmly 
               looks at his watch

               close on his watch 

               as the second hand just swings toward the twelve it is 
               exactly twelve noon

               back on casanova 

                                     casanova
                              almost wistfully
                         boom

               and the hospital explodes in a huge fireball that completely 
               consumes it

               back on the road  continuous

               the ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms 
               over the road showing a picture of captain amazing himself 
               a square jawed classic superhero staring fiercely into the 
               camera the caption reads crime dont even think about 
               it

               letters read six months later as the camera explores 
               the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards cruising past 
               piles of tires and abandoned train cars

               camera picks up a battered van as it drives through the yard 
               then pulls up beside an old boxcar the back of the van is 
               thrown open a ramp is thrown down and the red eyes a gang 
               of vicious small time thieves all of whom wear sunglasses 
               with red lenses start unloading their nights haul red

               statue and a top of the line baby stroller while their

                         dump him in the lake

               the others think thats a good idea and look around for a 
               brick

                                     red eye 3
                         come on kid youre goin for a 
                         swim

               but suddenly there is another presence a man in a blue 
               turban and cape with the initials br on his chest has 
               appeared he is the blue raja

                                     raja
                         not so fast gentlemen  and i use 
                         the term loosely unhand that 
                         youngster

               another man steps into the light he wears a construction 
               helmet and mask there is an s on his chest and he carries 
               an old shovel he is the shoveler

                                     shoveler
                         or youre mulch

               he brandishes his shovel for effect the red eyes look at 
               these two highly amused

                                     big red
                         what are you guys supposed to be 
                         superheroes

               a third man steps out his costume is less dramatic than the 
               others

               he wears only an old leather jacket and a faded torn shirt 
               with flames on it but the fierce look on his face and the 
               atrociousness of his haircut make it very clear that he is 
               the craziest and most dangerous of the three he is mister 
               furious

                                     furious

                                     big red
                         really did you mother make those 
                         costumes

               the crooks howl with laughter

                                     big red
                         this is our territory beat it

                                     furious
                         over your dead body

               big red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear

                                     big red
                         0ooooo hes scary

               the red eyes laugh but suddenly a small silver projectile 
               whizzes through the air and implants itself in big reds 
               backside he howls with pain pulls it out and examines it 
               its a silver dessert fork

                                     big red
                         a fork

               the raja holds up his hands each of which hold a spread of 
               silver forks

                                     raja
                         and theres plenty more where that 
                         came from

               big red gives a shrill whistle and a dozen more red eyes 
               step out of an old caboose including mikey a four hundred 
               pound behemoth he is eating a container of ben and jerrys 
               like it was an ice cream cone taking huge bites out of it 
               container and all

               raja and shoveler reacting gulp this was more than theyd 
               bargained for but furious just growls hes game

                                     big red
                         get em

               the red eyes attack mister furious goes into a furious 
               face his hair stands out straight and he rushes right into 
               the oncoming crooks

               a red eye takes a swing at the shoveler  but he simply 
               puts up his shovel and lets the crook slug the shovels pan 
               the crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand as 
               the raja fends off crooks poking them with salad forks 
               and the baby sits in his stroller watching and laughing 
               really enjoying the show theres no real martial artistry 
               or teamwork here this is a classic back alley brouhaha

               but theres too many of then the raja goes down under 
               swinging fists and so does the shoveler

               furious holds his own taking out crooks with powerful lefts 
               and rights  until mikey runs him down like a truck falling 
               right on top of him and crushing him under his massive weight

                                     red eyes
                         crush him mikey mash him 
                         mush him

                                     furious
                              barely audible under 
                              all that meat
                         is that all you got

                                     red eyes
                         he wants more squish him 
                         finish him off

                                     furious
                              faintly
                         your mother

               mikey sweating bears down but suddenly a calm very 
               authoritative voice is heard

               she takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her 
               finger like a harlem globetrotter for a long moment she 
               just looks at them smiling

               on the others watching almost mesmerized by the spinning 
               ball

               suddenly she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts 
               swinging the ball around her in wide ferocious arcs like a 
               cannibal with a war club  or a twirler on meth going so 
               fast she almost becomes a blur

               then just as suddenly she stops aims and rolls her ball 
               it shoots straight through invisible boys legs

               on a neatly placed collection of plaster lawn dwarves 

               as the ball smashes into then pulverizing them it goes 
               into a reverse spin passes through invisible boys legs 
               again and returns to the bowler who is holding its bag open 
               for it the ball rolls in

                                     bowler

                         youd be impressed right

               she turns and walks out our heroes share an amazed look 
               then run after her

               just outside the gate  on the bowler

               walking away as furious catches up with her

               she takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the 
               shovelers backyard but the camera pans across the street 
               to the dark place between two houses where a man wearing a 
               strange steel mask with a frightening impassively powerful 
               expression stands in the deep shadows watching them in 
               motionless predatory silence we do not know who he is and 
               we cannot tell if he is good or evil

               back at the barbecue  a little later  close on

               little girl in his arms

                         he was my father

               the others touched by this have gathered around the bowler 
               who is holding the old snapshot in her hand

               but as they yank them out the spleen sticks his head out of 
               the station wagon puts his face right up to the open window 
               of the limo and lets loose with a tremendous belch

               windows with his head flattening the tires by kicking them 
               knocking off the rear view mirror with the back of his hand

               then he leaps up on top of the limo

               while inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are 
               stomped into the roof above them

               angle through the windshield as furious leaps down onto the 
               hood and gazes in at them

               he tosses the dip stick away then leaps off just as tony p 
               gets off a shot exploding the windshield of the limo

               the shoveler throws the esquire into gear furious shouts

               he turns and points the pistol right at invisible boys head 
               furious struggles against his chains  to no avail

                                     tony p
                         sweet dreams punk

               invisible boy closes his eyes tony p cocks the pistol 
               but suddenly there is the ring of steel  a broad blade 
               sweeps through the air and tony ps pistol is sliced neatly 
               in half

                                     tony p

               the disco boys rush the newcomer but he slices through their 
               baseball bats with his machete and sends them reeling and 
               crashing into each other with expert forearm blows whacks 
               with the flat of his blade and head butts with his mask

               furious struggles to break free and join the fight but the 
               chains are too strong and the stranger doesnt need any 
               help

               tony p flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the 
               stranger who sidesteps him like a matador and swings his

               docked at the pier

               casanovas men throw the gate of the truck open and the 
               camera moves in no one is there but we notice two large 
               lumps under the packing blankets

               casanova holds anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden 
               crate being lowered from the deck of the freighter

                                     casanova

               casanovas cellular phone rings

               outside the diner  continuous

               the disco boy is on his phone his pistol is drawn and hes 
               got it aimed right at furious head

                                     disco boy

                         head hunting

               a minute later casanova and two or three disco boys drive 
               off in one of the sedans as the crate is loaded onto the 
               truck and the gate is pulled closed and locked

               inside the truck  a moment later

               the engine starts up and the truck starts to move as 
               invisible soy and the spleen poke their heads out from under 
               the packing blankets

               they approach the crate and invisible boy shines his 
               flashlight on it

               the crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands 
               theres no way theyre going to be able to get inside it 
               but in the light of the flashlight they see

               faded red lettering in russian and the distinctive old 
               hammer and sickle of the former soviet union

                         too bad plug him

               gunfire rings out from the alley as the disco bays step out 
               their pistols blazing but furious has anticipated them he 
               leaps right at casanova pins his arms in a bear hug and 
               holds him in the line of fire

                                     casanova
                         wait

               the disco boys stop firing furious drags casanova back 
               into an empty lot using him as a shield

                                     furious
                              to casanova

                         so are you

               furious releases casanova then runs for it and leaps over 
               the wooden wall at the end of the lot as the disco boys 
               open fire again and their bullets punch holes through the 
               wall

               furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night

               ext the frankenstein center  continuous

               the convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking 
               structure that we recognize from the model on the tv 
               interview with casanova earlier

               a high central tower rises up out of the half completed 
               bulwarks of featureless concrete it looks both totally modern 
               and completely ancient but a profound sense of evil connects 
               both themes beautifully

               angle on a plaque that reads

               frankenstein center for the performing and nonperforming 
               arts

               the gates of the center open and the convoy passes through

               inside the truck  a moment later

               invisible boy and the spleen stand listening waiting as 
               they feel the truck pull to a stop

               a moment later the gate is pulled opened anabel is there 
               with several thuggy looking security guards

                                     anabel
                         be careful with my baby

               there are two lumps under the packing blankets again

               ext loading dock  a few minutes later

               the crate is being carried away by a forklift a beat and 
               then invisible boy and the spleen slip out of the empty 
               truck

               and run down the road back toward the gates which are 
               still open

               theyre just about to pass safely through them when a pair 
               of armed security guards step in their path their guns 
               pointed at thern

                                     guard 1

                         hands up

               they freeze their hands held high

                                     guard 2
                         what are you two doing here

               our heroes are mute

                                     guard 1
                         not talking eh that can be fixed 
                         turn around start walking up the

                         and no funny business

               invisible boy and the spleen turn hands in the air and 
               start up the hill the guards right behind them

                                     spleen
                              after a moment to

                              whisper
                         pinch em

               invisible boy pinches his nostrils  and the spleen lets 
               out with a horrendous fart the guards gag and choke violently 
               in the fumes as our heroes turn and run for it escaping 
               out the gates

               int doc kellers laboratorybarn  a little later

               invisible boy and spleen report to the others

                                     invisible boy
                         whatever was in that crate is 
                         from russia

               the others consider this then hear a familiar voice

                                     furious os
                         is there room in the pack for one 
                         more wolf

               they look up and see that furious has just returned the 
               sphinx moves to him for a moment they stand face to face

                                     furious
                         i was wrong i need my friends

               sphinx takes off his mask revealing that he is the busboy 
               from the tacky taco

                         amigo

               they embrace

               a few minutes later the others are gathered around furious 
               listening to his story

                                     furious
                         casanova said that in two days the 
                         entire city would belong to him 
                         and there wasnt a thing that we 
                         could do about it

                                     bowler

                         i dunno

               through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside 
               the frankenstein center silhouetted ominously against it 
               raja shoveler and furious gaze at it

                                     shoveler
                         maybe its time we checked that place 
                         out

                                     raja

                                     furious
                              after a moment 
                              sounding very sphinx
                              like
                         we just become like the wolf who 
                         wears the sheeps clothing

               and vintage shoes ala the classic shot from saturday night 
               fever camera widens to reveal our three heroes dressed 
               in full blown seventies attire with vintage sunglasses 
               doing their best travolta strut down the street

               music continues as our heroes strut their way through the 
               gates of the art center right past the security guards

               outside the center  day

               they climb the long stairs toward the center which looms 
               above them then pass through the big wooden doors and 
               into

               int main hall  a moment later

               they hear a wild burst of drunken laughter echoing through 
               the hall

               furious has spotted a large covered dessert table waiting 
               to be wheeled into the hall

               back in the banquet hall  a few minutes later

               as the dessert table is wheeled in and in a closer angle 
               under the table cloth we see three pairs of disco shoes 
               creeping along

               a few minutes later monica steps up to the dessert table 
               suddenly she is yanked under

               under the table  continuous

               firmly over her mouth

               anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear 
               protectors then presses a button on a small remote control 
               device

               angle on a speaker placed above the podium as the air is 
               suddenly filled with a weird stridulating horrific noise 
               somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet 
               trapped in your ear and everyone in the room except anabel 
               goes completely berserk

               camera pans the tables as the guests laugh dementedly 
               punching gouging strangling and stabbing each other

               under the serving table our heroes go crazy

               casanova in a state of psychotic ecstasy whips out his 
               pistol and empties it into italian ice who drops to the 
               floor dead

               anabel presses the button again the sound winds down and 
               stops and everything returns to normal the entire event 
               lasted only a few seconds but the guests are dazzled

                                     crooks

               himself

               but suddenly a withering barrage of machine gun fire is 
               being laid down on them by three guards firing tommy guns 
               from a balcony overlooking the floor bullets splatter all 
               around them  and several unlucky guards are hit  but our 
               heroes dive for cover the raja tries to get off a fork but 
               the firing is too intense our heroes are pinned down

               retreat under it into the main tower

               back to casanova 

               as he types something into the security computer

               on the screen a computerized image of the eye appears 
               casanova highlights the word activate and then presses 
               enter

               back to the courtyard  on the eye

               as it comes to glowing sinister life

               a hapless guard retreats under the arch  the eye instantly 
               focuses on him and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser 
               beams that sizzle him

               a moment later our heroes arrive at the arch furious is 
               about to run through but doc heller holds him back

               the raja takes out a butter knife aims and hurls it straight 
               at the eye but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly 
               melt it into a formless blob of silver

               casanova hand held tightly across monicas mouth shouts 
               down tauntingly to furious

               desperate to find a way up but the wall is completely sheer 
               he feels helpless  frantic near tears

               flash to the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his 
               parents car crying pounding on the windows

               and then mr furious hands clench into fists  his hair 
               stands up  and his face turns into a mask of primordial 
               rage his button has finally been pressed bes mad he 
               reaches up as high as he can

               close on his hand 

               as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall 
               and he pulls himself up

               back at the top 0f the tower  continuous

               casanova throws monica onto the bed puts his hands on her 
               throat and strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against 
               his immense strength

               back to furious 

               fifty feet up and climbing he pulls himself up one hand 
               then another digging in his fingernails catching his toes 
               on whatever tiny cracks he can find as the others gaze up 
               at him

                                     heller

               a look of fierce determination on his face this is his 
               moment

               he takes a deep breath closes his eyes and concentrates

               on furious as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a 
               toehold gives way for a desperate moment furious is 
               dangling off the wall by the tips of the fingers of one hand 
               only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut

               suddenly there is a flash of silver and a large cake fork 
               embeds in the concrete not far from his head furious grabs 
               hold of it and throws a grateful look down to the raja

               who salaams up at him

               as invisible boy eyes closed in concentration walks very 
               slowly hands at his sides in an almost egyptian pose 
               toward the eye which stares down mercilessly waiting for 
               its next victim we notice that invisible boy has become 
               just slightly transparent

               our other heroes right behind them as the villains open

               furious grabs the gun out of his hand casanova ducks clear 
               furious tosses the pistol away then realizes hes bleeding

               them pinching their noses closed the spleen bent over at 
               their forefront

               while casanova dances around furious like a cat furious 
               fighting the pain of his bullet wound lunges at him and 
               casanova neatly sidesteps him

               the crooks and disco boys fall back gasping choking in the 
               noxious fumes

               as casanova attacks

               advancing shoulder to shoulder fighting as a team our heroes

               casanova comes at furious relentlessly kicking and 
               spinning and furious gets the worst of it

               suddenly a squad of disco boys comes charging at our heroes 
               from the flank but doc heller turns to face them shrinker 
               spray held rambostyle on his hip he lets them have it 
               blasting them with a dense blue spray

               when the spray clears the d boys lie squirming on the floor 
               prisoners in their now child sized disco suits

                                     disco boys
                         help get me out of this
                              etc

               upstairs casanova pummels furious

               while downstairs the shoveler dispatches the elvis brothers 
               with some nifty shovel work but suddenly the bland boys 
               pistols blazing are advancing on him forcing him back 
               against the base of a sculpture

               but the raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture

                                     raja os
                         gentlemen

               the bland boys look up and see the raja both hands filled 
               with silverware which he hurls

               a beat later the bland boys bristling with forks and 
               grapefruit spoons run screaming through the sculptures 
               as tony p pistol in hand skulks out from behind a sculpture 
               and spots the bowler

               upstairs furious goes flying against a wall

                                     casanova
                         roy youre making this too easy

               as tony p takes a careful bead on the bowler

                                     tony p
                         say hello to daddy for me

               he opens fire but she goes instantly into her ball swinging 
               frenzy

               he fires missing  shes too fast to keep a bead on 
               finally his gun clicks empty she turns and faces him

                                     bowler
                              grimly
                         daddy says hello

               she hurls the ball at him  like a fiery softball pitch

               balls pov 

               going straight for tony ps screaming head

               on the bowler watching  as tonys scream is cut short by 
               a gruesome thud

               back upstairs casanova comes at furious again but furious 
               ducks the kick pops back up and smashes casanova with his 
               good arm sending him flying across the room casanova 
               recovers

                                     casanova
                         lets change the tune

               he reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device 
               that anabel used at the luncheon he presses a button

               on the wolf sculpture as the jaws open its eyes glow red 
               and the dreadful sound of the psychostridulator grinds up 
               and fills the night air like a siren

               downstairs the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and 
               the villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode 
               the villains start shooting and stabbing each other

               series of shots  around the city  continuous

               on main street cars slam into each other pedestrians start 
               screaming and fighting a man and his dog snarl and snap 
               at each other

               the customers at the lakeside diner go insane hurling plates 
               and food

               at the shovelers house the kids turn psycho in front of the 
               television

               angle on a typical suburban neighborhood 

               as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture 
               can be heard coming from all the houses

               long angle of champion city 

               as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city

               back to the top of the tower  continuous  on casanova

               in full psychotic ecstasy

                                     casanova
                         what a rush
                              tosses the remote 
                              off the balcony

               on monica still motionless on the bed

               casanova and furious collide in the center of the room and 
               grapple in a contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman 
               strength casanova gets his hands around furiouss throat 
               and crushes it furious drops to his knees and casanova 
               thinks hes got him but furious grimacing with rage looks 
               him right in the eye

                                     furious
                              raspy voiced
                         is that all you got

               furious grabs casanovas wrists and crushes them casanova 
               howls with pain loses his grip furious slugs him again 
               and again then he grabs casanova by the belt swings him 
               around and hurls him into the air

               casanova crashes into the huge crystal chandelier  there 
               is an explosion of crystal and glass furious averts his 
               eyes as cut glass rains down all around him then he looks 
               up and sees

               casanovas gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the 
               chandelier

               casanova kicks and flails as he is hanged by the neck on 
               his own gold chain

               furious moves to the wolf sculpture be plunges his hand 
               through its bronze casing and rips out the heart of the 
               psychostridulator a flashing football sized device that 
               gives off an unamplified but higher pitched and more 
               irritating sound

               furious hurls the device hard against the floor and it 
               smashes into a thousand pieces

               close on one of the pieces 

               in insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched 
               even more disorienting sound this is the very nerve center 
               of the psychostridulator

               furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel

               silence

               furious drops to his knees wounded exhausted he looks 
               up at casanova who dangles lifelessly off the 
               chandelier

                                     furious

               suddenly somewhere in the night a burst of gunfire and 
               screams are heard the final music begins

                                     furious
                         amigos duty calls

               the mystery men wolf their burgers then stand and start for 
               the street

               as monica watches them leave a patron asks her

                                     patron
                         miss who are those guys

                                     monica
                              after a moment
                         i dont know

               just outside the diner  a moment later

               heroic group shot as the mystery men march down the middle 
               of street toward the sound of the gunfire and into the 
               night
