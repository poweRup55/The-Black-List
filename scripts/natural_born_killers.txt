     a black scorpion crawls towards us on hot tarmac  the sound of
     an approaching pickup  a tire crushes the life from the
     scorpion camera rising from it to reveal a desolate diner in the
     middle of nowhere

     int diner  day

     finishing his meal we hear the pingbangof a pinball machine
     being played off screen

     the cash register then dumping out the coins on the counter she
     selects a quarter

     mallory saunters past the cowboy playing pinball  as his eyes
     follow mallory he loses his ball

     she walks to the jukebox in the back inserts the quarter
     selects a song punches the buttons a needle lands on a record
     and a hardhitting rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop

     mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop  shes really cooking and smoking

     pinball cowboy and mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell
     these people are

     ext coffee shop  day

     a dirty pickup truck sporting a confederate flag decal pulls up
     to the coffee shop a dead deer in the back  sonny otis and
     earl three toughlooking rednecks pile out  steam rises from
     beneath the pickups hood

     int coffee shop  day

     the loudness of the rockabilly song slaps sonny and otis in their
     faces as they walk inside the door  the sexy sight of mallory
     doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks

                          sonny
                good god almighty  what the hell is that

                          otis

                          otis
                take a run at er kiddo

     sonny heads toward mallory  otis moves over to the counter next
     to mickey

                          otis
                miller mabel

                          mabel
                comin up

     sonny stands in front of mallory trying to copy what shes
     doing  her eyes are closed at the moment so she doesnt see
     him

     mabel sets the miller down in front of otis  otis takes a swig
     enjoying the floor show

                          otis to mickey
                thats some sweet piece of meat aint it

     mickey turns from his pie and looks at otis  his expression
     betrays nothing

                          mickey
                her names mallory

                          otis
                mallory whatever  who gives a shit  i call
                it pussy

     the needle lifts off the record  the song ends

     mallory opens her eyes and sees sonny grinding up against her
     grabbing for her tits

                          sonny
                hells bells  dont stop now sugar  im just
                getting warmed up

     sonny gives her his best shiteating grin before turning to otis
     otis gurgles out a laugh

                          otis
                hey i think shes sweet on you

     sonny turns to mallory

                          mallory sweet
               oh are you flirting with me

     she starts to sing shitlist by l7  sonny doesnt understand as
     she punches him hard in the face spinning him around  more
     punches follow as she wallops him all over the diner

     a new song automatically drops on  patti smiths rock n roll
     nigger or l7s shitlist pumping the room to a new peak of
     murder and insanity

     mallory grabs the back of sonnys head and smashes it down on the
     table cracking the linoleum

                          mallory
               dont fuck with my dance goddamnit mickey why
               do they fuck with my dance goddamn is it be
               cause im so cute why are they fucking with me

     otis jumps off the counter stool but mickeys hand clutches hold
     of his shoulder

     otis spins around toward mickey loaded for bear and points his
     finger at him threateningly

     before any threat can be made mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath and in a flash slices off otis finger

     otis finger drops on his boot  he grabs his aching hand  blood
     flows from the wound

                         mickey
               just because my womans mopping up the floor
               with your buddy is no reason for you to join in

     mickey makes five lightning quick slashing swings  the buck
     knife slips back into its sheath  at first there seems to be no
     difference with otis  finally blood flows from the slices made
     in his face and chest  otis collapses

     the shortorder cook in a hairnet charges out of the kitchen at
     mickey wielding a meat cleaver and screaming

     mickey whips out a 45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and fires

     bullets pov  heading fast toward shortorder cooks face  it
     hits  shortorder cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground screaming

     mickey spots earl whos standing outside the plate glass window
     earls watched the whole shebang

     earl mouths fuck  he turns and runs for it

     mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window which
     shatters  the knife plunges deep into earls back  he hits the
     ground dead

     mickey turns to mallory  shes sitting on top of sonny slamming
     his head repeatedly on the floor hes dead shes still singing

                          mallory
                you made myshitlist

                          mickey
                honey

     mallory looks up at mickey  she gets off sonny and moves to
     mickeys side

     mickey trains his 45 on pinball cowboy whos shaking in his
     cowboy boots  mickey aims at mabel whos clutching the coffee
     pot crying

                          mickey to mallory
                pick one

     mallory does eanie meanie minie moe pointing back and forth
     from mabel to pinball cowboy twice the jingle lands on the
     cowboy but mallory adds another phrase

                          mallory

                the toe  if he hollers let him go  eanie

                best one and you are it

     so that she ends on mabel  mabels dodging around screaming

     mickey fires the 45  the bullet chinks through the coffee pot
     mabels holding and explodes thunking her in the chest  she
     hits the floor dead

     mickey and mallory join hands and walk over to the pinball cowboy
     who stands in a pool of his own urine

                          mallory

     mallory leans into his face a yearning  she takes his hand

     he looks wondering surprised  theres something so needy so
     desperate in mallorys childlike eyes

     she takes his hand and runs it up inside her shirt muttering

     she fires again the shots bring the sound of bells jingling
     they look

     on a knoll fifty feet away stands a flock of rams

     conversely the rams pov is of a nearnaked man and a woman with
     a gun in the desert the chief ram tears out after mickey

                         mickey

     he starts to run

                         mickey
               shoot it  goddamn mall shoot the fucker

     mallory laughs as the ram closes on mickey  but the ram comes to
     an abrupt stop as it hears the whistle

     a figure now stands at the top of the knoll with the flock of
     sheep and a young boy  the ram trots back towards him

     mickey looking  mallory puts away the gun

     the figure is an old indian

     mickey crossing himself half joking

                         mickey
               rejoicefor he hath found his sheep which
               were lost in the desert

               hey chief we ran outta gasour cars up the
               road apiece

     the indian knows something he says nothing continuing down the
     hill and across the road with the young boy the ram and about 30
     sheep

     mickey throwing on his clothes follows with mallory their
     dispute forgotten for now

     ext desert hogan  day

     twenty feet across  a pickup is parked nearby  a scruffy dog
     alongside a pickup barks as they approach a donkey is tied to a
     pinon tree and sheep wander

     the young boy stands in the breeze watching them

     bed with a horsehair mattress sheep skins and an indian blanket
     a worn aluminum kitchen table occupies the middle of the room

     bays of dried ears of corn squash melon and beans lay on the
     dirt floor  chilies and dry mutton hang on wire strung on one
     side of the room  a pile of cedar wood is stacked by an old
     franklin stove a covered pot on top  scraps of cotton hang over
     the windows various photos of family and friends and feathered
     indian gear hang from nails pounded into the wall  its very
     quiet

     of sweetness and politeness  the young kid coming in and sitting

     in his hand

                         indian navajo
               once there was a woman who went out to collect firewood

     the snake is crawling over to the indian who reaches down and
     picks it up and puts in his lap

                         indian navajo

               the snake home with her  she put the frozen
               snake on her favorite blanket by the warm fire
               she fed it and nursed it back to health  one
               day she picked the snake up and it bit her on
               the cheek  as she lay dying she asked the
               snake i loved you why have you done this to
               me  the snake answered look bitch you knew
               i was a snake

     he chuckles as does the boy its very quiet the sound of the
     fire

     mickey has fallen asleep  the old indian begins to sing

     mallory is awake watching the indian  the room shadows
     dancing  it is the first time she can remember feeling peace
     almost like family  she starts to drift off

     mickey is dreaming out loud

     the old man stands and takes the snake to the door  opening it
     he lets the snake out

                         indian navajo
               go be a snake

     mickeys nightmare is getting heavier  hes moaning and sweating
     the old indian takes his feathered hat of f the wall and puts it
     on  he opens a wooden box and takes out a white eagle feather
     and a bundle of medicine

     ext hogan  night

     the old man and the boy with him now make offerings to the four
     directions to the grandfather spirit the stars the earth the
     mother praying singing  his face and hands are marked with
     white ash and colors so the spirits will recognize him

     int hogan  night

     as we hear the mounting sounds of the prayer we see mickeys
     face dreaming sweating

     the old man is now leaning over mickey and mallory in half light
     shaking the rattle and waving the burning sage over mickey to
     chase the demons

     beneath the counter with his fat finger  in a daze of his own
     he complies with mickeys request meandering to the medicine
     shelveson the tvwayne in front of a 711 store

                         scagnetti

               their blessing to get married

                         mcclusky

               its like that other lie  love makes the
               world go round

     they laugh together as they go past a new door a nervous guard
     whispers to deputy wurlitzer

     suddenly four guards come out of a cell carrying a badly bloodied
     prisoner  hes been stabbed over and over  they hustle him past
     mcclusky and scagnetti who keep talking ignoring the filthy looks
     thrown at mcclusky from every prisoner in the cell block

                         mcclusky
               so how does a guy like you become a
               specialist in psychos

                         scagnetti
               well dwight for starters id recommend having your
               mother killed by one after that happened i developed
               a rather keen interest in the subject

                         mcclusky
               what the hell happened

                         scagnetti
               i was born and spent the first part of my life in texas

                         mcclusky

               was five my mother took me out to play in the
               park  well that just so happened to be the
               same day that charles whitman climbed up to the
               top of university of texas tower and started
               shooting strangers

                         mcclusky
               you was with her

                         scagnetti

               the shots  i didnt hear any of em  one
               minute im walking with my mother and then all
               of a sudden her chest explodes  she hits the
               ground right  im just lookin at her  her
               forearm flies off  then her hip explodes
               now im not hearing any of these shots  all i
               know is my mother is falling apart in front of
               my eyes

                         mcclusky
               what about you son

                         scagnetti
               some hero grabbed me and threw me behind a
               bush  it took them all goddamn day to get
               charlie  so that meant i spent all goddamn
               day lyin flat on the grass being eaten alive
               by fuckin ants and thinkin what the fuck
               happened to my mom  ever since ive had a
               strong opinion about the psychopathic fringe
               that thrives today in americas fast food
               culture  i tend not to exhibit selfdiscipline
               becoming of a peace officer

                         mcclusky
               you got a right jack  say you dont mind
               dyou if i call you jack

                         scagnetti ignores the question
               not at all but i tell you what it is  these
               fucks think theyre special  daddy yanked
               their dicks momma never game em a hug   so
               they have carte blanche to take innocent life
                    mcclusky nods intensely
               they think theyre invincible  i never caught
               a killer yet who ever dreamed he might get
               caught  and they all look the same when i
               catch em  like little kids with their hands
               in the cookie jar

                         mcclusky
               thats my observation as well  we have an army
               of shrinks who talk about mania and
               schizophrenia and multiphrenia and obsessions
               but its all bullshit  its pride  arrogance
               somewhere somehow they get the idea theyre
               better than everyone else  it makes mesick
               and mickey and mallory knox are thesickestive ever seen

     int dining area  day

     they walk through the spotless dining area  the prisoners eat
     silently each one more uptight than the one before him

     the guards on the catwalks above sense something in the air
     nervous nodding to the warden who makes ad lib inquiries as he
     moves

                         mcclusky to prisoner
               yall right

                         wurlitzer nervous
               dont go down that corridor chief

     mcclusky changes direction

                         kavanaugh whispers
               not there either boss

     mcclusky waits

                         scagnetti shrewd
               so why me dwight  whats this really about

                         mcclusky

               air

                         scagnetti

                         mcclusky
               the one thing you dont want in prison jack
               issilence

     camera coming to rest on a huge black inmate  hes not eating
     hes not chewing  hes not blinking  the inmates on either side
     of him look like they might shit their pants

     the man hes looking at is nervous jacked up on speed

                         nervous man
               dont focuking you look at me motherfucker

     the black guy goes for him lunging across the table with a fork
     aimed at the jacked up guys throat

     but mcclusky beats him to the punch  twisting a personalized
     medieval instrument of torture  a thumb cracker or something
     over the inmates fingers  breaking them backwards

     the black inmates face shows the agony he is feeling  as he
     finally releases the fork

     guards now surround the two prisoners and cart them away

     as mcclusky renews his walk with scagnetti reinvigorated by the
     incident

                         mcclusky to guards
               put him in f block for the month  then bring
               him to me

     to bounce off every reflecting surface he sees continually

               years ago  great welterweight  but dumb 
               like all these killers couldnt count the eyes
               in his head  beat his bimbo girlfriend to
               death then mutilated her  ever box

                         deputy warden
               a little  back when

                         wayne
               yeah  i was nowhere near as good as sonny
               buti could hit  i had some power  some
               moves  i was a dancer

     flashback  int gym  day

     a sudden disconnected image of wayne beating a bag lathered
     up a real anger expressing itself

     back to wayne  present

                         wayne cont
               anyway there i was just another punk kid from
               the streets of new york got a free ride to
               columbia got out of school kissed some ass
               over at cbs and my first pony out the gate i
               get to interview sonny maricopa  that was
               something

     during this waynes expression tightens as he hears the
     approaching slam of doors and the clanking of chains and now the
     sound of his footsteps


                         wayne
               ohhhkkkaaaayshowtime

     the gate slides open  mickey knox is led in by two deputies
     wearing a blue jumpsuit with a thick and wide leather belt around
     the waist and metal rings built into each side  long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and
     through the rings binding his arms to his sides  his hands and
     feet are doublecuffed

     the deputies have their guns drawn ready to blow mickey in half
     at the slightest provocation  yet for a man wrapped and bound in
     chains mickey seems strangely in control of his environment

     he is seated roughly on the prisoners side of the glass

     wayne starts to smile but something weird happens  the smile
     gets stuck on his face  he cant stop smiling his allamerican
     youmustloveme smile  it just hangs there embarrassing and
     noticeable to everyone in the room

     mickey waits  whats wrong with this guy

     finally wayne gets control of his nerves

                         wayne
               hi mickey weve never been introduced but imim
               wayne gale starts to laugh again oh jeesus oh god

                         mickey shrugs

                    of approval
               i feel its apparent to anyone whos hip to
               whats going on that the prison board has
               thrown the constitution straight out the
               fuckin window  you and mallory may be killers
               but nuts insane not  youre being
               railroadedinto a hospital for the sole purpose
               of turning you into a vegetable  now some
               people are saying so what  i amnotone of
               those people  if we avert our eyes while they
               do this to you we give them permission to do
               it again whenever they see fit  today they
               wipe clean your mind because they feel your
               actions are dangerous tomorrow they wipe clean
               my mind  or dump me in syndication  because
               they feel what i say is dangerous  where does
               it all end  thats my angle

     flashback

     int mallorys parents living room  night

     the set is sitcom tv format  the lighting is flat the
     performances and timing are tv  it is shot in three camera
     sitcom format  possibly black and white harkening back to an
     earlier era in mickeys mind  the time when he first saw tv

                         mickey vo

               can remember no longer i write you letters and
               send them telepathically to your heart

     mallory gets a big handful of audience applause as she comes down
     the stairs dressed to the nines punky sexy ready to trot 
     yet a sweet girls expression maybe with braces

     ext farmland  day

     a black cloud rolls in  the wind is blowing  a storm is brewing

     mickey is part of a jail workcrew breaking mustangs  guarded by
     armed men on horseback with shotguns

     suddenly a large funnel cloud touches down a tornado zigzags
     crazily up the roadmore and more immense the end of the world

     the workboss is yelling for the men to get back to the bus

     everyone is running for the road

     the tornado is moving in fast

     but mickey lost in all the blowing and confusion has taken off
     down the road heading straight at the tornado

     mickey is running his ass off straight into the twisting
     devilobviously a process shot is looming here

     the horseman is gaining on mickey fires again  but the horse is
     spooked by the storm and throws the guard

     as the man hits the ground he discharges the shotgun right into
     himself  blowing his chest out

     mickey is last seen as a tiny man disappearing into the tornado 
     arms extended as if he were embracing death itself

                         simon  norman
               yes

                         wayne
               how can you say you admire them

                         norman
               its like this wayne  two people are standing
               in a dark room waiting for the other to attack
               these two people cant see each other yet they
               know theyre there  now they can either stand
               in that dark room forever waiting until they
               die of boredom or one of them can make the
               first move

                         wayne
               why cant they just shake hands and be friends

                         norman
               they cant because neither knows if the other
               is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs
               so you may as well make the first move

                         wayne
               obviously they made the first move

                         norman
               unfortunately yes

                         simon
               but you see thats okay wayne

                         wayne
               why

                         wayne
               how so

                         simon
               by taking away our legs  now we have to fight
               harder to get ahead than anyone else in the
               gym  probably the whole city  they gave us
               the fighting spirit  before this happened i
               was content  now im pissed off  now im half
               a man and ive got to work like the devil to
               get whole again

                         wayne
               but youll never be whole again

                         simon
               never is a very long time wayne  a word only
               the weak use  im not a sore loser  even if i
               dont have a leg to stand on im going to get
               up and fight this world until im on top again

                         norman
               thats the mickey and mallory way

                         simon
               and thats the way of the world

                         norman
               theyre just shocking the world into
               remembering the primal law

                         simon
               survival of the fittest

                         wayne
               one last question boys  usually mickey and
               mallory kill all their victims except for the
               lucky one  how come they let you two survive

     the brothers pause turn to wayne

                         norman
               they had us hogtied down during one of their
               houseraids and they were taking chainsaws to
               our legs before they were gonna kill us

     flashback  int hun brothers house  night

     mickey and mlllory are carving the brothers up with chainsaws 
     hidden in shadows  a demonic humor to the scene

     back to simon  the sound of the chainsaw echoes over

                         simon
               just for fun i guess

                         norman
               and then mallory stops mickey and says hey
               these are the brothers

                         simon
               mickey stops sawin on my leg and says oh my
               god im your biggest fan

     flashback  mickys look of genuine admiration as he stops
     the sawing

                         norman
               apparently theyve seen all our films

                         simon
               they were especially influenced by conquering
               huns of neptune

                         norman
               so mallory calls 911 and they took off

                         simon
               they actually apologized

               lasted five days  but i breathed a sigh of
               relief when mickey showed up and he was very

               court into a mockery and personally made him look like a

               as far as mickey being an excellent lawyer maybe im old
               fashioned but when i went to law school we were taught
               the object was to win the case which i did

               fighter in the history of martial arts

                         wayne
               the teachings of the bible seem inconsistent
               with your actions  christian values

                         mickey
               i dont know why  the bibles full of killings

                         wayne

               lotta people deserve to die
                    a look at mcclusky who is impervious

                         wayne
               why do they deserve to die

                         mickey
               everybody got somethin in their past some
               guilt some sin some awful secret thingi
               think people who deserve to die are those
               people who are not living in the first place

               right now who are aiready dead and need to be
               put outta their misery

                         wayne
               sort of everyone meets their serial killer
               half way  is that what youre saying the
               theory that the jews wanted to be victims
               walking into the gas chambers at auschwitz
               that even genocide at some levels agreed
               upon

               youre saying the world itself is predatory
               when a mountain lion takes down an elk its
               because its the elks time to go and all the
               bs liberal agenda about saving the animal
               herds only overpopulates the balance of nature
               maybe youre right mickey knox maybe youre
               right  corporate
               predators  enviromental predators  nuclear
               predators life is a hunt  ive seen it

     mcclusky signalling to kavanaugh and wurlitzer to step back

     julie signalling fiercely for quiet

     on the floor

                         mallory
               lets go  tongue in two faces

     int main tier  day

     camera flies down convicts running  they hang a guard off the
     railing by his neck  he dangles there

     int barber shop  day

     convicts are cutting the throats of the snitches in the barber
     chairs  smoke is pouring out everywhere

     int main tier  day

     teargas is fired at the convicts as the guards rush the 5story
     main tier retaking it

     a convict fires a teargas grenade right into the head of another
     convict

     out of this morass of smoke and gas mickey and mallory lead
     their caravan blasting both guards and convicts who try to
     attack them

     camera moves with them through smoke flame gas dying bodies 
     as if it were a process shot behind them  there is no stopping
     mickey and mallory

     technician 3 and technician 2 go down dead wounded dropping
     out of the caravan

     julie is wounded but cant yell out its sad

     rogers video captures it all  the footage we see through his
     camera is very similar to vietnam footage  its shaky real
     harsh and it captures the pandemonium of battle

     the soundtrack is a mad mixture of yelling crying laughing and
     gunfire

     more deputies appear tracking them

     the wild caravan runs in the other direction firing behind them
     technician 1 goes down and mickeys hit in the leg but keeps on
     running and firing mallory sees this and screams

     with his bloody hand

                         wayne

     mallory leans up against the wall holding her side with her hand
     blood trickles out between her fingers we now see shes been
     shot

     over duncans impassioned clamor they hear mcclusky yelling
     up the stairwell

     mickey squats in front of wayne who finishes his call

               the only way were gonna get all the way to

     while wayne speaks mickey props his shotgun under waynes chin
     and wraps the gaffer tape around the barrel of the shotgun  then
     he wraps it around waynes neck

                         wayne going with it
               what would i do  me and my network would sue

     mickey tosses the tape roll to owen and mallory and gestures to
     duncan

                         wayne contd
               i would make it my lifes ambition to bring

               that exists here just take me with you

     mickey stands with wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock
     of the shotgun

                         mickey
               calm down wayne thats what i thought and
               how many people watch american maniacs

               respected journalist  you wanted reality
               you got it

     he pushes wayne down the stairwell

     int prison stairwell ground floor  day

     mcclusky waits with his deputies

     empty frame on stairwell

                         voice of wayne
               my name is wayne gale  i am the star of
               american maniacs

     wayne comes into view camera in his hands  filming himself
     mickeys right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun thats wrapped firmly to waynes neck

                         wayne contd

               am a respected journalist winner of the edward
               r murrow award among others

     mcclusky freezes not knowing what to do except throttle mickey
     with his bare hands which he would do if wurlitzer were not
     holding him back

     his deputies pause hesitating as they realize if they take out
     either mickey or mallory that wayne or duncan would die

     note  the scenes intercut between video footage and color 35 mm

                         wayne contdyou are on camerawe are livethe camera
               barely turning  if anybody puts me in danger

               himself  my estate will sue every officer
               personally who fires  the networks law firm
               is sinclair marshall and milchan

     owen whips his gun left and right in clownlike loops like harpo
     marx smiling duncan homolka simply cries and begs for his life
     to be spared

                         duncan homolka indecipherable
               pppleeezzeee dddooonntt killl meeee

     but mickey knows what hes doing  this has an effect on the
     deputies

                         mallory yelling
               make a path

     the wall of deputies starts moving backwards

     int final corridor  reception area  day

     it has become a dance  the caravan on one side taped to the mast
     of their ship moving as if under one tent  mickey duncan
     mallory wayne owen and their guns and eyes

     across from them a phalanx of guns and lawmen  moving in
     syncopated unison a parallel track out the stairwell into the
     final corridor approaching the reception area to the prison
     freedom

     wayne keeps yelling duncan blubbering the deputies keep their
     guns trained but they give ground  parting like the red sea

     mickeys eyes see ut

     so do mallorys  they share a look

     outside  birds  trees  no bars  camera moving on it  coming
     to mcclusky who stands his ground at the door

                         mcclusky
               how far do you think youre gonna get

                         mickey
               right out the front door

                         mcclusky
               thatll never happen

                         mickey
               itishappening

     the caravan marches forth  wayne and duncan keep shouting their
     mantras  nobody dare to move on them

     wayne stops his speech to take a breath

                         mallory
               dont stop

     wayne starts up again

     the deputies are completely frustrated  mickey and mcclusky are
     nose to nose

                         mcclusky to mickey
               i will personally hunt you down blow the head
               off your fuckingwhorewife and plant your
               sick ass in the ground all by myself

                         mickey cool
               another day perhaps but not today warden

     mickey leaves frame

     mcclusky looks like hes going to pop his cerebral cortex  he
     begins a heart attack

     mickey and all exit the building

     the warden bucking with pain looks up the corridor where mickey
     and mallory have just come from  what he sees is his worst
     nightmare

     coming right at him are a hundred angry prisoners shotguns
     sticks numbchuks razors broken chairs waving climbing over
     the corpses of their fallen comrades withstanding the hail of
     fire from the guards  reaching for dwight mcclusky who is
     lifted over their heads having his heart attack moved from hand
     to hand like at a rock concert then all we see are the tops of
     his shoes as he is held upside down and torn to pieces

                                                            cut to

     ext woods  day

     a fogged moment of light strikes film and settles into an ecu of
     wayne  gasping a little too dramatically from his wounds

     mallorys pointing the camera at him shes laughing at what he
     says

     the scene that follows intercuts a normal format with cinema
     verite style shot through the video camera sometimes the lip
     sync is off

                         wayne
               this is wayne gale  unfortunately no longer
               live  im wounded and all my crew is dead

                         mallory
               look up look at me  that is so good

                         wayne
               mickey knoxs plan worked  we walked out the
               front door into a news van and made our get
               away  when we were followed by patrol cars
               mallory knox killed deputy sheriff duncan
               homolka and tossed his body out the back

     the wind is blowing through the pine trees above  insects buzz
     a vee of wild geese fly overhead honking heading north for the
     summer

                         wayne
               mickey told authorities over my police band
               that i would surely be next if they didnt give
               up the pursuit why helicopters werent
               employed i dont know  my only thought is
               that it all happened too fast for arrangements
               to be made  weve just pulled off to the side

     like mallorys taped paces in and out of frame in the bg

               out of the stairwell i remember thinkin  oh

                         mallory
               i wondered how long it would be before wed get
               to be alone together  and i wondered if i
               could wait that long

                         wayne os
               did you have anything to do with the riot

               probably the most famous couple in america

                         mallory
               well back in slave times they had a thing
               called the underground railroad  and we got a
               whole fan club out there just waitin to be

     mickey approaches wayne camera goes a little haywire as wayne
     lowers it

                         wayne
               okay just let me swing around and film myself
               asking the questions  and then ill do my
               little wrap up and were off

     mickey takes the camera from wayne and while he speaks he
     balances it on a fence post

                         mickey
               oh were gonna do a little wrap up all right
               wayne  but it wont be you starin in the camera

               gonna be starin down the barrels of our shotguns
               and were gonna be pullin the triggers

     wayne forces a chuckle  mickey steps away from the camera and
     into a threeshot  actually a four shot with owen there at first
     but again he slides out  the news van is parked in the eg

                         wayne

     mickey pumps the slide on his shotgun mallory grabs her shot gun
     from off the ground

                         wayne
