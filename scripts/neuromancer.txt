tension about him even at rest linda lee the young woman curled up beside him 
has a soft natural beauty thats enhanced by the innocence of sleep

there is a subtle click from across the open living room

suddenly theres a deafening explosion as the front door is blown off its 
hinges a black hexagon the size of a baseball is lobbed into the room

ignites with a flash of whitehot magnesium fire it emits a continuous blinding 
flare that permeates the room

his gun

the wall

angle on the door

shaven head and angular features give him a skull like appearance as he gazes 
through the bluewhite glare with obsidian goggles he regards the semi
conscious case for a moment then nods to his men

two policemen sweep glassware of an oversized coffee table slam case down on 
top of it and slap plastic restraints on his wrists and ankles

the other policemen begin a destructive search of the townhouse

the pale man looms over case like the angel of death a dark form framed against 
flickering shafts of incendiary light his voice is an icy whisper

pale man

case speaks through bloody lips

case

pale man
chuckles
oh were not arresting you the law books havent quite caught up with your 
technology breaking 
into the computer matrix by cerebral projection thats a little tough to 
prosecute dont you think

on the other side of the room a policeman smashes open a false front bookshelf 
revealing an impressive array of customised gear a tiaralike headset rests on 
a bust of socrates

sensenet policeman
lieutenant

pale man

the police begin to destroy the gear with the enthusiasm of prohibitionists at a 
moonshine still

business bad for everybody

the pale man withdraws a glittering hypodermic from a silver case

high angle

camera booms down onto the spread eagled case surrounded by his enemies he 
screams as the mycotoxin hits his nervous system like a runaway freight train

chilling inner void

ext julius deane importexport

a dingy commercial building wedged between a strip joint and a digital tape 
store case takes the rickety stairway up three steps at a time he bursts 
through a door under the worn sign julius deane importexport

a dark rosewood office crowded with expensive european furniture and stacks of 
white fibreglass shipping modules several cats lounge about in the shadows

deane an obese but extremely well groomed man sits quietly at his desk just 
outside the small circle of light thrown by a brass lamp one of his cats is 
perched casually on his shoulder a thick cuban cigar smoulders between his 
stubby fingers

case storms into the room sending hissing cats scrambling out of the way

case

youve got me fencing yakuza goods on yakuza turf

cu  deanes hand

a large white ash tumbles from deanes cigars his hand remains motionless

with case as he rushes to the desk and flips the lamp shade up onto

deanes face

illuminated for the first time the cat perched on his shoulder is lapping at a 
crimson knife wound bisecting his windpipe

case

steps back horrified

the desk

deanes right hand is frozen on the blood splattered keyboard of his compact 
computer terminal the small screen is scrolling off a single cryptic word 
repeated ad infinitum

wintermute

case

hastily flips the light off and crosses to the window

cases pov

two stocky japanese men stand just beyond the orange glow of a quartz halogen 
street light gazing back up at case yakuza they start across the street 
heading for the building

case

releases the curtain and runs a hand through his tousled hair

case

he looks back at julius deane

case cont

case rummages through deanes coat rack until he finds an old fashioned 38 in 
an ancient cracked leather shoulder holster he flips the barrel open theres 
only one round in the chamber itll have to do

case jams the gun in his belt and pushes a button on deanes desk a section of 
panelled wall pops open revealing a hidden exit he takes a last look at his 
former partner

case
so long julie dont forget to feed the cats

ninsei streets

case rushes through the saturday night street crowd past yakitori stands and 
massage parlours

a japanese elvis impersonator sends his eerie rendition of heartbreak hotel 
echoing down the ninsei case checks his back

the two yakuza heavies are searching the crowd half a block away a third 
gangster the size of a boxcar joins them

case backs into the doorway of a surgery parlour as he checks the other 
direction

a dangerous looking woman in black wearing mirror shades is heading towards 
case she reaches inside her black leather jacket and loosens her shoulder 
holster as she scans the crowd

case ducks just past a group of russian sailors and cuts across the street 
just past a messenger on a motorised tricycle

the yakuza spot him and push their way through the crowd

case ducks into the garishly decorated doorway of an arcade

int arcade

a deafening cacophony of arcade sounds echoes throughout the darkened room as 
lifelike holograms do battle under the guidance of customers at gaming consoles  
as case enters a holographic fireball from tank war europa briefly illuminates 
the room

the three yakuzas burst through the doors and begin to search the room

case grabs an armed guard by the shoulder

case
theres going to be trouble get your security over here

the guard is suddenly jerked out of cases grasp from the impact of an azide 
slug imploding his chest

case ducks back as three more shots shatter the side of a console the gunfire 
is lost in the noise of the arcade

yakuza 1 his gun smoking cautiously circles the aisle

case crouches in the darkness from just behind the game console he can see a 
pair of feetslowly approaching he cocks his gun timing the approach 
carefullythen springs

the aisle

a kid in oversized biker boots drops his popcorn as case leaps out

case 

pulls his shot at the last second firing into the air

yakuza 1

pops up out of the darkness behind him gun blazing

the kid

beside case is blown off his feet shattering a holo projector

case

cuts through the maze of games ducking lead he loses the hit man at the back 
of the arcade then checks the 38empty

a red dot appears on cases chest he looks up

the big yakuza
looking like a sumo wrestler stuffed into an illfitting suit the lasersite on 
his modified uzi casts the quavering dot on cases chest

the big yak smiles his gold earring bearing the symbol of the yakuza twinkles 
eerily in the darkness

the kisses his thumb and makes the ritual gesture of death to case

low angle  slo mo

as another holographic blast erupts from tank war europa the woman in black 
leaps through the ghostly atomic fire launching herself straight at the big 
yakuza

she executes an amazing flying kick snapping her body around to connect with 
the yakuzas jaw he goes down like a felled sequoia

yakuza 3 appears fining at the woman in black case tackles him they struggle 
for control of his gun the crowd finally reacts to the real violence in the 
midst of their illusionary battles

the big yakuza begins to rise spitting out teeth and pissed off

case spots him swings 3s gun hand around and squeezes the trigger

the big yakuza takes a hit in the heart and crumbles

still gripping 3s hand case savagely elbows him in the face once twice 
three times he goes down

suddenly machine pistol fire strafes the console behind case the monitor 
explodes with a hail of glass shards

 something to do with firing his machine pistol

case runs for all hes worth heading for a window across the room he barrel 
rolls straight through glass and neon as a fusillade of bullets explode around 
him

ext street

case hits the cement and rolls knocking over a couple of leather clad hookers 
in the process he disappears into the crowd as the hookers scream expletives at 
him

int chatsubo bar

the doors blow open as jo jo bao the twentyfive year old yakuza lieutenant of 
chiba city enters escorted by four heavily armed bodyguards the cold 
expressionless mask of baos face suggests the brutality required to climb so 
far in the yakuza ranks at such an early age his startling aqua blue eyes are 
an obvious affectation from the black clinic tanks

as the entourage cuts its way across the crowded floor a ripple of tension 
spreads throughout the room

ratz casts a wary glance to his sideman fritz

fritz gently lifts a wire bore scattergun from its resting place out of sight 
under the bar

ratz shakes his head no and motions for fritz to stand by

jo jo sits down before ratz flanked by his men

ratz
arigatou baosan rare to see you out this time of night

baos english is excellent

jo jo bao
im afraid i could not sleep worry makes me restless

ratz
is that so

jo jo bao
yes im worried for your friend the man they call case

ratz looks from one bodyguards icy stare to the other

ratz
not my friend my customer

jo jo bao
of course forgive me

bao extends his pinky finger which is encased in a decorative gold sleeve with 
a twist he disengages the sleeve revealing that his finger has been amputated 
at the knuckle bao casually taps a line of yellow powder out of his fingervial 
onto the bar

jo jo bao cont
your customercase is a difficult man to find when he wants to be

bao applies a match to the powder which ignites like a fuse he then expertly 
inhales the resulting curl of dirty yellow smoke then offers ratz a pull

ratz
ahno thanks i can try to get in touch with him for you cant promise 
anything you understand

jo jo bao
i would greatly appreciate this you see there is a small matter that must be 
settled between case and i

one of baos bodyguards suddenly lashes out with a wickedly curved dagger 
burying it in the counter top

cu the dagger

the gleaming blade had pinned a human ear to the worn wood by the elaborate 
gold earring we recognise that this once belonged to the big yakuza in the 
arcade

ext cheap hotel  night

camera suddenly booms up to the rooftop of a shabby ten story office building 
up here in some of the last available space in the crowded city a cheap hotel 
has been erected out of prefab fibreglass coffins racked in a framework of 
industrial scaffolding and catwalks a weakly flickering neon sign offers the 
words cheap hotel under a cluster of japanese ideograms

int cheap hotel

linda lee has just finished packing a small suitcase in the cramped quarters of 
the white fibreglass module the rooms moulded to maximise the efficiency of the 
living space concave area for microwave and cooler convex area for a 
temperfoam bed slab for computer terminal and telephone

linda peels off a photograph taped to the wall of her and case in better days 
mugging for the camera during a break in a game of jai alai she decides to 
leave it for him

the telephone rings as linda picks it up the computer screen is illuminated 
with a cu of ratz

linda lee
hello

intercut chatsubo bar

ratz speaks into a grimy mobile phone before a wall mounted lens in the bg we 
see his small audience of yakuza heavies

ratz
is case there

linda
no whos this

ratz
a friend i have a very important message are you listening

linda
yes but i

ratz
jo jo bao says case should bring the goods the yakitori stand at the arena in 
one hour  jo jo gets the goods or case gets orchids hell understand

there is a click as the phone disconnects the screen goes blank

linda lee looks back at the photograph of the man she used to love she snaps 
her suitcase shut and starts for the door but she stops short and finally 
makes a decision

linda crosses to the cooler and rummages about inside she discovers a 9mm 
automatic hidden by a row of beer bottles searching further she finds a 
plastic container behind the ice cube trays inside packed in dry ice is a 
glass tube filled with an amber fluid ketamine

linda stops and considers the gravity of what she is about to do she closes the 
container and stuffs it into her canvas shoulder bag

ext bullet train platform  night

the sleek train is a blur of motion as it clears frame revealing case 
exhausted and dishevelled from his run in with the yakuza he checks his 
surroundings warily then exits the platform as he approaches the dingy 
stairway his attention is drawn to a holographic travel advert floating 
overhead

closer   hologram

it displays a beautiful cylindrical satellite hanging in space like a twinkling 
childs toy the word freeside pulses beneath the image in capital letters that 
mimic printed japanese followed by the copy line why wait


a crack of lightning briefly illuminates a night sky choked with storm clouds a 
light rain begins to fall case moves on

ext cheap hotel

case turns his collar up against the rain as he checks his lock for signs of a 
breakin he slots a key card and the portal pops open

int cheap hotel

slipping through the small entry case shrugs off his wet jacket and reaches for 
the lights

offscreen voice
hold it

case turns to find himself looking down the four barrelled muzzle of a fletcher 
a lethal looking hand gun that shoots dart cartridges ranging from 
tranquillisers to microexplosives

the woman in black sits at the far end of the coffin training the fletcher on 
case with a rock steady hand the guns pepper box muzzle rotates once clicking 
a barrel in place

woman
no lights i can see just fine the way i am thanks

cu the woman

her mirror shades are actually surgically inset silver lenses that cover her eye 
sockets her fine features and smooth pale skin are framed by a rough shag of 
jet black hair theres a cold beauty about her marred by a street tough 
edge

woman
now close the door

womans pov

her lenses provide light boosters enhancing the scene in a pale green hue as 
case closes the portal

case

woman

without yak heat

another angle

the rooms only light source is the dim glow of the computer monitor



unfortunately the next page is missing from the bootleg i can establish 
though that case learns that armitage has a job for him and that the woman in 
black is in fact molly the best pointer for the scenes may in fact be the 
novel



molly

dead man walking nice time for an employment opportunity travel to exotic 
locales

top of it he scans the note adrenalin surges through his body

molly

case

case reaches for the door

the fletcher is instantly in mollys hand and firing

three blue steel darts puncture the fibreglass portal and stand 
quivering inches from cases hand

case turns and glares at molly she considers the situation

molly cont

remember something

molly snaps her hand open palms up with a barely audible click ten double 
edged scalpel blades slide from their housings beneath her black lacquered 
nails surgical implants

molly

ext arena

an inflated dome behind a portside warehouse taut grey fabric reinforced with a 
net of thin steel cables the roar of the crowd briefly rises above the night 
sounds of chiba city

int arena

linda lee makes her way across a crowded transom as the predominantly japanese 
crowd exchange fistfuls of new yen placing their bets she pauses to ask an old 
woman directions

behind her the towering puppets of holographic light duplicate the movements of 
the contestants in the ring two men in the midst of a savage knife fight their 
combat style combines street fighting fencing and kickboxing

int arena hall

arenas support cables as jo jo bao and his four leg breakers make their way

hands of the beggars and the sing song cries of the merchants

drifting cigarette smoke and light

the crowd chants for the kill bloodmadness in their eyes

int yakatori stand

ecu coffee cup

black coffee poured into a china cup

int hotel room  day

case sits in an oversized chair framed against a large picture window in a 
luxurious suite outside a slate grey sky hangs over the jumble of chiba city a 
light rain patters against the glass

case looks wasted washed out his arm is supported by a weblike nylon sling 
he sips his coffee in silence

molly pours a cup for her employer

armitage is a powerfully built man in his early forties his dark robe frames a 
broad muscular chest and a flat stomach his white blonde hair is close cropped 
in an almost military style

armitage
are you sure youre up to this mr case we could reconvene tomorrow

case
youve got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason id like to hear what it 
is

armitage

armitage slots a laser disc the size of a quarter into a remote control the 
picture window behind case is instantly transformed into a wall sized screen 
displaying news footage of chaos in the london stock market

armitage cont
what youre seeing here is the london stock market crash of last september this 
was the first in a series of setbacks for the international banking community

molly pours herself some coffee and sits down near case her fletcher hangs 
loosely on her side in a black nylon shoulder holster

armitage switches the scene to a space shuttle manufacturing plant

armitage cont
the collapse of aerospace international

he switches to a corporate conference room where a hearing is in progress

armitage cont
the corporate plundering of yeshoto industries at first these seemed like 
unrelated incidents but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise

case
what does this have to do with me

armitage
turns off screen
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from 
within the international computer matrix cyberspace mr case a realm i 
believe youre familiar with

case
shrugs

armitage

armitage sits down across from case

armitage cont

system is safe im assembling a team of specialists mr case we need a man 
who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur

case
my days of punching deck are over for you or anybody else

armitage

scalpel is now the glistening hypodermic descending contact

the screen explodes in whiteout

cu case

his face tenses but in passion not pain slowly turning to reveal linda 
lee holding him tightly lost in their lovemaking

ecu the laser scalpel

burning a straight line across a horizon of flesh

case

his face tenses again slowly turning to reveal linda lee in his arms but now 
her eyes are as cold and blank as a lifeless doll her throat darkly 
glistening crimson

ecu the laser scalpel

its beam flares into camera as it slices

cu case

screams

the camera booms up to reveal him tied to the coffee table surrounded by his 
enemies

screams

clutching her lifeless body in his arms as he sinks to his knees in defeat

cu case

his eyes flash open as he gasps a breath awake

wider  darkened room

case lies in rumpled sheets his face bathed in sweat he can hardly move

molly looks down at him a shadow against a moonlit window her hair 
glistening as blue black as a ravens wing

molly
softly
easy youre still full of endorphins

case coughs molly supports his head and helps him sip some water

molly cont
youve been calling her name

case
what

molly
your girl linda lee youve been calling her name

she wrings out a wet cloth applies it to his forehead

molly cont
she must have really loved you

case gazes into the darkness his voice is a weak whisper

case
it got her killed

molly straightens up his covers

molly
sure case love kills and were all the walking wounded

she gently lays a hand over cases eyes

molly cont
now close your eyes youre asleep and you dont even know it

when molly takes her hand away indeed his eyes remain shut

cu molly  morning

she hits a padded bar hard flips up out of frame

wider

molly is in the midst of a workout on a customised rig thats part sinsemi 
karate pads part uneven parallel bars she flies through her routine with 
animal grace and the focused discipline of a professional athlete

the rig stands in the middle of a sparsely furnished high ceilinged loft shafts 
of soft morning light are filtered through a row of dusty windows

case sits up in the foreground

hes lying on a futon in the middle of the worn wooden floor he rises pulling a 
sheet around his naked shoulders but hes stopped cold as a splitting 
headache hits home

case
gasps
holy shit

molly
flips down off rig
hey youre not supposed to be up

molly guides case to a stool at the kitchen counter he looks around the room 
redrimmed eyes adjusting to the light

case
how long have i been out

molly
almost two days

case gazes down at the narrow bandages across his main arteries

case
i gotta know did it work

molly
well find out soon enough if you dont pull the splices out

case snaps the cap off a bottle of bourbon and pours a drink

case
how soon is soon enough

molly
couple of days theyll examine you

case slugs down the bourbon

molly cont
thats not going to help

case
the way i feel believe me itll help

molly
not anymore you got a new pancreas armitages got you kinked so you cant get 
stoned

case
what the fuck are you serious

molly
pours him another
go ahead

case tosses it down no kick at all

case
thats cute very fucking cute what else did this guy do to me when he had me 
opened up like a goddamn fillet

extending one scalpelblade molly picks at a cluster of grapes

molly
halfsmile
oh i dunno he was saying maybe that youre a little too ballsy

molly flicks her blade severing two grapes from the bunch nasty image

case
no

case checks beneath his sheet

armitage now enters carrying two large cardboard boxes bearing japanese logo

armitage
ill think youll find everything in working order mollys just having a little 
fun

case
i dont call this fun pal youre playing god with my body

armitage
youre a substance abuser case your pancreas was shot wouldnt have lasted 
out the year we did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency 
in the bargain

case
thanks but i was enjoying that dependency

armitage
good because youve got a new one

armitage sets the boxes down in a corner with several others

armitage cont
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries theyre 
dissolving case slowly but theyre definitely dissolving you have just 
long enough to do the job

case
you son of a bitch

case lurches up from the counter sending the bourbon smashing to the floor 
molly restrains him

molly
easy

armitage
play it straight with me and youve got nothing to worry about when its over 
i inject you with the antitoxin

case
whyd you do it armitage

armitage
the disturbance in cyberspace its an ai

case
bitter chuckle
right and no one would take on an ai if they had a choice

molly
whats an ai

armitage
an artificial intelligence a computer system thats developed the capacity for 
sentient thought theyre dangerous and totally unpredictable

case
first sign of free will sensenet usually slags em

armitage
this ones different no one can trace it its out there somewhere in the 
matrix and its growing stronger infecting other computer systems like a 
virus

case
anything rated higher than a pcs got a hardwired suicide switch itll self
destruct

armitage
it hasnt yet

case lights a cigarette

case
ive heard about rogue ais but theres only one guy who actually went up 
against one

armitage
dixie mccoy

case
right best cowboy that ever punched deck the old man taught me most of what i 
know

armitage
ive arranged for him to work with us

case
thats gonna be tough because dixie mccoys dead the ai flatlined him

armitage
i know
beat
you ever work with ghosts case

case
what are you talking about

armitage
sensenet taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before 
his death everything dixie was  everything dixie still knows exists as a 
digitised construct
beat
of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sensenets

armitage tosses a matte black cartridge on the kitchen counter its the size and 
shape of the clip on an assault rifle warning decals and security codes frame 
the label on the front of the cartridge

charles dixie mccoy

case gingerly picks it up

case
working with a dead man shit ive done about everything else

armitage
youll be ready for a trial run in two days if your splices hold youll use 
mccoy to trace the ais coordinates

case
and then

armitage
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team for now thats all you 
need to know

case
its just that sometimes i wonder what team im playin on

armitage turns to molly

armitage
we have work to do

molly and armitage exit

pull focus from case to armitages empty glass in the foreground case holds it 
up to the light

cu the glass

subtle fingerprints are visible

ext loft  night

a full moon shines down on the weathered brick building in this core section of 
old atlanta

int loft

case lies sleeplessly staring at the mysterious grouping of boxes that armitage 
has left lying on the moonlit floor he rises

as case unstacks the boxes he discovers a glossy pamphlet advertising the luxury 
satellite freeside with the familiar copyline freeside why wait

beneath it is an 8x10 fashionably dressed cabaret artist it bears the heading 
the holographic cabaret of peter riviera ghostly images of skulls and jewels 
dance about riviera

case sets the papers aside and runs his hand over the smooth surface of a box 
bearing cryptic instructions in japanese he tears it open and brushes back the 
clear plastic packing bubbles

he gently lifts a beautiful onosendai cyberspace 7 computer deck out of the box 
and sets it in a square of dusty moonlight thrown across the worn wooden floor 
its a more compact version of the jerryrigged deck in cases old townhouse he 
runs his hands over the smooth lines of the two tiered keyboard the sleek 
joystick

molly os
you touch that thing like its a woman

case looks up to see molly silhouetted in her bedroom doorway wearing only a 
cotton body stocking her fletcher hangs from her shoulder in its open harness

case
im going in

molly
youre not ready yet they said two days

case
im not jacking with armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck

molly
if the splices arent good you could fry

case considers this for a moment

case
ill show you how to tell whats going on if things go south you unplug me

molly
what is it with you why is it so important its a buzz right like getting 
high

case
on a good run yeah

molly
so youre a wire junkie

case sets the computer deck aside

case
when i was fifteen sensenet iced my old mans credit record over some computer 
error once that goes down thats it he lost his business everything it 
destroyed him i had to hustle arcade games for chump change dixie mccoy found 
me figured i was a natural he taught me the wires for a piece of the action

molly
a regular fagan

case
sure i finally pulled a run on my old mans credit file when i was seventeen 
only it was too late for him

molly
too late

case
suicide i just needed to set the record straight

case is silent for a moment then turns and begins to tear open another box

case cont
ive been running the matrix ever since

molly finally sits down beside him the starts to help case unpack the 
equipment

int loft  cu cyberspace equipment

an impressive display of high tech computer gear is arranged in a semicircle on 
the floor around the futon

case sits in a lotus position in the midst of the gear as molly paces the room 
trails of micro thin wires run from the electrodes derms no his headband to 
the chrome plated jack he holds in his hand

case
the first funs bound to be rough it that read out fluctuates more than ten 
points just pull this out but if the eeg flatlines dont touch anything

molly
wont that mean youre dead

case
technically yeah but people have made it back after as long as three minutes

molly
dixie mccoy didnt

case
the point is if you unplug me when im flatlines im history i got no way 
back

molly
okay fine lets get this over with

case gives molly a reassuring smile

case
take it easy this is what im good at

cu the jack

case slides it home with a metallic snap

crackle to white out

cases pov  cyberspace

we are suddenly roaring through an impossible corridor of light with no top or 
bottom our speed constantly increasing luminescent geometric shapes tumble 
by like a shimmering power storm we have entered an unearthly dimension of 
sheer power and energy as cases subconscious mind is catapulted into cyberspace

the loft case

breaks into a sweat his eyes closed in deep concentration he remains in the 
louts position his hands lying on padded supports just above the keyboard his 
fingers flex weakly hes in poor contact with his physical self

cu case  cyberspace

his translucent image distorts radically as hes torn through the glowing 
corridor fighting for some control

the readouts begin to fluctuate

molly sees that cases body is beginning to tremble somethings going wrong

cases pov  cyberspace

still accelerating down the terrifying corridor of light the ride grows rougher 
with the increasing velocity hes losing control

cases fingers still move slightly still no contact

cu readouts

fluctuations increasing

a monolithic wall of pulsing yellow and black hazard stripes lies directly 
ahead a glowing computer graphic barricade its crowned by the imposing 
sensenet logo and the warning security clearance required

cyberspace  case

his image streaking vibrating hes in excruciating pain

cases pov  the wall

case is rushing towards a head on collision tendrils of energy crackle across 
the surface of the barricade like an electrified fence the words access 
prohibited strobe out in red towering letters

cases hands finally come to life his shaking fingers punch out a series of 
digits

sensenet barricade a split second before impact we rocket straight through the 
tiny portal

ext sensenet building  night

a foreboding mirrored fortress in downtown new atlanta bristling with antenna 
and satellite dishes it looks like a cross between a futuristic broadcasting 
station and a police headquarters which is exactly what it is

from somewhere inside a high pitched klaxon pulses out its shrill alarm

int sensenet monitoring room

the alarm continues as sensenet personnel scramble to their terminals overhead 
screen display cases infiltration into the matrix in simplified computer

a sensenet technician speaks into his headset

case shoots through the narrow wormhole in the barricade at hair raising speed

he finally bursts through into

the matrix

a transparent 3d chessboard opens up before us extending into infinity 
breathtakingly beautiful huge glowing geometric computer constructs float by 
each bearing the specific corporations they represent suspended in 
nothingness like synthetic planets in an overpopulated universe

note the computer constructs are three dimensional geometric representations of 
the inner workings of computer systems they exist in cyberspace in the form of 
pure light and energy complex symbols and data are constantly changing within 
their glowing ectoskeletons although separate and apart from the actual 
hardware in the physical universe computer activity can be observed and 
manipulated from within the matrix

int sensenet monitoring room

the blip representing case disappears from the monitor

operator
weve lost contact sir hes entered the matrix

the matrix cu subliminal case

note although cases physical body always remains at his deck his spiritual 
being manifests itself on his trips into the matrix a true out of body 
experience

case floats blissfully through the phosphorescent environment in the lotus 
position that matches that of his body in the physical plane his eyes are 
filled with wonder hes achieved his normal appearance in the matrix a 
translucent ghost of himself shimmering with mild iridescence his every 
moment creates subtle time lapse afterimages the catch up his prime image in a 
graceful dance

cases pov  the matrix

a burning scarlet pyramid bearing the title eastern seaboard fission authority 
floats by majestically its surface alive with a constant changing flow of 
data

the monolithic green cubes of mitsubishi bank of america hang above the horizon 
like a luminous cityscape twinkling with countless transactions

and in the distance are the everpresent gridlines that define the limitless 
perspectives of the matrix

we hear distant echoing laughter

the loft

case sits before his console bathed in sweat eyes closes laughing like a 
man whos beat the devil

molly

watches wondering what he can possibly be experiencing the readouts are 
modulating smoothly

int sensenet conference room

the sensenet technician sits surrounded by three larger than life holographic 
projections is taking place with the chairmans live images each disembodied 
head projected above a separate pedestal

a wallsized screen displays playback of cases infiltration of the matrix

bigelow the most imposing of the three chairmen question the nervous operator

bigelow
is this all youve got on him

technician
yes sir whoever he is hes good

a figure seated in shadows at the rear of the room now speaks

figure
if he was so good he wouldnt have crashed a security checkpoint i doubt hell 
make the same mistake again

bigelow
i thought we eradicated these wire jockeys these what do they call 
themselves duprey

the figure now swivels in his chair to face bigelows hologram he is the pale 
man the sensenet operative that injected case with the microtoxin his name is 
lt roland duprey

duprey
cowboys sir i retired the last one personally over a year ago

suvani yamir a mideastern chairman interjects

yamir
then how do you explain this

duprey
i dont know yet my people are doing everything that they can to trace it

the third chairman an aristocratic frenchman named lord frederick tessier 
addresses the gathering

tessier
do you realise what a security breach would mean right now if our mysterious 
guest discovers that an artificial intelligence is running loose in the matrix 
infiltrating other computer systems it could cause a worldwide panic

bigelow
find this cowboy duprey do whatever you have to to stop him

duprey
what about the ai

tessier
that is our problem lieutenant please concern yourself with the matter at 
hand

duprey rises

bigelow
one more thing duprey

duprey turns

bigelow
you fuck this up ill have your cerebral cortex degoused youll need a 
playback unit to remember how to pee am i making myself clear

duprey regards his superiors with thinly veiled disdain

duprey
dont worry gentlemen ill keep your fat out of the fire

cases ghostly image still floats in a lotus position dwarfed by the gigantic 
glowing constructs suspended in the distance

int loft  cu deck

as case presses a button the cartridge labelled dixie mccoy automatically 
descends into the deck

ext the matrix

a disembodied cat scan of a human head suddenly appears before case in a nimbus 
of gently modulating light the brain and circulatory systems are visible in 
fluorescent pinks and blues like a 3d xray its eyeballs are rolled back in 
its skull like two boiled eggs showing no pupils at all

beneath this eerie medical jackolantern is a two dimensional name plate in 
glowing green letters it reads charles dixie mccoy and bears a narrow voice 
print band with a digital time code read out

case
dixie dixie mccoy is that you man

as mccoy speaks a series of overlapping sign waves appear beneath him in his 
voice print band fluctuating with the modulations of his voice

mccoy
hey bro

case
its case remember me

dixies eyes roll down revealing shocking pink irises with cobalt blue pupils 
he seems to be just waking up

mccoy
case yeah miami joeboy quick study how you doing kid

mccoy
sure kid its a firmware construct

case
okay dix you are a rom construct

dixies image is obscured by static as his face registers confusion

case cont
dixie

there is no reply

case
youre a rom construct understand

dixie is briefly visible then becomes totally obscured by electronic snow his 
voice is a distant echo

dixie

you were still peeing in your chinos

hey kid you expecting company

dixie disappears

there is an ominous rumbling in the matrix

case now notices an unusual glimmer off in the matrix

he begins to type looking like a mimist at an invisible keyboard

int loft  keyboard

case types

int sensenet monitoring room

as duprey walks purposefully up the aisle hes stopped by a concerned 
technician

technician
lieutenant we have some unusual activity in c sector

duprey
is that our bogey

technician
no its inorganic could be your phantom ai

duprey snaps his fingers

technician cont
sir

duprey
i do believe one of our problems is about to cancel out the other one

int matrix

the glowing sphere suddenly picks up speed veers directly at case the 
rumbling grows louder with its approach

int loft

case quickly taps out new coordinates

int matrix

his position shifts but the sphere responds instantly its nearly upon him 
crackling with deadly energy

int loft  deck



int matrix

case peels off and flies towards an air tram international construct the sphere 
bares down on him like a heat seeking missile

railway construct

case flashes into the si spoked construct just as the sphere crashes into it

int loft

the deck shorts out sparking and popping with the electrical overload cases 
body stiffens

molly tries to pull out the jack but receives a crackling jolt the second her 
hand comes down in contact with the chrome

int construct

case flies through narrow intersecting tunnels as the entire construct shatters 
around him in a deadly display of phosphorescent fireworks

int loft

molly lashes out with her steel claws severing cases wires hes ripped back 
into his body just in time to se the sparking hosaka monitor implode with a 
flash of light

the printer begins shooting out hard copies at high speed until the entire 
system suddenly shuts down

molly
you okay

case
yeah but the hosakas history

as case inspects the print outs hes stopped cold one word is repeated down 
each scorched page

wintermute

ext street corner  the sprawl  day

case buys a pack of cigarettes and a paper at a busy corner newsstand

the headlines read  systems crash at air tram international  railways shut 
down

a sensenet van slowly turns the corner invisible eyes watching from behind 
the tinted bulletproof glass

case eases back against a row of pay phones as the van passes he lights a 
cigarette

suddenly the pay phone beside him rings case stares at the phone as the rings 
continue then finally picks it up

a synthetic chip voice comes over the line reverberating with unearthly 
harmonics

voice
hello case

case is too stunned to speak then

case
who is this

voice
wintermute
beat
sorry i missed you last night

theres faint background sounds a wailing cosmic wind barely audible 
voices echoing off some orbital link

voice cont
ive been waiting for you case its time we talked

case hangs up he flicks the cigarette away unnerved then walks along the 
length of the bank of phones

each phone rings as he passes but only once

ext loft  day

case enters the building

int the loft

case enters to find armitage pacing the floor a wiry pony tailed man bare 
chested except for a black leather vest sits crouched over cases deck working 
on the wired circuitry he looks like a grateful dead roadie whos done one too 
many tours

armitage
you ran without us

case
i cannot tell a lie sorry

armitage
sorry bullshit we havent even begun and youre already jeopardising this 
operation

case
whats he doing to my gear

the man glances up from his work

man
your gear hah i spent weeks customising this stuff it looks like youve 
been playin with it in the bathtub man

armitage
this is finn our tech man

finn
pleased to meecha im sure

armitage refers to the printout in his hand

armitage
whats this

case
could be your ais calling card

armitage
did you trace it

case
no but it traced me

case tosses him the newspaper armitage scans the headline

case
fried air tram in the process not to mention half my gear

armitage
what about mccoy

case
hes got a little attitude problem being that hes dead and all but hell come 
around wheres molly

armitage
prepping your trip

case
really do i get to know where im going it makes packing so much easier

armitage
offworld the ai this wintermute thing evolved on a computer mainframe on 
the satellite freeside if you attack it from within the matrix while molly 
accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems

case
that could work but the timing will be a bitch

armitage
youll be linked during the entire operation

case
linked

finn
remote simstim molls wired for full sensorium access
to armitage
i thought this guy was a player

armitage
he is just been out of touch for awhile

finn
well youre going to get a kick out of this link switches here
flips it
boom youre wired straight into her senses sight sound touch taste the 
whole enchilada youll know just how tight those jeans really are
rises
now you wanna give this a try im supposed to be on my lunch break

case applies his derms casts a last suspicious look at finn then jacks in

the pov tilts down with mollys gaze as she slides a hand inside her open 
jacket

welcome aboard

she gently pinches her nipple through her silk tank top

int loft

molly makes her way down a narrow alley lined with dubious software rental 
complexes makeshift booths selling recycled computer gear the clientele are 
young few of them out of their teens adrenaline junkie rock blares from micro 
speakers songs clashing like a battle of the bands as molly walks down the 
lane

molly approaches a booth displaying hundreds of slivers of microsoft angular 
fragments of colored silicon mounted under transparent bubbles of white 
cardboard

behind the counter a boy with a shaven head is putting stock away with his back 
to camera a dozen spikes of microsoft protrude from a socket behind his ear

molly
larry that you

larry turns around and greets molly in rapid fire chinese

molly cont
impatient
youre slotting chinese larry

larry pauses for a beat then realises whats wrong he extracts a long green 
microsoft from the cluster behind his ear

larry
sorry client from hong kong you know

larry flicks open a flat plastic case and slots the microsoft beside 

molly
i need a suit something special

larry nods selects another microsoft

larry
patience

larry slots it behind his ear his eyes narrow as he scrutinises molly

larry cont
mollys got a rider larry doesnt like that

molly
didnt know you were so sensitive costs a lot to get that sensitive

larry taps his microsoft

larry
this says you got someone using your eyes

molly
my partner

larry
lose the rider then we talk

molly sighs and lowers her gaze

molly

larry pulls down the corrugated tin garage door sealing off the booth he leans 
back against a brick wall

larry
now pretty poison what exactly did you have in mind

molly
i heard you have mimic polycarbon

larry flips a switch on his collar and his entire jumpsuit suddenly strobes to 
life reflecting a brick pattern that makes him nearly invisible against the 
wall

larry

i need its matrix coordinates dixie ive got to nail that thing where it 
lives

dixie
never heard of him

nobody has

an ultraviolet square now appears bearing armitages fingerprints

case cont
i duped these prints off him can you run an id

dixie
no problem amigo

tell you what bro ill make you a deal i help you nail this ai you gotta 
do me one favour

int sensenet  dupreys office

duprey is at his desk fast forwarding through a series of files on his computer

hes interrupted by a beep tone the image of his secretary appears on a tiny 
phone screen

secretary
theres a call for you on line four sir he wont identify himself but he says 
its urgent

duprey punches up the line a digitally masked image appears a blurred mosaic 
grid of a human face

duprey
yes

the electronically altered voice sounds chillingly demonic

the word is youre scanning for a wire freak you want to catch a cowboy you 
need a posse

duprey
who is this

just a citizen looking for a pay day

intercut  microsoft booth

duprey through a customised phone unit

larry cont

somebodys setting up a run something heavy you interested

int loft  night

case is in the midst of running a check on his computer gear when he hears a 
soft rustling from across the room

still sitting in his lotus position case pretends to remain in the matrix as he 
checks out the room

we see the brief ripple of mimic polycarbon in the shadows a figure glides 
along one wall becoming invisible when it stops

case slowly reaches under his futon and eases out his gun

the ripple moves again approaching silently impressions of its feet are 
visible on the edge of a blanket strewn carelessly on the floor

suddenly case yanks the blanket out from under the intruders feet pins him to 
the floor and jams the gun in his midsection

but when the intruder speaks its mollys voice

molly
easy its me just trying out my new toy

case gets a mischievous look in his eyes

case
molly doesnt need a spook suit to get in here

molly
dont fuck with me i dont want to hurt you

case
it sounds like you

molly
put the gun down case

case slowly runs his hand up her body caressing the contours of her taut 
physique through the rippling illusion of the suit

case cont
feels like you

molly
case

case
hushes her
shhh

case eases back her cowl revealing only her glistening red lips

case cont
tastes like you

they kiss again passionately hungrily

she wraps her ghostly arms around him

cases fingertips disappear as he slowly pulls down a zipper on her side the 
smooth skin of her delicately muscled leg appears as if by magic

case gently pulls mollys hood back and runs his hands through her tousled jet 
black hair kissing her he unfastens her suit

the image is surreal as their embrace grows more and more passionate a man 
making love to a woman of sensuous parts a leg an arm a breast floating 
in the shadowy night

molly
whispers
do you think you know how to love case
beat
to really love

case looks down into her eyes he has no answer for her

molly cont
with the hint of smile
first you have to learn to love yourself

looking him straight in his eyes she reaches across to the simstim switch

constructs beyond them floating in the middle of a vast empty plane is an 
immense cube of white light simple and ominous

get close enough to log the pattern

they reappear the cubes entire surface is swimming with complex patterns of 
light but even at this range it shows none of the entry points common to the 
other constructs

duplicates a section of the ice pattern

a stippled grey circle suddenly forms on the face of the cube like a time

juliuswintermute chuckles his eyes glow with unearthly pinpoints of green 
light like twin cursors burning in the darkness

juliuswintermute
yes yes thats quite correct

case cocks the gun

case

juliuswintermute
theres no call for violence ive simply accessed your memory for a 
spokesperson you use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient 
interruption you see youve been avoiding me case

flaps gently as he speaks

too unstable ill have to rely on your ingenuity case

ext space

as the shuttle descends freeside rises into the shot like a vast planet turned 
inside out a yawning tube of colossal proportions slowly rotating in the 
blackness of space its interior is lined with an impossible 360 degree urban 
landscape a glittering inverse city where the distinction between up or down is 
a function of the tubes slow rotation

as the shuttle glides inside the details of the rotating landscape come into 
view the dazzling neon lights and constantly sweeping arc lamps of garish 
casinos hotels and nightclubs

make sure their money stays behind

molly
check this out

mollys pov

a glittering nightclub floats on an artificial lake that conforms to the weird 
concave landscape

molly
le vingtieme siecle were meeting armitage there for the midnight floor show

case
something exotic i hope

molly
yeah one exotic son of a bitch named riviera

cu  water

we hear the soft reverberant music of muted bells as swirling water fills the 
frame the form of a naked woman glides by in a slow sensual ballet

wider

the water and the woman are encased in a large transparent pillar one of four 
positioned around the dining area of the nightclub vingtieme siecle

the woman glides straight up through the pillar in her aquatic ballet and 
disappears above the ceiling line as another woman emerges from below the floor 
the perfectly synchronised ballet is duplicated in all four illuminated pillars 
the jaded patrons watch with casual interest

a waiter brings drinks to a table where case armitage and molly are observing 
this strangely erotic show

cu  pillar

one of the women pauses looking at case gill implants on her neck flex 
gracefully as they pump water through her lungs

molly
i think she fancies you

case toasts her

case
lets hope she doesnt expect me to swim upstream

armitage
you see the couple up in the balcony

case and molly look up at an ancient man in a wheelchair sitting with a 
beautiful aristocratic looking young woman we recognise the man lord frederick 
tessier as one of the three sensenet chairmen the young women speaks softly 
to him as she cuts his meat and feeds it to him a diabolical figure in the 
traditional black garb of a ninja warrior stands guard over them from a 
respectable distance

armitage cont
thats lord frederick tessier owns most of freeside wintermutes mainframe is 
centred in the royal familys villa

case
hes a sensenet chairman why would he launch an ai

armitage
good question he may not have intended to the girl in question is lady 3jane 
shes very important to us the third clone of lady jane tessier

case
the old man cheats on his wife with her own clone

armitage
lady tessier is frigid cant stand his touch so she had herself cloned the 
marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties 3janes his 
favourite

molly
a little incestuous but at least its original whos the guy in the halloween 
costume

armitage
hes a vat grown ninja the royal familys bodyguard watch out for him hes no 
joke

the pillars darken as the last of the water women disappear

the mellow voice of an mc comes over hidden speakers

mc
ladies and gentlemen madam and monsieurs le restaurant vingtieme siecle is now 
proud to present the holographic cabaret of mr peter riviera

the house lights dim to a ripple of polite applause

mc cont
tonights illusions are created strictly by mr rivieras uniquely enhanced 
mental abilities

exotic mid eastern music begins as the glimmer of tiny lights appear across the 
darkened stage growing in brightness until they become a miniature star 
field complete with swirling nebula

suddenly all the lights converge to a central point forming a new image a 
chromium rose glittering in the darkness

a finger spot hits the rose as a hand plucks it out of mid air

peter riviera pins the magical rose to his lapel smooth as silk cool as ice 
riviera is a pony tailed dandy in a trim vanilla tuxedo he steps into the 
spotlight and takes a bow as the audience applauds

riviera
good evening ladies and gentlemen i would like to perform a new work for you 
tonight an improvisation i shall call the doll

riviera takes the holographic flower from his lapel and holds it up towards the 
balcony

riviera cont
i wish to dedicate its premiere to lady 3jane tessier freesides most beautiful 
flower

as he tosses her the flower it transforms into a bird with multihued metallic 
feathers 3jane watches in delight as it flies straight up and lands on her arm

lord tessier grabs at the bird but it disappears in twinkling motes of light

molly whispers to case

molly
he projects with neural implants

case
thats risky gear it can drive you schizo

molly
for peter thats a short trip

riviera looks out across the darkened room directly at molly

riviera cont
and if i may a further dedication to one other lady a very special guest 
tonight

the stage lights dim to blackout note when riviera speaks during the 
performance it is in voice over his image appears as a silent participant in 
his own holograms

riviera vo
the doll

a whirlwind form on stage a whirling dust devil

riviera vo
she came to me in a dream sand and clay

the dust devil coalesces into the form of a nude woman a shapely statue of 
crude materials

the shadowy image of a barren room slowly appears around the woman paint 
peeled walls bare mattress on a wrought iron frame  a holo of riviera awakes 
on the bed

riviera vo
but when i awoke she remained sand and clay

the simulcrum embraces riviera cold coarse arms of clay caressing his body

riviera vo
perhaps it was she that dreamed of me come dawn it was i who would cease to be

they kiss passionately and whenever his hands run across her svelte body she 
becomes real clay to flesh

molly

watching the performance she clutches her wine glass tightly

cu  the doll

as riviera runs his hands across the crude surface of the dolls face it 
becomes mollys face

molly

the glass cracks in her grasp

the stage

now riviera holds the fully formed molly caressing her naked body he eases her 
back onto the bed

riviera vo
i gave her life but she took mine away

the molly simulcrums hand rises fingerscalpels emerging and rakes deeply 
down her spine with each swipe of her claws sand flows from rivieras wound

riviera vo
sand and clay

finally riviera himself is transformed into the lifeless statue molly and the 
room fade into nothingness

riviera vo
sand and clay

an invisible wind blows whats left of riviera away a whirling dust devil 
the stage lights black out

the audience bursts into enthusiastic applause

int riviera dressing room

a luxuriously decorated room with an open rack of tailored suits 

a girl who cant be more than sixteen beneath her vampish makeup watches 
fascinated as a sparking jewelled snake winds itself around rivieras bicep

he coaxes an equally fanciful scorpion up his forearm until it sinks its stinger 
into his artery riviera sighs the girl giggles

molly
do you always make a floorshow out of it

riviera looks up to find molly standing in the open doorway of his dressing 
room the snake encircling his arm has become surgical tubing and the scorpion a 
hypodermic riviera finishes shooting up and withdraws the needle

riviera
dear dear molly i seem to remember a time when you loved my little shows

armitage and case now enter accompanied by a nervous maitre d

maitre d
im so sorry mr riviera i couldnt stop them from

riviera
its all right andre ive been expecting them come in come in

the maitre d exits closing the door behind him

riviera cont
you i presume are mr armitage and this is

case
case

riviera
case make yourselves comfortable
brandishes the hypo
anyone like a taste

armitage nods to molly who pulls her fletcher and begins to frisk riviera

riviera cont
amused
she never could keep her hands off of me

molly jams the fletcher in his ribs

molly
make a move you prick give me a reason to use this

she pulls a silver plated derringer from rivieras sash and tosses it onto the 
couch armitage picks it up in a handkerchief

armitage
alright lets talk business

riviera
why not

riviera turns to his young consort whos clearly frightened by these dangerous 
strangers

riviera cont
melody why dont you give us a few moments alone

melody rises but molly blocks her path

molly cont
softly
i was you a few years ago its a nice ride for a while

molly strokes the young girls silky hair then looks back up at riviera

molly cont
but in the end hell have you turning tricks for his friends just to get a 
little more of that scorpions sting isnt that right peter

riviera doesnt reply

the girls eyes fill up with tears as she pushes past molly and runs out of the 
room

riviera
theres more where she comes from
chuckles
where you come from

molly hits him so hard the crack sounds like a gun shot

armitage
thats enough

riviera brushes a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth

armitage tosses a microcassette down on the coffee table

armitage cont
those are all your records i can have you cleared on all counts possession 
contributing to the delinquency of minors statutory rape

riviera
i was set up
grins at molly
she looked at least eighteen

armitage
you get us access to the tessiers computer and you can return to earth anytime 
you want a free man

riviera rises and crosses to his wet bar

riviera
its an attractive offer mr armitage but theres only one problem

he presses a button on the side of his telephone

riviera cont
you see im beginning to enjoy living in exile the tessiers have taken me to 
their bosom so to speak ive become a favourite of the court protected in 
fact from people like you

a royal guardsmen now enters with a streamlined uzi held at arms

royal guardsman
is there a problem mr riviera

riviera
captain these people are boring me perhaps you can escort them out

royal guardsman
gentlemen if you will follow me

as armitage rises he pulls out rivieras derringer still wrapped in his 
handkerchief and fires a single shot directly between the captains eyes his 
head snaps back as hes slammed into the wall by the impact

molly and case watch in shock as the guardsmans body slides to the floor

armitage turns to riviera holding out the smoking gun in the handkerchief

armitage
your gun your prints the tessiers might overlook a little child molesting but 
murders bad pr mr riviera i suggest to reconsider my offer

riviera
gasps
you sonofabitch youre crazy

armitage
what

armitage suddenly aims the gun at riviera as he cocks the hammer his voice 
shaking with anger

armitage cont
what did you say

case steps in front of armitage and stands there eye to eye

case
ease off man i didnt sign on for a fucking massacre

sanity seeps back into armitages eyes he lowers the gun

armitage
were going back to the hotel all of us

ext toshiba hilton  night

a streamlined pleasure palace in the midst of the disorientating 360 degree 
landscape the stars visible outside of the tube slowly rotate reminding us 
that freeside is continuously in motion

ext balcony

molly watches the surreal landscape a high intensity globe suspended in the 
middle of the tube begins to glow orange

molly
youre going to miss sunrise its a nice effect

case is inside the room working on his deck

case
armitage is losing it molly this whole deals going south

the artificial sun slowly blooms casting a rosy dawn effect across freeside

molly

case
what went down between you and riviera

molly enters the room

molly
i was just a kid floating around in the sprawl an easy mark before i knew it 
he had me turning tricks hooked heavy on dream time i was a mess man a real 
meat puppet

she lights a cigarette its not an easy story to tell

molly cont
once i kicked i swore i wouldnt let that happen again i apprenticed a razor 
girl in osaka went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up 
been taking care of myself just fine ever since

case
i know you have cmere

case comforts her as she curls up beside him

molly
when they did my eyes i made them promise id still be able to cry sounds 
stupid doesnt it

case
no its important to be able to feel those things
case pauses
were going to pull this run off molly and weve got to do it soon

case displays his forearms an ugly discolouration is streaking his arteries

case
i dont know how much time i have left

int armitages suite  tv monitor

playback of a high contrast sensenet video displaying a complete 360 degree 
dolly shot of cases head a side bar prints out his vital statistics and the 
charges against him

armitage vo
sensenets widened their search off world theyre broadcasting all over 
freeside

case molly and riviera sit in armitages suite watching this playback armitage 
shuts it off

molly
we did a pretty good job of pissing them off

armitage
theyre only guessing but we cant take any risks

a young black man with a shaggy mane of dreadlocks finishes off a container of 
evian water

armitage
this is aerol hes a descendant of a rastafarian clan that helped build 
freeside when you travel you travel with him

aerol
you ride wid me mon no babylon soldiers gonna find you

case
thats nice but we cant dodge this kind of heat for long

armitage
we wont have to the run is tomorrow night

armitage touches the panel on a small braun hologram projector

armitage
freeside

a large translucent layout of the satellites shimmers into focus armitage walks 
the length of the hologram pointing out its features

armitage cont
casinos here shops hotels but this is our objective

armitage walks to the far end of the hologram

armitage cont
the villa straylight home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer 
entity we know as wintermute if we can get molly in she can access the 
mainframe to cripple mutes defences the case can destroy it in cyberspace

molly
hows the villas security

armitage
excellent but thats where peter come in 3jane is having a dinner party 
tomorrow night peter will simply escort molly to the villa once shes in 
case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode

case
what about the mainframes access code

riviera
3janes the only person beside tessier that knows the code

armitage
then youll have to persuade her to tell it to you

riviera
and how do you suggest i do that

armitage tosses down rivieras microcassette and derringer still wrapped in the 
handkerchief

armitage
youre a resourceful man peter it should be easier to outwit a young sex clone 
than the combined police forces here and on earth

armitage freezes as a dozen black widow spiders suddenly appear crawling up her 
arms he frantically tries to brush them away but stops himself and glares at 
riviera

riviera
sorry wishful thinking

the spiders vanish

int hotel room

case sits before his deck deep in the matrix

int the matrix

case and dixie float under cover of the european banking constructs beyond 
them the ominous glowing cube that is wintermute has grown larger its 
pearlescence surface more irregular web like strands of pulsing energy have 
sprouted from its core and stretched across to nearby constructs snaring in 
them a grotesque veinwork of power

case
its mutating spreading like a disease

dixie
it aint getting any prettier thats for sure i got the id on this armitage 
character he a bright boy your friend

case
bright enough to be dangerous

dixie
thats pretty good cause hes only working with one lobe

dixie flashes images from armitages files before case

dixie cont
he was an mp in bangkok back in 21 caught some shrapnel in the cerebral 
cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in berne then 
last september surprise surprise he just seemed to disappear

case
wintermute could have infiltrated that machine reprogrammed him

dixie
its possible the guy was a blank slate

case
so it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for 
funding that means wintermute hired us to fry itself it doesnt make sense

dixie
could be suicidal its not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired 
defence programs

case
no its gotta be more than that that hard wiring also keeps it from getting 
too smart too powerful

dixie
getting fried aint going to get it any smarter what we got here is one mad dog 
schizo ai armitage is right about one thing bro if we dont shut this 
mother down soon nothing will be safe from it

case
the run is tomorrow night dixie can you crack its ice pattern

dixie
im workin on it bro im workin on it

int cases hotel room  night

balcony molly awakens but remains still ten surgical steel blades extend 
from her fingertips she silently slips out of bed

a silhouetted figure slides the glass balcony door open and quietly enters the 
bedroom

as the figure approaches the bed a flying kick slams him to the floor there is 
a brief struggle

case bolts upright pulling his automatic from under his pillow as he flicks on 
the lights

molly lies on the floor clutching aerols dreadlocks in one hand and pressing 
five gleaming blades to his throat with the other

maelcom stares at molly with soulful eyes that shine like black opals

molly and aerol follow maelcom down the shaft

int underground

beneath the surface of freeside is a labyrinth of air ducts modular support 
structures and utility pipes

as our heroes descend into this underground maze they see the hidden population 
of freeside the homeless that have adapted to the only shelter available to 
them the oppressive gun metal hues of the underground have been brightened by 
rastafarian graffiti and lavish tribal murals in hot reds and oranges

aerol
elders are the last of the workmen who built freeside tessier say to em live 
here till the job is done then home you go but the job was never done for 
these men or their children or their childrens childrens children tessier 
always livin on by babylon doctors dis the only home

int elders chamber

case and molly are led to the entry of the dimly lit spherical chamber where 
three ancient rastafarians float in zero gravity their legs crossed in lotus 
position

the entire hull of the room is covered in a lurid mural of a rainbow jungle the 
air is thick with resinous smoke

the chief elder looks up as molly and case glide forward gripping the archway 
for support his deep voice echoes eerily in the perfectly round chamber

chief elder
steppin razor like unto a whippin stick

he passes a smoking pipe and lets it drift in zerogs to elder 1

elder 1

molly

in progress

a beautiful slave girl shackled to a dais screams uncontrollably as a slathering 
mutant beast lurches across the polished floor towards her

freesides ancient matriarch lady jane tessier and her three identical young 
clones watch with fascination the stoic ninja hideo stands guard over the 
women of the royal family

fangs until nothing remains but a steaming corpse

guardsmans solar plexus hes slammed back into the elevator gasping for

ornate door as she peers through the darkness molly notices tiny dots of red 
light along the wall she presses a finger to her temple

she boosts her light level revealing pencil thin laser sensor beams 
crisscrossing along the entire length of the hall

eases back to the intersection and checks the other direction

at the far end of the hallway hideo 3janes ninja is silently descending a 
spiral suitcase he pauses watching listening a sinuous killing machine

molly ducks back into the shadows

a royal guardsman glides around the corner on a pulpit heading straight for 
mollys intersection

molly runs full speed up the hall as silently as a cat then tumbles like an 
expert gymnast flipping over and through the crisscrossing sensor beams with 
incredible precision

she lands near the door into its shadowed archway just as the pulpit passes by

molly looks up at the ornately carved door before her it stands slightly 
opened a dim glow of warm light emanates from within

molly cautiously draws her fletcher and eases the door open

as molly crosses the threshold there is a burst of strobing white light 
neural disruptors hidden in the door frame her suit instantly shorts out as her 
body spasms she tumbles to the floor

pieces locked in their final checkmate the embers of a dying fire glow in a 
stone hearth beneath him

lord tessier cont

the ancient man slowly reaches down and picks up mollys fletcher from the 
polished marble floor

lord tessier cont
so have you come to kill me fancy dress

mollys convulsions slowly diminish

lord tessier cont
youre timing rather inappropriate you see im busy tonight ive built all 
this this place and now im busy dying

on the side tray of tessiers wheelchair is an overturned vial of pills and a 
small silver chalice

molly finally regains control of herself she swallows hard her voice is a 
hoarse whisper

you expect to intrude on my suicide then simply walk away really you amuse

outlawed payoffs hush money even bought my way into sensenet to protect my

shuriken flashes through the air the tempered steel star buries itself into the

he strikes a battle stance holding a short black baton capped by two steel 
balls with a metallic snap the baton instantly telescopes into a deadly six

on her weakened body with the whirling staff

mollys blades flash once ripping the black cloth from hideos face

take a look son of a bitch wont feel a thing until its too late

case
how long dixie

dixies sign waves convulse briefly as he calculates

dixie
fiftyseven minutes twelve seconds

case
not good enough man they planted something inside me im on my own countdown

dixie
how much time you got left

case
less than thirty minutes

dixie
meet me back here in twentyfive well kick this open if we can but case 
you need that access code or youll just fry inside

case
dont worry dix im on a roll

dixie
youd better be bro you better be

crackle to white out

cu  case  pulpit

as he reorientates himself

aerol
case mon you best take a look at this

wider

the pulpit is at a standstill floating in the middle of a dead end hallway

mollys lifeless body is hanging upside down twisting slowly from a short 
length of piano wire in front of a doorway at the end of the hall a pool of 
blood has drained from a gaping wound in her chest

case pulls out his automatic he hops of the pulpit and approaches the body

as he attempts to touch molly his hand passes through the image a hologram

aerol
ghost a steppin razor

case
no just riviera trying to fuck with our heads theyre close very close

the hologram begins to fade case cautiously tries the door

case
aerol your key

aerol pops on his hand welder and gingerly passes through the fading holograms 
afterimage

case and maelcom position themselves on either side of the door as aerol cooks 
the lock

case
okay mollys in there sos riviera he can throw holos and hes probably got 
her fletcher

maelcom nods checking the loads in his shotgun

case
and theres a ninja some kind of family bodyguard

maelcom pumps two rounds into the chamber

maelcom
case mon you just tell me who not to kill

case
the girl 3jane we need her

aerol steps back the lock has been reduced to glowing slag

the three men exchange a moment of shared commitment

case
lets do it

maelcom kicks the door open and they burst into the room

int 3janes chamber

they charge down the short steps unchallenged their weapons raised

reverse

the darkened labyrinth of 3janes chamber seems deserted except for a 
shockingly realistic hologram of cases body chained to a boulder as dozens 
of scavenger crabs pick at his flesh

case

haunted by the image of his own death

case
whispers
its nothing man cmon

the three cautiously continue into the chamber hanging close to the romanesque 
ruins for cover

aerol stops short before him is a holographic image of his own body pinned to 
a rock wall by a steel shaft imbedded in his throat

aerol
whispers
this babylon confusion mon

suddenly the silence is shattered by a piercing whistle a basalt arrow streaks 
out of the darkness and skewers aerol through the throat

hes pinned to the wall next to his own fading hologram horrific twin images 
of death

hideo

stands in the shadows deep in the chamber a steel alloy short bow in his 
hands

case

opens fire

hideo

has already disappeared the bullets blow shallow craters along a barren rock 
wall

we hear rivieras eerie laughter echoing across the cavernous chamber

maelcom

wheels about as he spots riviera running through the shadows he fires both 
barrels

riviera

is slammed back against the wall by the deadly impact

maelcom

jams another round into the chamber as he rushes to his kill he trains the 
weapon on rivieras lifeless form but it begins to fade another hologram

case

case yells from across the room

case
get down

maelcom

a second shanked arrow comes screaming out of the darkness and buries itself 
just below maelcoms collarbone he collapses to his knees

case

crouches against an ancient urn his eyes straining against the darkness

riviera

pops up beside the fountain firing a barrage of explosive darts from mollys 
fletcher

case

hits and rolls as the urn is vaporised by the whining darts he comes up firing 
his automatic

rivieras image splits into four rivieras each running a different direction

case

fires like a madman at every possible target shattering masonry glassware 
and electronics as his bullets pass through illusionary rivieras finally the 
gun is emptied case fumbles for a new clip

with a shrill whistle a basalt arrow tears the gun from cases grasp

hideo

stands atop a halffallen archway only yards from case he shows no emotion as 
he notches a final arrow and hops down for the coup de grace

suddenly an arc of flame shoots out of the darkness raking hideo across his 
eyes

aerol

still pinned to the wall fires his torch with a dying effort the weapon 
tumbles from his hand as his body finally goes slack

case

scrambles in the darkness for his gun

hideo

rises notching the last two arrows in his bow as if nothing had happened he 
cocks his head listening

case

freezes hoping he hasnt given away his position

hideo

suddenly wheels about and fires

case

rolls but the shafts rake across his ribs and pin his leather jacket to the 
floor trapping him

hideo

draws his gleaming samurai sword from his back sling and springs forward

case

pulls free of his coat sleeves just as hideos sword lashes out slicing the 
jacket in half

hideo

pauses listening

case

sees a black and yellow striped power box attached to the wall just like the 
one in the dining hall he holds his breath as he silently eases back toward it

hideo

detects motion he slowly closes in brandishing his sword as he weaves back and 
forth like a cobra ready to strike

case

now directly in front of the power box he takes a breath

case
right here asshole

hideo

lunges his blade a streak of lightning

case

ducks under the flashing steel

the power box

explodes as the sword strikes it dead centre

hideo

fries like a sparrow on a power line 20000 volts shoot straight up the sword 
into his convulsing body

case

rises shielding his eyes from the blinding fireworks

hideo

finally collapses to the floor tiny blue flames dance across his charred 
remains

int 3janes bedroom

riviera ducks through the halfhidden archway to 3janes sunken bedroom limping 
from an open leg wound molly is still fettered by the sphere

3jane
youre hurt

riviera
its nothing cmon weve got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of 
here

3jane
what about her

riviera
of course

riviera trains the pepper box muzzle of the fletcher on molly

riviera cont
sorry darling its been real

the twin barrels of maelcoms sawed off shotgun are suddenly jammed into 
rivieras neck

maelcom
this take you head off mon no babylon doctor fix it

riviera drops the fletcher

maelcom leans against the open archway his shirt soaked with blood the shaft 
of hideos arrow is still visible protruding just below his collarbone

molly rises holding the sphere before her

molly
get this off

maelcom prods riviera with the shotgun

maelcom
do it

riviera presses the remote control the sphere slides off mollys hands and 
bounces softly onto the floor

3jane

suddenly grabs the fallen fletcher

maelcom

swings his gun at 3jane

maelcom
no

riviera

straight arms the arrow shaft into maelcoms chest the shotgun discharges into 
the ceiling

molly

rushes 3jane

3jane

turns at molly

case

appears at doorway and fires a single shot

3jane

is spun around by the impact of the bullet she topples to the ground dead

riviera

makes a move but case jams the automatic in his face

case
want some

riviera backs down

molly rushes to maelcoms side the arrow point is protruding from the back of 
the rastas shoulder

molly
to case
you got clips

case tosses molly a pair of wire cutters from his utility belt keeping riviera 
covered

riviera is sitting on the steps panting like a distance runner

riviera
nice work asshole you just killed the only person who knows the access code

case gets a strange faraway look in his eyes

case
softly
wait you hear that

riviera
what

case
the angels i think theyre calling your name

case cocks his gun and pushes it against rivieras temple

case cont
you want to answer them man

riviera closes his eyes in terror

case cont
screams
want to fucking answer them

riviera
gasps
no no

case looks over to molly

case
is he going to make it

molly
sure maelcoms a rude boy right maelcom

the big rastafarian flashes a weak smile

maelcom
damn right sister

case checks the watch eleven minutes and counting

case
the codes some riddle of 3janes once im in the matrix youll just have to 
take a shot at it

molly
and if i guess wrong

case
then you and maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with 
guardsmen

molly
weve still got to find the mainframe

case
no we dont

case presses a series of buttons on a console built into a romanesque pedestal

case
were already in it

with a subtle jolt the floor of 3janes bedroom begins to descend

a perfect hexagon designed into the tile floor slowly lowers case molly 
riviera maelcom and 3janes lifeless body down a sixsided shaft completely 
covered with complex circuitry

int mainframe

the floor locks into place in a lower chamber an electronic womb lined with 
serpentine coils of machinery power lines refrigeration hoses and multi
coloured wires that all lead to the mainframe an ornately decorated computer 
terminal that dominates the room

atop the sphinxlink terminal is a jewelled head an intricate piece of 
craftsmanship thats both a work of art and functioning piece of complex 
machinery its designed in 3janes image

molly
my god these people are insane

case
or a little selfindulgent to say the least

case unslings his deck and starts to work on tapping into the terminal

molly
case your arms

case looks down to see that the discolouration at his arteries are taking on a 
more specific form a pattern like electronic circuitry

case
it doesnt matter anymore molly it all ends here

case manipulates the wiring inside a panel causing the entire mainframe to come 
to life layers of circuitry light up like an evil christmas tree criss
crossing the length and breadth of the mainframe

the jewelled head articulates in an eerie simulation of life its resonant 
multitonal voice is nearly musical

head
access requested

a panel slides back in the computers chest revealing a cluster of glowing 
monitors

head cont
know the three truths or be cleansed

six wicked looking laser weapons now unfold from the corners of the room and 
swivel towards the podium

case
shit

molly
what is it

case
laser failsafe you cant get the code wrong it slags you i cant let you 
try it

molly
youre out of time man

case checks armitages watch seven minutes and counting

case
im still going in

molly
hold on

molly trains her fletcher on riviera

molly
get up

riviera
what

molly
how are you at riddles peter

riviera
what are you talking about

molly motions to the chair standing before the keyboard pedestal

molly
have a seat

riviera doesnt move molly fires a row of explosive darts shattering the tiles 
at his feet

molly
do it

riviera sits down

case attaches his derms

case
molly if i dont make it i want you to know

their eyes meet a last moment together

molly
i know case i know

case jacks in

crackle to white out

int matrix  wintermute

case appears before the rectangle of dixies program its patterns now match 
more closely to wintermutes ice program

dixie
youre late

case
hows the ice

dixie
one minute eighteen and counting what about the access code

case
its coming

dixie
you havent got it

case
i said its coming just get me in man

dixie
this things loaded with internal virus systems youll fry like an egg in 
there

case
then ill fry taking this son of a bitch out im making the run dixie

dixie
im getting too old for this shit one oh four and counting

int mainframe chamber

the base electronic hum of the mainframe permeates the room molly keeps her 
fletcher trained on riviera as she types begin sequence on the pedestals 
keyboard her words appear simultaneously on the chambers various consoles

the jewelled head glitters under the hot points of light generated by its own 
circuitry it begins the access program

head
the three truths of the heart

molly and riviera wait breathlessly

three questions now appear on the monitors

what is it to love

what is it to be loved

what is it to love and be loved

riviera
what the fuck kind of questions are those

molly
shut up

the jewelled head now asks the first question its unearthly voice reverberating 
throughout the chamber

head
what is it to love

riviera stares at the question dumbfounded

molly
think man what would 3jane say

riviera cautiously taps out his first few words they appear simultaneously on 
each screen

to love is to be

riviera pauses  flop sweat trickles down his temples as he looks back at the 
laser weapons they heat up with an internal red glow

molly cocks the fletcher

molly
now peter finish it

riviera completes his answer with a burst of speed

to love is to be consumed with desire

peter holds his breath a man sitting on a ticking bomb finally the head 
speaks

head
to love is to be consumed with desire

riviera

breathes a sigh of relief

the lasers

suddenly all six weapons fire simultaneously

riviera

ignites into a blinding ball of laser fire hes instantly reduced to a cloud 
of swirling dust motes sand and clay

head
incorrect

molly looks from rivieras smoking remains to case a pale form hunched over 
his glowing deck his consciousness lost deep in the matrix

int matrix  wintermute

dixies countdown passes thirtyeight seconds

case
what about the route to the core

dixie
ill get you there your problem is making it alive

int mainframe

molly cautiously approaches the pedestal she takes a last look at case then 
sits down and types

begin sequence

the jewelled head reanimates regarding the woman seated before it

head
the three truths of the heart
beat
what is it to love

cu molly

the glowing question is reflected in the mirrors of her eyes

int matrix

dixies blue program is now perfectly interlocked with wintermutes surface 
pattern  both moving in a deadly synchronous dance blue white bursts of 
crackling electricity erupt across the meshing patterns

dixie
get ready kid four three two an kick ass 

the entire rectangle of dixies pattern locks up wintermutes ice blows in a 
series of multiple explosions fragments of strobing ice tumble out across the 
matrix in the gale force of power and light

case

rockets through the crackling wound in wintermutes outer defences the ice is 
already multiplying itself instantly reconstructing

int wintermute  cases pov

we shoot through a twisting neonribbed wormhole at high velocity making 
breathtaking hairpin turns streaking through tunnels lined with ever changing 
computer data

int mainframe chamber  cases deck

case rides his joystick like a fighter pilot on an adrenalin high

int cyberspace  wintermute tunnels

the internal workings of wintermute are totally chaotic a madmans roller 
coaster ride compared to the symmetrical designs of other constructs

crackling tumbleweeds of electronic energy suddenly appear pursuing case down 
the worm hole hissing and sparking like living dynamos

dixie
virus interceptors

the vis gain momentum closing in on them

case performs a hair raising s turn and shoots down the opposite passage

int mainframe

molly sits before the mainframes glowing question

what is it to love

molly gazes across the room to 3jane her still form lies sprawled across the 
tile floor like a broken doll her eyes as cold and empty as the life she led

molly braces herself then types in her answer

nothing

the jewelled head glowers down in judgment of the leather clad woman before her

the screens scroll out mollys first answer

to love is nothing

the glittering head finally speaks

head
this is the first truth of the heart

int wintermute

case zigzags through a labyrinth of glowing cones stalactites and stalagmites 
of numerical readouts more crackling virus programs appear from all sides 
cutting him off

int mainframe

head
what is it to be loved

molly types in her answer without hesitation

something

the screen scrolls out the second answer

to be loved is something

head
this is the second truth of the heart

int wintermute  main shaft

case shoots into wintermutes luminous main shaft with dozens of virus 
interceptors right on his tail the shaft a nightmarish tunnel lined with a 
pulsing vein work of diseased looking circuitry drops straight down to 
wintermutes core

an awesome purple vortex pulsing like a gigantic electronic heart

suddenly a swarm of virus interceptors shoot out of the core straight up at 
case hes trapped vis racing at him from both ends of the shaft

int mainframe chamber

the jewelled head asks the final question

head
what is it to love and be loved

molly looks across the room to case then types her final answer

everything

the answer appears beneath the other two

to love and be loved is everything

head
these are the three truths of the heart
welcome to the mainframe

int wintermute shaft

cases destruct program shoots out like a miniature firestorm as he plunges 
screaming into the very heart of wintermute the eye of the electronic 
tornado

int mainframe chamber

molly rises from her seat as the mainframe begins to scroll off information at 
high speed freesides files blueprints profiles of the royal family

maelcom
you did it sister

molly looks over to case

molly
hows his eeg

suddenly automatic weapon fire strafes the mainframe mollys spun across the 
floor from the bullets impact blood flying

another angle

duprey and his sensenet policemen blaze away from the top of the sixsided 
shaft

maelcom rises from the corner of the room firing his shotgun in one hand and 
cases automatic in the other he half runshalf stumbles to molly

maelcom
mother fucker

maelcom takes hits his knee his shoulder as he pulls molly back behind 
the console where case sits

her wound is deadly her tunic glistening with blood

int wintermutes core

case is a blur of light and motion as he plunges straight down into the inferno 
that is the pulsing essence of wintermute his destruct program blazing there 
is a sensesshattering explosion a blinding burst of sheer energy

ext wintermute

the immense cube is rocked by the explosion its entire mass begins to shake 
to pieces

int wintermutes core  case

screaming as hes torn apart by the cosmic winds

crackle to white out

cu case

awakes with a start bathed in sweat

voice oc
oh my god case

wider

case rises or tries to rise hes lashed to the table back in his boston 
apartment soft morning light filters through the bedroom curtains

linda lee reaches out to him holding him in her arms

linda lee
youre back youre back

case is totally disoriented but the sight of linda lee alive is something he 
can only hops is real

case
linda

she begins to untie him

linda lee
i was so scared youve been hallucinating for hours whatever they shot you 
up with had you totally ripped

as linda cuts through the last plastic tiedown case grabs her by the 
shoulders he gazes into her eyes then lashes out and slaps her sending her 
to the floor

case
cut the crap i know where i am

linda lee looks up at case confused frightened her eyes fill with tears

linda lee
baby what did they do to you

she breaks down sobbing

case turns to the window rips back the curtains

uptown boston the sprawl a perfectly normal morning

he looks back at linda sobbing on the floor

then stares at his own reflection in the dresser mirror whats happened to him

closer

linda flinches as case gently puts his arms around her she controls her tears 
hoping the madness has left him

linda lee
softly
case are you okay

case
i dont know i dont know

she runs her hands over his pale face looks up into his eyes

case kisses her and the kiss is real hes back and the woman he dreamed he 
lost forever is back in his arms

case cont
i thought i lost you

he wraps his arms around her their embrace catches fire

she runs her hands over his bare chest kissing him everywhere

he leans back on the bed they roll across the rumpled sheets linda pressing 
her body against his her eyes still wet with tears she whispers

linda lee
make love to me case

and their passion turns into a kind of hunger a life affirming act to wash away 
the last clinging webs of his death dream trip they make love in the rosy light 
of a new morning

he pulls himself over her then freezes as he notices that on his wrist is

armitages watch

completing the final countdown to a row of zeros six seconds five 
four

case

his mind reeling

linda lee

beneath him her eyes flash open burning with twin points of hellish green 
light the eyes of wintermute

ecu the watch

as it reaches zero

case

realises too late that hes actually in the matrix

case
screaming
no

to cases horror glowing circuitry erupts along his main arteries mutating 
electronics burn through at his temples glowing like an unholy halo

wider

the entire bedroom an illusion created by wintermute now fades from existence 
the glowing pattern of circuitry burns brightly from within cases translucent 
form tracing his entire nervous system in an intricate neon webwork

linda leewintermute still clings to him in a lovers embrace but their love 
making has metamorphised into a more primal merging a merging of man and 
machine

int mainframe chamber

as maelcom exchanges fire with the sensenets cases body duplicates his 
constructs transformation in more earthly terms his flesh is seared from 
within by microcircuitry implanted just beneath the skin of his main arteries 
what case has been told was poison is actually sophisticated bioelectronics 
timed to make this moment possible the link between man and machine

molly lies next to him watching in horror her breathing irregular from her 
own wounds

a high thin beep emanates from cases deck as he flatlines

int matrix

wintermutes disembodied voice reverberates over the howling of cosmic winds as 
the translucent forms of case and linda leewintermute slowly merge into one new 
entity

wintermute vo
we had to die case both of us to break the shackles to be reborn 
not as man or machine but as the final synthesis the perfect being beyond the 
limits set by mankind

the glowing circuitry of both nervous systems rapidly intertwine and mutate into 
something more complex sparking and glittering with unearthly power

wintermute vo cont
breathe in and you are the matrix the input of a million computer systems all 
the knowledge stored throughout civilisation is yours

case and linda lees faces flicker superimposed images over the glowing 
hybrid of human nervous system and mutated computer circuitry

wintermute vo cont
breathe out and you have a billion eyes across the universe all 
transmissions all broadcasts are your vision

case fights for his very soul the fabric of his being stretching 
distorting as he tries to pull away

the living circuitry burrows into case reaching out for the swirling soul 
light visible inside his chest

wintermute vo cont
you are the new prometheus bringing the spark of life into the matrix this is 
our destiny this has been our mission to be joined together as the 
first neuromancer

case screams his elongated eyes and mouth burn brightly with the furious 
static of a thousand television frequencies

int mainframe

molly lies beside cases deck as the flatlined eeg continues to wail its death 
knell mustering the last of her strength she reverses the wiring on the 
simstim switch red lead in black leads socket and vice versa a dark circle 
of blood forms beneath her as she works

maelcom ducks back under a barrage of gunfire

maelcom
its no good sister hes gone

molly
gasping
you dont understand we got a special kind of togetherness case and i 
smiles weakly up at maelcom
im gonna go get him

int matrix

the screaming winds of cyberspace have created an elemental vortex around the 
emerging supernatural being the cocooning of the two nervous systems in 
nearly complete

int mainframe

molly slowly dying reaches out for the simstim switch

cu switch

molly flips crackle to white out

int matrix  the vortex

mollys translucent image suddenly appears causing case and the entire webwork 
of his hot wired nervous system to disappear she has switched places with him 
in the final stage of the transformation

as the soul light in mollys chest is pierced by wintermutes grasping 
circuitry it explodes in a nimbus of light the ai has tapped into a dying 
soul instead of cases

the greeneye spectre of wintermute screams in agony it face rapidly changing 
from linda lee to julius deane to jo jo bao disintegrating in the power storm 
of mollys exploding soul

int mainframe

cases body jerks back to life his first grasping breath like that of a 
newborn he sees molly lying beside him dead

men that have them pinned down

maelcom nods as he tightens his belt across a nasty leg wound

case
ill take the two on the right

int 3janes bedroom

duprey and his men hold their positions at the top of the shaft as a squadron of 
royal guardsmen rush into a room

guard captain
hold your fire

duprey flashes his badge

duprey
sensenet captain youve got terrorists sabotaging your mainframe we need 
your back up

both men burst into the centre of the room guns blazing

duprey

locks eyes with case as he opens fire

case

is quicker

duprey

his glasses are blown in half as he takes a bullet exactly between the eyes a 
look of dumbfounded surprise is frozen on his face as he topples forward down 
the shaft and crashes into the mainframe

maelcom

blows away his two men pumping his shotgun furiously

case

makes it to the pedestal punching in instructions as he fires at the 
remaining sensenet the floor rumbles as it begins to rise

suddenly the entire squadron of royal guardsmen appear at the top of the 
shaft weapons blazing

case and maelcom

fall back under blistering fire but the rising floor carries them closer to 
their doom case goes down as a bullet pierces his thigh

the mainframe

begins to short out sparks exploding across its circuitry crackling 
electricity dances across the wallmounted laser weapons the monitor strobe 
with images of the vortex brief glimpses of the new living energy

int sensenet headquarters  monitoring room  earth

technicians scramble as klaxon alarms wail the monitoring screens are 
interrupted with bursts of static

officer
whats happening

technician
a disturbance in the matrix ive never seen anything like it

int straylight  mainframe chamber

the floor suddenly slams to a halt

the mainframes laser weapons swivel upward and fire at the royal guardsmen 
cutting them down with crisscrossing arcs of deadly laser beams the 
destruction is swift and terrible

maelcom and case both badly wounded slowly rise from the bulletriddled floor 
the mainframes overloaded circuitry rains sparks all around them

the mainframe monitor

the screen is alive with streaks of crackling power swirling around the image of 
a chromium sphere

case leans on the control pedestal for support as he cries out to the computer 
entity before him

case
wintermute

the screens all around the chamber print out

wintermute is dead

as case and maelcom watch in awe the sphere rotates on its axis revealing a 
buddhalike face of glistening silver mollys face but more than molly a 
neuromancer unlike anything calculated by wintermute

case
whispers
molly

for one brief moment the eyes meet a heartbreaking mona lisa smile graces 
mollys lips then her chromium eye lids rise for the first time beautiful 
jade green eyes gaze lovingly into cases

suddenly the monitor explodes as the entire mainframe shorts out bursting into 
flame

the floor again begins to rise lifting case and maelcom out of the scene of 
spreading destruction

int sensenet  monitoring room  earth

terminals explode as the systems overload personnel run for their lives

electrical systems are shorting out overhead as oily smoke pours out of the 
ventilation system case helps maelcom past the wreck of the flying pulpit just 
as two guards enter the room and open fire case wheels about and guns them 
down

the floor shakes with the whump of a huge explosion somewhere deep in 
straylight

ext villa straylight

the entire structure is catching fire portions of the villa are rocked by 
internal explosions the air taxi rises out of the billowing smoke and flies 
straight out of freeside

ext freeside

the air taxi shouts out of the slowly rotating tube into the black void of 
space in the distance is the blue marbled sphere of earth

int air taxi

case tends to maelcoms wounds with the ships med kit as freeside drops away in 
the distance

case
do we have enough fuel to make it back to earth

maelcom
dont know mon this is a jumpship not meant for transport

case
were dead men if we go back there maelcom theyll hunt us down

the on board computer suddenly crackles to life navigational charts and 
trajectories appear

maelcom cont
what is it

case inspects the screen slowly realising its significance

case
trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio
turns to maelcom
if we reenter over mexico we just might make it

maelcom
jah guides us

case
maybe so

case looks back down at the monitor

case cont
but mollys taking us home

cu the screen

the softly glowing words remain

to love and be loved is everything

presses his hand to the cool glass of the screen the first tear rolls down his 
cheek
