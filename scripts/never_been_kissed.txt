                                     josie
                         wait a second
                              into phone
                         no not youbye

               josie shuts the phone looks aroundretraces her steps 
                bambi is gone

               josie walks around the lot getting visibly upset

               in the corner of the lot we see a group of denominators 
               removing a big metal chain from around a group of tightly 
               packed cars

                                     aldys os
                         they do it to all the new kids

               josie finds aldys standing next to her

                                     josie
                         whos of they

               aldys motions up to a second floor window guy and his 
               group look down on them laughing

                                     aldys
                         guy perkins and his amazing 
                         lemmings they push your car out 
                         of its space hide it then watch 
                         while you look for it weve taken 
                         to chaining ours together for 
                         safety im aldys

                                     josie
                         im josie aldys is an interesting 
                         name

                                     aldys
                         when its not yours my mom was 
                         going through her harlequin romance 
                         phase

                                     josie
                         try being named after a guitar
                         playing pussycat

               aldys doesnt get it

                                     josie
                         never mind
                              beat
                         that is so awful that they hide 
                         your cars

                                     aldys
                         guess although what is truly 
                         awful is that with the combined 
                         intellectual effort of every kid 
                         in that room right now

               she points up to the biology room

                                     aldys
                         they still would not know the 
                         difference between a synecdoche 
                         and a hyperbole

               josie laughs

                                     josie
                         i know its pathetic

               aldys stares josie down

                                     josie
                         what

                                     aldys
                         well do you

                                     josie
                         synecdoche uses a part to represent 
                         a whole as in  head of cattle 
                         whereas a hyperbole is simple 
                         exaggeration like i could eat a 
                         horse

                                     aldys
                         nice

               they stop and look around

                                     josie
                         how long will they watch us for

                                     aldys
                         until guy tells them to go once 
                         they watched me for like two hours 
                         i found my car the next day in the 
                         tj maxx parking lot

                                     josie

               thrilled  having finally found a friend

               int nanas  later

               josie and aldys share a huge plate of chili fries

               aldys takes another slurp of her shake we hear a muffled 
               cell phone ringing

                                     aldys
                         i think your knapsack is ringing

                         denominators the math team could 
                         really use a new brain we lost

               as we begin montage

               int high school hallway  day

               josie and denominators walk down the hallway in unison 
               past guys group open their lockers in order a la 
               reservoir dogs take out paper pencils calculators

               int  high school hallway  day

               josie and aldys both wearing big orange denominator 
               sweatshirts are behind a table manning a bake sale

               a banner behind them says n  314578697786978 pie  75

               no one is stopping to buy anything josie points to the 
               left aldys looks and josie stuffs a whole brownie in her 
               mouth they laugh uncontrollably as josie starts to choke 
               and cough up most of the brownie

               we pan down a row of nervous looking denominator faces as 
               they watch josie sitting head to head against a digit an 
               opposing mathalon competitor they both work furiously 
               on a problem a judge sits between them a makeshift 
               scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied

               josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her 
               card he looks it over and gives her team five points 
               they win

               the denominators erupt into cheers theyre jumping all 
               over josie going crazy as we go wider we see the gym is 
               entirely empty except for a handful of denominators going 
               crazy on one side and a janitor sweeping up on the other

               int mall book store  day

               smiling at each other josie and aldys clutch books 
               excitedly and stand in line we widen to reveal theyre in 
               line with nerdy adults also clutching their books at the 
               head of the line is a blowup poster for the new elements 
               of grammar an old man signs books for his fans

               across the library at breakneck speed she sits down next 
               to josie visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside

                                     sheila

                              book
                         art is a form of catharsis and

                         was still writing about love right
