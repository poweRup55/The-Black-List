                 i do

                           dayday
                 damn nigga dont jack the joint  i
                 didnt even pass it

                           roach
                     hitting it good
                 sorry dude

                           craig
                 you better open up a window or something
                 before the smell gets out

                           dayday
                 aint no windows in here

                           roach
                 i got an idea

       he hands the joint to craig  gets up and closes the door
       then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner

                           roach contd
                 this is a little theory of mine it
                 should work

       he plugs in the vacuum and turns it on  he puts the nozzle
       in daydays face

                           dayday
                 blow

                           craig
                 that aint gonna work

                           roach
                 fuck yeah

       dayday hits the j and blows into the nozzle  it quickly
       sucks up the smoke

                           dayday
                     passing the j
                 it works

                           craig
                 still gonna smell it

                           roach
                 no way  watch this

       roach hits the joint harder than anyone else  smoke starts
       to come out of his ears  craig and dayday get a kick out of
       that

       ext pinkys records and disc  continuous
