               ext west texas road  day

               the last landscape hard sunbaked prairie is surveyed in a 
               long slow pan

                                     voice over
                         told me that hed been planning to 
                         kill somebody for about as long as 
                         he could remember said that if they 
                         turned him out hed do it again

               the pan has brought into frame the flashing light bars of a 
               police car stopped on the shoulder a young sheriffs deputy 
               is opening the rear door on the far side of the car

                         said he knew he was going to hell 
                         be there in about fifteen minutes i 
                         dont know what to make of that i

               close on a pair of hands manacled behind someones back a 
               hand enters to take the prisoner by one arm

                                     voice over
                         the crime you see now its hard to 
                         even take its measure its not that 
                         im afraid of it

               back to the shot over the light bars the deputy with a 
               hand on top of the prisoners head to help him clear the 
               door frame eases the prisoner into the backseat all we see 
               of the prisoner is his dark hair disappearing into the car

                                     voice over
                         i always knew you had to be willing 
                         to die to even do this job  not to 
                         be glorious but i dont want to 
                         push my chips forward and go out and 
                         meet something i dont understand

               the deputy closes the back door he opens the front passenger 
               door and reaches down for somethingapparently heavyat his 
               feet

                                     voice over
                         you can say its my job to fight it 
                         but i dont know what it is anymore

               the deputy swings the heavy object into the front passenger 
               seat matching inside the car it looks like an oxygen tank 
               with a petcock at the top and tubing running off it

                                     voice over
                         more than that i dont want to 
                         know a man would have to put his 
                         soul at hazard

               the deputy slams the door

               on the door slam we cut to texas highway racing under the 
               lens the landscape flat to the horizon the siren whoops

                                     voice over
                         he would have to say okay ill 
                         be part of this world

               int sheriff lamars office  day

               the deputy

               seated in the sheriffs office on the phone the prisoner 
               stands in the background focus is too soft for us to see 
               his features but his posture shows that his arms are still 
               behind his back

                                     deputy
                         yessir just walked in the door 
                         sheriff he had some sort of a thing 
                         on him like one of them oxygen tanks 
                         for emphysema or somethin and a 
                         hose from it run down his sleeve

               behind him we see the prisoner seat himself on the floor 
               without making a sound and scoot his manacled hands out under 
               his legs hands in front of him now he stands

                                     deputy
                         well you got me sir you can see 
                         it when you get in

               the prisoner approaches as he nears the deputys back he 
               grows sharper but begins to crop out of the top of the frame

                                     deputy
                         yessir i got it covered

               as the deputy reaches forward to hang up the prisoner is 
               raising his hands out of frame just behind him the manacled 
               hands drop back into frame in front of the deputys throat 
               and jerk back and up 

               wider the prisoners momentum brings both men crashing 
               backward to the floor faceup deputy on top

               the deputy reaches up to try to get his hands under the 
               strangling chain

               the prisoner brings pressure his wrists whiten around the 
               manacles

               the deputys legs writhe and stamp he moves in a clumsy 
               circle crabbing around the pivotpoint of the other mans 
               back arched against the floor

               the deputys flailing legs kick over a wastebasket send 
               spinning the castored chair slam at the desk

               blood creeps around the friction points where the cuffs bite 
               the prisoners wrists blood is being spit by the deputy

               the prisoner feels with his thumb at the deputys neck and 
               averts his own face a yank of the chain ruptures the carotid 
               artery it jets blood

               the blood hits the office wall drumming hollowly

               int sheriff lamars bathroom  day

               the prisoner walks in runs the water and puts his wrists 
               now freed under it

               int office  day

               close on the air tank one hand a towel wrapped at the wrist 
               reaches in to hoist it

               ext road  late day

               road rushes under the lens pointofview through a windshield 
               of taillights ahead the only pair in sight

               a siren bloop

               the car pulls over a fourdoor ford sedan

               the police car pulls over behind

               the prisoner  his name is anton chigurh  gets out of the 
               police car and slings the tank over his shoulder he walks 
               up the road to the man cranking down his window groping for 
               his wallet

                                     man
                         whats this about

                         step out of the car please sir

               the motorist squints at the man with the strange apparatus 

                                     man
                         huh what is

                         i need you to step out of the car 
                         sir

               the man opens his door and emerges

                                     man
                         am i

               chigurh reaches up to the mans forehead with the end of the 
               tube connected to the air tank

                                     chigurh
                         would you hold still please sir

               a hard pneumatic sound the man flops back against the car 
               blood trickles from a hole in the middle of his forehead 

               chigurh waits for the body to slide down the car and crumple 
               clearing the front door he opens it and hoists the air tank 
               over into the front seat

               ext arid plain  day

               seen through an extreme telephoto lens heat shimmer rises 
               from the desert floor

               a pan of the horizon discovers a distant herd of antelope 
               the animals are grazing

               reverse on a man in blue jeans and cowboy boots sitting on 
               his heels elbows on knees peering through a pair of 
               binoculars a heavybarreled rifle is slung across his back 
               this is moss

               he lowers the binoculars slowly unslings the rifle and looks 
               through its sight

               the view through the sight swims for a moment to refind the 
               herd one animal is staring directly at us its motion 
               arrested as if its heard or seen something

               close on mosss eyes one at the sight the other closed

               he mutters

                                     moss
                         hold still

               he opens the free eye and rolls his head off the sight to 
               give himself stereo

               close on the hatchmarked range dial on the sight moss 
               delicately thumbs it

               he eases the one eye back onto the sight

               pointofview through the sight moss adjusts to bring the 
               crosshairs back down to the staring animal

               mosss finger tightens on the trigger

               shot gunbuck swishes the pointofview upward

               moss fights it back down

               the pointofview through the sight finds the beast again 
               still staring at us

               the sound of the gunshot rings out across the barial

               short beat

               the bullet hits the antelope not a kill the animal recoils 
               and runs packing one leg

               the other animals are off with it

                                     moss
                         shit

               he stands and jacks out the spent casing which jangles against 
               the rocks he stoops for it and puts it in his shirt pocket

               ext arid plain  later

               moss is on foot rifle again slung over his shoulder 
               binoculars around his neck he is looking at the ground

               an intermittent trail of blood

               mosss pace is brisk distances are long

               he suddenly stops staring

               on the ground is the fresh trail of blood the glistening 
               drops already dry at the periphery but this trail is crossed 
               by another trail of blood drier

               moss looks one way along this older trail

               his pointofview flatlands scrub no movement

               he looks the other way

               a distant range of mountains no movement

               he stoops to examine the trail

               he paces it til he finds a print clear enough to give him 
               the animals orientation

               he stands and looks again toward the distant mountains he 
               brings up the binoculars

               his pointofview landscape swimming into focus heat waves 
               exaggerated by the compression of the lens

               panning looking for the animal

               movement very distant the animal is brought into focus a 
               black tailless dog huge head limping badly phantasmal by 
               virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence

               moss lowers the glass a moment of thought as he gazes off 

               he turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came

               ext rise near basin  minutes later

               moss tops a rise he scans the landscape below 

               not much to see exceptdistant glints off something not 
               native to the environment

               moss brings up the binoculars

               parked vehicles three of them squat broncos or other off
               road trucks with fat tires winches in the bed and racks of 
               roof lights

               on the ground near the trucks dark shapes lie still

               ext basin  minutes later

               moss is walking cautiously up to the site unslung rifle at 
               the ready

               flies drone

               he circles two dead bodies lying in the grass covered with 
               blood a gutshot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward 
               the mountains lies beside them a sawedoff shotgun with a 
               pistol stock lies in the grass

               the tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the 
               first pickup moss approaches

               he opens the door and looks inside

               the driver is dead leaning over the wheel moss shuts the 
               door

               he opens the door of the second truck

               the driver sitting upright still in shoulder harness is 
               staring at him

               moss stumbles back raising the rifle

               the man does not move the front of his shirt is covered 
               with blood

                                     man
                         agua

               moss stares at him

                                     man
                         agua por dios

                         aint got no water

               on the seat next to the man is an hk machine pistol moss 
               looks at it he looks back at the man the man is still 
               staring at him without lowering his eyes moss reaches in 
               and takes the pistol

               moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle 
               back over his shoulder he snaps the clip off the machine 
               pistol checks it and snaps it back on

               moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp 
               that covers the truck bed

               a map

               a detailed topographical survey map illuminated by a 
               flashlight

               moss is studying it in the cab of his truck

               after a beat he folds the map

               he checks the 45 taken off the corpse with the money

               wider the pickup truck parked outside the cattle guard 
               after a beat the truck drives over the grate onto the unpaved 
               part of the road jogging up the uneven terrain

               through the windshield the view is pitch black except for 
               the boulders and scrub picked out by the crazily bouncing 
               headlights

               ext basin  night

               door slam

               we are close on the water jug slapping against mosss leg as 
               we pull him through the darkness the shape of his parked 
               truck is just visible behind him silhouetted on the crest 
               by the glow of the moon already set

               walking across the basin to the near truck moss freezes 
               noticing

               its driversside door closed

               moss scans the horizon its only blemish remains his own 
               pickup

               he jogs the few remaining paces to the pickup he sets down 
               the gallon jug softly

                                     moss
                         hello

               no answer

               he opens the door

               the mans body is still held upright by the shoulder harness 
               but his head flayed by buckshot is tipped away

               moss glances at the bed of the truck

               empty

               he again looks at the horizon

               now another pickup stands in silhouette next to his own  
               two men are there

               moss covers behind the dead mans truck he eases his head 
               out for another look

               only one man visible now

               sounds hard to identify something airy up on the crest his 
               pickup rocks and settles its tires are being slashed 

               the other pickups engine coughs to life headlights and 
               roof lights go on

               moss again covers behind the vehicle

               a searchspot sweeps back and forth across the basin tableau 
               of bodies and trucks after a few trips back and forth 
               something happens to the spot its weaving light begins to 
               bounce we can hear the jouncing suspension of the pickup as 
               it trundles down the incline

               but the light tells the perspective of the slowly approaching 
               truck moss stays in the lee of his sheltering vehicle as he 
               runs doubled over directly away from the light keeping to 
               the shadow that wipes on and off

               a gunshot its impact kicks up dirt just ahead of moss to 
               his right

               moss turns to see

               two jogging men flanking the truck like infantry escorting a 
               tank one has just halted to fire the other is now raising 
               his gun

               moss tacks and sprints and rolls under a second abandoned 
               pickup to his left another shot sounds and misses

               bullets plunk into the metal of the truck body one bullet 
               skips off the dirt in front of the truck and pings up into 
               the undercarriage

               moss is elbowing out the far side next to a body lying by 
               the trucks passenger door

               the firing has stopped moss steals a look over the hood 

               the pursuing pickup is slowing so that the two gunmen can 
               swing onto the running boards

               the truck accelerates and as it veers around the first 
               abandoned pickup its lights swing off mosss cover truck

               moss sprints off doubled over at a perpendicular to his 
               previous path he hits the ground pressing himself into the 
               earth head between his forearms

               he elbows away as the truck bears on his former cover

               ext river gorge  dawn

               he tops the small rise and straightens and flatout runs  
               we hear the pickups engine racing and see behind moss its 
               spot sweeping backlight across the crest

               moss is running towards the declivity of a river gorge sky 
               there is pink from unrisen sun

               moss bears on the gorge panting

               the pickup bounces up into view on the crest behind him 
               roof lights blazing it is pointed off at an angle its 
               spotlight sweeps the river plain

               it finds moss the truck reorients as it bounces down in 
               pursuit a muzzle flash precedes the dull whump of the 
               shotgun

               moss races on toward the river another shotgun whump     
               moss stumbles turns to look behind him

               the truck gaining ground a man stands up out of the sunroof 
               one hand on top of the cab the other holding a shotgun

               moss is almost to the steep riverbank another whump of the 
               shotgun

               shot catches moss on the right shoulder it tears the back 
               of his shirt away and sends him over the crest of the river 
               bank

               moss airborne ass over elbows hits near the bottom of the 
               sandy slope with a loud fhump

               he rolls to a stop and looks up

               we hear a skidding squeal and see dirt and dust float over 
               the lip of the ridge thrown by the trucks hard stop

               as moss pulls off his boots we hear voices from the men in 
               the truck

               there is the clank of its tailgate being dropped and sounds 
               of activity on the hollow metal of its bed

               moss tucks his boots into his belt and runs splashing into 
               the fastmoving water a look back

               something shakes the scrub down the steep slope

               moss backpedals deeper

               bursting out of the scrub at the foot of the slope a huge 
               black dog with a large head and clipped ears it bounds toward 
               moss

               moss turns and half stumbles half dives into the river 
               underwater a very dull whump followed by the fizz of buckshot

               moss breaks the surface of the water gasping and looks 
               back

               figures on the ridge below the dog hitting the water 

               another gunshot from the bank where it hits we dont know 
               river current and mosss strokes speed him away

               he sweeps around a bend he finds his feet under him and 
               staggers onto a sandbar and then splashes through some outwash 
               to the far bank

               the pursuing dogs head bobs rhythmically in the water

               moss pulls the gun from his belt he takes the clip out and 
               ejects the chamber round

               the dog finds his stumpy legs much closer to the sandbar 
               his massive head dips and waggles as he lurches out of his 
               swim he emerges from the river and bounds across the sand 

               moss shakes the gun and blows into the barrel

               the dog splashes through the riverwash that separates him 
               from the human

               moss reinserts the clip he chambers a round as the dog runs 
               snarling and as the dog leaps he fires

               moss fires twice more quickly not waiting to see whether 
               the first round told

               the dog lands stopped but not dead it jerks and gurgles

               neck craned round and his back upper arm twisted toward him

               he meticulously picks shirt fiber out from where buckshot 
               packed it into the flesh

               he finishes he rips swatches from his shirt he starts

               pavement

               rushing under the lens lit by headlights

               from high up we see a throughway interchange as chigurhs 
               ramcharger takes the right fork of the highway under a green 
               sign for del rio

               transponder powered on but silent next to it is a machine 
               pistol with a canshaped silencer sweated onto the barrel 

               the transponder beeps once

               chigurh looks up we are approaching a steel bridge the 
               headlights pick up a large black bird perched on the aluminum 
               bridge rail

               the passenger window hums down

               chigurh picks up the pistol and levels the barrel across the 
               window frame

               the truck bumps onto the bridge its tires skipping over the 
               seams in the asphalt as it draws even the bird spreads its 
               wings and chigurh firesa muted thump like a whoosh of air 

               from high overhead the bullet hits the guardrail making it 
               hum as the ramcharger recedes and the bird lifts into the 
               darkness heavily flapping its wings

               moss snips the last of the wire hangers hooks off with the 
               sidecutter he wraps the three hooks with duct tape to make 
               a sturdier one

               he wraps more tape to attach this hook to the end of the

               from a bag he withdraws a twelvegauge automatic shotgun 
               fitted with a silencer big around as a beer can

               pick up the juryrigged pole leaning nearby he straightens 
               and feeds the length of the pole into the duct using the 
               joints to angle it in

               inside the duct he watches the pole play in illuminated by

               peering along the airduct both hands up next to one ear 
               awkwardly maneuvering the pole

               he lays the far hooked end over the protruding corner of 
               the document case he pulls

               the pole slides off the case

               against it

               he steps back

               he punches out the lock cylinder with the airgun and kicks 
               in the door raising the shotgun

               a mexican in a guyabera reclines on one of the two double 
               beds

               he is scrabbling for a machine pistol on the nightstand 

               chigurh fires three times quickly the damped blasts have 
               the low resonance of chugs into a bottle

               also frozen back against the wall outside the room to one 
               side of the open door

               after a beat he steps back into the open doorway leveling 
               the gun

               inside the room no movement much of the man on the bed is 
               spattered against the chewedup headboard

               the bathroom door is ajar its light on

               a long beat

               movement in the wedge of light

               immediately chugs from the shotgun chew up bathroom door 
               and nearby wallboard

               a cry from inside a brief chatter of machine pistol

               int motel duct  night

               along the air vent

               the machinepistol chatter crosses the cut

               we hear bullets snap through metal the sound brings on 
               indirect light as holes are punched in the duct somewhere 
               around the bend

               moss holds still as the galvanized metal faintly thunders 
               the flashlight resting on it wobbles

               he advances into the room gun pointing at the bathroom door 
               as he advances he swings the gun briefly over at the closet 
               door and fires the splinteredin door reveals no occupant 

               chigurh angles around the double bed to get a view of that 
               wedge of bathroom floor visible through its door blood is 
               pooling out from the right

               chigurh fires at the baseboard to the right of the door

               int motel duct  night

               moss makes another attempt to hook the bag the hook takes 

               moss drags the case inches out into the ducts bend before 
               the hook slides off again

               int 1st motel room bathroom  night

               chigurh

               he uses the shotgun barrel to push open whats left of the 
               bathroom door

               the mirror over the facing sink gives a view of most of the 
               hidden side of the bedroom bathroom party wall partial 
               view of a man pressed against the wall standing in the tub 
               in the corner from his posture and the one visible hand he 
               seems unarmed

               chigurh enters the bathroom

               the cornered man is unhurt but terrified  he holds up his 
               hands

                                     man
                         no me mate

               the man on the floor is quite dead a machine pistol lies in 
               one outflung hand 

               chigurh looks back up at the survivor

                                     chigurh
                         howd you find it

               chigurh walks unhurriedly to the tub the man watches him 
               hands up vibrating

               chigurh reaches with his free hand and pulls the shower 
               curtain most of the way round hiding the man he angles the 
               nose of the shotgun in and fires

               moss

               the hook again snags a strap on the case moss pulls 
               carefully

               chigurh emerges from the bathroom his socks are sodden with 
               gore he sits on the bed and peels them off he rubs the 
               bottom of each foot with the ankle of each sock and drops 
               the socks to the floor 

               he rises and opens three bureau drawers which are empty 
               and leaves them open

               he pulls open what remains of the closet door empty

               he looks under the bed

               he stands looks around

               he looks up his look lingers

               close on the airduct grille it is dusty rubmarks have 
               made four dark bands across the dusty slats chigurhs fingers 
               rise into frame and meet the grille roughly aligning with 
               the finger marks in the dust

               close on a screwhead a dime enters and engages the screw 
               and starts turning it

               from inside the duct fingers reach through the grille and 
               chigurhs hand pushes it up into the duct then angles it 
               and withdraws it faintly under the distant airy drone of 
               the compressor we hear the grate clatter to the floor

               the back of chigurhs head appears he aims a flashlight 
               away down the far length of the duct a beat

               in the room chigurh steps down from the chair and pulls the 
               receiver from his pocket and turns it on

               it beeps once

               silence

               frowning looking down at the receiver chigurh makes a slow 
               sweep with it the silence holdssnapped off by car steady 
               as we cut to

               desk

                                     moss

                         police just call me if anyone else 
                         checks in tonight

               int secondfloor hallway  night

               moss is mounting the stairs from the lobby the carpeted 
               hallway is lined by transomtopped doors moss goes to a 
               door halfway down on his left

               int hotel room  night

               moss enters a room with old oak furniture and high ceilings 
               he sets the document case next to the bed

               he unzips the duffel and takes out the shotgun which he lays 
               on the bed and then goes to the window he parts the curtain 
               to look down

               the street is empty mexican music floats up faintly from a 
               bar somewhere not far away

               int hotel room  later

               the room is dark the music is gone

               we are looking straight down on moss lying clothed on the 
               bed we are booming straight down toward him

               after a beat he shakes his head  he opens his eyes 
               grimacing

                                     moss
                         there just aint no way

               he sits up and turns on the bedside lamp

               the shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed 
               moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it 
               and upends the money onto the bed he feels the bottom of 
               the case squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand 
               out looking for a false bottom he eyeballs the case turning 
               it over and around

               he starts riffling money packets

               he finds one that binds it has hundreds on the outside but 
               ones inside with the centers cut out in the hollow is a 
               sending unit the size of a zippo lighter

               he holds the sender staring at it

               a long beat

               from somewhere a dull chug the sound is hard to reada 
               compressor going on a door thud maybe something else

               the sound has brought mosss look up he sits listening no 
               further sound

               moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed he 
               dials 0

               we hear ringing filtered through the handset also faintly 
               offset we hear the ring direct from downstairs

               after five rings moss cradles the phone

               he goes to the door reaches for the knob but hesitates

               he gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack 
               under the door

               an open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear

               moss rises and turns to the bed he piles money back into 
               the document case but freezes suddenlyfor no reason we can 
               see

               a long beat on his motionless back we gradually become aware 
               of a faint highfrequency beeping barely audible its source 
               is indeterminate

               moss clasps the document case picks up his shotgun and eases 
               himself to a sitting position on the bed facing the door 

               he looks at the line of light under it

               the beeps approach though still not loud a long wait

               at length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below 
               the door it lingers there the beepingstops

               a beat now the soft shadow becomes more focused it resolves 
               into two columns of dark feet planted before the door

               moss raises his shotgun toward the door

               a long beat

               moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens 
               on the trigger

               the shadow moves unhurriedly rightward the band of light 
               beneath the door is once again unshadowed

               quiet moss stares

               the band of light under the door

               moss stares

               silently the light goes out

               something for moss to think about he stares

               the hallway behind the door is now dark the door is defined 
               only from his side by streetlightspill through the window 

               moss stares he shifts starts to rise doesnt a beat

               a report  not a gunshot but a stamping sound followed by 
               a pneumatic hiss

               it brings a dull impact and moss recoils hit

               he winces feeling his chest

               the door is shuddering creakily in

               it is all strange moss gropes in his lap and picks something 
               up the lock cylinder

               the creaking door comes to rest ajar

               moss fires the shotgun blast roars in the confined space 
               and for an instant turns the room orange the chewedup door 
               wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again 
               moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case

               from outside his window

               moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his 
               back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case 
               he swings the document case out and drops it

               the bracketing for the hotels sign gives moss a handhold 
               he grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open moss 
               swings down as with a muted thump orange muzzleflash strobes 
               the room

               moss drops

               ext hotel eagle sidewalk  night

               moss lands and grabs the document case and straightens he 
               is at the hotel entrance standing in the light coming through 
               the etched glass of the double doors

               he looks at his own shadow thrown onto the street he plunges 
               through the doors into the lobby as a gun thumps and crackling 
               shot chews the sidewalk

               int lobby  night

               moss hurries across the lobby a glance to one side

               a booted foot sticks out from behind the front desk

               moss slows approaching the stairway he risks a look around 
               the stairway wall

               ascending balusters fade off into the blackness of the second
               story hallway

               moss sags he looks back across the lobby at the front door 

               he unhitches his shotgun he remains still for a moment 
               holding the shotgun back against the protected side of the 
               wall

               he quickly swings out and with shotgun aimed up the stairs 
               he crosses to the back lobby

               he quietly pushes open the back door

               ext service alley  night

               outside

               moss emerges into a shallow service alley dark and dirty 

               he is at a run when we hear soft tock and a garbage can in 
               front of him snaps and wobbles

               he turns looking up backpedaling another tock accompanies 
               a muzzleflash in a dark secondstory window

               moss fires his shotgun loud chips fly off the brickface 
               and the window shatters

               moss rounds the alley corner he stops and squats

               ext downtown eagle pass street  night

               wide dark deserted downtown eagle pass moss a lone figure 
               resting at a corner

               close on moss panting he takes stock painfully feeling at 
               his upper chest where the lock hit then touching gingerly 
               at his side beneath the ribs newly bloody he sighs

               he listens no noise he gets to his feet with the document 
               case in one hand and shotgun in the other he waits a beat 
               back against the wall

               he swings out and fires the shotgun into the alley and then 
               spins back and runs a short block and rounds the next corner 
               and stops to rest

               ext eagle pass street  night

               he waits for his breath to slow he brings up the shotgun 
               and readies himself

               he swings out to look back around the corner

               the street is empty

               he waits at the ready for whatever might emerge from the 
               alley mouth a short block away

               long beat stillness

               a panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging 
               back around the man could round the block the other way 

               empty street

               two empty streets moss doesnt know which way to cover 
               which way to go

               he stands looking each way trying to devise a plan no basis 
               for a plan

               quiet hesitation

               now a sound engine noise

               an old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up it rattles toward 
               him

               moss lowers the shotgun he keeps it to the hidden side of 
               his body

               the pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light 

               it comes on through the intersection 

               moss strides out into the street he swings the shotgun up 
               and gives the driver a raised palm to halt

               int pickupext eagle pass street  night

               the truck stops and moss opens the passenger door and swings 
               the case in and climbs in after

               the driver an older man gapes at him frightened

                                     moss
                         im not going to hurt you i need 
                         you to 

               the windshield stars

               a quick second round pushes part of the windshield in

               rounds come in without pause cracking sheet metal blowing 
               the cabs rear window into the truckbed twisting the rear
               view

               a round seems to have caught the driver in the throat a 
               gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe blowing out 
               blood

               moss quicker to react has already ducked below the dash

               a snap of the drivers head and a new freshet of blood from 
               a shot to the head the screams turn to low gurgles

               moss jammed almost in to the drivers lap frantically gropes 
               for the shift

               he throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator 
               driving blind as bullets continue to pour in

               he raises his head enough to see his sideview it shows

               a tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it the drivers 
               body swaying in its restraint

               the passenger side window shatters we are passing the gunman 

               now moss sits up to steer looking out front behind him 
               through the shotout back window the dark street is suddenly 
               punctured by muzzleflash it comes for the first time with 
               a report the low chug of the muted shotgun

               rattle of shot against sheet metal

               moss floors the gas to roar into a turn the street sweeping 
               out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash

               the pickup bounces but moss sitting fully up can now steer

               he goes half the length of the block and then yanks the wheel 
               hard braking the pickup smashes a parked car and jacks 
               around to a halt

               moss emerges from the pickup with his shotgun and goes to 
               the sidewalk and backtracks he covers behind a parked car 

               he sits leaning back against the car waiting

               a gritty boot turn at the corner the footsteps come closer 
               still

               they pass and recede toward the pickup

               we cut to chigurh approaching the pickup shotgun held at 
               ease across his body

               he slows

               moss he hears the slowing steps  he tightens his grip on 
               his shotgun and tenses

               chigurh slowing further he sees

               bloody boot prints outside the passenger door

               moss rises

               he dives as behind him moss fires

               head anything under the cars 

               he fires twice buckshot claws up the pavement and the car 
               bodies and tires and the cars sink hissing to their rims

               moss crosses to the far curb still advancing no one behind 
               the cars

               he looks up and down the street

               nothing to see

               he goes to the pickup truck drivers side he opens the 
               door and reaches over the drivers corpse for his lap belt

               briefly blurps his siren to pull it over he parks on the 
               shoulder in front of the truck and then walks back to the 
               driver who watches his approach chewing gum with blithe 
               unconcern

               bell whips the tarp back to expose eight corpses wrapped 
               blue sheeting bound with tape

                                     bell

               sheriff bell pulls the tarp down and ties it the driver

               late day

               carson wells grabs a light pole stanchion to hoist himself 
               onto the guardrail he stands atop it eyeing the chainlink 
               fence across the walkway 

               he climbs down and crosses to the fence and looks down

               the brown sluggish water of the rio grande

               looking down the walkway

               carson wells enters frame and recedes down the walkway  
               when he draws even with the next stanchion he looks down 
               through the fence

               cane on the riverbank and one gnarled tree

               int hotel eagle lobby  night

               int stairway  night

               carson wells appears around the corner and we pull him as he 
               mounts the stairs  when he is about halfway up a figure  
               focus does not hold him  rounds the corner behind and 
               silently follows holding a fatbarreled shotgun loosely at 
               his side

               after a few steps carson wells stops frowning cued by we 
               dont know what focus drops back as he turns chigurh raises 
               the shotgun

                                     chigurh

               the low chug of the shotgun

               aside from his finger on the trigger chigurh hasnt moved 
               he sits staring at wellss remains for a beat

               now his look swings onto the phone he watches it ring twice 
               more

               he picks it up and listens without speaking

               after a beat

               adjusts to sit back and raise his boots onto the bed

               on the floor where his feet were blood is pooling out from

               desk very slowly as if to advertise that he is not a threat 

               chigurh ignores him and rounds the desk to look at the man 
               gurgling on the floor

               after a beat still looking down at the man he has shot

                         right back in the next and shoots a 
                         retired army colonel

               they have reached sheriff bells cruiser and he sits in 

                                     bell
                         hard to believe

                         couldnt help your boy

               he is walking away

               sheriff bell sits thinking in the cruiser he makes no move 
               for the ignition 

               a long beat

               ext motel

               now very late empty of onlookers and emergency vehicles 

               sheriff bells cruiser pulls up just inside the courtyard 
               he cuts his engine

               sheriff bell sits looking at the motel

               very quiet after a long beat he gets out of the car he 
               pushes its door shut quietly with two hands

               he looks up the veranda

               the one door most of the way up has yellow tape across it 
               its loose ends wave in a light breeze

               sheriff bell looks up the street

               nothing much to attract his attention

               ext motel veranda

               sheriff bell steps up onto the veranda he takes slow quiet 
               steps

               we intercut his pointofview nearing the door marked by 
               police tape

               as he draws close to the door he slows

               the yellow tape is about chest high above it is the lock 
               cylinder  it has been punched hollow

               sheriff bell stands staring at the lock

               very quiet the chick chick of the tapeends against the 
               door frame

               still

               int motel room

               inside

               chigurh is still also just on the other side of the door 
               he stands holding his shotgun

               from inside the tap of the breezeblown tape is dulled but 
               perceptible it counts out beats

               chigurh is also looking at the lock cylinder

               the curved brass of its hollow interior holds a reflection 
               of the motel room exterior lights and shapes the curvature 
               distorts to unrecognizability what is reflected but we see 
               the color of sheriff bells uniform

               the reflection is very still then slow movement

               outside

               sheriff bell finishes bringing his hand to his holstered 
               gun it rests there

               still once again

               his pointofview of the lock the reflection from here 
               darker is hard to read

               inside

               chigurh still

               outside

               sheriff bell his hand on his holstered gun a long beat 

               his hand drops

               he extends one booted toe he nudges the door inward

               as the lock cylinder slowly recedes reflected shapes scramble 
               inside it and slide up its curve before the door is fully 
               open we cut around

               from inside

               the door finishes creaking open sheriff bell is a silhouette 
               in the doorway 

               a still beat

               at length sheriff bell ducks under the chesthigh police 
               tape to enter

               the worn carpet has a large dark stain that glistens near 
               the door sheriff bell steps over it advancing slowly the 
               room is dimly lit shapes

               there is a bathroom door in the depth of the room sheriff 
               bell advances toward it he stops in front of it

               he toes the door it creaks slowly open

               int motel bathroom

               the bathroom with no spill light from outside is pitch 
               black

               sheriff bell reaches slowly up with one hand he gropes at 
               the inside wall

               the light goes on bright white tile sheriff bell squints  
               a beat

               he takes a step in

               he looks at the small window

               he looks at the windows swivelcatch locked

               int main room

               sheriff bell emerges from the bathroom he sits heavily onto 
               the bed

               he looks around not for anything in particular his look 
               catches on something low just in front of him

               a ventilation duct near the baseboard its opening is exposed 
               its grille lies on the floor before it

               sheriff bell stares

               at length he leans forward he nudges the grille aside on 
               the floor a couple of screws a coin

               ext west texas cabin  day

               a cat

               licking itself on a plank floor stiffened leg pointing out 

               it suddenly stops and looks up ears perked

               a frozen beat and then it bolts

               the camera booms up to frame the barren west texas landscape 
               outside the window of this isolated cabin a pickup truck is 
               approaching trailing dust the cat reenters frame outside 
               running across the rutted gravel in front of the house as 
               the pickup slows

                         its peculiar im older nown he 
                         ever was by twenty years so in a 
                         sense hes the younger man anyway 
                         first one i dont remember so well 
                         but it was about meetin him in town 
                         somewheres and he give me some money 
                         and i think i lost it the second 
                         one it was like we was both back in 
                         older times and i was on horseback 
                         goin through the mountains of a 
                         night

               ext snowy mountain pass  night

               we cut to night and snow it is the image that the movie 
               began with continuing in voice over

                                     voice over
                         goin through this pass in the 
                         mountains it was cold and snowin 
                         hard ridin hard country he rode 
                         past me and kept on goin never 
                         said nothin goin by he just rode 
                         on past and he had his blanket wrapped 
                         around him and his head down

               the rider passes as described horses hooves drumming and 
               scattering divots of earth and snow

                                     voice over
                         and when he rode past i seen he 
                         was carryin fire in a horn the way 
                         people used to do and i could see 
                         the horn from the light inside of 
                         it about the color of the moon and 
                         in the dream i knew that he was goin 
                         on ahead and that he was fixin to 
                         make a fire somewhere out there in 
                         all that dark and all that cold and 
                         i knew that whenever i got there he 
                         would be there out there up ahead

               the rider recedes and the image fades the horn bearing fire 
               going last

                                         the end
