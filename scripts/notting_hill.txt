				william vo
		so this is where i spend my days 
		and years  in this small village in
		the middle of a city  in a house 
		with a blue door that my wife and i
		bought together before she left
		me for a man who looked like harrison 
		ford only even handsomer

	we arrive outside his bluedoored house just off portobello

				william vo
		 and where i now lead a strange 
		halflife with a lodger called

	int williams house  day

				william
		spike

	the house has far too many things in it  definitely two
	bachelor flat

	spike appears  an unusual looking fellow  he has unusual 
	hair unusual facial hair and an unusual welsh accent very 
	white as though his flesh has never seen the sun  he wears 
	only shorts

				spike
		even he  hey you couldnt help me
		with an incredibly important 
		decision could you

				william
		this is important in comparison to
		lets say whether they should 
		cancel third world debt

				spike
		thats right  im at last going out
		on a date with the great janine and i 
		just want to be sure ive picked the 
		right tshirt

				william
		what are the choices

				spike
		well wait for it
			he pulls on a tshirt
		first theres this one

	the tshirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien 
	coming out of it jaws open blood everywhere  it says i love
	blood

				william
		yes  might make it hard to strike a
		really romantic note

				spike
		point taken

	he heads back up the stairs talks as he changes

				spike
		i suspect youll prefer the next one

	and he reenters in a white tshirt with a large arrow 
	pointing down to his flies saying get it here
	
				spike
		cool huh

				william
		yes  she might think you dont have
		true love on your mind

				spike
		wouldnt want that
			and back up he goes
		okay  just one more

	he comes down wearing it  lots of hearts saying youre the 
	most beautiful woman in the world

				william
		well yes thats perfect well 
		done

				spike
		thanks  great  wish me luck

				william
		good luck

	spike turns and walks upstairs proudly  revealing that on the 
	back of the tshirt also printed in big letters is written 
	fancy a fuck

	ext portobello road  day

				william vo
		and so it was just another hopeless
		wednesday as i set off through the
		market to work little suspecting 
		that this was the day which would 
		change my life forever  this is 
		work by the way my little travel
		book shop

	a small unpretentious store named the travel book co

				william vo
		 which well sells travel books
		 and to be frank with you doesnt
		always sell many of those

	william enters

	int the bookshop  day

	it is a small shop slightly chaotic bookshelves everywhere 
	with little secret bits round corners with even more books 
	martin williams sole employee is waiting enthusiastically 
	he is very keen an uncrushable optimist  perhaps without 
	cause  a few seconds later william stands gloomily behind the 
	desk

				william
		classic  absolutely classic  
		profit from major sales push  minus 
		347

				martin
		shall i go get a cappuccino  ease the
		pain

				william
		yes better get me a half  all i can
		afford

				marin
		i get your logic  demicapu coming up

	he salutes and bolts out the door  as he does a woman walks in 
	we only just glimpse her
	
	cut to william working  he looks up casually  and sees 
	something  his reaction is hard to read  after a pause

				william
		can i help you

	it is anna scott the biggest movie star in the world  here 
	in his shop  the most divine subtle beautiful woman on earth
	when she speaks she is very selfassured and selfcontained

				anna
		no thanks  ill just look around

				william
		fine

	she wanders over to a shelf as he watches her  and picks out a
	quite smart coffee table book

				william
		that books really not good  just
		in case you know browsing turned to
		buying  youd be wasting your money

				anna
		really

				william
		yes  this one though is very 
		good

	he picks up a book on the counter

				william
		i think the man who wrote it has 
		actually been to turkey which helps
		theres also a very amusing incident
		with a kebab

				anna
		thanks  ill think about it

	william suddenly spies something odd on the small tv monitor
	beside him

				william
		if you could just give me a second

	her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and 
	approaches a man in slightly illfitting clothes

				william
		excuse me

				thief
		yes

				william
		bad news

				thief
		what

				william
		weve got a security camera in this
		bit of the shop

				thief
		so

				william
		so i saw you put that book down your
		trousers

				thief
		what book

				william
		the one down your trousers

				thief
		i havent got a book down my trousers

				william
		right  well then we have something 
		of an impasse  i tell you what  
		ill call the police  and	what can 
		i say  if im wrong about the whole 
		bookdownthetrousers scenario i 
		really apologize

				thief
		okay  what if i did have a book down
		my trousers

				william
		well ideally when i went back to
		the desk youd remove the cadogan 
		guide to bali from your trousers and
		either wipe it and put it back or 
		buy it  see you in a sec

	he returns to his desk  in the monitor we just glimpse as does 
	william the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
	shelves  the thief drifts out towards the door  anna who has 
	observed all this is looking at a blue book on the counter

				william
		sorry about that

				anna
		no thats fine  i was going to 
		steal one myself but now ive changed
		my mind  signed by the author i see

				william
		yes we couldnt stop him  if you 
		can find an unsigned copy its 
		worth an absolute fortune

	she smiles  suddenly the thief is there

				thief
		excuse me

				anna
		yes

				thief
		can i have your autograph

				anna
		whats your name

				thief
		rufus

	she signs his scruffy piece of paper  he tries to read it

				thief
		what does it say

				anna
		well thats the signature  and
		above it says dear rufus  you
		belong in jail

				thief
		nice one  would you like my phone
		number

				anna
		tempting but no thank you

	thief leaves

				anna
		i think i will try this one

	she hands william a 20 note and the book he said was rubbish
	he talks as he handles the transaction

				william
		oh  right  on second thoughts 
		maybe it wasnt that bad  actually
		 its a sort of masterpiece really
		none of those childish kebab 
		stories you get in so many travel
		books these days  and ill throw in
		one of these for free

	he drops in one of the signed books

				william
		very useful for lighting fires 
		wrapping fish that sort of things

	she looks at him with a slight smile

				anna
		thanks

	and leaves  shes out of his life forever  william is a little 
	dazed  seconds later martin comes back in

				martin
		cappuccino as ordered

				william
		thanks  i dont think youll believe
		who was just in here

				martin
		who  someone famous

	but williams innate natural english discretion takes over

				william
		no noone  noone

	they set about drinking their coffees

				martin
		would be exciting if someone famous
		did come into the shop though 
		wouldnt it  do you know  this is
		pretty incredible actually  i once
		saw ringo starr  or at least i think
		it was ringo  it might have been 
		that broke from fiddler on the roof
		toppy

				william
		topol

				martin
		thats right  topol

				william
		but ringo starr doesnt look 
		anything like topol

				martin
		no well he was quite a long way
		away

				william
		so it could have been neither of them

				martin
		i suppose so

				william
		right  its not a classic anecdotes
		is it

				martin
		not classic no

	martin shakes his head  william drains his cappuccino


				william
		right  want another one

				martin
		yes  no wait  lets go crazy  
		ill have an orange juice

	ext portobello road  day

	william sets off

	int coffee shop  day

	william collects his juice in a coffee shop on westbourne park 
	road

	ext portobello road  day

	william swings out of the little shop  he turns the corner of 
	portobello road and bumps straight into anna  the orange 
	juice 	in its foam cup flies  it soaks anna

				anna
		oh jesus

				william
		here let me help

	he grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off  getting 
	far too near her breasts in the panic of it

				anna
		what are you doing

	he jumps back

				william
		nothing nothing look i live just
		over the street  you could get 
		cleaned up

				anna
		no thank you  i need to get my car 
		back

				william
		i also have a phone  im confident
		that in five minutes we can have you
		spick and span and back on the street
		again in the nonprostitute sense
		obviously

	in his diffident way he is confident despite her being 
	genuinely annoyed  she turns and looks at him

				anna
		okay  so what does just over the 
		street mean  give it to me in yards

				william
		eighteen yards  thats my house 
		there

	he doesnt lie  it is eighteen yards away  she looks down 
	she looks up at him

	int williams house  corridor  day

	they enter  she carries a few stylish bags

				william
		come on in  ill just

	william runs in further  its a mess  he kicks some old shoes 
	under the stairs bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of 
	breakfast in a cupboard  she enters the kitchen

				william
		its not that tidy i fear

	and he guides her up the stairs after taking the bag of books
	from her

				william
		the bathroom is right at the top of 
		the stairs and theres a phone on the
		desk up there

	she heads upstairs

	int kitchen  day

	william is tidying up frantically  then he hears annas feet on 
	the stairs  she walks down wearing a short sparkling black 
	top beneath her leather jacket  with her trainers still on  he 
	is dazzled by the sight of her

				william
		would you like a cup of tea before 
		you go

				anna
		no thanks

				william
		coffee

				anna
		no

				william
		orange juice  probably not

	he moves to his very empty fridge  and offers its only contents

				william
		something else cold  coke water
		some disgusting sugary drink 
		pretending to have something to do
		with fruits of the forest

				anna
		really no

				william
		would you like something to nibble 
		apricots soaked in honey  quite 
		why no one knows  because it stops
		them tasting of apricots and makes 
		them taste like honey and if you 
		wanted honey youd just buy honey 
		instead of apricots but nevertheless
		 there we go  yours if you want
		them

				anna
		no

				william
		do you always say no to everything

	pause  she looks at him deep

				anna
		no
			pause
		i better be going  thanks for your 
		help

				william
		youre welcome and may i also say
		heavenly

	it has taken a lot to get this out loud  he is not a smooth
	talking man

				william
		take my one chance to say it  after
		youve read that terrible book 
		youre certainly not going to be 
		coming back to the shop

	she smiles  shes cool

				anna
		thank you

				william
		yes  well  my pleasure

	he guides her towards the door

				william
		nice to meet you  surreal but nice

	in a slightly awkward moment he shows her out the door  he
	closes the door and shakes his head in wonder  then

				william
		surreal but nice  what was i 
		thinking

	 he  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along 
	the corridor in silence  theres a knock on the door  he moves 
	back casually

				william
		coming

	he opens the door  its her

				william
		oh hi  forget something

				anna
		i forgot my bag

				william
		oh right

	he shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping 
	bag  then returns and hands it to her

				william
		here we go

				anna
		thanks  well

	they stand in that corridor  in that small space  second time 
	saying goodbye  a strange feeling of intimacy  she leans 
	forward and she kisses him  total silence  a real sense of the 
	strangeness of those lips those famous lips on his  they part

				william
		i apologize for the surreal but nice
		comment  disaster

				anna
		dont worry about it  i thought the 
		apricot and honey business was the 
		real lowpoint

	suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock

				william
		oh my god  my flatmate  im sorry 
		theres no excuse for him

	spike walks in

				spike
		hi

				anna
		hi

				william
		hi

	spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen

				spike
		im just going to go into the kitchen
		to get some food  and then im going
		to tell you a story that will make your
		balls shrink to the size of raisins

	and leaves them in the corridor

				anna
		probably best not tell anyone about
		this

				william
		right  no one  i mean ill tell 
		myself sometimes but dont worry
		 i wont believe it

				anna
		bye

	and she leaves with just a touch of williams hand  spike 
	comes out of the kitchen eating something white out of a 		
	styrofoam container with a spoon

				spike
		theres something wrong with this
		yogurt

				william
		its not yogurt  its mayonnaise

				spike
		well there you go
			takes another big spoonful
		on for a video fest tonight  ive
		got some absolute classic

	int williams living room  night

	the lights are off  william and spike on the couch just the 
	light from the tv playing on their faces  cut to the tv full 
	screen  there is anna  she is in a stylish woody allen type 
	modern romantic comedy gramercy park in black and white

	int manhattan art gallery  day

	annas character  woody anna  is walking around the gallery 
	with her famous costar michael  they should be the perfect 
	couple but there is tension  anna is not happy

				michael
		smile

				anna
		no

				michael
		smile

				anna
		ive got nothing to smile about

				michael
		okay in about 7 seconds im going to
		ask you to marry me

	and after a couple of seconds  wow  she smiles

	int williams living room  night

				spike
		imagine  somewhere in the world 
		theres a man whos allowed to kiss 
		her

				william
		yes she is fairly fabulous

	int bookshop  day

	the next day  william and martin quietly coexisting  an annoy 
	ing customer enters  mr smith

				mr smith
		do you have any books by dickens

				william
		no were a travel bookshop  we only
		sell travel books

				mr smith
		oh right  how about that new john
		grisham thriller

				william
		no thats a novel too

				mr smith
		oh right  have you got a copy of 
		winnie the pooh

	pause

				william
		martin  your customer

				martin
		can i help you

	william looks up  at that moment the entire window is suddenly 
	taken up by the huge side of a bus obscuring the light  and 
	entirely covered with a portrait of anna  from her new film
	helix

	int williams house  condorliving room  day

	william heads upstairs and pauses  spike coming down wearing 
	full body scuba diving gear

				spike
		hey

				william
		hi

	int williams kitchen  day

	the two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen

				william
		just incidentally  why are you 
		wearing that

				spike
		ahm  combination of factors really
		no clean clothes

				william
		there never will be you know unless
		you actually clean your clothes

				spike
		right  vicious circle  and then i was
		like rooting around in your things
		and found this and i thought  cool 
		kind of spacey

	ext williams terrace  day

	the two of them on the rooftop terrace passing the day 
	william is reading the bookseller  the terrace is small and 
	the plants arent great  but it overlooks london in a rather 
	wonderful way  spike still in scuba gear goggles on

				spike
		theres something wrong with the 
		goggles though

				william
		no they were prescription so i could
		see all the fishes properly

				spike
		groovy  you should do more of this
		stuff

				william
		so  any messages

				spike
		yeh i wrote a couple down

				william
		two  thats it

				spike
		you want me to write down all your 
		messages

	william closes his eyes in exasperation

				william
		who were the ones you didnt write
		down from

				spike
		ahm lets see  ahm  no  gone 
		completely  oh no wait  there was 
		one from your mum she said dont 
		forget lunch and her legs hurting 
		again

				william
		right  no one else

				spike
		absolutely not

	spike leans back and relaxes

				spike
		though if were going for this 
		obsessive writingdownallmessages
		thing  some american girl called 
		anna called a few days ago

	william freezes  then looks at spike

				william
		what did she say

				spike
		well it was genuinely bizarre 
		she said hi  its anna  and then 
		she said call me at the ritz  and 
		then gave herself a completely 
		different name

				william
		which was

				spike
		absolutely no idea  remembering one 
		names bad enough

	int williams living room  day

	william on the phone  we hear the formal man at the other end of 
	the phone  and then intercut with him

				william
		hello

				ritz man vo
		may i help you sir

				william
		ahm look this is a very odd 
		situation  im a friend of anna 
		scotts  and she rang me at home the
		day before yesterday  and left a
		message saying shes staying with 
		you

	int ritz reception  day

				ritz man
		im sorry we dont have anyone of 
		that name here sir

				william
		no thats right  i know that  she
		said shes using another name  but
		the problem is she left the message
		with my flatmate which was a serious
		mistake

	int williams living room

				william contd
		imagine if you will the stupidest
		person youve ever met  are you
		doing that

	spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot  hes read
	ing a newspaper

	ext ritz  day

	william jumps off a bus and walks toward the ritz  he carries a 
	small bunch of roses

	int ritz hotel  day

	he approaches the lifts  at the lift he pushes the button and 
	the doors open  as he is getting in william is joined by a young 
	man  his name is tarquin

				william

	william pushes the button  they wait for the doors to close

	int ritz corridor  day

	the lift lands  william gets out  so does tarquin  rooms 
	3035 are to the left  3539 to the right  william heads right
	so does tarquin

	does tarquin  william spots so does tarquin  william points 
	at the number

				william

				tarquin
		yes

				william

	with the poster picture of anna for the film helix

	are a number of journalists waiting for their audience

				karen

				tarquin
		marvellous  close encounters

	william goes for the coverup

				william
		no  theyre for my grandmother
		shes in a hospital nearby  thought
		id kill two birds with one stone

				tarquin
		im sorry  which hospital

	pause  hes in trouble

				william
		do you mind me not saying  its a
		rather distressing disease and the 
		name of the hospital rather gives it
		away

				tarquin
		oh sure  of course

				karen
		mr thacker

	saved by the bell

	int trafalgar suit corridor  day

				karen
		youve got five minutes

	he is shown in through big golden doors  karen stays outside

	int the trafalgar suite sitting room  day

	there anna is framed in the window  glorious

				william
		hi

				anna
		hello

				william
		i brought these but clearly

	there are lots of other flowers in the room

				anna
		oh no ho  these are great

	a fair amount of tension  these two people hardly know each 
	other  and the first and last time they met they kissed

				william
		sorry about not ringing back  the
		whole twonames concept was totally too
		much for my flatmans peasized 
		intellect

				anna
		no its a stupid privacy thing  i 
		always choose a cartoon character 
		last time out i was mrs bambi

	at which moment jeremy karens boss comes in  a fairly grave
	authoritative fiftyyearold pr man consulting a list

				jeremy
		everything okay

				anna
		yes thanks

				jeremy
		and you are from horse and hound
		magazine

	william nods

				anna
		is that so

	william shrugs his shoulders  jeremy settles at a little desk 
	in the corner and makes notes  a pause  william feels he has to 
	act the part  they sit in chairs opposite each other

				william
		so ill just fire away shall i

	anna nods

				william
		right  ahm the films great 
		and i just wondered  whether you 
		ever thought of having more
		horses in it

				anna
		ahm  well  we would have liked to 
		 but it was difficult obviously 
		being set in space

				william
		obviously  very difficult

	jeremy leaves

	william puts his head in his hands  he was panic

				william
		im sorry  i arrived outside  they
		thrust this thing into my hand  i 
		didnt know what to do

				anna
		no its my fault i thought this 
		would all be over by now  i just 
		wanted to sort of apologize for the
		kissing thing  i seriously dont
		know what got in to me  i just wanted
		to make sure you were fine about it

				william
		absolutely fine about it

	reenter jeremy

				jeremy
		do remember that miss scott is also
		keen to talk about her next project 
		which is shooting later in the summer

				william
		oh yes  excellent  ahm  any horses 
		in that one  or hounds of course  our
		readers are equally intrigued by both
		species
				anna
		it takes place on a submarine

				william
		yes  right but if there were horses
		would you be riding them yourself or 
		would you be getting a stunt horse person
		double sort of thing

	jeremy exits

				william
		im just a complete moron  sorry 
		this is the sort of thing that happens
		in dreams  not in real life  good
		dreams obviously  its a dream to
		see you

				anna
		and what happens next in the dream

	its a challenge

				william
		well i suppose in the dream dream 
		scenario  i just ahm change my 
		personality because you can do that 
		in dreams and 	walk across and kiss the 
		girl but you know itll never happen

	pause  then they move towards each other when jeremy 
	enters

	is taking this in  real friends  relaxed  easy teasing 
	and theres a cake  honey wears bernies unsuitable hat  anna 
	watches william laughing at something and then putting his head 
	in his hands with mock shame

	int max and bellas conservatory  night

	coffee time

				max
		having you here anna firmly 
		establishes what ive long suspected
		that we really are the most desperate
		hot of underachievers

				bernie
		shame

				max
		im not saying its a bad thing in 
		fact i think its something we should
		take pride in  im going to give the 
		last brownie as a prize to the saddest
		act here

	a little pause  then william turns to bernie

				william
		bernie

				bernie
		well obviously its me isnt it 
		i work in the city in a job i dont
		understand and everyone keeps getting
		promoted above me  i havent had a 
		girlfriends since puberty and 
		well the long and short of it is 
		nobody fancies me and if these cheeks
		get any chubbier they never will

				honey
		nonsense  i fancy you  or i did 
		before you got so far

				max
		you see  and unless im much mistaken
		your job still pays you rather a lot of 
		money while honey here she earns 
		nothing flogging her guts out at 
		londons seediest record store

				honey
		yes  and i dont have hair  ive got
		feathers and ive got funny goggly
		eyes and im attracted to cruel men and
		 no onell ever marry me because my
		boosies have actually started 
		shrinking

				max
		you see  incredibly sad

				bella
		on the other hand her best friend is
		anna scott

				honey
		thats true i cant deny it  she 
		needs me what can i say

				bella
		and most of her limbs work  whereas
		im stuck in its thing day and night
		in a house full of ramps  and to add
		insult to serious injury  ive 
		totally given up smoking my favourite
		thing and the truth is we cant
		have a baby

	dead silence

				william
		bella

	bella shrugs her shoulders  bernie is totally griefstruck

				bernie
		no  not true

				bella
		cest la vie were lucky in lots 
		of ways but surely its worth a 
		brownie

	william reaches for her hand  max breaks the sombre mood

				max
		well i dont know  look at 
		william  very unsuccessful
		professionally  divorced  used to
		be handsome now kind of squidgy 
		around the edges  and absolutely
		certain never to hear from anna again
		after shes heard that his nickname
		at school was floppy

	they all laugh  anna smiles across at william

				william
		so i get the brownie

				max
		i think you do yes

				anna
		wait a minute  what about me

				max
		im sorry  you think you deserve the
		brownie

				anna
		well a shot at it

				william
		youll have to prove it  this is a 
		great brownie and im going to fight
		for it  state your claim

				anna
		well ive been on a diet since i was
		nineteen which means basically ive
		been hungry for a decade  ive had a
		sequence of not nice boyfriends  one
		of whom hit me and every time my heart
		gets broken it gets splashed across 
		the newspapers as entertainment  
		meantime it cost millions to get me
		looking like this

				honey
		really

				anna
		really  and one day not long from 
		now

	while she says this quiet settles around the table  the thing 
	is  she sort of means it and is opening up to them

				anna
		 my looks will go theyll find out
		i cant act and ill become a sad 
		middleaged woman who looks a bit like
		someone who was famous for a while

	silence they all look at her then

				max
		nah  nice try gorgeous  but you 
		dont fool anyone

	the mood is instantly broken  they all laugh

				william
		pathetic effort to hog the brownie

	int max and bellas kitchenliving roomcorridor  night

	anna and william are leaving

				anna

				max
		im delighted

	he holds out his hand to shake  she kisses him on the cheek
	he stumbles back with joy

	they move to the door and wave goodbye

	ext max and bellas house  night

	william and anna step outside  from inside they hear a massive
	and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
	feelings  william is a little embarrassed

				william
		sorry  they always do that when i
		leave the house

	the house is in lansdowne road on the edge of notting hill 
	they walk for a moment  a bit of silence

				anna
		floppy huh

		hair

				anna
		why is she in a wheelchair

				william
		it was an accident  about eighteen
		months ago

				anna
		and the pregnancy thing  is that to

		think theyd tried for kids before 
		as fate would have it

	they walk in silence for a moment  then

				william
		would you like to come my house is

				anna
		too complicated

				william
		thats fine

				anna
		busy tomorrow

				william
		i thought you were leaving

				anna
		i was

	ext notting hill garden  night

	a little later in the walk

	they are now walking by a five foot railing with foliage 
	behind it

				william
		gardens  all these streets round 
		here have these mysterious communal
		gardens in the middle of them  
		theyre like little villages

				anna
		lets go in

				william
		ah no  thats the point  theyre
		private villages  only the people
		who live round the edges are allowed 
		in

				anna
		you abide by rules like that

				william
		ahm

	her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on 
	the answer to this

				william
		heck no  other people do  but not
		me  i just do what i want

	he rattles the gate then starts his climb  but doesnt quite
	make it and falls back onto the pavement

				william
			casually
		whoopsidaisies

				anna
		what did you say

				william
		nothing

				anna
		yes you did

				william
		no i didnt

				anna
		you said whoopsidaisies

	tiny pause

				william
		i dont think so  no one has said
		whoopsidaisies do they  i mean

				anna
		theres no unless  no one has said
		whoopsidaisies for fifty years and
		even then it was only little girls 
		with blonde ringlets

				william
		exactly  here we go again

	he fails and unfortunately spontaneously

				william
		whoopsidaisies

	they look at each other

				william
		its a disease ive got  its a 
		clinical thing  im taking pills and
		having injections  it wont last
		long

				anna
		step aside

	she starts to climb

				william
		actually be careful anna  its 
		harder than it looks

	but shes already almost over

				william
		oh no its not  its easy

	a few seconds later  anna jumps down into the garden

				anna
		come on flops

	william clambers over with terrible difficulty dusts himself
	off and heads towards where she stands

				william
		now seriously  what in the world 
		in this garden could make that 
		ordeal worthwhile

	she leans forward  and for the firs time since the first
	time  she kisses him  this time a proper kiss  a tiny pause

				william
		nice garden

	ext magic garden  night

	they walk around the garden  its a moonlit dream  we see 
	the lights of the houses that surround the garden  they come
	across a single simple wooden bench

				anna
		for june who loved this garden 
		from joseph who always sat beside 
		her

	we cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood  she
	doesnt read the dates carved below  june wetherby 1917
	 1992  she is slightly chocked by it

				anna
		some people do spend their whole 
		lives together

	he nods  they are standing on either side of the bench 
	looking at each other  the camera glides away from them up
	into the night sky leaving them alone in the garden  music
	plays

	int williams living room  evening

	william in a towel rushes downstairs having just had a shower
	he shoots past spike

				william
		bollocks bollocks bollocks  have

				william
		bollocks
			still searching  
			 with no help from 
			 spike
		this happens every time i go to the
		cinema  average day my glasses are
		everywhere  everywhere i look 
		glasses  but the moment i need them
		they disappear  its one of lifes
		real cruelties

				spike
		thats compared to like 
		earthquakes in the far east or 
		testicular cancer

				william
		oh shit is that the time  i have to
		go

	int williams living roomcorridor  evening

	he sprints downstairs now fully dressed

				william

	int cinema  night

	diving goggles

	int restaurant  night

	a very smart japanese restaurant  we see anna and william 
	sitting near the end of their meal

				anna
		so who left who

				william
		she left me

				anna

				william
		she saw through me

				anna

	now we can hear it  two slightly rowdy men

				lawrence
		no  no no  give me anna scott any
		day

	william and anna look at each other

				gerald
		i didnt like that last film of hers 
		fast asleep from the moment the 
		lights went down

	again  anna reacts

				lawrence
		dont really care what the films are
		like  any film with her in it 
		fine by me

				gerald
		no  not my type at all really  i
		prefer that other one  blonde 
		sweet looking  has an orgasm every
		time you take her out for a cup of
		coffee

	anna mouths meg ryan

				lawrence
		meg ryan

	william and anna smile  theyre enjoying it

				gerald
		druginduced i hear  i believe 
		shes actually in rehab as we speak

				lawrence
		whatever shes so clearly up for it

	annas twinkle fades

				lawrence
		you know  some girls theyre all
		stay away chum but anna shes 
		absolutely gagging for it  do you
		know that in over fifty percent of 
		languages the word for actress is
		the same as the word for prostitute

	this is horrible

				lawrence
		and anna is your definitive actress
		 someone really filthy you can just
		flip over

				william
		right thats it

	he gets up and goes round the corner to the men  there are in
	fact four of them the two meeker men gavin and harry hanging
	on the other guys witty words

				william
		im sorry to disturb you guys but 

				lawrence
		can i help you

				william
		well yes i wish i hadnt overheard
		your conversation  but i did and i
		just think you know

	hes not a very convincing or frightening figure

				william
		the person youre talking about
		is a real person and i think she 
		probably deserves a little bit more
		consideration rather than having
		jerks like you drooling over her

				lawrence
		oh sod off mate  what are you her
		dad

	anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
	being recognized

				william
		im sorry

				anna
		no thats fine  i love that you 
		tried time was id have done the
		same

	they walk on and then

				anna
		in fact  give me a second

	and she walks straight back to their table

				anna
		hi

				lawrence
		oh my god

				anna
		im sorry about my friend  hes
		very sensitive

				lawrence
		no look im sorry

				anna
		please please  lets just leave 
		it there  im sure you meant no harm
		and im sure it was just friendly
		banter and im sure you dicks are all
		the size of peanuts  a perfect match
		for the size of your brains  enjoy
		your meal  the tunas really good

	pause

				william
		and ahm  whats a fruitarian exactly

				keziah
		we believe that fruits and vegetables

		cruel  we only eat things that have
		actually fallen from the tree or bush
		 that are in fact dead already

				william
		right  right  interesting stuff
			pause
		so these carrots

	william makes a gentle exasperated gesture then

				william
		i think you have forgotten
			he looks at them
		what an unusual situation you have
		here  to find someone you actually
		love wholl love you  the chances
		are always miniscule  look at me
		 not counting the american  ive
		only loved two girls in my whole life
		both total disasters

				max
		thats not fair

				william
		no really one of them marries me and
		then leaves me quicker than you can 
		say indiana jones  and the other 
		who seriously ought to have known 
		better casually marries my best 
		friend

				bella
			pause
		still loves you though

				william
		in a depressingly asexual way

				bella
			pause
		i never fancied you much actually

	and kisses her

	int williams bedroom  night

	int williams kitchencorridor  day

	they move from the kitchen into the corridor

				anna
		and remember  spike owes you an 
		expensive dinner  or holiday

				william
		thats not true  and wait a minute
		this is crazy behavior  cant we just
		laugh about this  seriously  in the 
		huge sweep of things this stuff 
		doesnt matter

				spike
		what hes going to say next is  there
		are people starving in the sudan

				william
		well there are  and we dont need to 
		go anywhere near that far  my best 
		friend slipped  she slipped down

		of perspective

				anna
		youre right of course youre right
		its just that ive dealt with this
		garbage for ten years now  youve had

		are different

				william

	ext london  day

	as full sad music plays  william begins to walk through 
	notting hill

	this walk takes six months as he walks the seasons actually
	and magically change from summer through autumn and winter
	back into spring

	first it is summer  summer fruits and flowers  a sixmonth 
	pregnant woman  honey with another leatherjacket boyfriend

	as he walks on the rain starts to fall  he turns up his coat 
	collar  umbrellas appear  followed by winter coats  
	chestnuts roasting  christmas trees on sale and the first hint 
	of snow

	then he comes to blenheim crescent which is startling snowscape
	for the hundred yard right across ladbroke grove

	by the time he reaches the purple cafe the snow is melting and
	in a few yards it is spring again  he passes honey again 
	arguing with her boyfriend walking away tearful  then turns
	past the pregnant woman  now holding her threemonth baby
	the camera holds on her

	int bookshop  day

	a grey day in the bookshop  martin and william  as ever  a
	feeling that things in there ever change

	ten seconds pass  honey rushes in  spike still feeling in 
	disgrace comes in with her but lingers in the doorway

				honey

		here

				tony
		a tiny hiccough

				bella
		and so we must face the fact that from 
		next week we have to find somewhere 
		near to eat

	tonys brave face breaks  the dream is over

				bella
		i just want to say to tony  dont take 
		it personally  the more i think about
		things the more i see no rhyme or reason
		in life  no one knows why some things
		work out and some things dont  why
		some of us get lucky  and some of us

				bernie
		 get fired

				bella
		no

				bernie
		yes theyre shifting the whole outfit
		much more towards the trading side  
		and of course
			he owns up
		i was total crap

	theyre all rather stunned

				tony
		so we go down together  a toast to 
		bernie  the worst stockbroker in the 
		whole world

	they toast him

				honey
		since its an evening of announcements
		 ive also got one ahm ive 
		decided to get engaged

	total bewilderment from the others

				honey
		ive found myself a nice slightly odd
		looking bloke who i know is going to 
		make me happy for the rest of my life

	special cut to bernie  the shot shows he had special feelings
	for honey

				william
		wait a minute  im your brother and i

				spike
		well yes  groovy

				max
		any more announcements

				william

		everyone for my behavior for the last
		six months  i have as you know been
		slightly down in the mouth

				max
		theres an understatement  there are
		dead people on better form

				william
		but i wish to make it clear ive turned
		a corner and henceforward intend to be
		impressively happy

	int tonys restaurant  night

	two hours later  theyve had a very good time  theres been a 
	chocolate cake  lots of alcohol  tony is playing blue moon
	on the piano and bernie joins him singing

	at one table bella and honey sit  beer and wine on the table

				bella
		im really horribly drunk

	elsewhere max an william are relaxed together

				max
		so  youve laid the ghost

				william
		i believe i have

				max
		dont give a damn about the famous girl

				william
		no dont think i do

				max
		which means you wont be distracted by
		the fact that shes back in london 
		grasping her oscar and to be found 
		filming most days on hampstead heath

	he puts down a copy of the evening standard with a picture of
	anna on its cover

				william
			immediate gloom
		oh god no

				max
		so not over her in fact

	ext hampstead heath  day

	cut to the wide sweep of hampstead heath  william entirely 
	alone  he marches up a hill goes over the crest of it  and
	sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the 
	radiant white of kenwood house with its lawn and its lakes

	ext kenwood house  day

	now closer to the house william approaches a barrier  where
	he is himself approached

				security
		can i help you

				william
		yes  i was looking for anna scott

				security
		does she know youre coming

				william
		no no  she doesnt

				security
		im afraid i cant really let you 
		through then sir

				william
		oh right  i mean i am a friend  im
		not a lunatic but  no you basically

				security
		 cant let you through

	at that moment  thirty yards away william sees trailer door
	open  out of it comes anna  looking extraordinary  in a
	velvet dress full beautiful makeup rich extravagant hair
	she has a necessary cluster of people about her  hair makeup
	costume and the third assistant who has collected her

	she walks a few yards and then casually turns her head  and
	sees him  her face registers not jut surprise certainly not a
	simple smile  his being there is a complicated thing 
	cut back to him  he does a small wave  she pauses as the whole
	paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them  the
	movie divides them  but then she begins to walk through it and
	followed by her cluster she makes her way towards him  when
	she reaches him the security guard stands back a pace and her
	people hold back  she doesnt really know what to say

				anna
		this is certainly ah

				william
		i only found out you were here 
		yesterday

				anna
		i was going to ring but i didnt
		think youd want to

	the third assistant is under pressure

				third
		anna

	she looks around  the poor third is nervous  and the first is
	approaching

				anna
			to william
		its not going very well  and its
		our last day

				william
		absolutely  youre clearly very busy

				anna
		but wait there are things to say

				william
		okay

				anna
		drink tea  theres lots of tea

	she is swept away four people touching her hair and costume

				karen
		come and have a look

	ext kenwood park  day

	as they make towards the set

				karen
		are you a fan of henry james

				william
		this is henry james film

	ext kenwood house  day

	a complicated shot is about to happen  with waves of extras 
	and a huge moving crane  they end up next to the sound desk

				karen
		this is harry  hell give you a pair of
		headphones so you can hear the dialogue

	harry the sound man is a pleasant fiftyyearold balding
	fellow  he hands him the headphones

				harry
		here we go  the volume control is on 
		the side

				william
		thats great

	william the headphones on surveys the scene  the cluster is
	a full 100 yards from the action to allow a gracious sweeping
	wideshot  he watches anna  she is with her costar in the 
	henry james film  lets call him james

				james
		we are living in cloudcuckooland  
		well never get this done today

				anna
		we have to  ive got to be in new york
		on thursday

				james
		oh stop showing off

	he studies an actress a few yards to the left

				james
		god thats an enormous arse

				anna
		im not listening

				james
		no but seriously  its not fair  so
		many tragic young teenagers with 
		anorexia  and that girl has an arse 
		she could perfectly well share round 
		with at least ten other women  and
		still be begbottomed

				anna
		i said im not listening  and i think
		looking at something that firm you and
		your droopy little excuse for an arse
		would be welladvised to keep quiet

	back by the desk william is listening and laughs  thats his
	girl  anna prepares

				anna
		so i ask you when youre going to tell
		everyone and you say

				james
		tomorrow will be soon enough

				anna
		and then i right

				james
		who was that rather difficult chap you 
		were talking to on the way up

				anna
		oh no one no one  just some
		guy from the past  i dont know what 
		hes doing here  bit of an awkward
		situation

	ext hampstead heath  day

	cut back to william  he has heard

				william
		of course

	he takes off the headphones and puts them gently down

				william
		thank you

				harry
		anytime

	william walks away  the moment of hope is gone  he couldnt
	have had a clear reminder

	int williams living room  evening

	william is emptying anna scott videos into a box

				spike
		whats going on

				william
		im going to throw out these old videos

				spike
		no  you cant bin these  theyre 
		classics  im not allowing this

				william
		right  lets talk about rent

				spike
		let me help  we dont want all this 
		shit cluttering up our lives

	int backroom of the bookshop  day

	the next day  william is hard at work doing the accounts in a 
	dark small room with files in it  martin pops his head in

				martin
		i have to disturb you when youre 
		cooking the books but theres a 
		delivery

				william
		martin cant you just deal with this
		yourself

				martin
		but its not for the shop  its for you

				william
		okay  tell me would i have to pay a wet
		rag as much as i pay you

	they head out martin behind him incomprehensively rubbing
	his hands  hes in a very good mood

	int bookshop  day

	william enters  and there stands anna  in a simple blue
	skirt and top

				anna
		hi

				william
		hello

				anna
		you disappeared

				william
		yes  im sorry  i had to leave i
		didnt want to disturb you

				anna
		well how have you been

				william

		they change the law spike and i will 
		marry immediately  whereas you 
		ive watched in wonder  awards glory
		

				anna
		oh no  its all nonsense believe me
		i had no idea how much nonsense it all 
		was  but nonsense it all is
			shes nervous
		well yesterday was our last day 
		filming and so im just off  but i 
		brought you this from home and

	its quite a big wrapped parcel flat  3 foot by 4 foot 	
	leaning against a bookshelf

				anna
		i thought id give it to you

				william
		thank you  shall i

				anna
		no dont open it yet  ill be 
		embarrassed

				william
		okay  well thank you  i dont know
		what its for  but thank you anyway

				anna
		i actually had it in my apartment in new
		york and just thought youd but 
		when it came to it i didnt know how to
		call you having behaved so badly
		twice  so its been just sitting in the
		hotel  but then you came so i 
		figured the thing is the thing is
		 

				william
		whats the thing

	then the door pings  in walks the annoying customer mr smith

				william
		dont even think about it  go away 
		immediately

	mr smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient

				mr smith
		right  sorry

	and he leaves

				william
		you were saying

				anna
		yes  the thing is i have to go away
		today but i wondered if i didnt 
		whether you might let me see you a bit
		or a lot maybe see if you could
		like me again

	pause as william takes this in

				william
		but yesterday that actor asked you 
		who i was and you just dismissed me
		out of hand i heard  you had a 
		microphone i had headphones

				anna
		you expect me to tell the truth about my
		life to the most indiscreet man in 
		england

	martin edges up

				martin
		excuse me  its your mother on the
		phone

				william
		can you tell her ill ring her back

				martin
		i actually tried that tack  but she 
		said you said that before and its been
		twentyfour hours and her foot that 
		was purple is now a sort of blackish
		color

				william
		okay  perfect timing as ever  hold
		the fort for a second will you martin

	martin is left with anna

				martin
		can i just say i thought ghost was a
		wonderful film

				anna
		is that right

				martin
		yes ive always wondered what 
		patrick swayze is like in real life

				anna
		i cant say i know patrick all that 
		well

				martin
		oh dear  he wasnt friendly during the
		filming

				anna
		well no  im sure he was friendly 
		to demi moore  who acted with him in
		ghost

	shes kind in here not sarcastic

				martin
		oh right  right  sorry  always been
		a bit of an ass

	william returns a little uneasy

				martin
		anyway its lovely to meet you  im
		a great fan of yours  and demis of 
		course

	martin leaves them

				william
		sorry about that

				anna
		thats fine  theres always a pause 
		when the jury goes out to consider its
		verdict

	shes awaiting an answer

				william
		anna  look  im a fairly level
		headed bloke  not often in and out of
		love  but

	he cant really express what he feels

				william
		 can i just say no to your kind 
		request and leave it at that

				anna
		 yes thats fine  of course  i
		you know of course ill just
		be getting along then nice to see 
		you

				william
		the truth is

	he feels he must explain

				william
		 with you im in real danger  it
		took like a perfect situation apart 
		from that foul temper of yours  but my
		relatively inexperienced heart would 
		i fear not recover if i was once again
		 cast aside which i would 
		absolutely expect to be  there are too
		many pictures of you everywhere too 
		many films  youd go and id be 
		well buggered basically

				anna
		i see
			pause
		that reality is a real no isnt it

				william
		i live in notting hill  you live in
		beverly hills  everyone in the world
		knows who you are  my mother has 
		trouble remembering my name

				anna
		okay  fine  fine  good decision

	pause

				anna
		the fame thing isnt really real you
		know  dont forget  im also just a
		girl  standing in front of a boy  
		asking him to love her

	pause  she kisses him on the cheek

				anna
		bye

	then turns and leaves  leaving him

		well you know anybody saying they 
		want to go out with you is pretty
		great isnt it

				william
		it was sort of sweet actually  i mean
		i know shes an actress and all that so
		she can deliver a line  but she said 
		that she might be as famous as can be 
		but also that she was just a girl
		standing in front of a boy asking him 
		to love her

	they take in the line  it totally reverses their attitudes 
	a pause
