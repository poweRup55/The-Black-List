               black

               in black we hear a chaingang chant many voices together 
               spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock a 
               title burns in

               o muse 
               sing in me and through me tell the story 
               of that man skilled in all the ways of contending 
               a wanderer harried for years on end

               on the sound of an impact we cut to

               a pick

               splitting a rock

               as the chant continues wider angles show the chaingang at 
               work they are black men in bleached and faded stripes 
               chained together working under a brutal midday sun

               it is flat delta countryside the straightruled road 
               stretches to infinity mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
               patrol the line

               the chaingang chant is regular and it seems timeless

               we slowly fade out returning to

               black

               the last of the voices fades

               after a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to harry 
               mcclintocks the big rock candy mountain

               a wheat field

               a road cuts across the middle background noonday sun beats 
               down

               we hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and 
               see rising above ground level the occasional upraised pick 
               and spade heaving dirt men are digging a ditch alongside 
               the road

               after a long beat three men pop up in the wheat field in 
               the middle foreground they wear faded stripes and grey duck
               billed caps they scurry abreast toward the camera throwing 
               an occasional glance back at the ditchdiggers a clanking 
               sound accompanies their run oddly the wheat between them 
               sweeps down as they run after a brief sprint they drop back 
               down into the wheat

               in the background a man enters frame left strolling along 
               the road wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses a shotgun 
               resting against one shoulder he glances idly down into the 
               ditch and strolls on out of frame right

               the three men rise back up from the wheat and clanking 
               resume their sprint

               three pairs of eyes

               they are topped by three cap bills and peer out from behind 
               a blind of greenery we hear distant whistling

               the men are looking at a weathered barn a young boy 
               whistling is heading down the road that leads away from the 
               barn jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads 
               him he turns a corner and is gone

               barnyard

               the three clanking men we can now see their leg irons are 
               awkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard the squawking 
               yardbird doesnt need to move much to elude the three bunched 
               men

               country lane

               it curves in a gentle s into the background it is sun
               dappled pretty

               we hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot

               the three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the 
               lane the leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one 
               arm

               afternoon campfire

               the three men sit in a sidebyside arc around a dying fire 
               one of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken 
               bone another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve the 
               third idly poking at the fire with a spit

               each of them still bound by chains clinks as he moves

               one of them abruptly cocks his head listening

               the others notice his attitude and also freeze listening

               we hear the distant baying of hounds

               rolling hills

               from high on a ridge we see the three chained men running 
               toward us

               in addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound

               tracking

               laterally with the clanking running feet

               the chugging sound is very loud

               running

               next to a freight train a boxcar door is open

               inside the boxcar

               the lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself 
               up his two clanking friends keeping pace outside

               six hobos sit in the boxcar lounging against sacks of 
               odaniels flour they impassively watch the convict clamber 
               in as his two confederates run to keep up

               the convict hauls himself to his feet in spite of his stubble 
               he has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache he is 
               everett

               as he dusts himself off

                                     everett
                         say uh any a you boys smithies

               the hobos stare

               everett gives an ingratiating smile as behind him the second 
               convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar the third 
               convict still keeping pace outside

                                     everett
                         or if not smithies per se were you 
                         otherwise trained in the metallurgic 
                         arts before straitened circumstances 
                         forced you into a life of aimless 
                         wanderin

               the convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and 
               disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately 
               after everett just finishing his speech flips forward in 
               turn smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the 
               open doorway his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves 
               on the boxcar floorboards

               the hobos impassively watch

               outside

               the three men tumble clanking down the track embankment

               squush  they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom

               they shake their heads clear then rise to their feet in the 
               muck and watch the train recede

               its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds

                                     everett
                         jesus  cant i count on you people

               the second con is delmar

                                     delmar
                         sorry everett

               everett looks desperately about

                                     everett
                         all right  if we take off through 
                         that bayou

               the third con pete bald but also with beard stubble angrily 
               cuts in

                                     pete
                         wait a minute who elected you leader 
                         a this outfit

                                     everett
                         well pete i just figured it should 
                         be the one with capacity for abstract 
                         thought but if that aint the 
                         consensus view hell lets put her 
                         to a vote

                                     pete
                         suits me im votin for yours truly

                                     everett
                         well im votin for yours truly too

               both men look interrogatively to delmar

               he looks from pete to everett and nods agreeably

                                     delmar
                         okay  im with you fellas

               everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen

               the baying of hounds is louder now but through it we hear a 
               distant scrape of metal against metal like the workings of 
               a rusty pump the men turn in unison to look up the track

               a small distant form is moving slowly up the track toward 
               them

               as it draws closer it resolves into a humanpropelled flatcar 
               an ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw 
               handle

               the three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to 
               show movement the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs

               the flatcar draws even and slows

                                     everett
                         mind if we join you ol timer

                                     old man
                         join me my sons

               the three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping

               the three men exchange glances delmar waves a clanking hand 
               before the old mans milky eyes no reaction

                                     delmar
                         you work for the railroad grandpa

                                     old man

                                     everett
                         well that right there may be why 
                         youve had difficulty finding gainful 
                         employment ya see in the mart of 
                         competitive commerce the

                                     old man
                         you seek a great fortune you three 
                         who are now in chains

               the men fall silent

                                     old man
                         and you will find a fortune  though 
                         it will not be the fortune you seek

               the three convicts faces upturned listen raptly to the 
               blind prophet

                                     old man
                         but first first you must travel 
                         a long and difficult road  a road 
                         fraught with peril uhhuh and 
                         pregnant with adventure you shall 
                         see things wonderful to tell you 
                         shall see a cow on the roof of a 
                         cottonhouse uhhuh and oh so many 
                         startlements

               the cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the 
               track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame

                                     old man
                         i cannot say how long this road 
                         shall be but fear not the obstacles 
                         in your path for fate has vouchsafed 
                         your reward  and though the road 
                         may wind and yea your hearts grow 
                         weary still shall ye foller the 
                         way even unto your salvation

               the old man pumps  reeka reeka reeka  as all contemplate 
               his words

               loud and sudden

                                     old man
                         izzat clear

               the men start then mumble polite acknowledgement

               the railroad tracks wind to the setting sun reeka reeka 
               reeka  the flatcar rolls in wide shot toward the golden 
               horizon

                                                                   fade out

               day

               a hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse

               the three men walk clanking and abreast

                                     delmar
                         howd he know about the treasure

                                     everett
                         dont know delmarthough the blind 
                         are reputed to possess sensitivities 
                         compensatin for their lack of sight 
                         even to the point of developing para
                         normal psychic powers now clearly 
                         seein the future would fall neatly 
                         into that kataggery its not so 
                         surprising then if an organism 
                         deprived of earthly vision

                                     pete
                         he said we wouldnt get it he said 
                         we wouldnt get the treasure we seek

               everett grows testy

                                     everett
                         well what does he know  hes an

                         shoein impediments to restore our 
                         liberty of movement

               bang a rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men

                                     childs voice
                         hold it rah chair

               the front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front 
               porch and a dark screen door

               the screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the 
               porch and steps down into the sunlight holding a gun almost 
               bigger than he is the grimyfaced boy about eight years 
               old wears tattered overalls

                                     child

               he pokes his rifle at the three men who raise their hands

                                     delmar

               bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm 
               implements overgrown with weeds he is whittling artlessly 
               at a stick

               he glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner 
               then returns to his whittling

               pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized 
               congregation

               it lands harmlessly in some scattered straw

                                     bullhorn voice
                         you choose it boys  the prison 
                         farm or the pearly gates

               the straw curls lights and the fire scuttles over to a 
               parked black maria

               with a loud airy whooof the undercarriage of the police van 
               pops into flame

               the man with the bullhorn sees it

                                     man with bullhorn

               one starts spinning

               flames lick up the outside of the van as  chinkachinka
               chinka  bullet holes walk across the body

                                     man with bullhorn

               yelling men scurry away

               the vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many 
               tommy guns now firing inside tires pop hiss and settle 
               doors pop open glass shatters

                                     voices
                         whos that

               an oncoming car is bouncing crazily across the yard horn 
               blaring deputies leap out of its path

               the car shoots past the chattering van which still bucks and 
               bounces on its shocks its interior strobing and flashing as 
               if filled with trapped lightning

               the speeding car heads directly for the flaming barn door 
               and crashes through in a shower of sparks

               the car brakes inside the barn and the drivers door flies 
               open the little hogwallop boy yells over the roar of the 
               flames

                                     boy

               the doors slam shut and the boy grinds into gear he has 
               wood blocks strapped to his feet so that he can reach 
               accelerator brake and clutch he sits on a sears roebuck 
               catalogue to give him a view over the dash

                                     boy
                         you aint the boss a me

               the car speeds for the far wall sheeted in flame and bursts 
               through

               country road  day

               the little hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the 
               middle of the empty road his walk is unsteady the wood 
               blocks still strapped to his feet

               on a wooded hillside they sit at a twig fire roasting a

               everett has taken out a can of nearempty dapper dan he 
               scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his 
               hair

               we hear distant singing  one lone tenor voice

                                     everett
                         well youre right there but the 
                         ol tacticians already got a plan

               everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to 
               pete

                                     everett

                         coiffure in order

               pete looks at the watch puzzled

                         have painful associations for wash

               pete pops the front and reads the inscription

                         to washington bartholomew hogwallop

               he screws the lid back on the pomade

               delmar whistles appreciatively

                                     delmar

               he lurches threateningly to his feet

                         you stole from my kin

               everett scrambles up

                         who was fixing to betray us

                         pete its a fool looks for logic in 
                         the chambers of the human heart 
                         what the hells that singing

               we can make out the words now sung by the lone tenor

                                     voice
                         oh brothers lets go down come on 
                         down dont you wanna go down

               people in white robes are drifting down the hill through 
               the woods behind the campsite they join in with the lead 
               voice

                                     voices
                         oh brothers lets go down down to 
                         the river to pray

               delmar gazes wonderingly at the whiterobed figures as he 
               answers everett

                                     delmar
                         appears to be some kinda con
                         gurgation care for some gopher

               everett too watches the whiterobed people following in the 
               wake of the tenor he answers absently

                                     everett
                         no thank you delmar  a third of a 
                         gopher would only rouse my appetite 
                         without beddin her back down

               there are more and more white robes drifting through the 
               woods all of them strangely oblivious to the three men

                                     delmar
                         you can have the whole thing  men 
                         pete already had one

               there is an endless stream now drifting through the 
               foreground the background the campsite itself

                                     voices
                         oh sisters lets go down come on 
                         down dont you want to go down

                                     delmar
                         we ran acrost a gopher village

               the drifting worshipers wear beatific expressions one only 
               a middleaged woman notices the three convicts around whom 
               the rest of the flock blindly drifts she calls to them

                                     woman
                         come with us brothers join us and 
                         be saved

               the river

               white robes stream down the hill out of the woods and down 
               the riverbank the voices swell in a great chorus

                                     voices
                         we went down to the river one day 
                         studying about that good old way 
                         and who shall wear that robe and 
                         crown oh lord show us the way

               we are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground 
               he stands bellydeep in the river easing a whiterobed man 
               backdown into the water behind him a line of robed singers 
               lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods

               pete delmar and everett emerge from the woods and gaze down 
               at the river whiterobed people continue to drift past them

                                     everett
                         i guess hard times flush the chumps

                         theres always

               delmar wades out into the stream cutting in line

                                     everett
                         where the hells he goin

               delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the 
               minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water

                                     pete

               delmar is slogging back through the water

               later

               the smoldering twig fire a bloodhound on a leash circles 
               into frame its tail fiercely wagging

               we follow it as nose to the ground and straining against 
               its leash it waddles over to an empty tin of dapper dan 
               pomade

                                     a voice

               everett drives shaking his head with a forebearing smile 
               pete sitting next to him and delmar in back are both 
               dripping wet

               pete is sullen

               performing a hot and harmonized version of man of constant 
               sorrow

               a caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just 
               as tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station 
               door whooping it up

               a sixtyyearold man in enormous seersucker pants held up by 
               suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is 
               getting out of the first car his face is familiar from 
               countless sacks of pass the biscuits pappy odaniel flour

               a big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of 
               the car he has the sloping shoulders the pasty skin and 
               the aimlessly bobbing head of an intellectual flyweight

               hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get 
               out of the second car

                                     pappy

               tommy sits in the background playing and singing a slow 
               blues the three convicts holding coffee cups gaze into 
               the fire

               over the dreamy song

               their pointofview shows a lone barn with their car parked 
               to one side various police vehicles have pulled up facing 
               the barn and armed men their backs to us train guns on 
               it some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars

                                     everett
                         damn they found our car

               the man with the bullhorn continues directing his comments 
               at the distant barn

                                     man

                         inclinationto gentle you boys no 
                         further

               the three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands 
               impassively next to the man with the bullhorn holding a 
               leash against which a bloodhound strains

                                     man

                         fires of damnationmakes no nevermind 
                         to me

               the sheriff makes a signal to a man holding a torch who 
               skitters up to the barn and lights it

                                     delmar
                         damn we gotta skedaddle

               the three men shuffle down the dusty road

                                     pete
                         the hell it aint square one aint

                         in that remark i dont intend to 
                         dignify with comment but i would 
                         like to address your general attitude 
                         of hopeless negativism consider the 
                         lilies a the goddamn field orhell 
                         take a look at delmar here as your 
                         paradigm a hope

                                     delmar

                                     everett
                         now you may call it an unreasoning 
                         optimism you may call it obtuse 
                         but the plain fact is we still have 
                         close to close to

               he loses his drift as all three men turn reacting to the 
               sound of an approaching speeding car

                                     everett
                         close to three days before 
                         they dam that river

               the car comes into view cornering on two wheels it crashes 
               back onto all four and as it speeds along dollar bills 
               snap and flutter out its windows the car roars up to the 
               three men as delmar waggles a hopeful thumb it screeches to 
               a halt

               the driver a young man in a sharp suit with a round babylike 
               face leans over to call through the passenger window

                                     driver
                         is this the road to itta bena

                         uh itta bena

               delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air and 
               looks at it wonderingly he holds it stretched between two 
               hands brings the two sides together then gives it an 
               appraising pop

                                     everett
                         itta bena now uh that would be

                         isnt it uh

               like a child gazing at soap bubbles delmar looks around at 
               the wafting currency and yanks another fluttering bill out 
               of the air

                                     everett
                         im thinkin its uh you could take 
                         this road to uh

               there is the sound of a distant siren

               the driver still patiently leaning over to hear out the two 
               brainwrackers shoots a quick look in his rearview mirror

                                     pete
                         nah that aint right im

                         mistaken  see weve been away for 
                         several years uh

               the driver pushes open the passenger door

                                     driver
                         hop on in while you give it a think

               the three men climb in and the car squeals out

               int car

               the driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the 
               sirens grow louder then gropes inside his coat

                                     driver
                         any a you boys know your way around

                         mississippi

               the man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his 
               passengers delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering 
               inside the car

                                     delmar
                         friend some of your folding money

                         george nelson its a pleasure

               he opens his door and steps onto the running board giving 
               everett a casual

                                     nelson
                         grab the tiller will ya buddy

               everett slides over startled george nelson now fully 
               outside and facing the pursuit vehicles has one hand clamped 
               on the car roof and waves to delmar with the other

                                     nelson

                         george

               ext car

               nelson sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car

                                     nelson
                         come and get me coppers you

                         aint yet fully growed

               nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him returning 
               fire he suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the 
               roadside and murmurs

                                     nelson
                         cows

               he swings the tommy gun over with a whoop

                         i hate cows worse than coppers

               he lets loose a spray one of the cows drops and the rest 
               stampede toward the road

                                     delmar
                         aww george not the livestock

               energized nelson resumes bellowing

                                     nelson

                         sonsabitches come and get me

               in bovine ignorance of the conventions of highspeed police 
               pursuit some of the cows have wandered up onto the road 
               the lead police car broadsides one george nelson cackling 
               wildly fires into the air as his car recedes

               small town

               the car is speeding into town dodging and weaving through 
               light traffic as george fires into the air  perhaps a means 
               of clearing a path perhaps an expression of high spirits

               the car screeches to a halt and george hops out and the 
               three convicts emerge to follow him

                                     nelson
                         come on boys were goin for the

               jowls shaking in a full run george nelson bursts through 
               the door of the bank followed by the three men

               he fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table

                                     nelson

                         bena

               he leaps down fires into the air again and sweeps a young 
               woman standing in line into a full vj dip kissing her on 
               the lips

               delmar nudges everett

               he sends a burst into the ceiling and heads for the door as 
               customers murmur

               about delmar lays a hand on georges shoulder and tries to 
               steer him toward the door

                                     delmar

               the siren grows louder as the four men emerge

                                     everett

               he shrugs off everetts hand and lights the fuse on a stick 
               of dynamite

               as the car peels out  kaboom  the dynamite blows a crater 
               in the street behind

               campfire

               it is night

               george nelson now strangely quiet holds a coffee cup and 
               stares gloomily into the fire

               after a long beat delmar also staring into the fire slaps 
               one knee and ejaculates

                                     delmar
                         damn but that was some fun though 
                         won it george

               george responds barely audible and without brightening

                                     george

               is less sensitive to the babyfaces mood

                                     delmar

               at length george swishes the coffee around his cup shrugs 
               tosses the coffee and rises

                                     george

               he digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded 
               delmar

                                     george
                         you boys can have the automobile

               glassyeyed he continues to dig in his pockets and lets his 
               money fall to the ground

                                     george

               george has turned woodenly and walks away leaving the 
               campfires flickering circle of light

                                     george

               delmar stares at everett who looks appraisingly at georges 
               retreating back pete scrambles to pick up the loose money

                                     delmar

               delmar gazing out at the blackness that has closed over 
               george nelson hasnt really been listening he turns sadly 
               back

                                     delmar
                         damn i liked george

               a field

               a ploughing farmer has paused to look for the source of 
               distant stringband music growing closer there is also an 
               approaching amplified voice

                                     voice
                         dont be saps for pappy vote for 
                         stokes and responsible gummint

               a stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the 
               field it is festooned with stokes banners showing the 
               candidate holding high a broom pickers perform in the bed 
               of the truck along with a dancer doing a twostep as he 
               pushes a broom a midget in overalls waves his arms as if 
               conducting the music

                                     voice
                         hes against the innarests and for 
                         the little man

               this the drivers voice is amplified through a flared 
               speaker mounted on the roof of the cab as the oncoming truck 
               draws near the midget bellows out at the farmer who has 
               removed his hat to scratch his forehead

                                     midget
                         greetings brother vote for stokes

               the voice tails away

                                     midget
                         clean gummint is yours for the askin

               our pan with the passing truck comes to rest on the wezy 
               radio building

               inside

               we are pulling back from a close shot of the portly blind 
               man

                                     man
                         hang on lemme slap up a wire

               he turns away to load a recording as he talks into a 
               microphone

                                     man

                         enjoy thoroughly

               he switches off the microphone as the song a duet of ill 
               fly away scratchily issues from a monitor he turns his 
               attention back to a welldressed man sitting nearby

                                     man

               ill fly away mixes up to play full over the following

               montage

                the three men walk down a flat delta road the sun 
               shimmering off the rough pavement their bank loot wrapped 
               in a bandanna is knotted to the end of a stick slung over 
               delmars shoulder

                a different road under a threatening sky the three men 
               stand in the middle distance waiting in the foreground two 
               little black boys are walking home each carrying a block of 
               ice a horsedrawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and everett 
               waggles his thumb thunder rumbles

                a spinning 78 on a green felt turntable the crude black 
               label identifies it as man of constant sorrow by the soggy 
               bottom boys

                a high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping 
               eave of a barn under which everett pete and delmar have 
               taken cover the three hold their coats pinched shut at the 
               neck as they look forlornly up at the weather

                the three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through 
               a bayou

                the three men sit around a campfire everett sits on a 
               stump expressively telling a ghost story as pete and delmar 
               gaze at him from below wideeyed and rapt

                the three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst 
               pods

                a woolworths interior a sadfaced woman in a calico dress 
               addresses the clerk

                                     sadfaced woman
                         do you have the soggy bottom boys 
                         performing man of constant sorrow

                                     clerk
                         no maam we had a new shipment in 
                         yesterday but we just cant keep it 
                         on the shelves

               the sadfaced woman is crestfallen

                                     sadfaced woman
                         oh mercy then  just the purple 
                         toilet water

                the three men walk down a road excavated through banks of 
               clay from which gnarled tree roots protrude

                a pie rests on a windowsill steam wafting from it a hand 
               enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the 
               pie a moment later we see everetts and petes backs as 
               they scamper away across the yard a short beat and then 
               delmar peeks over the sill he ducks back down and then his 
               hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill moments later we see 
               him scampering away after pete and everett

                another campfire the three men sit around it laughing as 
               they enjoy the pie each with a slab on a plate improvised 
               of old newspaper everett finishes his piece licks his thumb 
               and tosses the newspaper onto the fire

               we jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins 
               to curl its edge a story is headlined tva finalizing plans 
               for flooding of arktabutta valley the flame curls the page 
               away briefly revealing the page beneath  with a story 
               headlined soggy bottom boys a sensation  but who are they  
               before it too is consumed

                a little general store we are very high looking down at 
               a foreshortened everett pete delmar and store clerk who 
               is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward 
               us everett is pointing up directing the man with the pole 
               he moves it tentatively to and fro until at a certain point 
               everett nods vigorously

               a reverse shows the end of the pole  a long stockpincher  
               as it closes over a tin of dapper dan pomade resting on a 
               high shelf

               the exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a 
               little crossroads town the three men are emerging from the 
               store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubbletopped 
               gas pumps out front a fancyman in a boater hat gets out of 
               the car and heads for the store passing the three everett 
               glances at him and as the man disappears inside he dives 
               into his car waving for delmar and pete to follow delmar 
               initially reluctant is hauled into the car by pete and the 
               men take off

                the spinning 78 recording as the song enters its last 
               verse

                a spinning car wheel

                a panoramic boom up as the car toodles away down a road 
               that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset

               the car

               the three men are driving through the heat of the day everett 
               drives pete is slouched in the front passenger seat delmar 
               in back picks out ill fly away on a banjo

               pete listens to something squints tilts his head

                                     pete
                         shutup delmar

               delmar and everett exchange glances everett shrugs and delmar 
               desists

               we can faintly hear a high unearthly singing barely human 
               the sound seems to agitate pete he looks desperately out 
               the window

               his hinging pointofview shows down the declivity from the 
               road and half hidden by trees three women washing clothes 
               in the river

               petes reaction is enormous he jams a fist into his mouth 
               eyes widening he yanks the fist out and screams

                                     pete
                         pull over

               everett startled does so

               ext

               before the car has even come to a stop petes door flies 
               open and he is stumbling down the bank to the river

               everett and delmar follow more casually everett chuckling

                                     everett
                         i guess o petes got the itch

               at the river

               the unearthly singing full volume here comes from the three 
               women beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as 
               they dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks

               pete is all awkward smiles and deep burning eyes

                                     pete
                         howdy do ladies name of pete

               strangely the three laundresses do not answer though they 
               do smile at him as they continue to sing

               pete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket

                                     pete
                         maybe i could help you with the uh

               he realizes he is holding ladies undergarments

                                     pete
                         ahem i uh

               he drops them back in the basket

                                     pete
                         i dont believe ive uh heard that 
                         song before

               everett and delmar have arrived everett is loud and jovial

                                     everett
                         aintcha gonna innerduce us pete

               petes eyes stay glued on the women as he hisses out of the 
               corner of his mouth

               none of the women respond but as all continue to sing one 
               brings a jug marked with three xes to everett

                                     everett

               he passes the jug to pete as the woman runs her fingers 
               through his hair

               the other two women are approaching to likewise tousle pete 
               and delmar

               delmars woman caresses his face and by squeezing his cheeks 
               smushes his mouth into a pucker

                                     delmar
                         pleased to meet you maam

               the singing continues the stream gurgles somewhere in the 
               distance flies lazily buzz

                                     pete

                                                                    fade in

               close on delmar

               we are very tight delmars eyes are closed we hear loud 
               snoring at length his eyelids flutter open but the snoring 
               continues

               delmar groggily props himself on one elbow

               it is late afternoon he is still on the riverbank everett 
               snores nearby

               the ladies are gone the hamper of laundry is gone pete is 
               gone

               after looking blearily about for a moment delmar starts and 
               staggers to his feet

                                     delmar
                         holy saint christopher

               he toes everett urgently in the ribs

                                     everett
                         whuhh

               petes clothes are laid out on the ground not in a heap 
               but mimicking the human shape as if he had been simply 
               vaporized fron within them

               everett rouses himself and looks at the clothes he scans 
               the opposite river bank

                                     everett

                         got time for your shenanigans

               delmar stares horrified at the pile of clothes a spot in 
               the middle of the shirt is rising and falling rising and 
               falling

                                     delmar
                         sweet jesus everett they left his 
                         heart

               everett joins delmar to look the rhythmic rising and falling 
               now travels up the shirt a large yellow toad sticks its 
               head out from under the collar

               delmar keens everett is bewildered

                                     everett

                         him up an turned him into a horney
                         toad

               the toad hops down the river bank

                                     delmar
                         pete come back

               he slides down the bank after the toad everett watching in 
               perturbation

               the toad plops into the river and delmar dives in after him 
               he emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his 
               hand

                                     delmar
                         dont worry pete its me delmar

               driving

               we hear soft whimpering as everett drives sneaking worried 
               glances over at the passenger seat

               delmar has the toad in his lap he whimpers as he pets it

               everett hesitantly offers

                                     everett

               a beat delmar continues to whimper

                                     everett

               the tables are formally laid with linen delmar and everett 
               sit at a table a shoebox between them deep in conversation

                                     everett

               he points a knife at the shoebox

                                     everett
                         dont happen for no reason delmar
                         obviously its some kind of judgment

               another patron

               we are looking over the shoulder of a broadshouldered man 
               in a creamcolored suit and a shirt with powderblue collar 
               he is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs sensing 
               something he looks up cocks his head and then slowly turns 
               to look back

               he thus reveals a creamcolored eyepatch with powderblue 
               trim his good eye is looking intently off  at everett and 
               delmar who continue arguing out of earshot

               back to everett and delmar

               still heatedly discussing

                                     delmar
                         the two of us was fixing to fornicate

               the waitress has just arrived for their order everett gives 
               her an ingratiating laugh

               big man

               watching everett fan his money the big man stops chewing 
               and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty 
               pat

               back to everett and delmar

               as everett closes his menu

                                     everett

               a meadow

               the car boosted from the general store has been pulled off 
               the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with 
               bluebonnets and rimmed with mossdripping oak

               picnic hamper big dan is just sucking the last piece of

                         give you a lesson in right now

               he reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off 
               a tree he casually strips its twigs

                                     everett

               his club is ready he swings at delmar who staggers back 
               with a grunt

               everett wears a puzzled smile

                                     everett

               delmar though stunned is faster to size things up he 
               charges big dan and wraps his arms around him

               delmar roars

               big dan rears back and whacks at his head

               everett is still puzzled but willing to be instructed

                                     everett
                         big dan whatre you doin

               big dan walks awkwardly over to everett with delmar still 
               attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear big 
               dan takes a break from whacking at delmar to deliver a blow 
               to everett

               the blow catches everett on the chin and sends him reeling

                                     big dan

               big dan bear hugs delmar and tosses him away he whacks 
               everett into a semiconscious heap and then paws through his 
               pockets

                                     big dan
                         do unto others before they do unto 
                         you

               he pulls out their wad of cash

                                     big dan
                         ill just take your show cards

               he walks over to delmar who is on the ground moaning and 
               kicks him several times

                                     big dan
                         and whatever you got in the hole

               he takes delmars shoebox and flips off the top

               inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it

                                     big dan
                         what the

               inside

                                     big dan
                         its nothin but a damn toad

               delmar moaning looks blearily up through swollen eyes

               big dan has the toad in his enormous fist

               delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips

                                     delmar
                         no you dont understand

                                     big dan

                         give ya warts

               he squeezes the frog crushing it and tosses it away against 
               a tree

                                     delmar
                         oh lord pete

               big dan is over at the car cranking it up

                                     big dan
                         end of lesson

               he climbs in

                                     big dan
                         so long boys heehee see ya in 
                         the funny papers

               the car belches and pops and toodles off down the road

               delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass 
               of the frog weeping

                                     delmar
                         pete pete pete

                                                                   fade out

               pan down from black to bring in a torch

               flickering in the night we hear the rumble of distant thunder 
               as the continued pan down brings the torchs bearer into 
               frame  a man with the slavering grin of the dimwitted 
               sadist he watches as we hear

                                     voice
                         where are they

               there is the sound of a lash and a scream

                                     voice
                         talk you unreconstructed whelp of a 
                         whore where they headed

               another lash brings another scream

               the screams come from pete his arms stretched high over 
               his head are tied to a tree limb his interrogator wields a 
               bullwhip

                                     interrogator
                         your screams aint gonna save your 
                         flesh only your tongue is boy

               another lash another scream

                                     interrogator
                         where they headed

               a third man walks into the torchlight a hound drooling at 
               his heels he is cooley the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses 
               whom we remember from previous barn confrontations

                                     cooley
                         lump io

               the two men acknowledge by backing away from pete

               we hear a pat pat and then the accelerating pitter
               patter of arriving rain

               cooley looks up

                                     cooley
                         sweet summer rain like gods own 
                         mercy

               he looks back down at pete

                                     cooley
                         your two friends have abandoned you 
                         pete  they dont seem to care bout 
                         your hide

               he shrugs looks off

                                     cooley
                         okay

               looking up into black a rope is tossed up  it recedes out 
               of the torchlight into black night  and then drops back 
               down into the light a noose bouncing at its end

                                     cooley
                         stairway to heaven pete

               his lips his dog slobbers

               cooley holds up one hand the two men pause in fitting the 
               noose

               pete is sobbing

                                     pete
                         godfer gimme

               thunder crashes

               back of a haytruck

               everett and delmar sit disconsolately on a haybale as the 
               stakebed truck bounces along a rough country road they are 
               both illkempt and heavily bruised

               though still an undammable river of verbiage everett now 
               seems to be talking out of weary habit not conviction

                                     everett
                         believe me delmar he wouldve wanted 
                         us to press on pete rest his soul 
                         was one sourassed sonofabitch and 
                         not given to acts of pointless 
                         sentimentality

               delmar doggedly shakes his head

                                     delmar
                         it just dont seem right diggin up 
                         that treasure without him

               we distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting hollow
               eyed everett tries to convince himself as much as delmar

                                     everett
                         maybe its for the best that pete 
                         was squushed why he was barely a 
                         sentient bein now soon as we clean 
                         ourselves up get a little smellum

                         hunnert per cent better about 
                         ourselves and about

               his voice trails away as he looks out at the road

               they are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and 
               duckbilled caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side 
               of the road guards bearing shotguns amble back and forth

               as he stares at the line of men everett tries to pick up his 
               thread

                                     everett
                         and about life in general

               the prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust

                                     everett
                         jesus we must be near parchman farm

               the men giving throat to a dolorous chaingang chant do 
               not look up at the passing haytruck

               everett is haunted

                                     everett

                         year ago we bust off the farm

               the last man in line swings his pick and as he grows smaller 
               looks up everett stares

               it is pete

               lone and lorn he returns everetts slackjawed stare until 
               heat ripples and the trucks dusty wake dissolve him away

               everett blinks

                                     everett
                         pete have a brother

               everett shakes his head as if to clear it

                         heat must be gettin to me

                         earned me now what in the

               the screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to 
               sludge and stops

               the theater is dark and quiet

               everett and delmar and the rest of the sparse audience 
               look restively about

               a man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium

               he walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind 
               delmar and everett he scans the theater then brings a 
               whistle to his lips

               at his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained 
               men trot in at doubletime with much clanking they file 
               into one row and then that row filled the one behind it 
               they remain silently on their feet

               the first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts 
               scan the theater the first guard again blows his whistle

               the two rows of chained men sit

               after another silence

                                     first guard
                         okay boys enjoy yer pickcha show

               one more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed

               a hissing whisper from behind draws everett and delmars 
               attention

                                     voice
                         do not seek the treasure its a 
                         bushwhack

               everett and delmar turn and stare saucereyed in the middle 
               of the frontmost row of convicts sits pete  bald haunted 
               pete

               after a long disbelieving stare

                                     delmar
                         pete

               pete whispers again urgently

                                     pete
                         theyre fixin a ambush do not seek 
                         the treasure

               everett jaw hanging open can only stare as if at a ghost 
               delmar stares also but finally brings out another

                                     delmar
                         pete

                                     pete
                         do not seek the treasure

               everetts face remains frozen in horrified disbelief but 
               delmar finally accepts petes corporeal reality

                                     delmar
                         we thought you was a toad

               pete squints and cocks his head as if to say what was that

               delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth 
               movements

                                     delmar
                         we thought you was a toad

               pete shakes his head  didnt catch it  and repeats also 
               overarticulating

                                     pete
                         do not seek the treasure

               a guard murmurs

                                     guard

                         wipin little circles with his 
                         bread

               a noose

               in slow motion it is dropping dropping dropping through 
               the night we hear distant thunder and the howl of a hound 
               the sounds recede and the black background dissolves into a 
               pan down from a raftered ceiling as the noose fades away

               the continued pan down shows that we are in a barrackslike 
               cabin it is night convicts are ranged in bunkbeds their 
               snores stand out against the chirp of crickets

               in the upper berth of the foreground bed is pete his hands 
               are clasped behind his head a manacle and chain links one 
               wrist to a rail that serves as headboard

               he stares up haunted at the phantom noose

                                     pete
                         i could not gaze upon that far 
                         shore

               he reacts quizically to a whispered

                                     voice
                         pete

               a moment later everett rises over the lip of his bed his 
               face is blacked and he sways as if standing on a boat

                                     everett
                         hold still

               he is raising a large longarmed shortnosed pincering 
               tool he locks the nose onto petes chain and levers the 
               arms as his hand chinks free pete does not react to his 
               newfound liberty

               we hear an agonized voice from off as everett continues to 
               sway

                                     delmar
                         caint stand much longer

               petes eyes burn into everetts

                                     pete
                         it was a moment a weakness

                                     everett
                         quitcha babblin pete  time to 
                         skedaddle

               the three men

               we track with them as they walk through the moonlit woods 
               delmars and everetts faces are thoroughly blacked pete is 
               just finishing blacking his and he hands the shoe polish 
               back to everett

                                     pete
                         they lured me out for a bathe then 
                         they dunked men trussed me up like 
                         a hog and turned me in for the bounty

                         toad

               he tackles him and with his hands wrapped round everetts 
               throat the two roll over

                                     everett
                              strangled

                         pabyoulum

               they have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now 
               halfway into a clearing they abruptly stop

               pete lying on top of everett looks up startled by loud 
               chanting everett lying on his back tries to see as well 
               his eyes rolling back in his head

               their pointofview shows a great open field where men in 
               bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross

               pete and everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and 
               then push through with delmar

               the ranks of hooded men chanting in a high hillbilly wail 
               intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime at 
               length they stop in perfect formation still chanting to 
               face the imperial wizard who stands in front of the burning 
               cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold

               an aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the 
               burning cross before which a gibbet has been erected the 
               backmost row has stopped facing away only a few yards from 
               the bushes that hide delmar pete and everett

               as the chanting continues two klansmen lead a black man 
               whom they grasp by either arm up the aisle toward the gibbet

                                     black man
                         i aint never harmed any you 
                         gentlemen

               everett hisses

                                     everett
                         its tommy they got tommy

                                     delmar

               it is indeed tommy johnson

                                     tommy
                         i aint never harmed nobody

               pete is staring aghast at the makeshift gibbet

                                     pete
                         the noose sweet jesus we gotta 
                         save im

               a broadshouldered man in the middle of the ranks of klansmen 
               sensing something slowly turns to look back over his 
               shoulder he thus reveals that his hood has only one eye
               hole

               he slowly draws off his hood it is of course big dan 
               teague his one good eye looks about his other eye now 
               revealed is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed 
               sightlessness

               everett still crouched behind the bushes notices something 
               he hisses and points

                                     everett
                         the color guard

               off to one side is a robed and hooded threeman color guard 
               displaying a confederate flag

               in front of the crowd the imperial wizard raises one satin
               draped arm and the chanting stops

                                     wizard
                         brothers we are foregathered here 
                         to preserve our hallowed culturen 
                         heritage  from intrusions inclusions 
                         and dilutions  of culluh of creed 
                         of our oltime religion

               over in the bushes everett delmar and pete are straightening 
               up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods having 
               disposed of the color guard

                                     wizard
                         we aim to pull evil up by the root 
                         before it chokes out the flower of

               a huge roar  and now the ranks resume their chanting

               the color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the 
               two men leading tommy to the gibbet everett hisses

                                     everett
                         hey tommy its us

               behind everett in the deep background someone emerges from 
               the ranks into the middle aisle he approaches with a strong 
               purposeful stride  big dan teague bareheaded holding his 
               hood under his arm

               everett hisses again

               tommy looks back over his shoulder

                         huh

               everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind

                                     everett

               big dan whips off the other two hoods  delmar and pete in 
               blackface

               from the crowd

                                     voice
                         the color guard is colored

               big dan roars

               the crowd roars

               everett screams

                                     everett
                         run boys

               pandemonium breaks out and the imperial wizard takes off 
               his red satin hood for a better view

               he is the reform candidate homer stokes next to him his 
               midget also pulls of his midget hood

               stokes is peeved

                                     stokes
                         who made them the color guard

               everett pete tommy and delmar bearing the confederate 
               flag are retreating across the neutral ground separating 
               the mob of klansmen from the burning cross the mob pursues 
               in full cry

               when the intruders reach the foot of the cross delmar turns 
               he javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd

               homer stokes is mortified

                                     stokes
                         damn cant let that flag touch the 
                         ground

               the crowd gasps and watches heads tilted back in silence

               the only sound is the fluttering flag

               homer stokes eyes rise hesitate and start to fall as the 
               flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend

               we boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned 
               white hoods dead in the middle is bareheaded dan teague

               his arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kickoff 
               returner he squints up with his one good eye judging 
               distance and trajectory

               from somewhere we hear a loud boink as of a wire popping

               the flag flutters

               the crowd is silent

               big dan sets and

               whap he snaps his hands up and together

               he has caught the flagpole the flag has not touched the 
               ground

               the crowd cheers

               big dan looks around beaming acknowledgement of the cheers

               from somewhere another boink

               as big dans look reaches front again his smile fades

               his eye tracks up  up

               creeeeeek the fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall

               at the foot of the cross everett snaps its last guy wire 
               with his pincers  boink  and the four men sprint off

               whoooosh  as the crowd scatters the cross descends toward 
               big dan frozen looking up

               it crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates 
               big dan teague

               a packard

               it is pulling up in front of a town hall from which party

               pappy odaniel stands by waldrips chair with an arm draped 
               over his shoulder leaning in to murmur confidentially  
               waldrip sits stiffly erect as he listens frowning at a spot 
               in space

               suddenly waldrip erupts

               band continues to play he is parting his beard to hiss down 
               at her

               she shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate 
               as everett continues pleading to her back

               this byplay is interrupted by a roar from the crowd

                                     stokes
                         wait a minute wait a minute is you 
                         is or is you aint my constichency

               int rustic cabin

               far up some sleepy holler an old man in overalls and his 
               wife sit hunched before a crystal set listening to the tinny 
               voice they look at each other wordlessly look back at the 
               crystal set

               back to banquet hall

               stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks 
               apprehensively on

                                     stokes
                         is you is or is you aint 

               a disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug 
               stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words

               pappy is considering the crowd

                                     pappy

               he starts clambering up onto the stage

               two men advance through the clapping audience holding high 
               either end of an eightfoot rail when they reach stokes 
               other audience members help load him onto the rail

               onstage pappy claps along with the audience

               as they play the band members fearfully eye pappy who 
               advances on them

               pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and 
               does a little twostep the audience roars the band relaxes 
               performing with even more gusto

               stokes is being through the crowd on the rail jeered at and 
               pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit

               as the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars 
               approval and pappy elbows in to the microphone beaming

                                     pappy

               the steps of the meeting hall people stream out of the

                         cabin is

               his attention and everyone elses is drawn by a procession 
               on the street below a crowd carrying torches jogs behind a 
               man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being 
               escorted by four policemen trotting alongside their 
               nightsticks held across their chests in riotready formation

               everett and the rest of the soggy bottom boys descend the 
               last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal delmar 
               cries out

               heavy restraints

                         from my fingertips

               as he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder

                         top again

               black

               in the black we hear snuffling growing louder closer 
               slobberier

               a crack of light we are inside a cupboard its door is being 
               nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout

               as the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed 
               with light it contains next to a tangled bunch of hairnets 
               several neatly stacked tins of dapper dan pomade

               piney woods

               everett pete delmar and tommy are walking through the woods

                                     everett

                         will  with a mighty oak tree out 
                         front and a happy little tire swing

               they emerge into a clearing the cabin stands before them 
               it is indeed a peacefullooking haven with a mighty oak tree 
               in front there is however no tire swing instead three 
               nooses hang from one stout limb

                                     delmar
                         wheres the happy little tire swing

               two shotgunwielding goons fall in behind the four men and 
               push them forward

               moving forward reveals next to the oak tree three fresh
               dug graves standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough 
               pine coffin

               the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses cooley steps off the 
               porch the drooling hound at his heels

               the goons are shoving them toward the tree three 
               gravediggers having just finished their work emerge from 
               the three graves they are shirtless black men with bandannas 
               round their necks

                         is that right

               the leering goons who have been lashing the mens wrists 
               behind their backs pause their sadism stymied they look 
               to cooley for guidance

               so too does the drooling hound

               silence

               finally

                                     cooley
                         too bad we dont have a radio

               the goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy 
               task

               the gravediggers stand next to the graves leaning on their 
               shovels they begin to sing a slow and dirgelike youve got 
               to walk that lonesome valley sweat glistens on them and 
               trickles down their faces like tears

                                     pete

                         perhaps you should take a moment for 
                         your prayers

                         recognize us poor sinners please 
                         lord

               the singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell

                                     everett
                         i just want to see my daughters 
                         again  oh lord ive been separated 
                         from my family for so long

               the mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more 
               palpable than audible  the song it seems rising out of 
               the earth itself

                                     everett
                         i know ive been guilty of pride 
                         and sharp dealing im sorry that i

                         swear ill mend my ways for the 
                         sake of my family for tommys 
                         sake and delmars and petes

               the rumble is building

                                     everett
                         let me see my daughters again 
                         please lord help us please help 
                         us

               the rumble erupts into a deafening roar

               a wall of water is crashing through the hollow

               it engulfs everything and everybody the cabin itself is 
               ripped away the soggy bottom boys are knocked off their 
               feet and all is noise and confusion

               underwater

               a silent world everett tumbles in the current in natural 
               slow motion

               suspended around him are scores of tins of dapper dan pomade

               other objects spin slowly by framed sepiatinted family 
               portraits tree limbs a fishing pole an outhouse door a 
               frying pan a noose an old banjo the wildeyed frantically 
               paddling bloodhound a tire with a rope tied around it

               further downhill

               the churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly 
               created river fastmoving but no longer violent

               after a beat of hold on the rippling waters the surface is 
               broken by the upbob of a pine coffin

               the coffin floats downstream for a beat and then everett 
               pops out of the water next to it gasping for air shaking 
               his head clear of water and moving his shoulders to finish 
               freeing himself from the rope round his wrists

               pete and delmar emerge nearby gasping for air

               the men hang onto the coffin which bears them downstream 
               dazed they look around

               the inundated valley shows only the occasional roof or 
               treetop poking out of the newly formed river all is quiet 
               except for the gurgle of water

                                     delmar
                         a miracle it was a miracle

                                     everett

                                     pete
                         that aint the tune you were singin

                         in a moment of stress no the fact

                         they can hydroelectric up the whole 
                         durned state

                         france  and not a moment too soon

               his voice trails off as he notices something

               a cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its 
               eaves a cow has taken refuge on its roof it stands staring 
               at everett who returns the stare

               he shakes off the vision and clears his throat

                                     everett

                         tommy

               tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream clinging to a 
               halfsubmerged piece of furniture

                                     everett
                         what you ridin there tommy

               the furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current 
               and to keep his head above water tommy climbs in place 
               like a hamster on a wheel as the chest exposes its ribbed 
               upper half

                                     tommy

                         bottom of a pretty durned big lake

                         uhhuh

                         a 9000hectacre lake honey

                                     penny

                                     everett
                         yes but honey 

                                     penny
                         that wasnt my doing

               indignation quickens her pace everett keeps up and the two 
               are pulling forward out of frame

                                     everett
                         course not honey but

               we are now on the wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch 
               still singing from somewhere distant through the song we 
               can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal

               the secondtolast girl is the oldest she holds a piece of 
               string along which we travel still listening to penny and 
               everett off

                                     penny
                         i counted to three honey

                                     everett
                         well sure honey but

               we reach the end of the piece of string it is wrapped around 
               the waist of the toddler who lingers in frame she gazes 
               down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open 
               field

                                     everett
                         finding one little ring in the 
                         middle of all that water

               his voice and that of the singing girls recedes

                                     everett
                         that is one hell of a heroic 
                         task

               the string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of 
               frame

               a train track is thus revealed in the distance the rhythmic 
               clack is from the handpumped flatcar

               the blind seer pumps the car along the distant track singing 
               harmony under the wharvey gals receding voices

               the end
