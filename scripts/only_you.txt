super 1968

on a darkened living room a huge summer moon spilling silver
through a window

we move slowly across the mantelpiece where a pair of candles
glow illuminating family photos  weddings two maybe three
generations back  brides in white their young grooms at
their sides frozen in time  as we pan we hear two voices
offscreen a boys and a girls

                           girls voice os
               stop pushing it  youre not
               supposed to force it  youre
               supposed to just let it happen

                           boys voice os
               im not pushing it youre pushing
               it

                           girls voice os
               i am not

silence  until

                           girls voice os
               youre pushing it again

an exasperated sigh

                           boys voice os
               well hurry up  my foots falling
               asleep

                           girls voice os
               mommm  larrys pushing it

mom

                           mom os

                      room
               larry dont push it

and now we finally pan over to discover two kids playing with
a ouija board  for future reference the players are faith
age eleven and her brother larry ten

                           larry
               im not pushing it

                           faith
               wait  i have to write this down

a groan out of him  she grabs a piece of paper and starts
scrawling out a series of letters

                           faith
               grandma told me everybody has a
               soul mate

                           faith
               but most people never find theirs
               most people settle  im never
               gonna settle

she gazes up as the ripe summer moon slips behind a bank of
clouds

                           faith
               this way ill know the name of the
               man im supposed to wait for

the arrow continues to move around the board stopping on
various letters which she copies down

                           larry
               yeah but what if this guy lived
               a billion trillion years ago
               like what if he was a cave man
               and now hes dead

                           faith
               dont be stupid larry  if hes
               my destiny then obviously he
               has to be alive

another letter

                           larry
               yeah but what if he doesnt live
               here  like what if hes a
               cannibal in new guinea or
               something

                           faith
               if i live here then he lives here
               fate wouldnt make a mistake like
               that
                     beat
               and stop talking  youre gonna
               ruin the spell

another pause  another letter  then  ever the devils
advocate

                           larry
                     whispering
               yeah but but faith what if
               he does live here and one day you
               just walk past him on the street
               i mean you dont hear his name
               you dont get a chance to introduce
               yourselves  you practically bump
               straight into each other but you
               never even know it

right in his face

                           faith
               well know

                           larry
               okaaaaayyyy

the arrow comes slowly to a halt  and she writes down the
final letter as the moon again breaks through the clouds
throwing a bright white beam of light directly onto the name
which reads

                           faith os
                     a whisper
               damon bradley
                     she looks up
                      spellbound

up above larry takes careful aim then sends a water balloon
torpedoing their way  it hits the ground between them with
an enormous splat  they scream

int fortune telling booth  night

we move past them through a beaded window and into the booth
where a disheveled older woman madame divina is paging
through a copy of scientific american

theres a tap at the door  she checks her watch  curses
she shoves the magazine in a drawer then hoists a bowling
ball the kind with the iridescent swirls in them onto an
opening in the center of the table carefully positioning it
so the three holes arent visible  she flicks on a flashlight
above it  crystal ball

back outside the girl everybodythinksisgoingtomarryalex
is nervous

                           girl 2
               but what if she tells me something
               bad  i dont want to hear anything

                           kate
               they never tell you anything bad
               nobodyd ever go to them if they
               did

the door opens  the womans imposing hulk casts a shadow down
over them  they look up

                           fortune teller
               who knocked

like deer in the headlights

                           girl 2
                     pointing at kate
               she did

                           kate
                     pointing at girl

inside past the beads and sits down

               if thats okay

madame divina starts laying out a series of tarot cards
suddenly theres a loud knock at the back door  faith jumps

                           fortune teller
                     dismissing
               spirits

she lays down a couple more cards  then a persistent
psssstttt pssssttt  more banging

                           fortune teller

               to the freak show
                     as she goes
               just because theyre midgets does
               that mean they dont have to go
               to the bank like the rest of us

she lumbers to the back of the booth throws open a back door
and looks down

                           fortune teller
               what

inside faith is nervously eying the cards  her friend kate
peeks in through the beads

                           kate
                     mouthing the words
                      and pointing
               is that a bowling ball

faith doesnt understand  kate mimes a bowling motion
swinging her arm  faith shrugs  as the woman returns from
outside we overhear

                           boys voice os
               hey kate  larry wants you

                           larry os
               i do not

kate grins ducks out  mme divina sits back down  closes
her eyes  fingers the ball entranced

                           fortune teller
               something is coming to me  im
               getting a name

faith leans forward

                           fortune teller
                     straining
               this name is very important to
               you  da  david  no no

a faint breeze flutters through the room and the candle starts
to flicker

                           fortune teller
               damon

faiths heart skips a beat

                           fortune teller
               his name is
                     her eyes pop open
                      with startling
                      intensity
               damon bradley

it is of course the same name

                           faith
               omigod  omigod
                     getting up
               i have to go

she seizes faiths hand

                           fortune teller
               just a minute

faith freezes

                           fortune teller
               your destinys two dollars

faith pulls out two bills drops them on the table  bolts
for the door  but the woman stops her again

                           fortune teller
               hey

she leans in very close and pulls faith toward her  we should
sense that this is not part of the act  this is for real

                           fortune teller
               the truth is no matter what the
               cards say you make your own
               destiny  dont wait for it to come
               to you  you understand

faith nods  still in shock

                           faith
               can i be excused now

super twenty years later  saturday night

we hear pouring rain  but what sounds like rain is actually
the shower as we pull back to find mitzi gaynor washing that
man right out of her hair  south pacific is on television
we pull back even further to reveal three women watching
a big saturday night  theres a lot of chocolate on the
table

the women are  the adult faith  attractive a little dreamy
the walls of her apartment are adorned with reproductions of
famous works all featuring a similar theme rodins the
kiss botticellis birth of venus etc  bookshelves are
crammed with volumes of poetry  shes absentmindedly pulling
the petals off a bouquet of flowers on the table

also in attendance kate her childhood friend turned
housewife and sisterinlaw  kate is a pragmatist  shes
clipping coupons out of the newspaper as they watch  and
doing her nails leslie  big hair  good heart  not the
sharpest tool in the shed

as the movie cuts to a commercial

                           leslie
               im just saying i think it would
               be a good idea

                           kate
                     dubiously
               date police

                           leslie
               yes  a guy who says hes gonna
               call then doesnt ought to get
               slapped with a citation thats
               all

faith glances at kate  theyre used to leslie

                           leslie
                     blowing on her
                      nails
               anyway like i said ive given
               it a lot of thought and ive
               finally narrowed it down
                     beat
               a heterosexual with a job

                           faith
               well i dont think its asking
               too much to want to feel it in my
               head and my heart and my body and
               my soul all at the same time and
               to have that feeling to be mutual

               so you gotta be a little flexible
               look at your brother and me
               larrys not perfect neither am
               i  but we work it out  were not
               unrealistic in our expectations
               and we have each other
                     setting down her
                      scissors
               i think youve got the door number
               three syndrome

                           faith
               dont tell me oprah did a show

                           leslie
               yeah i saw that  like on lets
               make a deal  youve got the amana
               freezer and you can keep it or
               risk it on whats behind door
               number three  which usually turns
               out to be a donkey

faith looks at kate

                           faith
               i dont have an amana freezer

                           kate
               its a metaphor  its women who
               always think theres some unknown
               out there thats going to be better
               than whats in front of them  and
               instead wind up with nothing

                           faith
               metaphorically i still dont have
               an amana freezer

                           kate
               i think if youre honest with
               yourself youll admit youve had
               a chance at a number of amana
               appliances in your lifetime

she knows theres probably some ugly truth to this  luckily
the phone rings  faith picks it up

                           faith

               you know all the shrinks on donahue
               say that all those love songs about
               some enchanted evening are just
               a cruel hoax that feeds peoples
               fantasies

                           faith
                     a little
                      plaintive
               but somebody wrote those songs

                           kate
               so whats your point

                           faith

the machine shuts off  faith gets into bed  reaches for the
light  then remembering something gets up

theres a daily calendar lying on her dresser  she rips off
the top page crumples it into a ball drops it into the
wastebasket

and turns out the light

                                             dissolve to

of door number one  waves  the crowd goes wild

                           monty hall
               door number two

the distinct braying of a donkey can be heard emanating from
behind door number two

                           monty hall
               or door number three

a complete mystery  this one seems to glow

               door number three

murmurs of dismay ripple through the crowd  the curtains
part to reveal a shriveled old crone covered in cobwebs
who bears an unsettling resemblance to faith  the crowd boos

int faiths bedroom  night

faith shoots up in bed in a cold sweat

                                             dissolve to

ext faiths apartment  the next morning

faith exits her apartment and heads down the hall carrying
a wastebasket  she opens the garbage chute lifts up the
basket but as she tilts it her hand slips and a multitude
of crumpled little balls all those days go spilling out onto
the floor  she just stares down at them on the edge  when

                           os
               you need some help

she looks up  its dwayne

ring finger into peoples faces

dwaynes got a captive audience and is holding court near the
front door  faith is across the room a tray of food in her
hands  the doorbell rings

                           dwayne
                     ignoring it
               im not kidding  all over the
               metatarsus  corns the size of your
               fist and this fungus
                     searching
               you know the way tuna fish looks
               when its been in the back of the
               refrigerator for about six months
               anyway

his listeners start silently returning their hors doeuvres
to the serving trays  the doorbell rings some more

                           dwayne
                     to faith

as he walks away

                           kate

               he begged me to marry him  i
               didnt even want to marry him

                           faith

dwayne pops his head in

                           dwayne
               honey picture time

faith gets up to follow him  as they go he turns to her

                           dwayne
               you gonna leave your hair like
               that

her hair looks exactly as it has all evening  but shes
anxiously trying to somehow rearrange it as the flash pops
and the frame freezes

                                             dissolve to

int doorway  later that night

the partys over  theyre saying goodnight to the few
remaining guests  the door closes one last time  faith
starts cleaning up picking up plates etc  dwaynes standing
in the bedroom doorway unbuttoning his shirt already getting
ready for bed

                           dwayne
               this was really nice

                           faith

                           dwayne
                     putting his arms
                      around her
               and just think  this is only
               the beginning

he kisses her forehead  releases her  heads for the bedroom

                           dwayne
               oh sweetie you wont forget to
               pick up my cleaning tomorrow will
               you

she starts to respond but hes already disappeared  a
distant roll of thunder rumbles through the room  the
candlelight flickers  and the rain descends

int living room  day

a sea of white with a tiny face drowning in it  massive
sleeves an enormous hoop skirt tiers of cascading ruffles
drenched in acres of white sequins

                           faith
               i feel like the good witch of the
               north

kates helping faith try on her gown and veil

                           kate
               come on its not so bad

                           faith
               look how big it makes me look
                     she looks down
               i look like an alp

                           kate
               i think it was sweet of him to pick
               it out

                           faith
               i know  it was

kate positions the veil on her head

                           kate
               but what

                           faith
                     sighing
               oh i dont know  i guess its
               just not quite the way i always
               thought it was going to be  you
               know like in the movies

                           kate
               thats the problem  when youre
               a kid you think life is gonna be
               like the movies  dreams come true
               the good guys win people live
               happily ever after all that
               crap  turn

she turns  kate continues adjusting the veil pinning it

                           kate
               but one day you wake up and realize
               youve been had  of course life
               isnt like the movies  thats why
               there are movies

                           faith
               yeah  i guess youre right
                     beat
               i really like the wallpaper we
               picked out for the den

but kates just getting warmed up

                           kate
               let me tell you something about
               love  there are no prince
               charmings there are no glass
               slippers  love is hard work

                           faith
               i know  youre right

                           kate
               people have problems insecurities
               flaws and you have to learn to
               compromise to overlook to
               forgive  its not settling faith
               its life  real life

okay

                           faith
               i understand kate
                     beat
               what do you think of this garter

                           kate
                     careening out of
                      control
               i mean just how long are you going
               to cling to this childish illusion
               that its all supposed to be
               perfect  well guess what
               it isnt  not for you not for
               anybody

kate slams the pins down scattering them  a long beat of
silence

                           faith
                     quietly
               kate is something the matter

                           kate
                     shakily staring
                      up at the ceiling
               larry brought me flowers last
               night

                           faith
               is that bad

                           kate
               i think hes having an affair

she buries her face in her hands

                                             cut to

theyre sitting down  faith is handing kate kleenex

                           faith
               okay  now  have you talked to
               him about this

still looking down kate mutely shakes her head no

                           faith
               have you seen him with someone

                           kate
               no  i can just tell

                           faith
               after all he is my brother and
               i know he can be kind of a jerk
               sometimes but i know him pretty
               well and i really dont think

the phone rings

                           faith
                     reluctantly
               dont move

faith gets up and tries to head into the kitchen but the
unfortunate combination of the big dress and the small doorway
stop her  she tries a variety of approaches before finally
turning the hoop skirt on an angle and suspending part of it
over her head enabling her to squeeze through the doorway
just far enough to knock the receiver off the hook and grab
it

                           faith
               hello

kate wiping her eyes mouths who is it  faith shakes her
head

                           faith
                     wanting to get

kate hands faith a pencil and the back of an rsvp card  and
letter by letter we watch faith scrawl out a name which for
the second time in the movie we realize spells damon
bradley

the receiver clatters to the floor

                           faith
                     dumbstruck
               damon bradley

click

                           faith
               but wait  hello  hello

but there is only a dial tone  she stands there clinging
desperately to the receiver  a woman adrift in a life raft
whos suddenly seen a ship appear then disappear back over
the horizon

ext driveway  afternoon

faith still in her wedding gown is racing to her car  a
crazed gleam in her eye  kate is tagging after her

                           faith
               its a miracle

                           kate
               its a coincidence

                           faith
               the woman at my dry cleaners
               believes theres no such thing as
               coincidence

kate looks at her  so what

                           faith
                     breathlessly
               okay okay but dont you think
               its a weird coincidence  doesnt
               it seem like somebodys trying to
               tell me something  and not only
               that take a look at this

faith pulls a clipped copy of the days horoscope from her
purse  kate scans the column

                           kate
               taurus today can be a fresh start
               and a new beginning
                     dropping it to
                      her side
               come on faith they all say that
               in my case it means im gonna empty
               the dishwasher

she snatches back the paper undeterred

                           faith
               i just want to get a look at him
               thats all

ext roadway  afternoon

faith is driving like a maniac her hoop skirt crammed in over
the edge of the dash blocking the lower half of the
windshield

ext airport  afternoon

faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone
somehow manages to muscle the round hoop into an ellipse and
springs out the door

she mashes herself into one of those glasspartitioned
revolving doors but gets stuck making a few revolutions
before a couple of passersby help pry her out on the other
side

she scans a departure screen for the flight to venice and
buttonholes a sky cap  he points to the distance

she hikes up her gown and starts sprinting through the
airport jumping luggage cancaning through the turnstiles
dodging kids running up the down escalator

int alitalia checkin counter  afternoon

faith flings herself across the counter

                           faith
                     breathlessly
               flight 417  is it still here

the clerk gives her the onceover  he hasnt seen this ploy
in awhile

                           clerk
               may i see your boarding pass
               please

                           faith
               i i mustve misplaced it

                           clerk
               im sorry but without a boarding
               pass we cant let you on the plane

she starts digging through her purse at the same time slowly
inching her way past the little rope they put up to block
people

                           faith
                     a smile
               im sure ive got it here
               someplace

he smiles back  and tightens the rope

                           clerk
               great  because like i said until
               you find it we cant let you on
               the plane

                           faith
                     panic rising in
                      her voice
               you dont understand  the man im
               supposed to marry is on that plane

                           clerk
               okay maam just a moment

he picks up his phone

                           clerk

                           clerk
                     back to her with
                      a plastic smile
               itll be just a moment

we see a security guard approaching  the clerk starts waving
him over  meanwhile crew members off an arriving flight are
entering through a side door  using her dress as a shield
faith manages to wedge a foot in it

as the clerk turns to address the guard she darts out and
starts sprinting across the tarmac for the plane  where
theyve just finished pulling the portable stairs away from
the cabin door

as the plane starts to taxi the ground controller waves
frantically at her to get out of the way  with an anguished
cry she sinks to the ground as the jet screams overhead

int airport bar  afternoon

close on a shooter of tequila  a whitegloved hand picks it
up and downs it  when

                           os
               okay wheres the nut in the dress

the bartender casts a sympathetic glance towards the end of
the bar  points  shes a pitiful figure this bride in her
torn wedding gown getting bombed all alone

                           security guard
                     taking her by the

ext dwaynes apartment  night

kate and leslie are there  kate knocks  no answer  she
pulls a key from beneath the mat and opens the door

she calls out dwaynes name  no answer  nods to leslie

int airport  night

faith still in her bridal gown is waiting impatiently at
the twa terminal entrance  finally she spots kate and leslie
in the distance carrying a suitcase  she rushes to them

                           faith
                     anxiously to
                      leslie
               were you able to find it

                           leslie
               at the very bottom of dwaynes
               closet

faith clenches her fist in victory

                           leslie
               but  there wasnt a regular
               yearbook picture of him in there
               he mustve been absent that day
               or something

faiths face falls

                           leslie
               however he was in the marching
               band

faith brightens again as leslie pulls a contact lens case
from her purse  she unscrews one side empties the contents
into faiths palm  a fuzzy little image the size of an
eraserhead  damon bradley age 17 in the shadow of a tuba
faith holds the virtually microscopic black and white speck
up under her nose examining it lovingly

                           faith
                     touched
               thanks leslie

then ever so carefully places it back into the case puts
the case in her purse and reaches for her suitcase  which
kate is still holding onto

                           kate
               i cant believe we did this  do
               i have to remind you that your
               wedding is in six days

                           faith
               look i know you think this is
               irresponsible of me but think how
               much more irresponsible it would
               be to marry the wrong person
                           more

                           faith  contd
               what if dwayne and i arent really
               meant to be  is it fair of me to
               waste his life

kate reluctantly lets go  faith starts walking through the
terminal pulling clothes from the suitcase

they follow her into the ladies room where faith changes
clothes

                           leslie
               i think shes right  you shouldnt
               let a chance like this slip by
               what if hes really the one

               spent your whole life waiting for
               somebody with this name
                     qualifying it
               this name you got from a parker
               brothers game when you were

               of italian men  speaking italian
               with italian accents and those huge

pulls something from her purse

                           faith

he rings for the bellboy

                           faith
                     trying not to
                      panic

his polite veneer wearing thin the man pulls a key from the
honeycomb of slots behind him

                           concierge
               room 217  would you like to go
               up and check under the bed

she doesnt respond  he replaces it

                           faith
               well which way did he go

the man stares at her blankly

                           faith
               nobody here has any idea which way
               he went

                           concierge
                     icily
               once they pay the bill we dont
               usually follow them

kate leans across the counter and grabs him by the collar
pressing her forehead to his

                           kate
               maybe you dont understand
                     like shes
                      possessed
               my friend was supposed to meet him
               here

he starts to wrestle with her  faith steps in to help pry
kates fingers from the gentlemans neck

                           faith
                     to him
               excuse us

hes still coughing as faith leads her away from the desk into
the lobby

                           kate
               well he was rude

they sit down

                           faith
               i cant believe we came all this
               way and hes gone

                           kate
               you gave it your best shot  you
               tried

                           faith
                     a whimper
               we lost him

kate nods sympathetically

                           kate
               you wait here  im gonna go get
               us a room for the night

devastated faith stares vacantly into space

                           faith
               ill never meet the man of my
               dreams

                           kate
                     to herself as she
                      goes
               you and the other 99 of the women
               in the world

as kate heads back toward the checkin desk faith gets up
and approaches the doorman  she pulls the contact lens case
from her purse  unscrews one side and holds it out in front
of him  he starts laughing  she darkens  he sobers rattles
something off in italian gesturing toward the distance

ext streets of venice  night

the two women race along over bridges under streetlamps
faith is holding the case out in front of her sisterinlaw

                           faith
               just once more so youll be sure
               to know what to look for

                           kate
               faith ive seen it already okay
               if i spot somebody whos got a head
               thats an eighth of an inch around
               standing underneath a tuba ill
               recognize him from the photo
               otherwise im telling you its
               not gonna do me any good

faith starts stopping people on the street holding out the
case encouraging them to peer in  some of them look at her
like shes nuts a few shake their heads one man finally
stops  examines it carefully

                           faith
                     anxiously
               did you see him  do you recognize
               him

                           tourist
                     looking up
                      smiling
               candid camera right
                     he starts waving
               where is it

she snatches it away  continues on  but the crowd jostles
her  she is bumped hard from behind  and the photo goes
floating out into st marks square  frantically she gets
down on her hands and knees trying to keep people from
trampling it

                           kate
               what are you doing

                           faith
                     without looking
                      up
               he fell out

reluctantly kate gets down on all fours too  faith spots
the little face lying about two feet away  she strains to
reach out when a shoe mashes down on her hand  it lifts back
up taking the photo with it stuck fast to the sole

faith struggles to her feet scooting after the man whos
moving at a fast clip  she fights her way through the crowd
tracing his footsteps crouched to make sure its still there

hes heading toward the edge of the canal  is about to step
aboard a gondola when faith stands up and grabs his shoulder
from behind  he turns

                           faith
                     breathlessly
               excuse me sir im sorry but i
               think theres something that
               belongs to me stuck to the bottom
               of your shoe

confused the guy looks down  faith reaches for his foot

                           faith
               do you mind if i just

she takes the shoe turns it over twisting the mans leg and
knocking him off balance in the process  sending him toppling
into the water

                           faith
                     peering down from
                      above
               oh im sorry

but the shoe is still in her hand  she turns it over and
sure enough the tiny image is still perched there  she licks
a finger and triumphantly picks it up like a crumb
success  until a big gust of wind comes up whisking the
little likeness into the grand canal

int gritti palace lobby  night

a puddle of water is forming on the marble floor

                           os
               it wasnt like i did it on purpose

faith is dripping  looking like her world has come to an end
shes holding a phone book as kate drops tokens into a pay
phone

                           kate
               you cant really blame him for
               being upset  it was an armani
               suit

                           faith
               did i or did i not offer to have
               it cleaned

                           kate
               i dont think he understood what
               you were saying  whats the
               airport number

a maid walks by wheeling a cart  suddenly faiths eyes
light up

                           faith
               no

she takes the receiver from kates hand hangs it up

                           kate
               i just got a dial tone

                           faith
               the guy at the desk said he only
               left about a half hour ago right

                           kate
               so

                           faith
               so maybe his room hasnt been
               cleaned yet  maybe theres
               something in there that might help
               us  maybe theyll let us go in
               and take a look around

they both turn to look at the concierge  look back at each
other  shake their heads  kate picks up the phone again
faith takes it from her hangs it up again  looks pleadingly
at her friend  beat

                           kate
               i am not breaking into anybodys
               room

int hotel hallway  night

a wad of lire changes hands as a maid opens the door to room
217

int room 217  night

it hasnt been cleaned  in fact it looks like a cyclone hit
it

                           kate os
               so far id say were looking for
               a rich slob

kate stands with her hands on her hips surveying the scene
faith spots a wastebasket in the corner  she runs over to
it picks it up peers in

                           faith
               ah ha

                     charmed

                           kate
               a rich possibly fat slob

                           faith
                     hopeful
               maybe theres fingerprints on it

                           kate
               were not looking to arrest the
               man faith were trying to locate
               him

                           faith
               oh  right

she drops it  starts digging through the wastebasket again

                                             dissolve to

a small pile of garbage spread out on the floor  an apple
core a couple more butterfinger wrappers some tissue an
empty shampoo bottle a soap wrapper  nothing very helpful
theres only one more crumpled piece of paper yet to be
examined

                           faith
               this our last hope

she says a silent prayer  unfolds it

                           kate
               and shes going to be married in
               five days and it would mean so
               much to her if she could find him
               before her wedding day

tearyeyed faith nods

                           faith

               him if they have any idea where

he looks at her

                           concierge
               and then you promise youll go
               away

she nods energetically

                           faith
               so  how do we get to rome

ext country road  sunrise

somewhere in tuscany  where the landscape looks like one of
those old renaissance paintings  undulating hills
sundappled olive groves vast vineyards crumbling
farmhouses  they speed into the frame aboard a vespa  faith
is at the handlebars

                           kate
                     over the wind
               couldnt we just have taken a
               train

                           faith
                     shaking her head
               the book said they have a lot of
               rail strikes in italy

                           faith
               this way were in control
               besides look how pretty this is
               were really getting to see the
               countryside

they speed off  and a bug smacks straight into kates mouth

                                             dissolve to

later  the front wheel of the vespa is rotating very slowly
thats because theyre pushing it  in silence until

                           faith
                     quietly
               i told you a liter was less than
               a gallon

                           kate
                     snapping
               we wouldve had enough gas to get
               us there if you hadnt gotten us
               lost  besides a kilometer is less
               than a mile

                           faith
               right  so we shouldve been able
               to cover more of them

silence

                           kate
               boy we sure are seeing the
               countryside alright

                           kate
               im hungry

                           faith
               you know no offense or anything
               kate but i think im starting to
               see larrys side of the story

                           kate
               whats that supposed to mean

                           faith
               nothing

they plod along again in silence

                           faith
                     throwing up her
                      hands
               i thought all roads were supposed
               to lead there anyway

                                             dissolve to

later still  theyve stopped to rest  the sun is beating
down mercilessly

faith gets up stands at the side of the road arm and thumb
extended

                           kate
               i dont know that we should be
               accepting any rides from strangers

faith just looks at her

                           faith
               you expecting somebody you know

                           kate
               well you dont have to get snippy
               with me

                           faith
               sorry

after a beat

                           kate
                     wounded
               so what exactly is larrys side
               of the story anyway

                           faith
               i dont know kate  i just said
               that  im sorry  im just on
               edge
                     gazing into the
                      distance
               im afraid were losing him

                           kate
                     staring vacantly
                      ahead
               you think he misses me at all

                           faith
               course he does

                           kate
               you know when larry and i got
               married i thought we were so lucky
               we found each other so early
               people talk about spending their
               lives together how many of them
               really get to  but maybe i was
               wrong  maybe sooner or later
               everything wears out

faith turns to look at her sisterinlaw  she goes over and
kneels down next to her

                           faith
               remember in junior high when i
               had that halloween party  and we
               were playing twister  and it
               landed on righthandred and there
               was only one red spot left  you
               reached for  it but you started
               to fall

                           faith
               and instead of taking it larry
               reached out to catch you  he let
               you win  larry never let anybody
               win  thats when i knew  he was
               a goner

kate is idly doodling in the dirt with a twig

                           kate
               that was a long time ago

                           faith
               and you know what i thought then
               kate  i thought i hope someday
               i have somebody who loves me that
               much
                     a confession
               i still hope that

still looking down kate smiles ruefully

                           kate
               that youll find someone wholl
               let you win at twister

she looks up eyes full of doubt  faith nods solemnly

                           kate
               he went out and bought himself
               mens cologne the other day  did
               i tell you that

                           faith
                     concerned
               larry bought himself cologne

                           kate
               polo

uhoh

faith puts a consoling arm around her and they sit there in
the tuscan countryside  in quiet contemplation of the
capriciousness of life and love

ext country road in tuscany  day

theyre walking again both holding thumbs out now  and their
prayers are answered  a bright red ferrari comes screeching
to a halt about ten feet in front of them  they exchange a
look  faith dashes towards it  peers in the window
converses with the driver a moment then waves kate over

                           kate
                     lugging the
                      suitcase
               you really think this is safe

an interior shot of the car reveals a nun behind the wheel

                           faith
               id say so

kate takes a look inside

                           kate
               god the catholic church is even
               richer than i thought

she climbs in and the car peels out

ext streets of rome  day

the ferrari zips into the eternal city  a wonderland of color
and history

baroque fountains spout cool clear water kids play soccer
in the ruins lovers kiss in secluded corners elegantly
stylish men and women sip espresso in sidewalk cafes engaged
in conversations flirtations negotiations  all the worlds
a stage

they screech to an abrupt halt directly in front of

                           sister margherita
               ai monasteri

they get out and are still thanking her profusely standing
at the side of the car with suitcase in hand when there is
a whisper from behind

                           os
               do you believe in love at first
               sight

faith freezes  gazes heavenward

                           faith
                     like an oath
               yes

she turns  to discover that god is a practical joker  the
guy is talking to kate  slicked back hair ponytail a lot
of leather  he looks awfully young

                           kate
               im married

                           young italian stud

               no problem  i only want for us
               to be friends

                           young italian stud
               i am giovanni

he kisses kates hand

                           giovanni
               and you are

                           kate

               kate

                           giovanni
               you are looking for a place to
               stay no kate

               this is your most lucky day  my
               family runs a pension not three
               blocks from here

what a coincidence  she looks at faith  in spite of herself
shes a little charmed flattered by him  as they continue
up the steps

                           giovanni
                     suggestively
               i wait here for you

int ai monasteri  day

inside a hushed environment reminiscent of a monastery
the store sells liqueurs etc made by monks  faith
approaches the counter behind which one of those inordinately
fashionable italian women is positioned

                           faith
                     almost whispering
               hello  uh do you speak english

                           woman behind counter
                     demure smile

                     more thrilled
               yes  you do know him

anna slams her espresso down on the counter

                           anna
               e un porco

                           faith
               excuse me

she starts ranting in italian  faith pulls out her dictionary
and starts flipping frantically through it  kate comes over
with a handful of little bottles

                           kate
               what did you say to her

                           faith
                     still flipping
               i dont know  i just asked her
               if she knew him and all of the
               sudden

               oh
                     beat
               wait a minute

kate rushes to the door

                           kate
               hey giovanni

he comes running  kate hustles him inside and over to faith

                           kate
                     to him
               my friend is looking for her
               brother and she thinks this woman
               knows where he is  can you tell

                           giovanni
                     then suddenly

               ask her if she knows where he is

                           giovanni
               sa dove lui

she screams for about a minute  he turns to faith

                           giovanni
               no

                           faith

                           giovanni
               she did but she

she rips a napkin into shreds

                           giovanni
               misplaced it

more yelling

                           giovanni
               he thinks shes going to meet him
               at mezzaluna tonight but she

                           anna
               hah

she hits her inner elbow with the edge of her other hand in
the italian version of the finger

                           giovanni
               has a prior commitment

                      giovanni
               bless you thank you thank you

the proprietor rushes in from the back of the store makes
her apologize to the nice customers

                           anna
                     grudgingly
               sorry

                     thats better

as faith heads toward the door she yells after her

                           kate

ext ai monasteri  moments later

as they emerge from the shop and head down the stairs kate
is looking skeptical

                           faith
               all that proves is that she wasnt
               the woman who was meant for him

faith throws her arms around her in celebration dancing in
the street

                           faith
               and now we know where hes gonna
               be

he momentarily pulls her aside

                           giovanni
                     apologetically
               i must leave town for two days
               was unavoidable  but day after
               tomorrow
                     with import

than necessary

arrayed before her  is browsing how to make a man etc

nods meaningfully

ext piazza navona  night

they emerge from a cab into a dreamlike landscape illuminated
by the lights berninis fountain of the four rivers and the
strolling fireeaters performing in the piazza  everything
seems to be moving in slow motion

                           faith
               all of the sudden im feeling kind
               of nervous
                     wringing her
                      hands
               god i hate blind dates  why
               couldnt we just have arranged
               marriages in america

                           kate
               youre right  at least that way
               you could spend the rest of your
               life blaming your parents instead
               of yourself  smile

faith smiles  and they enter the restaurant  a sea of
frescoes flowers crystal and silver all awash in
candlelight  some enchanted evening

from faiths pov we see various and sundry men acknowledge
or appear oblivious to her expectant face  a smile here a
glance there  he could be any of them  or none of them

                           faith
                     through her smile
               lets get a drink

they take a seat at the bar  unbeknownst to them an
extremely handsome man at a table on the terrace is eying them
intently

                           kate
               arent you going to ask the
               maitred if hes here

its all come down to this  a whole lifetime of waiting
searching hoping

                           faith
                     suddenly chicken
               i sort of wanted to wait to see
               if maybe hed notice me first

                           kate

               miles and now youre gonna play
               hard to get

the man from the terrace is getting up  is coming their way

                           kate

               signals

kate glances back over at him  waves

                           kate
                     to faith
               well how come were always looking

               okay okay  you join him  but
               first will you ask if hes here

we watch from a distance as kate gets up and approaches the
maitred  he gestures towards a booth on the other side of
the room  she thanks him and makes a beeline back to the bar

                           kate
               hes heeeeeerrre

                           faith
                     nervously looking
                      around
               oh my god  where

                           kate
               hes sitting in the fourth booth
               down on the left hand side with
               his back to us  hes wearing a
               navy jacket  if you turn around
               you can see part of his right
               elbow

                           faith
                     not moving a
                      muscle
               is he looking at us

                           kate
                     glancing over her
                      shoulder
               nope

faith tries to peek around without being too obvious  and
slips off her bar stool almost knocking over the drink of
the person next to her  she grabs it awkwardly climbs back
onto the stool  then pulls out a compact and checks out the
view

                           faith
                     like shes twelve
               oooooo i can see his sleeve

after a beat

                           faith
               i guess i should just go over and
               introduce myself huh

kate nods  faith puts the mirror away  starts to get up

                           faith
                     sitting back down
               who do i say i am

                                             cut to

moments later  having gotten her story straight  she gets
up again

                           faith
               right right  okay
                     suddenly seized
                      with selfdoubt
               you dont think hes gonna think
               im too aggressive

                           kate
               faith  so far youve trailed the
               man halfway around the globe  at
               this point i dont think another
               fifteen feet is gonna tip the
               scales

                           faith
               right  okay  its meant to be
               right
                     a deep breath
               this is it

she straightens her skirt  starts to walk toward him again
when

                           kate
               faith

                           faith
                     turning anxiously
               what

                           kate
               good luck

faith smiles gratefully back at her  kate motions go on
then turns back towards guiseppe faith collects herself
a woman with a mission  begins striding purposefully towards
him

focused only on that special arm as with each step a little
more of it comes into view

only a few more feet  there is nothing between her and him
now but that waiter with the enormous tray of pasta coming
from the other direction  but alas  in a collision worthy
of inclusion in the agony of defeat the tray and all its
contents go sliding down over her  all eyes turn her way
and she stands there paralyzed in an agonizing moment of dead
silence  then with an anguished howl she dashes to the
ladies room  kate gets up and goes rushing in after her
and back out in the restaurant a pair of feet get up and
step gingerly over the remains of somebodys angel hair pasta

seconds later with an enormous wet orange spot on her dress
faith bursts out of the ladies room  and discovers hes gone

the women bolt out the door just in time to glimpse a man
in a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the
distance  in hot pursuit faith flings off her heels and
sends them flying  one of them bonks a passerby another
man clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket on the
head  we may get only a brief look at this guy but its
enough to establish that while he may not be dropdead
gorgeous any woman with any sense wouldnt kick him out of
bed for munching saltines either   theres an undeniable
warmth in his eyes

but faith doesnt see him at all because as he bends down
to pick up her shoe he disappears from sight in the crowd
and she races madly past him  down the subway stairs into
the tunnel and into a mob

int subway tunnel  night

she battles her way through the throng hopping up and down
to try to get an overview but there is no sign of him  she
dashes from car to car pounding on windows calling out his
name  until in a sudden whoosh the doors close and the
train speeds off into the night

but shes still running after it  desperately  until it
finally vanishes around a corner out of sight  and she sinks
to the ground arms outstretched in the darkness  in vain

                                             dissolve to

ext piazza navona  night

close on an abandoned shoe  a hand picks it up

                           kate os
               i found one

the two of them are wandering the piazza  faith puts the shoe
back on and with one bare foot limps over to a table  her
dress is stained her nylons are run a few stray noodles
still cling to her hair  basically shes a disaster

as they sit down

                           kate
               well nobody can say we didnt try

                           faith
                     not hearing this
               okay heres what i think  we
               find out what all the subway stops
               for that train are the subway
               systems really not that big in
               rome we could narrow it down and

                           kate
                     not believing
                      this
               and then what faith

                           faith
               and then we rent a truck or
               a car either one and we set up
               a loudspeaker and we drive through
               the surrounding areas and we page
               him

simple as that  kate just stares at her dumbfounded

                           faith
               what  my hair

when

                           os
               i like the style  i just dont
               think this color works for me

they look up  its the stranger in white with her other shoe
in his hand

                           faith
               oh
                     reaching for it

                           damon
               allow me

he kneels down and places the shoe on her foot  then gazes
up into her eyes

                           faith
               thanks very much
                     back to kate
               so what do you think

kate looks at him  kind of charmed

                           kate
               that was really sweet

                           faith

               professional help

                           faith
                     nodding
               like a detective

                           kate
               no like a psychiatrist

                           faith

               psychiatrist gonna find him

                           faith
                     to him again
               thank you

now go away  he sits down at a table nearby  stares over
at faith  she spots an italian policeman or carabiniere
standing at the edge of the piazza

                           faith
               im gonna go see what i can find
               out about speaker rental

at him like hes nuts

steps around him to head toward the cop  he sits back down

                           damon
                     to kate

                      amazement
               my friend has lost her fucking

kate turns to him

                           kate
               shes trying to find out where she
               can rent a loudspeaker

               what for

                           kate
               so she can drive through the
               streets of rome paging the man of
               her dreams

he laughs

                           damon
               no really  whats she doing

                           kate
               really  she thinks hes here
               even though shes never met him
               even though shes never laid eyes
               on him

                           damon
                     still not
                      believing her
               seriously

kate just looks at him

                           damon
               oh  well whats wrong with that

he gazes over at her gesticulating wildly in the distance

                           damon
               only if shes never met this
               guy what makes her think hes
               perfect for her

kate just shakes her head  dont ask

                           damon
               were they pen pals

                           kate
               no

                           damon
               is he some kind of celebrity or
               something

                           kate
               no

                           damon
               did he do some anonymous good deed
               for her

an exasperated sigh

                           kate
               she got his name off a ouija board
               when she was eleven

she holds out her palms  what can i tell you

a beat  then

                           damon
               what is his name

faith comes trudging back in tears

                           faith
               he said it would take at least six
               months to get a permit for a
               loudspeaker  and you have to get
               the pope to approve it

defeated she picks up her purse

                           faith
               lets just go

kate puts her arm around her and they start walking  the
stranger grabs his jacket off the back of his chair  tags
after them

                           damon
                     anxiously
               will you be staying in rome long

                           damon

                           faith
                     to get rid of him
               damon bradley

                           damon

he nods  amazed

                           francesca
               and youre the biggest mess ive
               ever seen

she reaches for her hair

                           francesca
               i find that very attractive

and she faints  dead away

int restaurant  night

having regained consciousness faith is across a candlelit
table from him  theyre engrossed in conversation  in each
others eyes  tables around them have all emptied  a waiter
in the background is trying to prop his eyes open

                           damons mother
               coming so close and yet just
               missing each other  do you know
               what i mean

does she know what he means

                           damons mother
               theres this poem by rilke i dont
               remember the whole thing but its
               about that  about waiting for that
               person and wondering if youll
               ever find them  and the last line
               of it goes who knows  perhaps
               the same bird echoed through both
               of us yesterday

                           faith
               separate in the evening

                           damons mother
                     slowly
                      spellbound
               yes

                                             dissolve to

montage   to the beatles i will

pension divino amore  faith hops out damons car  he waits
she dashes inside practically skipping

moments later having changed clothes floats back out and
they take off again  up above kate watches wistfully out
the window

dry cleaners  dwayne is there trying to pick up his stuff
the clerk is holding out a ticket  you have to have one of
these

the forum  the sun is coming up over the ruins  faith and
damon stroll through them  damon pulls out a doggie bag
sets down a little container of pasta for the wild cats that
roam rome

mcdonalds  romes golden arches  kate is munching on a big
mac and working on a postcard  dear larry  somebody
cruises by her table snakes out a hand reaching for her
purse  without so much as an upward glance she flicks out
a leg and trips him

campo dei fiori market  the enormous outdoor market where
everything from orchids to watermelon to live eels and
octopus are in abundant display  damon buys faith a gardenia
she puts it in her hair

giolitti  a gelateria  kates eating ice cream  still
working on the postcard  dear larry  nothing more
finally crumples it up

the spanish steps   faith and damon are sitting on the edge
of the steps watching the street show that is rome when a
local approaches with a polaroid  selling pictures  they
pose

                           faith
               my hairs kind of a mess isnt
               it

                           damons mother
               your hair is perfect

he leans in and kisses her  and from this angle except for
the clothes they look an awful lot like rodins version as
the frame freezes

close on the photo  she looks up from it

                           faith
               you dont think this is just
               infatuation do you

                           francesca
               oh no
                     beat
               do you

                           faith
               no

he takes her hand  both a little unnerved they walk  until

                           damons mother
               but  just to be sure maybe we
               ought to shatter each others
               unrealistic images of perfection
               you know each of us admit
               something embarrassing about
               ourselves

                           faith
               okay  good idea  you first

                           francesca
               me first  alright well
                     beat
               something embarrassing right
               something we dont want to admit
               in public

she nods  he thinks a moment  then

                           francesca
                     sheepish
               im a liberal

she looks at him with amazement

                           faith
               im a liberal

                           francesca
                     disbelieving
               no

                           faith
                     solemnly
               my car bumper has never held a
               winning sticker

they gaze deeply at one another

                           francesca
               well as long we both know were
               going into this with our eyes wide
               open

                                             dissolve to

ext via margutta  twilight

a lanternlit street of 18th century facades  a faint breeze
stirs the trees above  strains of opera float out a window
faith is looking around  finally though theyre not
overlooking anything

                           faith
               youre right  this is a really
               pretty view

he smiles

                           damons mother
               not this

he leads her out to the center of the street  tilts his head
back  she follows and they walk with their necks craned
back like two drunken sailors like two kids

                           damons mother
               this

and up above in the houses and apartments lining either side
of the street visible through the unshuttered windows are
gilded ceilings and candlelit vaults of angels  and beyond
those the starstudded indigo summer sky
               its all a matter of how you look
               at it

int pension bar  night

kates down at the bar talking to the italian bartender

                           kate
               so youre saying you think i
               should call him

he draws a beer

                           bartender
               he is your husband no

                           kate
               yes but  he was having an
               affair

                           bartender
               si

so what  he picks up a napkin and sets the glass down on it

                           kate
               the point is he was sleeping with
               another woman

beat

                           bartender
               uh huh

how much clearer can she make it

                           kate
               they were having sex

finally it dawns on him

                           bartender
                     nodding gravely
               she was your sister

                           kate
               no she wasnt my sister

                           bartender
                     shaking his head
                      in sympathy
               your mother

                           kate
               of course not

                           bartender
                     another stab
               your grandmother

                           kate
               look she wasnt a relative okay
               i dont know who she is

big deal  he rolls his eyes and dismisses it with a wave of
his hand

                           kate
               so how much longer til giovanni
               gets back

ext the trevi fountain  night

its all lit up  and deserted at this late hour  the water
glows ethereal blue  they sit at the edge bare feet
dangling in  damon picks up one of her shoes

                           damons mother
               i think ill have it bronzed

she smiles  then sobers

                           damons mother
               what

                           faith
               i feel like ive been wandering
               in the desert for as long as i can
               remember  with nothing but
               emptiness around me wind and
               sun  and suddenly out of the
               blue somehow ive found the oasis

he takes her face in his hands  solemnly almost mystically
kisses her eyes her mouth

until

                           faith
               there is one other thing you should
               know about me

                           francesca
               nothing you could say would change
               the way i feel

                           faith
               im engaged  im supposed to be
               married in two days

                           francesca
               except possibly that

she gets up  heavy with guilt

                           faith
               and hes a friend of yours  its
               dwayne

                      to explain an

                           faith

herself from his arms

                     to himself
               i had a feeling this was gonna be

she opens the taxi door

                           faith
                     on the brink of
                      tears
               how could you do this to me

                           peter

int pension bar  minutes later

kate and faith are both at the bar staring off into the

               to figure out what you want them
               to be and then they act like that

                     tearfully
               but how could he know  he only

                           kate
               shes not here

                           peter
               where is she

                           kate
               she went out to check into
               skywriting  i cant believe you
               lied  is this a genetic thing
               men will say anything just to get
               laid

                           peter
               no  thats not fair  thats not
               it at all  look something
               somewhere got screwed up  maybe
               some metaphysical wires got
               crossed  i may not have the right
               name but i was there  im the
               guy  im skywriting

she eyes him skeptically

                           kate
               you didnt think this would be a
               problem

he starts pacing

                           peter
               it was an emergency  i only lied
               that night because it was the only
               way i knew to stop her  i knew
               if i didnt id never see her
               again

                           kate
               good strategy

                           peter
               do you know i wasnt even supposed
               to be in rome  my boss was
               supposed to come to this
               conference and at the last minute
               he got the measles  the measles
               who gets the measles at
               fortythree  so they sent me
               and i wasnt supposed to be in that
               piazza that night either  id gone
               to the movies only it was sold
               out  so i was wandering around
               just wandering  when i got hit
               in the head with this shoe

he gazes out at the roman skyline

                           peter
               and then i saw her  and all i know
               is when i looked in her eyes i
               saw something light  and life
               and passion and yearning  and
               something else i cant even put
               my finger on something id never
               seen before

                           kate
               mania

                           peter
               whatever  and i thought please
               god give me a sign give me some
               way to keep this woman from getting
               into that taxi and disappearing
               from my life forever  and he did
               she told me the name  granted
               it wasnt my name but it was a
               start

he turns to kate

                           peter
               and if thats not destiny i dont
               know what is

                           kate
                     touched
               thats really romantic

she places a consoling hand on his shoulder

                           kate
               too bad she hates your guts

starts leading him toward the door

                           peter
               its just a name for chrissakes
               the whole thing is so ludicrous
               for all she knows this guy could
               be the biggest loser on the face
               of the planet  he could have a
               criminal record
                     throwing up his
                      hands
               he could think ronald reagan was
               a great president

kate shrugs

                           peter
               i mean realistically what are
               the odds that this is a terrific
               guy

                           kate
                     flatly
               ten billion to one

beat

theres a knock at the door  she opens it  its giovanni
 with a single rose

                           giovanni
               guess whooooo

                           giovanni

int cockpit of a teeny tiny plane  day

faith is strapped into the passenger seat of a miniscule
twoseater  whiteknuckled  staring wideeyed out the window
at a faint trail of vapor

                           faith
                     over the roar of
                      the engine
               are you sure people are gonna be
               able to read this

the pilot nods  the plane goes into a dive  faiths eyes
roll back in her head

ext pension terrace  day

kate and giovanni are at a table overlooking the domes of
the city bathed in the honeyed late afternoon light
giovannis pointing out the sights  a plane buzzes overhead
kate looks up  some faint gibberish is being scattered to
the wind  she shakes her head  giovanni takes her hand

                           kate
                     a little
                      nervously
               dont you have to be getting back
               to work

his eyes sparkle

                           giovanni
               its siesta

                           kate
               oh

                           giovanni
               you see in america they care for
               work they live to work  but in
               italy they care for food for
               love for pleasure

his lips graze her wrist

                           kate
               how old are you

                           giovanni
               what do the years matter  ive
               known you for centuries

int pension lobby  afternoon

faith enters  her hair looking like she stuck her finger in
a light socket  shes handed an enormous stack of messages
peter peter peter etc  there are a lot of crossouts

she forces herself to drop them into the trash on her way up
the stairs  then opens her door and sees the flowers  she
fingers one momentarily softening then turns resolute  she
pulls her suitcase from beneath the bed and is unzipping it
when kate enters grinning from ear to ear

                           kate
               hiiii

                           faith
               hi  whereve you been

                           kate
               sightseeing
                     sobering as she
                      realizes
               whatre you doing

                           faith
               packing

                           kate
               why

                           faith
               because ive been kidding myself
               because i realized you were right
               from the beginning  this whole
               thing was just a wild goose chase

                           kate
               so youve had a little bad luck

                           faith
               a little bad luck

                           kate
               okay a lot of bad luck  but that
               means the odds are probably in your
               favor now  this is no time to give
               up

faith smiles wanly  starts pulling stuff out of drawers

                           faith
               why do they read kids fairy tales
               in the first place  children are
               very impressionable you know

                           kate
               so youre just quitting  just like
               that

faith pauses

                           faith
               i thought you were the one who
               didnt think i shouldve come in

                           kate
                     softly
               and a fortune teller

                           faith

               meant to be  ive got fortyeight

               of dead ends that i am relieved
               to finally be leaving behind

ext streets of rome  twilight

faith is taking the same walk that was so magical the night
before  but its not the same  she takes a few steps tilts
her head back and trips  shes holding her foot in pain
when

                           os
               kate told me you were going home
               is that true

she looks up sees peter  turns around and starts limping
briskly back towards her hotel

                           peter
                     tagging after her
               is it

                           faith
                     stepping around
                      him
               because i know who dwayne is and
               hes reliable and stable and wants
               to marry me

                           peter

               so  is there something wrong with
               loving somebody whos safe

                           faith
                     exasperated

                           peter

               he  know who you are

he touches her arm  she pulls it away

                           peter

               hes a podiatrist  pain is your
               bodys way of telling you something
               is wrong  your toe is trying to
               tell you not to do it

she rolls her eyes continues limping

                           peter
               there must be something i can do
               something i can say to make this
               up to you  just tell me what
               it is ill say it  ill do it
               i dont want you to hate me

                     softening she
                      stops
               look peter i dont hate you
               but what we had was an illusion
               mutual wishful thinking  we both
               wanted to believe it for awhile
               but it was all founded on a lie

                           peter
               so

                           faith
               so it wasnt real

                           peter
               what about the oasis in the desert
               are you telling me that was a lie

                           faith
               no that wasnt a lie  that was
                     almost more to
                      herself
               a mirage

she looks at him  then softly sadly

                           faith
               dont you see  were not the
               ones who are meant to be
                     earnestly
               youre the man of somebody elses
               dreams

                           peter
               because i dont have the right
               name

she starts walking again

                           faith
               im going home  i never shouldve
               come here in the first place and
               im going home

he calls after her

                           peter
               fine  okay  forget me  leave
               me out of it  but dont go
               throwing your life away on somebody
               you dont love

                           faith
                     she turns
               who says i dont love him

a long beat

                           peter
               i see  well then go home  get
               married  i hope youll be very
               happy

and he walks quickly away disappearing into the shadows
she starts to call after him but hes already gone

faith is waiting in the lobby as a cab pulls up outside  we
watch from a distance as she hugs kate goodbye  the driver
comes in picks up her bag and she drags out the door behind

gets in turns over the engine  theyre pulling away when
someone runs out into the street arms waving madly

ext amalfi coast  dawn

they drive past sheer cliffs dropping off to silvery rocks
azure seas transparent depths  around hairpin turns skirting
the gulf of salerno before finally winding into the
impossibly beautiful seaside town of positano  an enchanted
land of steep hillsides overgrown with lemon trees jasmine
bouganvilla  cliff hanging villas emerald and sapphire
grottoes  cerulean skies  heaven on earth

ext le sirenuse hotel  day

another lifestyles hotel  an elegant old villa perched
above the village and the deep blue sea  the four of them
head for the desk where kate cheerfully plunks down larrys

               oh and i forgot to tell you  hes
               here with his mother

she checks her hair starts adjusting it in the reflection
of a window  then peeks around the corner

angle on a man reclining on a lounge chair  we start at the
feet which dont quite reach the end of the chair  move up
the legs past the pot belly to sure enough an enormous
gold medallion resting on his chest  a fringe of hair skirts
the perimeter of his head  and his back

a copy of mickey spillanes latest rests on a table next to
him  hes lying back eyes closed  this is damon bradley
this is him

peter smiles broadly  faiths face falls

                           kate
               thats him

faith elbows her

                           kate

                      anxious to
               of course

she doesnt move

                           peter
               do you want me to do it

                           faith
               no

she takes a good look  swallows hard  reluctantly
approaches

                           faith
               hi

he doesnt look up  she stands awkwardly over him looking
back at kate for support

                           faith
               uhhem excuse me hello

he cracks one eye squints up at her

                           faith

               oh  sorry

he closes his eyes

                           faith
               pardon me but

he squints up again

                           faith
                     like an idiot
               do you have the time

he eyeballs her like shes some sort of curious life form

                           man at pool
               do i look like im wearing a watch

he doesnt

                           faith
               no i guess not  i just thought
               maybe

when someone at the edge of the pool calls out

                           os
               hey damon

but the person shes talking to doesnt respond  instead
somebody else another man whod been doing laps in the pool
emerges

                           him
               yeah

this is no ordinary mortal this is a living monument to
mankind  he couldve modeled for michelangelo  mel gibson
feels like jojothedogfacedboy next to this guy  the guys
in the calvin klein ads okay lets say he looks like one
of those guys

kates eyes shift to peter who suddenly sobers

back at the pool a little kid is talking to damon

                           little kid
               thanks for letting me borrow this

the kid sets the spillane tome back on his chair

                           him
               no problem

he gets out and starts toweling off a halo of sunlight
glistening off his tanned muscular body reflecting in the
deep green pools of his eyes  she grabs hold of a nearby
chair as her knees start to give way

                           faith
                     barely audible
               youre damon bradley

                           him
               uh huh

                           faith
               excuse me

its never  she goes running back inside

                           kate
                     whispering loudly
               whatareyoudoing

                     spinelessly
               what if he doesnt like me

                           kate
               it means youre a completely
               worthless excuse for a human being
               and the fates have all conspired
               to make you miserable

                           faith
               my god youre right

               faith im kidding
                     stopping her
               is this how you plan to get what
               you want from life  when you
               finally find it you turn and run
               away from it

she gazes fearfully back out to the terrace

                           peter
               hey if she doesnt wanna meet him
               she doesnt wanna meet him

kate glares at him  takes faith by the shoulders

                           kate
               you have overcome everything it
               took to get here  every obstacle
               to reach this moment  this fateful
               moment  now its in your hands

she points toward the terrace

                           kate
               is that what you want

is this a trick question

                           kate

               around then

she starts to skulk away

                           him
                     politely
               i hope so

               would you be willing to have dinner
               with me

a slow smile creeps across his lips  why not

                           him
               sure

                           faith

                     extending a hand
               its a pleasure to meet you faith

he takes her hand  kisses it  peter rolls his eyes

she turns around and dashes back inside  we hear an
earsplitting shriek of excitement come from inside the hotel
damon smiles to himself

and faith is strolling through town floating on air  she
spots a dress in a clothing store window

int clothing shop  day

faith emerges from a dressing room in something summery and
flowing  she looks beautiful

                                             dissolve to

int hotel room  sunset

a jar of green goo  faiths plastering one of those green
clay masks to her face  her dress is hanging on the door
shes got rollers in her hair  she and kate are getting ready
for dinner

                           faith
               did you see his eyes  ive never

               so nice  did you see how nice he

relieved faith steps out from behind the bathroom door still
wiping green stuff off her face

                           faith
               hi peter

                           peter

               to thank you

he shrugs

                           peter

               out  i just met somebody myself

                           faith
                     a little
                      surprised
               oh  thats nice

                           peter
               yeah

                           peter
               and shes a knockout too

               well good  good for you

               need to fix this button  do you
               have a needle and thread

this is pretty transparent but she politely plays along
as she starts looking through her stuff he starts idly
fingering their toiletries  smells her perfume etc

                           peter
               so youre going to dinner

she nods

                           peter
               where are you going  just out
               of curiosity

                           faith
               just to that place down at the
               bottom of the stairs  nothing
               fancy

she hands him the needle and thread

                           peter
               oh thanks
                     really trying
               well have a good time

                           faith
                     heartfelt
               you too

as he exits

                           peter

                      indebted
               thank you peter  thank you so
               much

he nods and leaves  she looks at kate

faith emerges from her room and starts down the steep hillside
stairs that lead to the village  lights along the shore are
beginning to glitter a warm breeze flows in like silk  its
the sort of moment and sort of place where all dreams seem
within reach

down below she can see him waiting for her outside the
restaurant door  she pauses a moment to take it all in  he
looks up and sees her  blows a kiss up to her  she
practically swoons

as she arrives at the foot of the stairs he takes her hand

                           him
               you look like a goddess

int buca di bacco restaurant  twilight

a openair place overlooking the sea  waves crash
moonlight glistens on the water  guitarists stroll by
singing sentimental neopolitan ballads  its all almost too
good to be true  theyre led to a table and he pulls out her
chair  the perfect gentleman  a waiter comes over to welcome
them  asks if theyd like a drink

                           him
                     to faith
               wine

shes a little giddy

                           faith
               sure

                           him
                     to the waiter

               please

back to her

                           him
                     leaning forward
               you know i noticed you out at the
               pool even before we spoke  i could
               sense the chemistry between us

                           faith
                     a little
                      flustered
               really

                           him
                     bedroom eyes
               really

                                             dissolve to

the waiter arrives with the wine  pours  she raises a glass

                           faith
               well to new friends

                           him
               and more

they toast

                           faith
               so i guess youre probably
               wondering why i asked you to
               dinner

he sets down his glass

                           him
               not really  happens to me all the
               time

an awkward laugh  it probably does  damon picks up his menu
scans the prices

                           him
               well fuck me

she must be hearing things

                           faith
               excuse me

                           him
               nothing
                     clearing his
                      throat
               prices are a little steep here
               arent they

                           faith
               dont worry about it  youre my
               guest

she picks up her menu

                           faith
               what looks good

                           him
                     perusing it
               hmmmm well the scampi sounds
               good

small world

theyre still pondering their options when another couple
stroll in and are led to the table directly next to theirs
its peter and his date francesca  and this time he was
telling the truth  shes stunning  all suntanned legs and
skintight spandex  beaming he pulls out her chair  faith
just stares at him  as he moves around the table to sit down
his eye catches hers

                           peter
                     sotto
               what

                           faith
                     hissing
               what are you doing here

                           peter
               we were hungry

she turns her back on him

                           him
                     looking up from
                      his menu
               so what do you think

                           faith
                     distracted
               uh the scampi sounds good to me
               too

                           os
               damon  there you are

an elephant of a woman approaches damon waves her over

                           him
                     to faith
               i didnt think youd mind

she proceeds to plant herself at their table

                           him
               faith this is my mother

                           faith
               oh hello

                           him
               mommy this is faith

trying to conceal her surprise faith politely extends a hand

                           faith
               nice to meet you mrs bradley

peter drops his napkin leans over towards faith to retrieve
it

                           peter
                     whispering into
                      her ear
               mommy

                                             dissolve to

later  their food has arrived  francesca is rubbing peters
leg under the table  faith is trying to ignore this

                           faith
               so you say youve been to italy
               before

                           him
               a few times  its kind of an
               annual tradi

                           peter
                     to damon
               pardon me but could we borrow your
               salt

faith glares at him

                           him
               sure

he hands it over

                           faith
               you were saying

                           peter
                     to damon
               boy that looks tasty  what is
               that

                           him
                     chewing
               scampi

                           damons mother
               damon  not with your mouth full

                           peter
               scampi huh  i love scampi  i
               practically always get it in these

damon nods  swallows

                           him
               you want to try some

                           peter
                     pleased with
                      himself
               sure  ill trade you some of my
               pasta

they start cheerily exchanging portions

                                             dissolve to

later still  the candles have burnt low  the plates are
being cleared  francesca and peter are feeding each other
dessert  giggling  damon snaps his fingers at a waiter

                           him
               el checko por favor

annoyed the waiter totals up their tab and starts to hand
it to him  damon motions towards faith  she takes it starts
pulling out lire as he and his mother get up

                           peter
               say i saw where they had motor
               boats for rent down in the harbor

                           faith
               i dont know if thats such a

                           damon and his mother
                     in unison
               great idea

faith is still counting as damon and his mother peter and
francesca all head for the door  she finally finishes
hurries to her feet to catch up with peter

                           faith
                     at his side
               why are you doing this

                           peter

               right  i think i may have been
               too critical in the past

damon belches loudly

                           kate
               faith if i may say so you picked

they stare over at him

                           faith

                           kate

               a toad

                                             dissolve to

later  francesca is idly running her fingers through peters
hair

                           faith

               the sun also rises  for whom the
               bell tolls  the old man and the

                           him
               hes alright  for a closet homo

faiths jaw muscles tighten slightly as she tries to take this
in stride

                           faith
               how about music  you like
               classical

                           peter
               the boston pops  season tickets

damon yawns

                           faith
               well how about those old romantic
               movies with those great stars huh
               like audrey hepburn

                           peter
               actually i think i prefer
               katherine hepburn

                           him
               audrey was cool

finally  she smiles  damon spits noisily over the side

                           him
               too bad she didnt have any tits

                                             dissolve to

kate is listing things  faith and damon are nodding their
heads yes and no  never in unison

                           kate
               baseball  carmelcorn  organized

                                             dissolve to

kate checking her list

                           kate
               amazing  with the exception of
               fruitcake which lets be honest
               everybody hates
                     looks up
               you two have absolutely nothing
               whatsoever in common
                     rechecking her
                      list
               thats got to be almost
               statistically impossible

francesca and peter are up towards the bow of the boat
cavorting hanging on each other  faith is facing them with
her back to damon

                           faith
                     not wanting to
                      look
               whats he doing now

kate peers over her shoulder

                           kate
               hes tearing the wings off a moth
               and making it walk around

faith buries her head in her hands

                                             dissolve to

faith is standing at the railing alone gazing out at the open
ocean  when she feels someone sidling up next to her

                           him
               so what are we waiting for

                           faith
               what

                           him
               lets face it  you want me

he places a hand on her breast  she lets out a bloodcurdling
scream  peter comes running to her rescue  hauls off and
decks him

ext dock  night

peter and giovanni are forcibly dragging damon off the boat
down the dock  still onboard she and kate watch them go
in a daze

                           faith
                     numbly
               hes a jerk

                           kate
               yes  he is

                           faith
               i spent my whole life waiting for
               a creep

                           kate
               yup

                           faith
               i came all the way to italy in
               search of a weasel

                           kate
                     still watching
                      them go
               when you couldve found one in
               america

francesca steps past them off the boat

                           francesca
               do not feel bad  he was scum

ext landing  night

after the men are out of earshot we see peter pull this guy
aside  and surreptitiously hand him an envelope

                           him
               you didnt think that last bit with
               the bugs was a little over the top

                           peter
               not at all  you were perfect

handing him another envelope

                           peter
               and thank mrs walker too

ext boat  moments later

faith and kate are still there unloading a groggy mrs
bradley   she goes tottering down the dock as peter returns

                           peter
               you okay

                           faith
               yeah

                           peter
                     sympathetically
               i guess he turned out to be kind
               of a loser huh

she sighs nods

                           peter
               im sorry

                           faith
               i feel like the worlds biggest
               idiot

he finishes securing the boat

                           peter
               why should you be embarrassed
               he was the jerk

she doesnt believe this but appreciates the gesture

                           faith
               in spite of the way it all turned
               out though i want you to know
               how much i appreciate your helping
               me find him  i would always have
               wondered what might have been

he pauses

                           peter
               yeah
                     then
               well was the least i could do

                           faith
               no it was more than that  it was
               very generous of you  it was very
               kind

his eyes meet hers  from the landing francesca calls after
him impatiently

                           peter
                     reluctantly
               i better go

faiths eyes shift between the two of them

                           faith
               sure  i understand

he touches her shoulder

                           peter
               promise me you wont leave without
               saying goodbye

                           faith
               no  course not

and with that he gets up steps off the boat and heads down
the pier with francesca clinging to him  she watches them
walk away

                           kate
               so

                           faith
               so  i guess ive got a wedding
               to go to

faith steps off the boat and walks down the pier a solitary
figure who finally disappears in the mist

int hotel room  night

faith is packing  she picks up her lets go italy guide
and the polaroid of her and peter falls out  the kiss
she sighs  tucks it back inside the book  she picks up her
wallet opens the coin purse reaches in to pull out her
engagement ring  as she does something else falls to the
floor  dwaynes dry cleaning ticket  she stares down at it
then takes the ring places it back in her wallet  and picks
up the telephone

int her mothers home  day

her mother is sobbing hysterically  larry is there  dwayne
is there  leslie is there  leslies eyes meet dwaynes
meaningfully

ext boat  night

kate and giovanni are walking down the pier hand in hand
he stops her leans her up against the railing and plants
a massive kiss on her  after shes managed to catch her
breath

                           kate

he realizes where this isnt going  tries another tack

                           giovanni
                     hurt
               you think im just one of those
               italian casanovas  the guys who
               try to seduce every woman who comes
               their way  who prey on unhappily
               married women  who lure
               unsuspecting

                           kate
               giovanni

               thank you for making me feel
               wanted

she turns and heads up the stairs  alone  after a beat

                           giovanni
               kate

she looks back down

                           giovanni
               it was my pleasure

and he starts down the street  passes an outdoor cafe  with
an attractive woman in it  angle on the woman

                           os
               do you believe in love at first
               sight

int hotel room  night

                           faith
               kate is that you

                           kate

                           faith
               i didnt expect you back so soon

kate closes the door

                           kate
               well i realized if youre getting
               married youre gonna be needing
               the maid of honor right

                           faith
               actually no  theres not going
               to be a wedding

               and larry

               i dont know  ive just been
               thinking maybe this destiny
               thing is more of a doityourself
               operation  maybe the things that
               are meant to be are the things we
               want badly enough to fight for

the room is quiet  you can hear the waves in the distance

                           kate
               maybe

                                             dissolve to

ext hotel room  dawn

its a glorious morning  birds chirp  the sea shimmers in

suspending a banner across the stairs announcing a new play
the odyssey   one kid accidentally drops his end and it
goes fluttering down across her path  faith stops to retrieve
it and is handing it back up to him when she glances at the
window where the eightbytens of the plays stars are being
changed  the new star of the show is noneother than damon
bradley  only his name isnt damon bradley  its leonard
gilinsky  she stares at the photo  and suddenly has trouble
breathing

                           faith

               me crazy  no one in their right
               mind would go to this much trouble
               to win over someone as insane as
               you  did it ever even for one
               second occur to you how much work
               it was to set all this up  how
               many arrangements had to be made
               how many players had to be
               coordinated

                           faith

                     touched
               really

                           faith
                     realizing this
                      herself for the
                      first time
               yes

               and this is the thanks i get  i
               did you a favor  you never wanted
               to marry that joker in the first
               place

                           faith
               thats not the point
                     realizing shes
                      just given herself
                      away
               and what if i had wanted to

                           peter
               if you had wanted to youd have
               gone home

then more calmly

                           peter
               look i just thought if you finally
               got rid of this obsession with this
               name if you could get it out of
               your system once and for all then
               maybe youd be able to stop waiting
               and open your heart to someone
               real  granted ideally me  i
               didnt do it to hurt you  i did
               it for you
                     beat
               i did it for us

                           faith
               there is no us

his eyes harden

                           peter
               oh thats right  theres only
               him  mr perfect imaginary man
               you know i gave you more credit
               than you deserved  the truth is
               youre in love with the fantasy
               youre afraid of something real

racing down the corridor

faith rushes to gate 7  slaps something down on the desk
in front of the clerk

               boarding pass

she stops  breathing hard  uncomprehending  he looks at
the pass

                           clerk
               and this isnt for this airline
               either

faith turns to the window to see the portable stairs once
again being pulled away from the cabin door  deja vu  she
notices a side door  only this time there are men with
machine guns standing guard directly outside it  this after
all is rome

with her hands pressed plaintively against the glass she
watches as the plane taxis away from the gate toward the
runway to join the lineup of other planes waiting for
takeoff clearance  this jet which well call peters jet
is fifth in line

int airport terminal entrance  day

kate and larry come barrelling in

int airport gift shop  day

with an i    italy logo  and an enormous roll of masking
tape

a jet takes off  peters jet moves up a notch  three to go

int gate number 7  day

close on the ice chest  with a lot of tape wrapped around
it  and large lettering medical emergency do not open
and a little red cross  it looks pretty tacky

it  faith stops him

                           faith
               im afraid i cant let you do that
               hearts are very fragile

somebody else comes up  a security guard  he and the clerk
start conversing italian

out the window 

faith sees another jet take off  two to go

inside 

faith is anxiously looking from one authority to the to other
vainly trying to follow their conversation  finally the guard
turns to her

                           carabiniere

                           faith

               before

               in the balance

out on the runway 

the last jet in front of peters is given clearance  it races
down the runway and disappears into the sky  and peters jet
taxis into position  engines revving furiously

inside 

a whole flock of airport personnel are now conferring  a
crowd of other onlookers have gathered  a few of them start
mumbling opinions

                           faith

a cigarette in the other tosses in his two cents

                           onlooker
               let the nut go

off the runway back toward the terminal
