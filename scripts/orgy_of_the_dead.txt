	the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight  the

	   			shirley
			but does it have to be in a
			cemetery

				bob
			you wouldnt understand  seeing
			a cemetery on a night like this
			can stir in the mind the best
			ideas for a good horror story

	   			shirley
			but therere so many wonderful
			things to write about bob

				bob
			sure there areand ive tried
			them all  plays love stories
			westerns dog stories  huh

	shirley who leans closer against him

			just so i could write about 
			trees or dogs or daisies  
			huhuhdaisies  thats it 
			ill write about my creatures 
			who are pushing up the daisies

	shirley looks up at bob and smiles  he tilts his head down and 
	they kiss

			art of kissing
				
				shirley
			thats life  my kisses are
			alive
			
				bob
			whos to say my monsters 
			arent alive

			moon howl the dog and the wolf 
			and creeping things crawl out
			of the slime  it is then the

			radiance

	the mausoleum doors creak open on their own and criswellquickly stalks out across the clearing hiding his face 
	behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
	elbow against his face in dracula fashion

ext woods  night

	at the car accident scene with bob and shirley slow jazz 
	music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery 
	bob and shirley are still sitting on the ground looking 
	toward the source of the music

	thick bushes

ext cemetery night

	criswell nods repeatedly smiling at the dancer in approval
	the street walkers clothes have suddenly disappeared

	bob and shirley creep beneath the bushes crouched down low  
	they reach the edge of the clearing where criswell and the 
	princess of darkness are watching the street walker dance
	
				shirley
			could it be some kind of

	mausoleum again to start off the next dance

	the giants walk to the doors now wearing red and white
	horizontalstriped miniskirts or ancient egyptian garb 
	they pull the iron doors open slowly and we see the gold 
	girl dancer lying on her back on the altar inside

	the gold girl dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
	table then stalkingly dances out into the clearing  she is 
	wearing a metallic gold tuniclike dress

	we see a shot of bob and shirley watching and suddenly the 
	gold girls dress has disappeared

	the gold girl dance continues

	the giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
	slowly sprinkling them over the gold girl as she dances 
	she sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins


				criswell

	the giants continue dropping gold coins on the gold girl  
	she picks up the gold coins rubbing them over her body 
	in ecstasy

				criswell
			       excitedly

	the giants continue to the delight of criswell  the gold 
	girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her
	
				criswell

	the giants continue  criswell is thrilled and begins to 
	laugh loudly
	
				criswell
			    to the princess
			for all eternity she shall 
			have gold

	the princess of darkness laughs in acknowledgement then 
	claps her hands twice commanding the giants to finish the
	ceremony
	
	the giants walk toward the gold girl who is still on the 
	ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
	body  the giants pick up the gold girl who resists trying 
	to maintain contact with the gold  she reaches for it as 
	they lift her up
	
	closeup of a bubbling giant cauldron full of a substance that 
	is supposed to look like gold

	a few seconds later the giants lift the gold girl out of the 
	cauldron  her body is now entirely gilded and she is stiff 
	they lift her onto their shoulders carrying her like a board 
	walking in front of criswells throne then back into the 
	mausoleum laying her body on the altar
	
	we see bob and shirley looking dismayed

			well rest easy im not 
			angry with either of you

				relieved

	the mummy sighs in relief and the wolf man nods

				the mummy
			then it is some service you 
			desire of us

			damned  you two know them all  
			and i am tired of this usual 
			type of entertainment

				princess of darkness
			themoonis soon gone
			
	the princess of darkness points up at the full moon

				princess of darkness
			there is little time left for 
			the remainder of the evenings 
			pleasures
			
	the princess of darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
	the altar and walks around beside criswells throne

				criswell
			yes yes yes i know all that

				princess of darkness
			at the first sight of the 
			morning suns rays we must 
			be gone

				criswell
			i suppose most of the others 
			will have to wait for their 
			judgement until after the next 
			full moon

				princess of darkness
			it would seem so master

				criswell
			ahh but i declare there is 
			still time forsomething

				the mummy
			there are one or two which 
			should complement the nights 
			entertainment master

				criswell
			ahh good  then i will 
			see them  dismiss the rest

				the mummy
			yes sir master

	bobs hands are wiggling trying to loosen the rope binding 
	his wrists behind his back around the stone column
	
				bob
			the ropes are coming loose
				
				shirley
			be careful
				
				bob
			i amits our only chance
				
				shirley

				bob
			my guess is if we dont 
			take the chance pretty soon
			were not going to have much
			life left anyway
				
				shirley
			im frightened  im so 
			frightened
				
				bob
			hold on just a little 
			longer shirley

	the princess of darkness is leaning over covering her mouth 
	and whispering into criswells ear looking over her hand back 
	at shirley
				
				criswell
			not yet  i perhaps have other 
			plans for such a pretty one  
			no matter i will tell you when 
			andifyou may have her

	the princess of darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
	criswell
			
				princess of darkness
			the wolf man informs me that 
			the next one is the woman who 
			murdered her husband on their 
			wedding night  now she dances
			with his skeleton
			
	the skeleton dance begins

	the skeleton dance girl wearing a white dress and long 
	wedding veil comes into the clearing with a skeleton  she 
	dances with the skeleton then dances in the clearing for 
	criswell

	the skeleton dance concludes
				
				criswell
			      to shirley
			have you not enjoyed the 
			evenings festivities
				
	shirley is silent and looks downward
	
				criswell
			ahh that will soon change 
			when you become one of us

	the wolf man leans back and howls  he tilts his head back so
	far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
	skin at the bottom of his neck
				
				the wolf man
			wwaaaaaaooooooooooaaaaahhgggghhhaaaa
			aaaaaaaaahhggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh
				
				criswell
			it would seem that the 
			wolf man would have you 
			for his own

			wolf man and the mummy a 
			reward  it could be thatyouare that reward

			be so fortunate  your 
			existence will cease within

			see a man dance

				bob

				princess of darkness

				criswell
			the princess of darkness would 
			have you for her own to join us 
			through extreme pain
			      beat
			yet i am inclined for one as 
			lovely as you to be more lenient 
			i have but to touch you with my 
			finger and it would mean the end 
			of you all over quickly and 
			painlessly
			
				shirley
			no no no
			
				criswell

			fate live with it  i should

				criswell
			ahh there is yet time

				criswell
			   getting annoyed
			i know the laws of the night  
			i state there is still time

				forcefully

				criswell
				angrily

			i am the sole ruler of the 
			dark world  there is no one 
			to challenge my authority here  
			my word is the lawall powerfulno oneis to challenge that

			everlasting despair  now are

				princess of darkness

				criswell
			well then let us proceed
				
	the princess of darkness snaps her fingers three times 
	summoning the zombie dance girl
	
				princess of darkness
			she lived as a zombie in life 
			so she will remain forever a 
			zombie in death

	the zombie dance girl dances
			
				bob
			easy shirley  easy

	the zombie dance concludes
				
				princess of darkness
			the moon sinks lower into the 
			hills  we must hurry to the 
			finish
			
				criswell
			i will decide the conclusion
				
				princess of darkness
				impatiently
			you had the mummy cancel all 
			the others scheduled for this 
			session
				
				criswell
				interrupting
			then cancel my order
				
				princess of darkness
			themoonis almostgonecriswell

	the fluff dance girl dances for approval
	
	the fluff dance ends
	
	criswell looks over at the princess of darkness
				criswell
			the timeis short
				
				princess of darkness
			for what
				
				criswell
			your pleasures of course
				
				princess of darkness

	the princess of darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
	her long sacrificial dagger slowly moving toward shirley 
	gazing back at criswell seductively  she finally gets to 
	shirley and cuts the button off of shirleys shirt which 
	was so tight it was about to burst open anyway  she unsnaps 
	the front of shirleys bra
	
	bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a move merely
	stepping forward  he is instantly hammerfisted on the back 
	of the neck by the wolf man and falls down unconscious
	
	the princess of darkness raises her long dagger high above 
	shirleys head  but suddenly the sun rises it is already 
	high overhead and the night creatures lose their power  the 
	princess of darkness clings to shirleys arm as she slowly 
	sinks down to the ground losing all strength
	
	the camera pans around showing shirley and bobs faces then 
	back to the ghouls all of whom have turned to steaming 
	skeletons  only their clothing and bones remain
	
	quick zoom in on criswells throne  criswells steaming 
	skeleton still sits surveying the cemetery wearing his cape

fade in

ext woods  morning

	at the clearing in the woods near the car wreck bob and 
	shirley are lying on their backs on the ground just as they 
	were after the crash before they got up to investigate the 
	strange music that led them to the ghouls

	there are two doctors examining bob and shirley

	in the foreground we see a reporters shoulder and hands  
	he is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
	pad

				doctor 1
			easy miss everythings 
			gonna be alright

				shirley
			bob  bob

				doctor 1
			hes right here beside you 
			hell be alright too

	the reporter walks around and crouches beside shirley and 
	doctor 1 and continues writing in his pad

	a newspaper photographer crouches in the foreground to get a 
	shot of the accident scene and victims

				shirley
			where are they where did 
			they go they tried to kill 
			me

				doctor 2
			whats this you say  who 
			was going to kill you

			rest

			true  they all turned into 
			skeletons  sheshe cut me 
			here
	
	shirley points to her abdomen where the princess of darkness 
	had made the x with her fingernail
	
	nurse crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape 
	then hands it to the doctor  she cuts another piece of
	tape but the doctors dont realize this and leave her
	hanging
			
				doctor 1
			probably was bruised in the 
			crash
			
				doctor 2
			you know you two were very 
			lucky

				shirley
			i love you bob i really do  
			forgive me

				bob
			theres nothing to forgive 
			it was all a dream

				shirley
			you love me then

				bob
			of course i do

	the doctors put shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
	takes more pictures  they put her into the back of an 
	ambulance

	then after the doctor listens to bobs neck with a stethoscope 
	bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance

				criswell vo
