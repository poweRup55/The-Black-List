	evan throws open the front door revealing the airy foyer of
	the townhouse  the place is completely empty  he talks
	fast races through the tour  the three of them come in
	sarah still bouncing her basketball
	
	                     evan
	          this is the middle of the house the

	          and theres two bedroom floors
	          above
	
	the front door closes behind them with a thud so
	authoritative it seems to say no ones ever getting out  meg
	tries to get her daughters attention to tell her to stop
	bouncing the ball in the house
	
	                     evan

	meg whispers sarahs name but sarah still ignores her goes
	on bouncing the ball

	          highly unique property
	
	                     lydia

	sarah immediately stops bouncing  she wanders into the
	living room peers through the big french doors which look
	out over the courtyard area  theres another row of
	brownstones on the next block and all the patios back up to
	one another  it looks tranquil out there oasis in the city
	
	sarah leans up against the door sighs her breath fogs the
	window  there is a profound melancholy about her  meg
	watches her tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection
	cant
	
	evan flings open the door of an oldfashioned cagestyle

	she gets in the elevator and rattles the door shut with a
	bang  that kids got an attitude  meg takes a deep breath
	turns to lydia  she brushes her hair behind an ear we
	notice her thin hand is shaking

	meg shrugs whos that
	
	                     evan
	               moving through a
	                bathroom
	          master bath
	
	                     lydia
	          the hotel guy  its been in the
	          papers lately  his kids are all
	          suing each other over his estate
	          he was a total recluse paranoid
	          rich as hell he was worth thirty
	          million or something now it turns
	          out they cant find half of it
	               singsong
	          somebody took something didnt
	          belong to them
	
	                     evan
	          i hardly see how family gossip is
	          germane to showing the property
	
	                     lydia
	               low to meg
	          stop calling it the property you
	          sound ridiculous
	
	                     evan
	               through a closet
	          master closet
	
	from the hallway there is a groaning metallic sound the
	elevator and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
	puts it through its paces  evan winces speaks as if his
	mouth hurts when he moves it
	
	                     evan
	          could the child please stop that
	
	                     lydia
	          kid  no elevator
	
	she looks at meg and winks
	
	int  master bedroom  day
	
	                     evan
	          and we emerge in the master bedroom
	
	he checks his watch
	
	meg looks around studying the dimensions of the room  she
	looks at the far wall the one that borders the house next
	door  she looks at the wall that corners it opposite the
	window wall  she takes two steps back from it
	
	                     meg
	          somethings weird
	
	                     lydia
	          what
	
	                     meg
	          i dont know doesnt that corner
	          seem funny to you
	
	she points to the far end of the wall near the entrance to
	the closet  there is a mirrored door that leads to the
	closet and a mirror on the wall alongside it  if you look
	closely youll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
	toward one another which causes an optical illusion in which
	the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
	it is
	
	                     evan
	          i was waiting to see if youd
	          notice  on caravan no one from our
	          office had the slightest idea
	
	he pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall  it makes a
	faint click then glides open a few inches off the wall  he
	pulls it toward him opens it all the way a hundred eighty
	degrees and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
	closed door  there is smooth wall behind it but if you look
	closely there is a faint vertical crack in the wall
	
	meg looks at him  what in the world  even pushes again
	twice this time first at the top then at the bottom and
	the smooth wall clicks ajar  he pulls it wide open  meg and
	lydia step forward fascinated
	
	int  panic room  day
	
	from the opposite end of a lone narrow windowless space we
	see the three of them standing in the open doorway
	silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
	windows behind them
	
	                     evan
	          its called a panic room
	
	he hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead
	
	                     meg
	          a what
	
	                     evan
	          a safe room  an inner sanctum  a
	          castle keep in medieval times
	
	                     lydia
	          oh ive seen these
	
	                     evan
	          its quite in vogue in high end
	          construction right now  one really
	          cant be too careful about home
	          invasion
	
	the other two walk inside but meg lingers near the door
	looking around studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
	 water food packs batteries flashlights tools rope
	clothes blankets  you get the idea
	
	                     lydia
	          hey this is perfect for you

	          reinforced steel core walls  buried
	          phone line completely separate not
	          connected to the houses main line
	          and never exposed throughout the
	          houses infrastructure or outside
	          the house  you can call the
	          police nobody can cut you off
	          your own ventilation system
	          complete with oxygen scrubber so
	          youve got plenty of fresh air for
	          as long as you like  and a bank of
	          video monitors 
	
	he hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors
	revealing a dozen different views of the house
	
	                     evan
	           covering almost every corner of
	          the house
	
	meg nods starting to sweat
	
	                     meg
	          makes me nervous
	
	                     lydia

	          the furniture guy
	
	                     meg
	               giving up
	          whats to keep them from prying open
	          the door
	
	evan reaches past meg and pushes a red button on the wall
	behind her  with a sudden whang of steel a heavy metal door
	leaps out of a slot in the wall and slams shut like a
	submarine hatch  a series of metal latches click into place
	inside it from top to bottom securing it into place
	
	                     evan
	          steel four inches thick
	
	meg takes a step back  theyre now enclosed in the room
	
	                     evan
	          everythings springloaded even if
	          the powers out its fully
	          functional
	
	                     meg
	          open it
	
	                     lydia
	          old bernie didnt miss a trick with

	          thats highly inappropriate
	
	                     meg
	          i said open the door
	
	evan hits a green button and the door groans slowly open
	recoiling its massive spring and revealing sarah the little
	girl standing in the entryway grinning widely
	
	                     sarah
	          my room  definitely my room
	
	she bolts in just as her mother bolts out
	
	int  master bedroom  day
	
	meg stands just outside the door to the panic room regaining
	her composure  not crazy about tight spaces  which we
	already knew
	
	                     lydia
	          that door is a safely hazard
	
	                     evan
	          not at all
	
	he points  theres a tiny red beam that shines across the
	doorway one at shoulder height 
	
	                     evan
	          infrared  like the beam in an
	          elevator doorway  wont let the
	          door close if somethings blocking
	          it
	
	 and one at shin height  even bend down blocks the one at
	shin height with his hand
	
	                     evan
	          watch
	
	he reaches up to push the close button but with one hand
	anchored at the floor he cant quite reach it
	
	                     evan
	               to lydia
	          push that button for me will you
	
	                     meg
	          dont
	
	lydia pushes the close button nothing happens  evan pulls
	his hand put of the beam takes a step back  lydia pushes
	the button again
	
	whang  the metal door rockets shut the metallic slang
	reverberating in the room  almost immediately the fake
	piece of wall hums shut of its own accord followed a moment
	later by the mirror which detaches itself from the back of
	the closet door and hums silently back into place closing
	over the hidden door making the corner of the room look like
	a corner again
	
	as the mirrored door closes it shows meg her own reflection
	she looks at herself still rattled  she wipes a trickle of
	sweat from the side of her face
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  townhouse  foyer  day
	
	the same house two weeks later  the entry floor is piled
	high with moving boxes  sarah and meg lie sprawled out in
	the middle of the black and white tile arms and legs splayed
	wide exhausted
	
	they stare up at the ceiling beat
	
	                     sarah
	          too many stairs

	meg dressed in an old knicks tshirt and boxer shorts
	stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom reading
	from an instruction manual  shes frustrated  she mutters
	slurring a bit drunk

	beeps at her disapprovingly  shes doing something wrong
	
	she sighs sits on the floor gets serious about figuring out
	the instructions

	her fingers
	
	dance over the alarm panel some time later  she seems to
	have figured it out and a small light on the panel lights
	up
	
	system armed
	
	the very moment the red light goes on we cut sharply to 
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	 the darkened panic room where the dozen small video
	screens all suddenly wink to life showing a dozen views of
	the house  whatever she pushed turned these on too probably
	not what she meant to do but at least she got the alarm on
	for the night
	
	the door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
	hangs open  in the middle of the floor in here somebody has
	made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions  sarah must
	have been playing here before bed
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom
	
	she fills a glass of water puts it on a box shes using for
	a night table
	
	she plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone places the
	phone in the cradle  it beeps  charging
	
	she sets the digital clock puts it next to the glass of
	water  its 1226
	
	she gets in bed her side the left side
	
	she lies in the dark half an acre of empty bed across from
	her
	
	we drift off her see the clock again  the time changes the
	number one dissolves away changing the time to 
	
	                                             dissolve to
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	 226  meg is in a hard boozy sleep  we drift out the
	door of the master bedroom into the third floor hallway and
	down the open stairwell  we glide through the entry floor
	still gently falling through the stairwells airway dropping
	even further all the way down to the kitchen floor the
	ground floor
	
	we drift across the darkened kitchen serpentine through the
	canyon of moving boxes approach the window that looks out on
	the street
	
	we move right up against the window peer through the glass
	just as 
	
	 a van pulls up across the street and stops  cant see
	through its windows  no movement for a moment then the
	drivers door opens and a man climbs out  he wears dark
	clothes
	
	the man closes the door looks both ways and starts across
	the street towards us  hes carrying a bag of some kind
	
	he goes to the door and we drift down toward the doorknob
	we hear a key slide into the door rattle
	
	but the lock doesnt turn  the key slides out back in
	again jiggles  still wont open the door
	
	the man steps away from the door goes to the kitchen window
	which is heavily barred and peers inside right at us
	cant see anything its darker in here than it is out there
	
	he turns looks both ways on the street again then steps up
	onto the window ledge  now we can only see his legs cant
	tell what hes doing  hes reaching up stretching for
	something  it drops into view with a metallic scrape
	
	the fire escape
	
	the man climbs his feet disappearing from our field of
	vision
	
	we turn around facing the other way in the kitchen  we
	start back the way we came through the canyon of boxes in
	the kitchen toward the stairwell
	
	int  stairwell  night
	
	back in the stairwell the exact reverse of the shot we saw
	earlier  were drifting up off the kitchen floor through
	the entry floor and as we rise we notice something all the
	way up on the roof that we couldnt see before when we were
	looking down
	
	a skylight  we continue to rise drawn toward it  we move
	up through the master bedroom floor creeping up alongside
	the stair banister now reaching the top floor of the house
	and just as we near the skylight 
	
	 a figure appears visible through it  the man in dark
	clothes on the roof now  he stops peers down through the
	skylight looking at us without seeing us again
	
	he steps across the skylight  this is not the way he intends
	to enter  we drift again following his soft footsteps on
	the roof which we can hear faintly through the ceiling
	
	here in the hall just outside sarahs bedroom a closet door
	is ajar  we squeeze through the gap and into the closet
	
	in the closet
	
	its completely dark  cant see a thing  but then a sliver
	of light appears coming from above  we look up
	
	there is a ladder thats bolted to the wall in this closet
	it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling
	
	roof access  and that roof access panel is moving ever so
	slightly moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting
	a shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
	edges of the portal
	
	it slithers along the edge of the hatchway searching for
	something  it finds a small round nub in the crack  the
	silver something stops  it hums with electricity for a
	moment then there is a bright spark and a soft crack
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the master bedroom a message appears on the alarm panel
	
	zone 19 disabled
	
	int  closet  night
	
	in the closet the silver something withdraws and the roof
	access panel is removed  a million stars are visible in the
	night sky above  but were inside
	
	and in a moment so is this intruder  the man peers down
	through the open hatchway then slips through the opening and
	climbs silently down the ladder
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in bed meg stirs  an alcohol sleep is a restless one and
	shes suffering
	
	she sits up groggily chugs a glass of water  lies down
	again
	
	int  fourth floor hallway  night
	
	one floor up the man steps into the hallway and starts for
	the stairs moving quickly and confidently  knows where hes
	going knows what he wants  he starts down the stairs
	happens to glance to the side as he does so
	
	he freezes  hes looking in the open doorway of the top
	floor bathroom staring hard at something that clearly
	disturbs him
	
	a nightlight  plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
	bathroom  for the record its the power puff girls  the
	man climbs the stairs again concerned goes to the door of
	the bathroom  he looks from the nightlight to the
	countertop
	
	theres a moving box on the countertop  his eyes widen
	this is news to him bad news
	
	he takes a step back and a breath  he turns looks to the
	end of the hall  his eyes now adjusted to the darkness he
	notices something he didnt see before something coming from
	under the door to the fourth floor bedroom
	
	light  from inside  from another nightlight
	
	int  sarahs bedroom  night
	
	in the top floor bedroom a nightlight burns in another
	outlet  nearby sarah is asleep in bed the covers kicked
	off
	
	the door to sarahs bedroom glides open terribly slowly
	the man stands in the doorway staring aghast at the
	mountain of moving boxes piled in the room  his gaze falls
	on sarah in the bed
	
	the man just stares beside himself  his lips mouth a word
	soundlessly  doesnt take a lip reader to guess it
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the master bedroom meg flops over in bed facing away
	from the doorway really having a rough go of it  she slept
	too hard before now shes awake her head is killing her
	shes really paying the price of four glasses of wine
	
	she lies still on her side facing us
	
	behind her the bedroom door moves silently
	
	opening
	
	the man stands there one finger still on the door hes just
	pushed open  he stares at the sleeping form of meg on the
	bed whose back is to him  he has no idea shes awake
	
	meg lies in bed eyes wide open no idea a man is standing in
	the doorway to her bedroom
	
	noiselessly the man moves away down the hall  the moment
	his head disappears down the stairwell 
	
	 meg flops over again facing the doorway  she closes her
	eyes gives sleep another try
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	the man walks across the kitchen shaking his head in
	exasperation at the packing boxes all around him  he goes to
	the front window peers outside  he reaches for a light
	switch on his right
	
	through the window we can see the stoop light go on  then
	off then on and off again
	
	still through the window we see the side panel door of the
	van slide open
	
	two more men climb out  they are also dressed in dark
	clothes  they also carry satchels
	
	they walks calmly across the street grow large in the window
	as they approach us  the first intruder who has a name
	its burnham steps over to the kitchen door runs his
	silvery strip through the gap  another hum and spark
	
	an alarm panel
	
	flashes again
	
	zone 1 disabled
	
	in the kitchen
	
	burnham opens the kitchen door letting the two other guys
	slip inside  raoul is a hulking figure whose back seems to
	rise up over the top of his slouching head when he walks it
	looks like gravity does all the work just pulling him
	forward  junior is much smaller very highstrung dresses
	like a homey very street but cant hide the fact that the
	street is park avenue
	
	they all freeze staring at the moving boxes

	charger  the phone slips from her fingers bounces off the
	corner of the table caroms off her foot and skitters under

	steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall 
	
	 and whangs shut in a splitsecond
	
	int  master bedroom  night

	but safe
	
	she spots the telephone the one with the special buried
	phone line  she lunges for it snatches it from its cradle

	pounding on it with his fists screaming no over and over
	again crazy with rage
	
	raoul stands in the middle of the room chest heaving hands
	on his knees
	
	burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway
	looks from raoul to junior to the door to the panic room
	figures out the situation
	
	                     burnham
	          tell me tell me theyre not in

	we rise up further still above where the ceiling ought to
	be to look down on this room and the one beside it the room
	behind the four inches of reinforced steel the panic room in
	which meg and sarah kneel in the middle of the floor holding
	each other tight
	
	standoff

	                     sarah

	          nope
	
	                     meg

	                     sarah
	          huh uh
	
	she checks her wristwatch for some reason
	
	                     sarah
	          dont worry about me
	
	the implications being worry about yourself
	
	sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors studies
	them  meg crawls over to join her  they scan the screens
	
	on the monitors
	
	there are a dozen different views of the house  front stoop
	kitchen  dining room  entry floor  living room  master
	bedroom  den  top floor bedrooms both of them  top two
	floor hallways  even one with a shot of the inside of the
	elevator
	
	the three intruders are gathered in the living room standing
	in a tight circle having a hell of an argument  lots of
	gesturing fingers jabbing in chests but we cant hear a
	word
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg furrows her brow noticing something interesting to the
	right of the video monitors  she slides over studies a
	panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
	grilled area
	
	                     meg
	          hey
	
	sarah joins her looks at the buttons  each one is labeled
	with a different room name  den kitchen master bedroom
	etc  up in the corner there is a button that says all
	page down in the opposite corner theres a button marked
	talk
	
	meg looks at sarah
	
	                     sarah
	          go ahead
	
	meg is reluctant frightened  sarah is encouraging for the
	first time
	
	                     sarah
	          you can do it
	
	meg leans forward clears her throat
	
	int  living room  night
	
	burnham raoul and junior are standing in the halfdarkened
	living room in the middle of their argument when a voice
	booms around them
	
	                     meg os
	          excuse me
	
	they practically jump out of their shoes looking around for
	the source of the voice
	
	                     meg os
	          the police are on their way
	
	only burnham has remained relatively calm  after he gets
	over the initial shock he walks toward the tiny camera
	thats hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
	stares up at it  raoul who has taken off his ski mask is
	careful to move out of the cameras range and turn his back
	to it
	
	                     meg
	          i suggest you leave
	
	on the monitors
	
	burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head wagging a
	finger from side to side  he raises a hand makes a gesture
	like a telephone then wags his finger again  the message is
	clear  you dont have a phone
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg is puzzled
	
	                     meg
	          howd he know that
	
	she presses the talk button again
	
	                     meg
	               into speaker
	          take what you want and get out
	
	that sounded fairly tough  she looks at the monitor again
	
	on the monitors
	
	the three of them have an urgent whispered conference then
	they all start patting their pockets for some reason turning
	in circles looking for something
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg and sarah watch them confused
	
	on the monitors
	
	burnham holds up a finger to the camera  wait a second 
	while raoul and junior rush off screen looking for
	something  junior returns a moment later holding something
	and the three of them hunch over a box working on something
	
	after a moment they break apart and junior steps up to the
	camera holding a pad of paper  he shows it to the camera
	on the top page in big block letters theyve written
	
	what we want
	
	after a suitable pause for reading he turns to the second
	page where four more words are written
	
	is in that room
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah gasps meg sits back
	
	                     meg
	          what we want is in that room
	
	                     sarah

	                     meg
	          no i told you they cant  its
	          not a possibility
	
	angry she sits forward and jabs the talk button
	
	                     meg
	               into speaker
	          what do you know about this room
	
	on the monitors
	
	there is more frenzied writing more arguing and a first
	draft of a response torn up  finally junior steps forward
	with another sign
	
	more than you
	
	in the panic room
	
	megs confidence is ebbing but she doesnt want to show it
	she hits the talk button again
	
	                     meg
	               into speaker
	          were not coming out  were not
	          letting you in  get out of my
	          house

	               into speaker
	          get the fuck out of my house
	
	she clicks off again looks to sarah for approval and gets
	it sort of in sarahs halfsmile  but sarahs eyes go back
	to the screen
	
	                     sarah
	          answer
	
	meg follows sarahs eyes back to the screen where another
	message is being held up for them
	
	on the monitors
	
	the notepad says
	
	we will let you go
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg and sarah speak at the same time
	
	                     meg

	with an audible click she signs off  burnham raoul and

	at the window burnham notices something sitting just outside
	the french doors on the balcony  its a large outdoor
	barbecue grill  he thinks takes a step closer
	
	he sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
	grill
	
	                     burnham
	          workin on it
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	in the panic room meg is sitting crosslegged on the floor
	leaning against a wall but sarah is in motion sorting
	through shelves opening drawers  every drawer has something
	in it sealed under plastic  she opens and closes sorts and
	lifts finds the following
	
	waterproof matches and lighters
	
	flashlights
	
	unopened packages of batteries
	
	sealed water bags stamped pure five years from date
	
	tinned food
	
	flares
	
	pillows fireproof blankets we know because the bags are
	stamped fireproof blanket
	
	a complete tool kit
	
	as sarah explores she discovers something in the far wall at
	the end of the room down on the floor at eye level
	
	its a small round portal about eight inches across with a
	fourpronged cloverlike seal  the portal is closed tight as
	sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two it
	resists her attempts to crank it open
	
	meg notices
	
	                     meg
	          hey  relax okay
	
	but sarah keeps at it feels along the edges of the portal
	then all along the wall looking for some kind of hidden
	switch that controls it
	
	                     meg
	          i mean it lie down  you get your
	          adrenaline up and you know whats
	          gonna happen
	
	sarah stops looks at her mother who is pale and wan
	huddled in the corner
	
	                     sarah
	          are you freaking out
	
	                     meg
	          little bit  yeah
	
	sarah looks around the room
	
	                     sarah
	          small space
	
	                     meg

	          dont though
	               talk about it that is
	
	sarah looks at her thinks  its not an unfamiliar
	situation her needing to comfort her mother
	
	                     sarah
	          why did the chicken cross the road
	
	                     meg

	                     sarah

	                     meg
	          i dont know why
	
	                     sarah
	          to prove he wasnt chicken
	
	meg tries to push a smile across her face but its
	immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens
	her eyes show alarm staring at the kitchen
	
	                     meg
	          what the hell are they doing
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	the contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
	kitchen counter every kind of tool imaginable many that are
	unfamiliar to us  they sort through the pile choosing
	things
	
	int  kitchen floor  rear doors  night
	
	at the french doors that lead to the garden burnham has a
	cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand
	he reaches up drills a screw through the door into the
	corner of the door frame  he does the same at the bottom of
	the door
	
	he unlocks the doorknob tries it  the screws hold the door
	fast  he moves on to the next door
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	in the panic room meg stares at the video screens eyes
	wide terrified  she watches them  cant take her eyes off
	them
	
	                     meg
	               barely audible
	           locking us in
	
	int  library  night
	
	in the library in the front of the house raoul screws shut
	a window driving the long screws into its frame  he looks
	out at the street at two clubgoers walking home
	
	he pulls the drape
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	megs hands are over her mouth shes trembling shaking her
	head from side to side  this cant be happening
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	in the kitchen junior goes to the wall phone meg used to
	call for pizza earlier  he cuts the phone wire with a
	knife
	
	he stands there staring at the phone wiping the sweat from
	his palms on his pants  not satisfied he pulls the phone
	itself out of the wall cuts the cord for the handset too
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room
	horrified  sweat has broken out on her forehead her whole
	body seems to vibrate  sarah comes over leans in front of
	her
	
	                     sarah
	          mom
	
	but sarahs voice is hollow seems far away
	
	                     sarah
	          are you okay
	
	meg looks at her  as she watches sarah floats away from
	her  in fact the entire room is floating away from her
	elongating
	
	and narrowing  meg looks to the sides and the walls dont
	just seem like theyre pushing in on her they are pushing in
	on her
	
	meg opens her mouth screams but no sound comes out
	
	sarah stands up and bends over her but now shes just a
	figure far away all the way at the end of a long impossibly
	narrow hall
	
	                     sarah
	               barely heard
	          mom  mom
	
	meg crawls out into the middle of that hallway to get away
	from the wall but they both continue moving in on her
	
	                     meg
	          not here not here someplace
	          else someplace else
	
	her eyes roll back into her head we see just the whites and
	she loses her balance falling over onto her back
	
	we fall with her move in tight on her face and the dark
	hallway carpet beneath it turns to green all green grassy
	green  she sits up looks around and we realize she is in
	fact somewhere else shes 
	
	ext  great lawn  day
	
	 in the middle of the great lawn in central park  she
	stands turns in a circle shes completely alone on the
	great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
	day tall buildings sparkling in the distance
	
	meg stretches her arms out smiles but far off in the
	distance she hears a voice calling to her dimly
	
	                     sarah os
	          mom  mom
	
	meg ignores the voice shes so happy to be out here out in
	the open in the beautiful wide open she could stay here
	forever she spins around throws her head back but theres
	that voice again insistent
	
	                     sarah os
	          mom please
	
	there is the sharp sound of a slap and megs face abruptly
	jerks to the side  she touches her cheek confused as a hot
	red handprint rises up on it
	
	what the hell was that
	
	bam
	
	now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
	deafening crunch  the smile vanishes from megs face she
	turns  where did that come from
	
	bam  another one even louder  megs whole body winces at
	the sound
	
	bam  a third one and on this one meg falls to her knees
	covering her ears walls spring up around her right there on
	the great lawn we rush in on her the walls close in and
	shes right back 
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	 in the panic room where she always was and that pounding
	is real its right outside the door its like somebodys
	trying to smash their way right through the wall
	
	sarah is right over meg holding her by the arms and that
	handprint on megs face is real sarah must have slapped her
	to try to bring her out of it
	
	                     sarah
	          theyre coming in  theyre coming
	          in
	
	meg looks to the wall watches it seem to vibrate as another
	deafening bang crunches into it from outside
	
	bam  bam  bam  the sound is deafening  sarah throws both
	hands over her ears  meg looks around still disoriented
	
	                     sarah
	          you cant do that  you cant freak
	          out like that  you have to stay

	                     meg
	          im here  im here
	
	they huddle there terrified  meg blinks wipes the sweat
	from her forehead begins to come back around  she turns her
	head sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch sarah wears
	tries to look without her daughter knowing  its not an
	ordinary watch it only has one number a tall flashing
	digital display
	
	120
	
	meg nods as if reassuring herself
	
	                     meg
	          were fine  were okay
	
	she turns looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
	theyre doing out there
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	bam
	
	in the master bedroom a claw hammer crunches into the
	sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room
	
	the intruders are in the master bedroom now and burnham is
	like a man possessed tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
	end of the tool while junior shines a flashlight into the
	hole
	
	as the sheetrock tears away we see the skeleton of the wall
	behind it  theres a latticework of two by four studs and
	beyond those the dull shine of the walls metal core
	
	but thats not what hes after  he continues tearing
	reveals an air duct running through the wall feeding into
	the panic room through a welded hole in the steel  burnham
	tears away with the hammer exposing a short section of the
	duct
	
	clang  the claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox
	burnham drops to his knees rips open another tool case
	this one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it along
	with a couple dozen specialized bits  he selects one twists
	it into the drill
	
	at the wall burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch
	a horrendous metal screech fills the air and the drill bit
	tears into the duct opening up a jagged hole about the size
	of a quarter
	
	raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom carrying a
	coiled garden hose  burnham snaps his fingers for it raoul
	tosses it to him holding one end and the hose uncoils in
	the air as it snakes across the room
	
	burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole hes
	just drilled in the air duct
	
	rip  he tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
	connection makes it airtight
	
	slit  using a large hunting knife raoul hacks a ten foot
	section of the garden hose off the coil
	he stretches it out across the room to the white five
	gallon tank we saw before which is now sitting on the floor
	up here  we move in close as burnham snugs the cut end of
	the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank  red
	block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank
	
	propane
	caution  flammable
	
	along with a number of other dire warnings
	
	burnham raises his hand to the knob hesitates doesnt
	really want to do this but doesnt stop himself either
	
	he spins it open  halfway
	
	                     junior
	          open it
	
	                     burnham
	          i did
	
	                     raoul
	          he said open it
	
	                     burnham
	          just sending a message  shell get
	          the point
	
	gas hisses through the spigot and into the hose  we follow
	along the length of the hose across the floor of the room
	through the hole in the sheetrock into the hole thats been
	drilled in the air duct 
	
	inside the wall
	
	 through the wall itself where we see the horizontal lines
	of an air vent up ahead  we squeeze between two of the
	horizontal lines 
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	 and come out in the panic room  three red streamers tied
	to the air vent flap to life as the gas hisses into the
	panic room
	
	directly underneath the vent meg is hunched up against the
	wall her arm around sarah
	
	she sniffs
	
	again
	
	sarah sniffs
	
	they look at each other
	
	she looks up  sees the streamers floating above her
	
	she leaps to her feet steps up onto a shelf and stretches
	her nose toward the streamers  just as she does 
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	near the tank raoul shoves burnham out of the way
	
	                     raoul
	          we aint playin here
	
	he cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way
	the gas pours into the hose with an audible whoosh
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg at the vent falls back two lungfuls of propane and
	drops to her knees on the floor
	
	                     sarah
	          what what what is it
	
	                     meg
	          on the floor  get on the floor
	
	now sarah coughs  the gas is pouring into the room
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	raoul is standing guard over the tank to make sure no one
	messes with the valve
	
	                     burnham
	          look dont be stupid
	
	junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
	room trying to hear any sounds from within
	
	                     junior
	          be quiet
	
	                     burnham
	          were trying to scare them not kill
	          them
	
	                     junior
	          theyre coughing
	
	                     burnham
	          theyre gonna die in there
	
	                     junior
	          nobody is gonna die man will you
	          please have the balls to follow
	          through with a good idea  think
	          about it what would you do if you
	          were them stay in there and choke
	          to death or come out  huh  were
	          just getting them to come out for
	          fortyfive minutes fortyfive
	          fucking minutes  the worst thats
	          gonna happen is they pass out we
	          drag em out here into the fresh
	          air and theyll be fine
	
	                     burnham
	          junior you gigantic idiot how are
	          we supposed to get into the room if
	          they pass out
	
	pause  junior turns to raoul
	
	                     junior
	          cut it back a little bit
	
	                     raoul
	          no fucking way
	
	                     junior
	          hes right we cant get into the
	          room if theyre dead
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg and sarah are down on the floor rags covering their
	mouths trying like crazy to filter the air but its not
	working  sarah is crawling around the base of the wall near
	to where she was before clawing at the strange portal thing
	again
	
	finally she finds a small metal handle folded back into the
	cloverleaf seal on the portal  she unfolds it twists it
	
	the portal cranks open revealing it to be at the end of a
	tube about a foot long an emergency ventilation source
	directly through to the exterior of the house  she bends
	down and looks through it  its covered by a metal mesh at
	the opposite end but she can see and smell the outside
	through it
	
	she sits up gestures to her mother to bend down next to her
	she does and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
	the tube gulping fresh air greedily
	
	meg looks at sarah good job and they both drop to the floor
	at the portal and suck air  its temporary but it works
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the master bedroom the debate has turned physical
	burnham lunges across the room at raoul to get his hands on
	the valve to turn off the gas  but raoul catches him and
	hurls him aside
	
	burnham slams into the wall bounces off and screams at
	raoul who screams right back  junior leaps into the middle
	trying to break it up to get them to shut up keep their
	voices down
	
	its bedlam
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	in the panic room meg knows this cant go on forever  she
	turns away from the portal looks up at the vent where the
	streamers still stream
	
	she looks to the other side of the room to where sarah found
	the waterproof matches and lighters
	
	she thinks  takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
	and crawls over to the lighters  she selects one snatches
	up a screwdriver
	
	sarah looks at her has a vague idea of what shes thinking
	but cant believe it  she shakes her head vehemently
	
	in response meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
	blankets and piles them over sarah right up to her
	disbelieving eyes  she bends down takes another gulp of
	air  but shes getting woozy  this cant go on much longer
	
	she staggers across the room hoists herself back up onto the
	shelf she stood on before and gets right up next to the
	vent  holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas
	she unscrews the vent cover
	
	the duct is wide enough to put your arm in  she reaches in
	past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
	wall  she reaches all the way in lighter in hand
	
	inside the duct
	
	we see her hand crawl in lighter clenched between her
	fingers  she raises a thumb to the flint wheel cranks it
	once
	
	too slow  not even a spark
	
	her hand shakes  she tries again  still no spark  but with
	the effort and the angle when she thumbs the lighter it
	makes her hand twitch banging up against the sides of the
	duct with a hollow boom
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	burnham turns abruptly
	
	he turns around  they all freeze listening  he hears it
	again  the hollow boom coming from inside the wall  now a
	third time
	
	he walks forward slowly toward the wall
	
	boom
	
	he moves closer gets right up next to the wall  he leans
	into the wall putting his ear right up next to the air duct
	this close he hears the sound in more detail realizes its
	two sounds
	
	scratch  boom
	
	he arches an eyebrow
	
	inside the duct
	
	megs hand is trembling tiring  she tries again thumbs the
	flint wheel  it scratches as it rolls her hand twitches
	booms against the side of the duct
	
	still the gas hisses through
	
	in the panic room
	
	megs face is turning color shes running out of air  her
	feet tremble on the shelf shes about to lose her footing
	
	inside the duct
	
	she tries again  scratch  boom
	
	in the bedroom
	
	burnhams eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound
	
	                     burnham
	          oh
	
	he tears himself away from the wall 
	
	inside the duct
	
	 megs thumb tenses for one good hard turn 
	
	in the bedroom
	
	 burnham leaps through the air hurling himself toward the
	propane tank 
	
	inside the duct
	
	 meg cranks the wheel a spark sparks a flame flames and
	a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions one toward the
	panic room the other toward the bedroom
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg jumps off the shelf throwing herself as far away from
	the vent as she can her arm engulfed by licking blue flame
	she drops to the floor of the room covering her daughters
	body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
	a lake of fire with a deafening whoomp  the fluorescent
	light tubes explode showering glass everywhere
	
	in the bedroom
	
	the blue flame shoots out of the wall into the hose through
	the hose backing up toward the tank
	
	burnham crunches to the floor next to the tank knocking the
	other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
	flame erupts from the end of the hose
	
	the flame engulfs his entire body his hair starts on fire
	his chest his arms  raoul lunges forward junior tears the
	blankets from the bed and throws them over him burnham howls
	and rolls on the floor in pain
	
	in the panic room
	
	the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
	another angry whoomp leaving a few little pockets of flame
	that meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket  only one
	of the fluorescent lights is left intact it casts a
	flickering uneven light on the room
	
	she stands in the middle of the stillsmoky panic room
	breathing hard  she shouts screams incomprehensibly making
	no sense whatsoever
	
	she stops noticing the look sarah is giving her  wideeyed
	admiring frightened you are an insane woman
	
	meg looks to herself  her arm is signed the hair burned
	off  the sleeve of her tshirt is burned back to the
	shoulder  her face is sooty blackened
	
	meg grunts half frightened by herself
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	out in the bedroom its worse for burnham who has lost most
	of his hair and shirt  but his skin isnt badly burned
	which is something i guess
	
	still hes in a rage  he pounds the metal door of the panic
	room
	
	                     burnham
	          im coming in there bitch i am
	          coming in there  i am coming in
	          there
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg whirls goes to the door herself screams right back  we
	can hardly make out a word shes saying but it sounds
	threatening
	
	suddenly she stops hearing something else  outside the
	door burnham continues to rant but theres a second sound
	a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room the wall
	thats shared with the brownstone next door
	
	its a faint  very faint  pounding sound along with a
	high pitched complaining voice so faint it can hardly be
	heard  sarah hears it too
	
	                     sarah
	          neighbor
	
	meg and sarah leap as one facing the common wall shouting
	at the tops of their lungs  get help call the police
	please call the police that sort of thing
	
	they shout and shout but the soft pounding continues and if
	their voices are as soft on the other side as the complaining
	voice is on this side they have no hope
	
	their voices crack and they begin to cough too irritated by
	the gas to shout for very long  long after they stop the
	soft pounding from next door continues
	
	their pleas are not heard
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	the intruders have stopped their racket too and are
	listening carefully at the common wall  eventually the soft
	pounding stops the complaining voice complains no more
	
	burnham stands there in pain  things are falling apart
	raoul stands in the doorway silhouetted by the hallway
	light  he draws himself up to his full bulky height  hes
	big
	
	                     raoul
	               to junior
	          were gonna talk  downstairs
	
	junior nods and starts out  raoul lets him pass but when
	burnham tries to follow him raoul puts a big hand on his
	chest stopping him
	
	                     raoul
	          you stay  make sure she dont come
	          out
	
	burnham swallows  but stays
	
	raoul turns follows junior downstairs  as he descends he
	looks up making eye contact with burnham  and holding it
	something on his mind thats for sure
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	thunk  megs head falls back against a wall she sags to the
	floor legs folded in front of her completely drained
	
	but sarahs not drained sarahs full of nervous ingenuity
	rustling around through the stuff in the panic room an idea
	forming in her head  she finds a powerfullooking flashlight
	and loads it up with batteries  she tries it flashing
	around the room
	
	halogen bulb very powerful hurts her mothers eyes as she
	flashes it past  meg watches her  whats she up to
	
	sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
	discovered earlier  she squints through it
	
	through the tube
	
	she can see out of the house into the courtyard behind the
	brownstone
	
	about thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
	brownstones on the next block and directly across because
	the tube doesnt leave much room for lateral vision she can
	see straight into somebodys bedroom
	
	theres a light on  a sleeping man is in bed an open book
	on his chest
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah sits back
	
	she grabs the flashlight looks for a little button on the
	top the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with
	shining it on the wall of the panic room she flashes it at a
	wall three times on and off  satisfied she turns back to
	the tube
	
	meg curious crawls across the floor to join her  sarah
	shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube leaving
	enough room on either side of it for them to see through
	meg lays down flat squints into the tube sarah alongside
	her  she looks at her daughter curious  your plan
	
	sarah reaches into the tube finds the little flash button on
	the top of the flashlight
	
	through the tube
	
	the piercing halogen beam begins to flash across the
	courtyard and into the bedroom of the man in the bedroom
	the light flashes on the wall over his bed
	
	the flashes are in a rhythm  short  short  short  long
	long  long  short  short  short
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg turns to sarah impressed
	
	                     meg
	          morse code
	
	                     sarah

	                     sarah
	          titanic
	
	through the tube
	
	the flashes continue  dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot
	dot  but the man continues to sleep the light on the wall
	behind him has no effect
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah is frustrated  she adjusts the flashlight
	
	through the tube
	
	the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
	shining directly into the sleeping mans eyes
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot  shes
	starting to sweat  meg leans over sneaks a peek at the
	watch sarah wears on her left wrist  the readout
	
	114
	
	through the tube
	
	the sleeping man stirs  opens his eyes  winces from the
	light which is flashing directly in his eyes
	
	in the panic room
	
	                     meg
	          got him
	
	                     sarah
	          come on come on
	
	through the tube
	
	the sleeping man sits up  raises a hand trying to block the
	light which keeps flashing on him
	
	he gets up out of bed  he comes to the window
	
	in the panic room
	
	                     meg
	          yes yes yes yes
	
	sarah keeps it up flashing faster
	
	through the tube
	
	they see the man come all the way to his window  he leans
	against it cups his hands so he can see better  the flashes
	continue right on top of him now
	
	clearly the man is reading the flashes  he takes a steps
	back from the window 
	
	 gives them the finger 
	
	 and angrily yanks shut his drapes
	
	a moment later the light goes out and the room is black
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg and sarah drop their heads to the carpet defeated
	
	sarah rolls over knocks the flashlight away stares up at
	the ceiling
	
	meg puts a hand in her hair  it was a good idea
	
	                     sarah
	          were never getting out of here
	
	                     meg
	          shhh
	
	she looks at the wristwatch again
	
	103
	
	shes concerned
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	burnham is concerned as well  hes still in the master
	bedroom but barely hes standing in the doorway straining
	like hell to hear a conversation that junior and raoul are
	having in the foyer one floor one
	
	theyre trying to keep their voices down but stray words
	float up through the open stairwell  words like him and
	warning and dangerous
	
	burnham chews a fingernail  if only he could get closer  he
	throws a look back at the door to the panic room  he looks
	back out the bedroom door  listening
	
	int  foyer  night
	
	junior and raoul are huddled together in the foyer  theyre
	keeping their voices low but their conversation is heated
	
	                     junior

	junior and raoul are visible still arguing in the foyer
	
	on the next monitor over burnham is visible standing in the
	master bedroom doorway listening
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg is watching the monitors thinking  she notices
	something sits forward abruptly looking at the monitor that
	covers the master bedroom  she squeezes right up close
	staring at the screen
	
	on the monitor
	
	we peer closely at the box next to her bed the one she was
	using for a night table  on top of the box she sees the
	charger for her cellular phone sitting empty
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg sits back eyes alive with an idea  if only she could
	get to that phone which must be still under the bed  she
	looks back at the monitors at burnham lingering in the
	doorway to the room
	
	                     meg
	          damn
	
	she turns away from the monitors to check on sarah whos
	settled into a corner of the room looking pale
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the bedroom burnham is desperate  the argument
	downstairs is entering round two and hes got to hear what
	theyre saying
	
	he takes a few steps out of the bedroom 
	
	int  third floor hallway  night
	
	 and comes into the hallway  he leans over the stairwell
	where hes standing he is directly under the camera that
	covers the hallway 
	
	on the monitors
	
	 and cant be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg turns back from sarah to look at the monitors again
	she see burnham is no longer in the bedroom  and doesnt
	appear to be in the hallway either
	
	                     meg
	          oh yes yes
	
	she looks at another monitor
	
	on the monitor
	
	she sees junior and raoul in the foyer
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg sits back  that leaves burnham unaccounted for
	
	                     meg
	           the hell is he
	
	in the hallway
	
	burnham is still lingering under the camera
	
	in the panic room

	meg goes to the door raises a hand to the green open
	button  hesitates
	
	in the master bedroom
	
	we see burnham lurking in the hallway just about six feet
	from the door to the panic room  dont open that door
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg wipes sweat from her palm
	
	                     meg
	          if it looks like i cant get back
	          just close the door

	                     meg
	          close it
	
	sarah nods looks back to the button
	
	in the hallway
	
	a shouted curse rises up from downstairs  burnham takes a
	step toward the stairs
	
	on the monitors
	
	he suddenly appears in the hallway
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah sees it
	
	                     sarah
	          wait
	
	meg freezes  she looks at the monitor wideeyed  close
	one
	
	in the hallway
	
	burnham cant take it anymore
	
	                     burnham
	          oh hell
	
	he turns and takes off down the stairs
	
	on the monitors
	
	burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer next
	to junior and raoul   
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg and sarah see all three men accounted for downstairs
	
	                     sarah
	          go go go
	
	meg leaps up runs to the door and punches the green button
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	the door begins to crank open meg slips through the gap
	sideways before its even all the way open  she darts across
	the room 
	
	 slides to the floor next to the bed 
	
	 and flattens herself reaching underneath it to get the
	phone  damn that phone slid far its right in the middle
	wouldnt you know it
	
	in the foyer
	
	the three men hear her footsteps as one they take off for
	the stairs
	
	in the master bedroom
	
	meg continues to stretch her fingers inches from the phone
	
	on the stairwell
	
	feet race up toward her 
	
	in the master bedroom
	
	megs fingernails paw the phone pull it closer to her  she
	grabs it stands

	the three men come off the stairs and race toward her they
	see her as she lunges across toward the panic room she
	hurls herself through the door 
	
	in the panic room
	
	 and sarah smacks the red button  the steel door closes
	with a deafening whang
	
	safe
	
	in the entryway
	
	the echo of the metallic whang reverberates through the
	house
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	in the panic room meg punches 911 on her cell phone with
	trembling fingers
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	the big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
	three men burst into the room  burnham stops in the middle
	of the floor turns in a frantic circle

	meg raises the cell phone to her ear 
	
	 and gets a rapid busy signal
	
	                     meg
	          oh no  no no no no no no no
	
	she looks at the phone  its showing just one signal bar
	and even that one is flashing on and off

	          oh come on come on come on
	
	she walks around the room raises the phone high and low
	trying crazily to find a signal
	
	but cant   
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the bedroom burnham stands just outside the door
	fingertips lightly resting on it the ghost of a smile on his
	face
	
	                     burnham
	               softly
	          i dont think well be talking on
	          our cell phone from in there
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	inside the room meg doesnt seem upset  rather shes

	something
	
	                     meg
	          wires
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	at the same moment burnham is having the same thought  hes
	still at the door fingertips still resting there

	int  master bedroom  night
	
	burnham looks down at the baseboard below  what is he
	looking at
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg steps up onto the shelf she climbed earlier and comes
	up next to the vent
	
	                     sarah
	          what are you doing
	
	                     meg

	multicolored wires she saw earlier

	           phone wires
	
	she jumps down off the shelf goes to the tools starts
	searching for something

	          i may not have hooked up the phone
	          in here but i hooked up the main
	          line and theres a jack at the base
	          of this wall outside i saw it
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	yes that is correct there is in fact a jack in the base of
	the wall outside the door to the panic room
	
	burnham bends down into frame studying it thinking the same
	thing she is  he clears his throat
	
	                     burnham
	          say while were on the subject of
	          phones
	
	he turns looks up at junior
	
	                     burnham
	          when i said cut the line did you
	          cut the main line at the junction

	leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom
	
	int  panic room  night

	with a strong rip meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
	colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
	it  she trusts it at sarah finds a wire cutter in the
	assorted tools and gives her that too

	she lays back oddly passive her lips changing color  she
	stares at the monitors
	
	int  living room  night
	
	junior strides into the living room purposefully  he tosses
	some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
	to the kitchen  burnham is behind him
	
	                     burnham
	          would you wait  would you please
	          just wait a minute
	
	but junior heads down  burnham follows  raoul is just
	coming down from upstairs
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	junior reaches the door of the kitchen tries to open it
	realizes its screwed shut  he takes out a screwdriver and
	starts unscrewing the screws  burnham stops at the stairway
	
	                     burnham
	          you walk out that door and you lose
	          your share of the money

	he gets the last screw out throws open the door and blast
	of wind gusts in its a blustery night out there he takes a
	step into the doorway 
	
	 and with a quiet pffft from right behind burnham a bullet
	whizzes across the kitchen and hits junior in the back of the
	head  he crumples right in the open kitchen doorway
	
	burnham shouts incoherently and turns  raoul is standing
	there two steps up a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
	his gun
	
	                     raoul
	          nobody leaves
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	sarah is staring at the video monitors eyes wide  she
	raises one trembling finger points at the kitchen monitor
	tries to mouth the words cant
	
	meg looks up
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	burnham is freaking out but trying to stay calm
	
	                     burnham
	          oh god oh my god
	
	raoul walks past him calmly grabs junior by the ankles and
	drags him back into the house  he turns looks at burnham
	whose jaw is dropped in horror
	
	                     raoul
	          you should see the look on your
	          face
	
	                     burnham

	          thinks he knows me
	               to the corpse
	          you dont know one thing about me
	
	while burnham stares down at the body in shock and raoul
	stares at burnham his back to the outside a small thin
	voice comes from the stillopen doorway
	
	                     voice
	          what the h 
	
	they turn  a man fiftyish stands there in hastily thrown
	on clothes staring down at the dead body in mute shock
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg watching the monitors with sarah gasps as she sees the
	man whose name is harris  while she and sarah watch 
	
	on the monitors
	
	 they see the silent image of harris set upon by raoul
	who grabs him roughly and drags him inside  burnham hurries
	to the door 
	
	int  kitchen  night
	
	 and slams it shut  he puts his back to it thinking
	terrified things are spinning out of control fast
	
	raoul in the middle of the kitchen floor is venting some
	more of his rage on harris whom he has hurled to the floor
	he lands a solid boot in the side of harriss head leaving
	him groaning in pain completely disoriented
	
	harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
	from underneath junior
	
	                     burnham
	          stop it  stop it
	
	                     raoul
	               turning on him
	          whos the clown now  huh  whos
	          the fucking clown now
	
	he pulls his gun shoves it into burnhams eye hard we can
	hear the faint sizzle of skin burning
	
	                     burnham
	          me  i am
	
	                     raoul

	          remember that
	
	                     burnham
	          please
	
	raoul pulls the gun back just an inch  the skin around
	burnhams eye is an angry red  his eyes dart strain to look
	over at harris moaning on the floor  and at junior dead
	
	                     burnham
	          what  what do you want me to do
	
	                     raoul

	          then you end up like him
	
	he tilts his head over to junior whose brains are spreading
	out on the kitchen floor
	
	                     raoul
	          one  squeeze

	raoul grunts satisfied  pulls the gun back  burnham slides
	away shaking  he bends down to the floor  he looks at
	harriss left hand  at his index finger
	
	he sees a white strip of skin where harris wore his wedding
	ring until recently
	
	                                                  cut to

	door of the panic room  he collapses at its base  burnham

	burnham stands up turns to the video camera and shouts

	hes silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs  raoul begins to
	beat him
	
	burnham stands by powerless horrifies watching as raoul
	savages harris who continues to call out as long as he has
	strength telling meg not to open the door no matter what
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg and sarah shout in horror she covers her daughters
	face turn her away from the screen screams in incoherent
	anger of her own
	
	but she doesnt open the door

	          stop it man stop it thats his
	          kid in there his kid is watching
	          this
	
	but raoul whips the gun up into burnhams throat backing
	him off shutting him up
	
	he resumes his pounding of harris
	
	burnham turns looks up at the camera in the corner of the
	room
	
	he cant stand it anymore  he whips off his jacket runs to
	the camera and covers the lens
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	while meg watches the monitor that cover the master bedroom
	abruptly goes black mercifully sparing them the sight of
	harriss beating
	
	she holds sarah whos sobbing shaking
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	harris finally lapses into unconsciousness  raoul stands
	over him chest heaving
	
	burnham stand in the doorway neither in nor out of the room
	a silhouette head hung
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
	monitor but its hopeless its covered  on the hallway
	monitor she can just see shadows as two men in the bedroom
	lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room
	
	a sudden beeping sound tears her attention away  still
	holding sarah she pulls her back off her shoulder  her
	face is completely white her lips blue her eyes rolled back
	into her head  the beeping sound grows louder she checks
	sarahs wristwatch the reading is dire
	
	57
	
	meg gasps horrifies
	
	                     meg
	          oh god oh my god
	
	sarah begins to convulse she bucks right out of megs arms
	and falls back onto the floor of the panic room  meg clears
	everything away from her tries to make room for her
	
	the convulsion worsens  meg searches through the piles of
	supplies comes up with a plastichandled screwdriver  she
	opens sarahs jaws wedges the plastic handle between her
	teeth
	
	she helps sarah ride out the convulsion  finally her eyes
	roll back into her head she slowly reorients herself
	sarah reaches over turns off her stillbeeping
	wristwatchmonitor herself
	
	sarah sighs a shuddering sigh of relief but she is nowhere
	near normal
	
	her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
	yellow color  she moves her lips meg cant hear her she
	bends down
	
	                     sarah
	          you gotta jab me mommy
	
	meg turns looks back at the monitors  what she sees is good
	news 
	
	on the monitors
	
	the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera  burnham
	and raoul are gone the only person there is harris who lies
	slumped on the far side of the bed
	
	in the panic room
	
	meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room
	
	on that monitor
	
	she sees burnham and raoul having an urgent conversation
	burnham sitting in a chair raoul pacing in front of him
	ranting
	
	in the panic room
	
	megs face lights up she practically laughs shes so
	overjoyed at this turn of events
	
	she turns looks back at sarah who is starting to tremble
	again
	
	that does it  meg leaps up hits the button that controls
	the steel door and it starts to crank open almost
	impossibly slowly
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	meg steps out of the panic room into the master bedroom
	she looks at harris on the bed  with his back to her she
	cant even tell if hes alive or dead but first things must
	be first so she turns and races out of the room
	
	int  hallway  night
	
	meg flies up the stairs bare feet on padded carpet
	
	int  living room  night
	
	in the living room raoul looks up hearing the pitterpat of
	her feet on the stairs above
	
	he smiles and pulls his ski mask back on to cover his face
	
	coming around behind him we see burnham sitting in the
	chair  except it isnt burnham at all its harris
	unconscious wearing burnhams shirt
	
	and if harris is the person in the chair that means 
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	 the person on the bed in the bedroom is burnham wearing
	harriss shirt  his eyes pop open he sits up sees the wide
	open door to the panic room
	
	int  sarahs bedroom  night
	
	meg races into sarahs bedroom and tears open the door of a
	minifridge  inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
	and something called glucogen
	
	she grabs a bottle of glucogen and a black leather pouch and
	takes off
	
	int  hallway  night
	
	as meg nears the bottom of the stairs she sees a horrifying
	sight  its raoul ski mask over his face standing in the
	doorway of the master bedroom
	
	she screams he slams the door she takes off down the hall
	reaches the end throws the door open 
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	 and races into the master bedroom where raoul is
	motoring fast headed for the panic room where she can
	already see burnham standing in the middle of the open
	doorway in front of sarah wearing harriss shirt and a grim
	tricked you expression
	
	meg hurls herself at raoul lands clinging to his back  she
	claws and wrestles with him gets one hand on his ski mask
	tears it from his head  he reaches up to try to stop her
	from pulling it off 
	
	 his gun slips from his fingers falls to the floor 
	
	 and caroms off his boot spinning across the floor away
	from them
	
	raoul flips her off his back violently she crunches to the
	floor clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
	face  he makes a move toward his gun but shes faster
	shes already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
	toward it
	
	raoul measures the distance knows hell lose and sprints
	for the panic room instead  meg turns looks down at the
	medicine in her hands then at the door to the panic room
	where raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
	controls the steel door
	
	she makes a fast decision and lunges hurling the plastic
	bottle of glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
	gap just before 
	
	 the springloaded steel door slams shut with tremendous
	ferocity
	
	and then its silent  meg wails in agony pounds on the
	door
	
	she stands back chest heaving sobbing
	
	a looooong moment goes by
	
	finally a voice comes over the houses intercom system
	
	                     raoul os
	               calmly
	          if you leave the house well kill
	          her
	
	meg sobs
	
	                     raoul os
	          if i see a uniform in the house
	          well kill her
	
	                     meg
	          oh oh
	
	                     raoul os
	          you understand
	
	on the monitors
	
	meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom  she nods
	terrified
	
	in the panic room
	
	burnham pushes past raoul at the speaker button and leans
	forward  hes approaching exhaustion
	
	                     burnham
	               into speaker
	          i just i just need fortyfive
	          minutes
	
	raoul stands behind him muttering to himself
	
	                     raoul
	          saw my face man  saw my face
	
	on the monitors
	
	we see megs face agonized as she lunges toward the camera
	screaming something up at it the same thing over and over
	but in here her voice is nearly muted what bleeds through
	the walls isnt enough to be heard
	
	in the panic room
	
	raoul looks at her image on the monitor irritated
	
	                     raoul
	          shut up
	
	in the master bedroom
	
	we abruptly hear her voice fullthroated
	
	                     meg
	               shouting into the camera
	           cine she needs the medicine
	          give her the 
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah shivers in a corner knees pulled up to her chest
	staring at the intruders scared out of her wits and looking
	very very sick
	
	burnham looks at her musters the most reassuring face he can
	come up with under the circumstances
	
	                     burnham
	          its gonna be cool kid  be outta
	          here before you know it
	
	no response from sarah  burnham cocks a head really looking
	at her
	
	                     burnham
	          are you okay
	
	                     raoul
	          hurry up for christs sake
	
	burnham turns grabs his satchel and drops to his knees in
	the middle of the floor  over his shoulder we can see the
	face of meg on one of the monitors shouting into the camera
	begging them to give sarah her medicine
	
	using his hand burnham measures six lengths in from the
	wall then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet
	looking for a seam
	
	he finds one gets hold of it on one edge and runs his other
	hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
	turn a corner  he stands hovering over the carpet and
	pulls back evenly with both hands
	
	the concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly with the soft
	sound of tearing velcro  underneath the flap 
	
	 is the smooth metal door of a floor safe
	
	burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove  it rolls
	out and opens up onto the floor revealing a neat array of
	safecracking tools
	
	he begins his delicate work but is suddenly jarred by a
	pounding on the metal door  he turns annoyed  meg is still
	screaming outside the door
	
	                     burnham
	          the hell does she want
	
	                     raoul
	          i dont know she keeps screamin
	          the same thing over and over
	
	burnham turns looks at the monitors
	
	on the monitors
	
	meg is staring up at the camera miming the act of giving
	herself an injection in the arm
	
	in the panic room
	
	raoul laughs
	
	                     raoul
	          drugs  she wants drugs  what the
	          fuck
	
	but burnham thinks  his eyes fall on the bottle and the
	leather pouch she hurled through the door then whip over to
	sarah who sags over into a fetal position on the floor  her
	lips are moving
	
	                     burnham
	          oh man
	
	he crawls over to sarah puts his ear down next to sarahs
	lips
	
	                     burnham
	          what is it
	
	sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak but her
	breath comes hard
	
	                     sarah
	          i need
	
	                     burnham

	sarah nods  burnham points to the pouch and the glucogen on
	the floor nearby
	
	                     burnham
	          that stuff
	
	sarah nods again
	
	                     burnham
	          can you do it yourself
	
	sarah shakes her head no
	
	                     burnham
	          well i dont know how
	
	sarah looks at him eyes pleading  raoul stands behind
	burnham
	
	                     raoul
	          i dont fucking believe this
	               to sarah

	sarah looks terrified shaking her head no
	
	                     raoul
	          come on
	
	he starts to pull burnham away but burnham shakes his hand
	off violently  he bends down very close to sarahs lips
	
	                     burnham
	          tell me the truth okay  whats
	          gonna happen if you dont get this
	
	sarah swallows licks her cracking lips  when she speaks
	its breathy almost inaudible
	
	but the words are clear
	
	                     sarah
	          coma  die
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	seen from overhead meg paces in the master bedroom out of
	her mind with worry no idea how to communicate to the people
	in the room the desperate situation
	
	suddenly a voice comes over the intercom speaker
	
	                     burnham os
	          i understand  ill give her the
	          shot
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	a hand comes down into frame and picks up the glucogen and
	the leather pouch  burnham stands looking down at them
	raoul grabs him pulls him to the far end of the room
	
	                     raoul

	          man youre wasting my time  you
	          dont know how to do this and the
	          longer we stay in here the more
	          likely shes gonna lose it and call
	          the cops
	
	                     burnham
	          are you gonna open the safe
	
	raoul looks at him
	
	                     burnham
	          then shut up and get out of my way
	
	as burnham crosses the room raoul makes eye contact with
	sarah who is staring at him
	
	                     raoul
	          dont look at me
	
	across the room
	
	burnham drops to his knees next to sarah and unzips the
	pouch
	
	                     burnham
	          okay kid all i know about this is
	          what ive seen on tv you gotta talk
	          me through it
	
	sarah tries to form words but shes too weak  burnham
	swallows
	
	                     burnham
	          okay  no talking  no problem  tv
	          dont lie right
	
	he reaches into the pouch take out a syringe a sterile pad
	and a length of rubber tubing  he takes sarahs arm
	stretches it out exposing the underside of her forearm
	
	                     burnham
	          you seem like a good kid  your
	          mom only saw her for a second
	          but woah  beautiful huh
	
	no answer  burnham ties the rubber tubing around sarahs
	arm pulls it tight

	to fill it from the glucogen bottle
	
	                     burnham
	          you guys are pretty rich huh
	
	sarah shrugs  while burnham goes through the process of
	finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself he
	goes on as much to comfort sarah as to comfort himself
	
	                     burnham
	          yeah you dont think about that
	          stuff  good for you

	          woulda been a hell of a dad

	to the corner of the room and picks up the gun the one that
	raoul dropped
	
	she heads downstairs
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	sparks fly as burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
	small specialized drill
	
	raoul bends down next to him
	
	                     raoul
	          congratulations  you saved her life

	a whisper unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
	hear him

	cop 2 stifles a laugh
	
	                     meg
	          but thank god i came to my senses
	          before i said all that and hung up
	          instead so nobody would ever know
	          what i was thinking unless of
	          course two policemen showed up in
	          the middle of the night to
	          interrogate me about it
	
	that was good  cop 1 is embarrassed  cop 2 thinks its
	funny
	
	                     cop 2
	          you want her to show you which three
	          things rick or should we just go
	
	cop 1 looks at meg a long look he holds it for one last
	moment trying to read her mind
	
	on the monitors
	
	we see the video image of the cops as they turn and head away
	down the front steps  meg closes the doors looks up into a
	camera right at us
	
	in the panic room
	
	burnham and raoul breathe a sigh of relief
	
	burnham goes back to work on the safe  hes making progress
	
	raoul looks at sarah  stares actually  hes thinking too
	
	bad thoughts  he moves over crouches down next to burnham
	
	                     raoul
	          she saw my face  the kid too
	
	sarah overhears that  she raises her head alarmed  burnham
	turns looks over at her and she just gets her head back
	down in time  burnham and raoul close themselves off for a
	private conversation
	
	sarah edges closer  she overhears a fragment
	
	                     burnham
	          thats your problem
	
	                     raoul
	          thats their problem
	
	sarah is terrified  doesnt know what to do  she looks to
	her immediate left sees the intercom panel  she edges
	closer
	
	                     burnham
	          let me fucking finish this so we can
	          get out of here
	
	                     raoul
	          you finish  then we finish
	
	sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button  all page
	
	int  living room  night
	
	in the living room there is an audible click as the speaker
	is activated  meg looks up hears burnhams voice in the
	middle of a sentence
	
	                     burnham os
	           posed to mean

	          we come out
	
	meg listens horrified
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger
	
	                     burnham
	          bullshit
	
	                     raoul
	          you know how this gotta end
	
	int  living room  night
	
	meg stares in shock as raouls voice echoes in the empty
	room
	
	                     raoul os
	          they stay in the house
	
	there in an abrupt click and the speaker turns off  meg
	turns goes to harris falls to her knees no idea what to
	do  she holds him close their foreheads touching  shes
	terrified exhausted wants to collapse in his arms
	
	instead she starts to pull the gun from his fingers  he
	tightens his grip what are you doing  he tries to hold onto
	the gun but she pulls his fingers off it takes it away from
	him  he is too weak to resist
	
	                                                  cut to
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	in the panic room sarah has her hands clamped over her ears
	her mouth is wide open and a hideous metal shriek seems to
	be coming out of it
	
	but the shriek is actually coming from the safe where
	burnham continues to work another drill a bigger bit  the
	noise is deafening
	
	on the monitors
	
	sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom
	carrying a jacket  meg tosses the jacket this time she
	doesnt want them to see what shes doing
	
	the monitor goes black
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	in the master bedroom meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
	hanging over a chair
	
	she steps into a pair of boots
	
	she shoves the gun into her belt
	
	here in the bedroom she can hear the drill  from the house
	next door she hears pounding again more muffled curses
	apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too
	
	meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
	panic room  her eyes light up with an idea
	
	she goes to the front wall of the bedroom stands with her
	back against the exterior wall street side with her left
	shoulder against the common wall thats shared with the
	neighbors brownstone
	
	she begins to step off the distance heel to toe measuring
	with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
	entrance to the panic room
	
	                     meg
	          fourteen
	
	she hurries out of the bedroom  whats she doing
	
	int  library  night
	
	meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves a
	library  there is a window that looks out over the sidewalk
	one floor up same level as the stoop
	
	she looks up into the corners of the room
	
	                     meg
	          no camera no camera no camera
	
	theyre bare no video cameras  good
	
	she goes to the window tries to open it  screwed shut of
	course
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	the safe is almost cracked  raoul is watching the monitors
	carefully
	
	on the monitors
	
	we see meg as she searches through the tools in the living
	room finds a screwdriver a sledgehammer
	
	in the panic room
	
	raoul furrows his brow  now what
	
	int  library  night
	
	meg is back in the library hurriedly unscrewing the window
	she gets the last screw out shoves the window up
	
	the wind blasts in its a hell of a spooky night out there
	
	she leans out the window  we lean with her  the sidewalk is
	empty we see it only from our vantage point inside the
	house  shes one floor up  to her right is the houses
	front stoop
	
	she tosses the sledgehammer over onto the stoop  climbs up
	onto the window ledge and slithers out herself
	
	we lean further watch her as she edges along the ledge hops
	down onto the stoop and freezes staring in horror 
	
	 at the video camera that covers the front stoop
	
	on the monitors
	
	we see her staring straight up at the camera clearly
	standing on the front stoop outside the house where she was
	specifically told not to go
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah sees the image of her on the stoop  raoul happens to
	be looking away at the moment at the safe but he starts to
	turn around to look at the monitors again 
	
	 and sarah kicks him hard in the ass
	
	                     raoul
	          hey
	
	he turns away from the monitors
	
	                     sarah
	          sorry  cant control it sometimes
	
	raoul scowls at her  behind him 
	
	on the monitors
	
	meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
	the monitor
	
	in the panic room
	
	sarah sees her mother go
	
	                     sarah
	               to raoul
	          wont happen again
	
	int  library  night
	
	still leaning out the window we can see meg from here as she
	reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
	neighbors house which is contiguous
	
	straining to see yet stay in the house we see meg all the
	way at the right edge of the frame as she shifts the gun to
	the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbors door
	sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg
	
	after a long moment we hear the neighbors front door open
	the conversation begins  the wind is gusting right in our
	faces we cant make out the details but the gist is clear 
	let me into your house and dont as me a lot of questions
	
	the neighbor  and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
	an old woman  is slow to respond grumpy
	
	losing patience meg just pulls the neighbor out of the way
	and shoves into the house  the neighbor stumbles out onto
	her front stoop and we were right its an old lady in a
	nightgown but shes no shrinking violet  in fact shes
	royally pissed off and not at all intimidated
	
	                     neighbor
	          what the hell do you think youre
	          doing young lady
	
	she storms back into her house following meg  as both of
	them disappear from the frame we move out of the library
	into the foyer and move along the common wall the one
	shared with the neighbors brownstone
	
	from the other side of the wall we can hear muffled voices
	arguing meg and the neighbor shouting at each other
	
	we drift up up the stairs and hear the thundering of
	footsteps on the stairs next door  we keep pace with them
	from inside this house  we pass right through the floor 
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	 and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom and
	now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
	wall in here the neighbors fearful angry tones megs
	firm urgent declarations
	
	we move with meg even though we cant see her we know what
	shes doing shes stepping off the paces on the other side
	of the wall  we drift down that wall fourteen steps until
	we reach the metal door to the panic room then we pass
	through that door 
	
	int  panic room  night
	
	 and arrive inside the panic room where burnham is this
	close to getting the safe open when all of a sudden 
	
	whomp
	
	crunch
	
	burnham and raoul freeze alarmed  its coming from the long
	wall the shared wall
	
	they look at each other
	
	whomp
	
	crunch
	
	they look at the wall
	
	somebody is on the other side pounding like hell
	
	                     raoul
	          the walls are steel right
	
	                     burnham
	          not that one
	
	                     raoul
	          not that one
	
	                     burnham
	          hey man its the neighbors house
	          who breaks in through the neighbors
	          house
	
	whomp  crunch
	
	louder  closer  burnham turns screams at the wall
	
	                     burnham
	          who the fuck breaks in through the
	          neighbors house
	
	                     raoul
	          weve got the kid
	               shouting at the wall

	          is she thinking
	
	whomp  crunch
	
	                     burnham
	          shes got your gun thats what
	          shes thinking  the fuck you had to
	          bring a gun for
	
	burnham throws himself back on the floor goes back to work
	on the safe  fires up the drill again it screams into the
	metal
	
	                     burnham
	          almost there
	
	the pounding keeps up from next door  we hear sheetrock torn
	away on the far side  bricks scraping out of place
	
	sarah in the corner is energized excited  while burnham
	and raoul are distracted she grabs the leather pouch palms
	the three syringes that are left in there
	
	                     burnham
	          almost there
	
	finally the door to the safe crunches in on one side
	yielding to the drilling 
	
	 at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer crashes
	through the wall of the panic room  raoul grabs hold of
	sarah burnham maintains his focus throwing open the safe
	revealing 
	
	 nothing
	
	crunch
	
	the sledgehammer head strikes again opening up a hole about
	a foot across  light spills through from the other side as
	well as the voice of the hysterical neighbor
	
	raoul hurls sarah against the far wall leaps over to the
	side of the hole and waits poised above it
	
	at the safe burnham doesnt lose his cool just opens a
	false bottom in the safe revealing a manila envelope
	
	he snatches it up rips it open and his eyes dance as he
	holds up fourteen individual one million dollar us treasury
	bearer bonds  he fans them out eyes drinking from his
	grail
	
	bang
	
	a gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds setting it
	aflame before it slams into the far wall sending up a little
	cloud of plaster dust
	
	                     burnham
	          jesus
	
	he whirls sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall
	gun extended
	
	but raoul is standing just above the hole and already has
	his boot raised over the hand  he brings it down a
	crunching blow that stomps right on megs wrist
	
	meg screams loses her grip on the gun and it clatters into
	the space between the houses
	
	between the walls
	
	the gun falls into oblivion the space between the walls
	where no one can get to it
	
	in the panic room
	
	burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket
	
	                     burnham
	          i got the money lets go
	
	raoul grabs sarah and turns jabs the green button to open
	the door
	
	behind them meg screams in anger and wriggles through the
	opening  before shes even all the way through she gets
	hold of raouls leg and pulls herself into the panic room
	scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the toosmall
	hole
	
	                     burnham
	          go lets go outta here
	
	but raoul is deep in a violent rage  still holding sarah
	with one hand he bends down grabs meg by the hair and
	drags her toward the doorway
	
	                     raoul
	          you know how this is gonna go
	
	                     burnham
	          fuck you im gone
	
	he bolts out of the room through the metal door which is
	just finishing its slow crank open its heavy spring coiling
	in the wall
	
	raoul drag meg across the floor by the hair right into the
	track of the open steel door
	
	she looks up sees the infrared safety beam over her head
	and  realizes with horror what his intention is
	
	still with one arm holding sarah who is kicking and
	struggling viciously raoul holds megs head down on the
	floor below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
	closing  he reaches for the close button
	
	sarah raises her arm stuffed with three syringes and jabs
	them into raouls neck  raoul screams in pain
	
	meg manages to raise her head breaking the beam
	
	int  hallway  night
	
	on the stairwell burnham stops frozen his face twitching
	with indecision  he hears the murder taking place just above
	him
	
	he runs down three steps
	
	stops again
	
	runs down the rest of the stairs
	
	int  master bedroom  night
	
	raoul stretches to push the red close button for the door
	but he has to hold megs head down out of the lower beam
	with one hand all with sarah savagely attacking him at the
	same time and three syringes hanging out of his neck
	
	finally he gets megs head all the way down onto the floor
	
	looking up meg sees the red beam become complete again
	
	raoul jabs the button 
	
	 just as sarah throws her hand into the upper beam the one
	at shoulder level  sarahs hand turns red the beam is
	broken the door will not close
	
	raoul roars in anger and twists violently sending sarah
	flying across the room
	
	meg strains gets her head off the floor again breaking the
	beam  raoul starts jamming the close button over and over
	again the beam completes then breaks completes then
	breaks never the button and the beam at the same time
	
	but it cant go on forever  megs tiring she cant keep it
	up her head trembles 
	
	 and collapses onto the floor
	
	the beam completes 
	
	 raoul smacks the red button 
	
	 and burnham appears on the other side of the door  he
	reaches in grabs hold of raoul to pull him off her but
	raoul loses his balance falls forward 
	
	 into the gap 
	
	 and his head is crushed by the springloaded steel door
	that slams forward just as meg draws herself back
	
	meg falls across the panic room grabs sarah and holds on
	tight
	
	the door detects the obstruction and opens again slowly
	raouls body slumps to the floor dead
	
	burnham stands there looking down at meg and sarah
	
	they stare at each other wordless their first face to face
	contact  she sees the bonds protruding from his jacket
	
	she just looks at him  there will be no understanding here
	
	he zips his jacket turns and hurries away
	
	int  entry floor  night
	
	burnham races down the steps hurries to the entry door
	throws it open 
	
	 and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose  he
	blinks tries to focus on whoevers on the other end of that
	gun
	
	its the cop the first cop the one who came to the door and
	was so suspicious of meg  the cop looks down sees blood
	smeared all over burnhams jacket sees more than enough to
	know his suspicions were correct
	
	                     cop 1
	          put your hands up
	
	burnham freezes silhouetted in the doorway  wind and leaves
	blow into the house a real gale outside
	
	from behind cop 1 more cops shout all at once must be a
	half dozen of em there but burnham cant see anything in
	the stinging light and cant hear much either over the
	roaring wind
	
	burnham moves suddenly flinging the door shut right in the
	cops face  the door slams hard burnham turns to run but
	doesnt get more than a few paces before three sharp gunshots
	crack through the door behind him
	
	brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
	door but its not the light that gets you its the chunks
	of lead  they rip through burnhams back and come out his
	chest a triangle pattern
	
	burnham stops sags to his knees  he reaches into his
	jacket pulls out the loose stack of bonds
	
	he fans them out stares down at them holds them like
	playing cards
	
	                     burnham
	          monster hand
	
	behind him the front door cracks open half a dozen cops
	appear and start shouting all at once  burnham tosses the
	bonds to the floor the same gesture as folding a hand of
	poker
	
	he groans and collapses slowly falling through the bonds
	twisting as he goes down  he slaps onto his back in the
	foyer as the wind gusts through the open door scoops the
	bonds up off the floor and blows them back into the house
	as if they were never meant to leave
	
	burnham lies there on the floor eyes open staring up at the
	ceiling looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air
	suspended there twisting and bucking and diving just over
	his head as he dies
	
	                                             dissolve to
	
	ext  central park  great lawn  day
	
	the swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves blowing in the
	air over central park on a crisp fall day  the leaves float
	down over the great lawn that massive expanse of grass we
	saw in megs hallucination
	
	but on a day like this the great lawns full of people
	throwing frisbees playing football lying there doing
	nothing
	
	the leaves land on the grass next to meg and sarah stretched
	out on a blanket a newspaper spread in front of them open
	to the ads
	
	meg is on her back arms folded behind her head staring up
	at the clouds
	
	sarah is intent on the paper circling the occasional ad
	
	                     sarah
	          i mean uptown is close to dads
	          place but somebody at school said
	          the village is really cool so i
	          dont know its so great to be
	          close to the park and everything
	          what do you think i mean give me a
	          clue here where are we gonna live
	
	meg rolls over props herself up on one elbow  she seems
	years younger  she looks at sarah reaches out brushes her
	daughters hair behind one ear
	
	she smiles  she is calm
	
	behind her a flock of pigeons takes off leaping into the
	clear autumn sky
	
	                                                fade out
