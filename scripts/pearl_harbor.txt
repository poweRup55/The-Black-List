	out of black we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by

	ext  pov of an airplane

	flying over american heartland  we see the earth through the
	pilots perspective as sky and ground swap positions the
	plane swooping down and storming over the ground

	the plane

	is a biplane racing over a field lush with young plants  it
	releases a trail of crop spray and climbs again

	up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like
	honey over family farms stretching to the horizon  maybe
	its not heaven maybe its just tennessee  but as long as
	theres been an america men have fought and died for this
	place  as volunteers

	far off but visible from the plane is

	a barn  day

	the barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says
	mccawley crop dusting another plane noise this one made
	by kids brings us to two boys sitting in the shell of an
	old plane propped on crates scavenged of its engine seats
	and wheels

	the boys sit in its cockpit butts crowded onto the nail keg
	theyve replaced the seat with  theyve even attached a 2x4
	as propeller as if their imaginations needed any help  they
	wear overalls and have bowl haircuts  rafe and danny 10
	years old

					rafe
			bandits at 2 oclock

					danny
			power dive

	they buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls
	rafes bare feet on one pedal dannys on the other

					rafe
			its germans

					danny
			kill the bastards

	rafe looks at danny in shock  then they both laugh and go
	right back into their game manufacturing their own machine
	gun and engine sounds

					rafe
			good shooting danny

					danny
			good shooting rafe

					rafe
			land of the free

					danny
			home of the brave

					rafe
			theres another one

	their vocal motors roar again but a mans hand grabs danny
	by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit

	its dannys father and hes a fearsome sight drunk his
	hair uncombed his face unshaven his teeth  those still
	left  are rotting  hes also missing an arm but the one
	thats left is potent and hes shaking danny with it

					dannys father
			you no count boy  johnson come lookin
			said hed pay a dime for you to shovel
			his pig shed and i cant find you no
			place

					danny
			daddy i told you i was comin here

	his father slaps him off his feet  rafe is so horrified he
	cant get a sound out  danny isnt even surprised  but when
	his father snatches him up again twisting the overall straps
	so tight they choke him he struggles  it does no good his
	father starts marching across the field dragging and
	strangling danny

					danny
			da dad

	the fathers drunken anger makes him oblivious  until
	crack  the 2x4 propeller slams him across the back knocking
	him to the ground and making him drop danny

	the father rolls over to see 10yearold rafe holding the
	2x4 like a bat

					rafe
			let him alone

	the fathers eyes bulge in rage he struggles to his feet

					danny
			rafe daddy no

	the man looks murderous but rafe draws back the board

					rafe
			ill bust you open yougerman

	the words ring something deep in the mans boozebroken
	brain  he begins to cough convulsively it brings a blossom
	of blood to his mouth  he wipes it with his hand but blood
	clings to his teeth  he chokes out 

					dannys father
			i fought the germans

	he looks at danny in shame with the realization of what hes
	just done  he turns and staggers away

	danny looks at rafe  a communication between boys joined by
	something deeper than blood  then danny runs off after his
	father

					danny
			daddy  daddy  wait

	danny catches him takes his fathers hand and walks away
	with him

	the crop duster we saw in the air has just landed behind
	rafe  the pilot rafes father shuts off the engine

					rafes father
			whats goin on son

					rafe
			nothing  dannys dad just come to get
			him

	rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4
	propeller  his father looks toward danny and his father
	walking away then looks at his own son

					rafes father
			hey boy  you wanna go up

	rafe cant believe it he runs to the plane and hops into his
	fathers lap  as his father cranks the engine and tucks him
	into the harness rafe says 

					rafe
			daddy sometime will you take danny up
			too

					rafes father
			sure will son

	the engine races to lifeand we 

							dissolve to

	ext  new jersey air base  day

	american p40 fighters blast through the air props screaming
	and wind singing by their wings

	there are eight pilots in their individual seats and we
	focus on two  rafe mccawley has grown lean and handsome
	and danny walker is very much the same

	their planes start swapping positions in the formation while
	the other guys are flying along in a tight line rafe and
	danny are playing one of them gunning his engine to go high
	the other diving and coming back up in his place
	leapfrogging

	it scares the other guys having their planes flashing in and
	out so close  the training captain watching through
	binoculars on the ground talks into his radio 

					training captain
			mccawley  walker  cut that out

					rafe
			i thought this was a training flight
			im just trying to give danny some
			training

					danny
			not on your best day boy

	rafe grins and guns his plane low in the opposite direction
	he was moving before  danny reacts almost instantly
	leapfrogging in the opposite direction scaring the piss out
	of everybody else

					training captain
			thats it get into a wedge

	the squadron responds forming up into a tight v rafe and
	danny just behind and on either side of the center

					rafe
			didnt you say test the limits

					danny
			hey you wanna test my limits you better
			line up a couple dozen women on the
			groundcause i got no limits in the
			air

	rafe grins loving the challenge  then he and danny do the
	leapfrogging maneuver laterally swapping sides in the v

					training captain
			everybody down

	ext  new jersey airfield  day

	the planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway shut
	down their props slide back the canopies and hop down  we
	see young pilots well get to know  anthony billy red

					training captain
			where are mccawley and walker

	ext  rafe and danny  still in the air  day

	theyve circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now
	heading right at each other like two bullets playing
	chicken

					training captain
			aw shit

	int  the cockpits

	from rafe and dannys pov the rush is awesome

	the pilots on the ground watch in awe as the p40s get so
	close they cant possibly get out of each others way
	billy the most boyishfaced of the pilots yells to drown
	out the sound of the collision

	at the last instant both planes snap a quarter turn so that
	their wings are vertical and they shoot past each other
	belly to belly

	in the cockpits

	rafe and danny burst out laughing

	the pilots on the ground

	laugh and congratulate each other

					training captain
			you know what they say you can take the
			crop duster out of the country  but
			dont put him in a p40

	rafe banks to land and danny tucks in behind him  danny has
	rafes plane in his sights

					danny
			if i had guns id be chewing up your 

	rafe feints left banks right and appears behind danny

					rafe
			if you had guns youd be pissin on em

	theyre almost to the landing strip rafe behind danny  but
	as dannys wheels are about to touch he guns his engine and
	snaps the nose of his plane straight up

	the other pilots stop laughing

					anthony
			hes doing an inside loop

					training captain
			aw shit

	danny pulls it off just barely making a full circle to come
	in behind rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway

					danny
			yeehawww

	danny taxis his plane over to join the others  hes grinning
	as he slides back his cockpit cover then 

					danny
			wheres rafe

	red tall with flaming orange hair tips his chin toward the
	air  seeing rafes plane still in the air danny starts to
	refasten his harness

					training captain
			youre down walker  thats an order

					danny
			what about him

					training captain
			hes not taking my orders anymore

	dannys just about to ask what the hell that means when he
	notices rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral

					danny
			hes gonna do it

					billy
			do what

					danny
			it
				beat
			aw shit  aw shit shit shit

	rafes plane reaches two thousand feet just a speck above
	them and seems to pause in the air

					danny

			i shouldnta done an inside loop

					billy
			why

					danny
			cause now hes gonna do an outside loop

					training captain
			aw shit  aw shit shit shit

	anthony and billy join in like an involuntary chant 

					anthony  billy
			aw shit shit shit

	rafe in his cockpit is tightly controlled yet serene  he
	noses the plane into a power dive

	the p40 screams toward the ground picking up speed going
	so fast it begins to shudder

	the other pilots are transfixed  red is so nervous he cant
	get the words out

					red
			aw sh sh sh sh

					billy
			shit

					red
			yeah

					danny
			you can do it rafe  you can do it

	the p40 hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed
	snaps into a half roll streaking upside down over the
	runway  rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness the
	asphalt of the runway shooting past ten feet beyond his
	head

	he pushes the plane into a climb his cockpit on the outside
	of the circle  the plane reaches the top of its arc and
	almost stalls but rafe noses it over again toward the
	earth only this time he has very little altitude  the plane
	hurtles down still with it belly on the inside of the
	curve

	and makes it full circle  rafes head now is barely a foot
	off the asphalt as the plane shoots past still inverted

	the other pilots burst into cheers

	rafe in his cockpit permits himself a smile

	he lands and the guys run out to meet himall except for
	the training captain who stands there shaking his head

	danny jumps on the wing as rafe stops and slides back his
	canopy  danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him

					danny
			you couldve killed yourself you stupid
			bastard

	he dives into the cockpit hugging rafe

					danny
			that was the most beautiful thing i ever
			saw

	int  colonel doolittles office  day

	colonel jimmy doolittle midforties is commander of the
	base  hes as tough as he is good in the air  and right now
	hes frowning at rafe mccawley standing at attention before
	him

					doolittle
			there are some people who think the
			outside loop is reckless and
			irresponsible

					rafe
			how could it be irresponsible sir if
			you were the first man in the world to do
			it

					doolittle
			dont get smart with me son

					rafe
			never sir  i just meant its dangerous
			only for the kind of pilot who wants to
			show off rather than inspire the other
			pilots in his unit  and all youve done
			for me sir working out the transfer i
			did it to say thanks  to honor you sir
			what the french call a homage

					doolittle
			thats bullshit son  but its really
			good bullshit

					rafe
			thank you sir

	doolittle stands moves around his desk and shakes rafes
	hand

					doolittle
			good luck over there mccawley  i admire
			your decision

			if we must go to war there is only one

	have robbed him of the power to move  his eyes pick up every

	of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body
	sinks into the water  hes cloaked in the fog his
	parachute pushed by the wind is pulling him along face
	down  he fights with the straps flips himself over and
	pulls the release

	but hes still in desperate trouble in his flying clothes
	his heavy leather jacket soaking with seawater hes going
	down his body sinks beneath the surface

	again  or both

	subliminal flashbacks  below the surface of the north sea
	rafes body drifts but he fights his way back uphe kicks
	off his shoes sheds the jacket strips off his pants and
	starts tying the cuffs into knots

	then in a cut he is floating in the water his pants turned
	into a makeshift life preserver his body shaking
	convulsively from the cold

	then in another cut we see him after hes been in the water
	for so long that his body no longer trembles hes lost
	consciousness  he has no strength no will to live his
	face settles into the waterhis body slips from his
	preserver and drifts beneath the surface

	above the surface his limbs come to life and he fights
	his way up breaking the surface  the whole sea around him

	water is up to the trapped sailors waists when they grab a
	wrench and start taking turns pounding sos in morse code
	on the bulkhead

	ext  deck of oklahoma  day

	as the listing grows more severe sailors start jumping from
	the deck into the water  still the marines on deck are
	firing back at the planes some marines are even using
	handguns  but courage does not save them

	the oklahoma rolls over

	the men still on its deck try to run but its not just the
	fires and the water they cant escape the gun turrets 1400
	pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
	tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls

	the sailors and marines thrown into the water struggle to
	get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
	turtle

	below the water men are sucked down with amazing force every
	hair on their heads streaming behind them as theyre snatched
	to the depths

	inside the oklahoma everyone and everything is spilling
	upside down  the ships generators sputter out and the
	lights go out  the flashlights of the few sailors who can
	find them cut raggedly through the darkness and water spills
	in  there is no escape

	below the water the oklahomas superstructure hits bottom
	some men are crushed there  for others its salvation as
	the backwash blows them toward the surface

	on the surface the men are launched almost completely out of
	the water before splashing back into the water and burning
	oil  a few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
	propeller protrude above the surface but most of the
	oklahoma is under water

	men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
	wounded away from the wreckage  a bomb hits the launch and
	blows body parts everywhere

	int  oklahoma  rear compartment

	in one compartment there are a dozen trapped men  theyve
	survived the rollover and are in a chaotic world where the
	floor is now the ceiling  the water is up their waists
	some of the sailors are panicking

	one sailor has a flashlight and switches it on flashing the
	light from face to face

					sailor with the flashlight
			dont panic  dont panic

					panicked sailor
			the waters rising  its coming up
			were all gonna drown

					sailor with the flashlight
			the air pressure will equalize it

	but the water keeps rising along with their fears  several
	of the sailors are still screaming

	the waters already to their bellies  one of them grabs a
	wrench and starts slamming morse code against the bulkhead

	one sailor in the middle of the room is particularly
	panicked not just yelling but crying and whimpering 

					terrified sailor
			get me out  get me out

					sailor with the flashlight
			stop it  come on  save your air

					terrified sailor
			my foots caught

	hes at the lower end of the compartment where the water is
	deeper  the ships nose is lower than her stern  the
	waters up to the guys neck

	the man with the flashlight dives down and finds the guys
	foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling  now
	their floor

	he pops up again  the waters up to the trapped guys mouth
	hes already gagging

					sailor with the flashlight
			is there a hacksaw in that locker

	they open it tools spill out  among them is a hacksaw
	they hand it to him the sailor dives down and cuts off the
	guys foot

	the trapped man is underwater muffling his scream  he comes
	free and surfaces gasping  his severed foot floats to the
	surface and then the horror really hits them  the sailor
	with the flashlight pops up in the blossoming of blood  he
	and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump to stop
	the bleeding

	the drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop
	their signaling  now they start banging twice as loudly as
	before

	bullets stitch his fuselage wounding him  he still forces
	the plane forward  he taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets
	chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters
	to a stop theo dead at the controls

	joe doesnt bother to strap in he hits the throttle hard and
	heads down the runway

	the zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 mph
	the zeros bullets eat his canopy and plane skin the plane
	breaks apart in mid air spilling in gouts of flame as it
	smashes down on the tarmac

	throw on their radio headsets

	off clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches  they
	blow right through the strafing fire and into the sky

	danny understands immediately following rafes tactic as he
	breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut palm trees and
	low hills to shake the japs  they fly like crop dusters
	skimming down a foot from the ground then bobbing up
	banking left and right  the zeros have divided into two
	groups to chase them their wings clipping tree tops as they
	try to follow the americans

	it feels like a 200 mph car chase 20 feet off the ground

	blast in wing guns blazing chopping into two zeros  both
	zeros falter and begin to lose altitude  the p40s make
	almost impossible tight turns still sidebyside and go
	after the two plane they crippled on the first pass

	rafe finishes one zero making it explode in a ball of flame
	in the air  danny finishes the other shooting off its wing
	so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there
