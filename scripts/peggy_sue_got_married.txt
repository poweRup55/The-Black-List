				peggy
		choosing a good nursery school can
		be one of the most important
		decisions you can make it will
		often determine your childs
		attitude towards education and
		schooling
			proud of herself
		of course the lessons learned are
		primarily social —— sharing being
		considerate of others
			remembering
		and theyre so cute when theyre
		little they bring you back their
		little masterpieces every day and
		you put em on the refrigerator
		door theyre so proud and their
		names are all misspelled scott
		would always print his s backwards
		and beth would make her sweet
		little flowers

		burrito sometimes it just folds
		over on itself and one part touches
		the other

				peggy
		whats inside

				richard
		you can till it with whatever you
		want from illusions to memory
		from experience to innocence from
		happiness to the entire universes

				peggy
		so you think time travel is
		possible for people
