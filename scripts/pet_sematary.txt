fade in on

that most persistent summer sound crickets in high grass
reereereeree this in dark which slowly

						dissolves to

ext  a grave marker  summer day

its a plywood cross leaning aslant written on the crossarm in 
black paint which has faded smucky  he was obedient the letters 
are faded they are also straggling and illformedthe work of a 
child

main titles begin

ext  another grave marker

a childs printing again this time on a chunk of warped crating 
biffer biffer a helluva sniffer until he died he made us richer  
19711974

main titles continue

ext  two markers

i think all these shots are lap dissolves all is silence but for 
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass around the markers 
themselves the grass has been clipped short and by some markers 
there are flowers in cheap vases crisco cans skippy peanut 
butter jars etc

these two markers in memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march 1 
1965 on a wide flat board and gen patton our good dog april 
1958 another board

main titles continue

ext  five or six markers

we cant read all of them some are too faded or the 
gravestones themselves too degenerated but we can see now that 
this woodland clearings a rather eerie  and wellpopulated  
animal graveyard

we can see polynesia 1953 and hannah the best dog that ever 
lived hannahs tombstone is part of an old chevrolet hood 
painstakingly hammered flat

main titles continue

ext  angle on the pet sematary

from here we can see most of the clearing which is surrounded by 
forest pines we can see that the gravesmaybe 80 in allare 
arranged in rough concentric circles on the far side of this 
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard 
clearing the end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which 
hold up a crude arch we can see no writing on this side  the 
words on the arch face those arriving along the path

main titles continue

ext  the arch from the path side cu

main titles conclude written on the arch in faded black paint is 
the work of some longgone child pet sematary

the camera holds on this for a moment or two then pans slowly 
down to look through the arch from this angle we are looking 
across to a deadfalla tangle of weatherwhitened old dead 
branches at the back of the graveyard its maybe twentyfive feet 
from side to side and about nine feet high at either end are 
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible

as main titles conclude the camera moves slowly in on the 
deadfall and as it does we realize that there is a horrible 
snarling face in those branches is this an accident coincidence 
our imagination perhaps the audience will wonder the camera 
holds on it and then we

							dissolve to

black and a white title card moving day

ext  a house in the country  evening

sound of crickets reereereeree

to the left of this house a big empty field behind it the 
woods before it a wide twolane road

the house is a pleasant twostory new england dwelling with a 
shedgarage attached in front of it is a sign which reads quinn 
realtors 292 hammond street bangor a big sold strip like a 
bumper sticker has been plastered across it diagonally

growing sound the rumble of a truck a big big truck it belts 
between the camera and the house  a tanker truck with a silver 
body and the word orinco written on the side in blue letters its 
shortstack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke behind it 
comes a ford wagon which slows signals and turns into the 
driveway of the house weve been looking at

ext  rear of the wagon

as louis creed brings it to a stop we get a good look at the 
license plate illinois and a bumper sticker have you hugged 
your md today

the engine sound stops for a moment or two we hear only the ree
reereeree of crickets then

				ellie creed voice
		is this our new house daddy

				louis creed voice
		this is it

ext  the wagon a new angle

the two front doors and one back door open louis creed about 32 
gets out from the drivers side rachel creed his wife gets out 
from the passenger side from the rear door comes ellie creed a 
girl of 6 they are staring fascinated at the house

they come together the three of them by the front of the wagon 
still staring at the house louis is clearly nervous

				louis
		sowhat do you think

rachel begins to smile she turns to louis and hugs him

				rachel
		its gorgeous

				ellie
		am i really gonna have my own room

				louis
		yes

				ellie
		yaay

she looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging 
down from the bough of a tree

				ellie to rachel
		is that a swing

				rachel
		yes but the rope might be

				ellie
		yaay

she goes running toward it rachel gives louis a tired smile

				louis
		let her go its cool

				rachel
		louis the house is beautiful

they kissgently at first then more passionately as he draws 
her more tightly against him a babygagebegins to cry from the 
car louis and rachel break the clinch

				rachel
		the master of disaster awakes

this sound is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pentup tomcat

				louis
		and buckaroo banzai

				rachel
		come onlets parole em

they walk to the car rachel going to one of the back seat doors 
louis to the rear of the wagon

int  the front seat with rahel and gage

gage is sitting in his car seat not exactly crying but certainly 
yelling to be let out the seat dash and floorboards are 
littered with roadmaps soda cans big mac boxes and similar 
crud these folks have driven all the way from chicago to maine in 
this station wagon and the wagon looks it

				rachel
		decided to wake up and see what home
		looks like huh

she begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses gage is just 
wearing a tshirt and a diaper hes fifteen months old

ext  the rear of the wagon with louis

he opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier we see a big 
tomcat insidemostly what were aware of are shining green eyes

				ellie voice
		daddy mommy i see a path

louis cat carrier still in hand turns toward

ext  ellie in the tire swing

shes got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs

ext  the view up toward the woods ellies pov

we see the field and a clearly marked and mown path leading up 
its flank and into the dark woods

the camera dips and pendulums as ellie swings

ext  rachel and gage front of the car

				rachel irritated
		not so high ellie you dont know
		how strong that rope is

she puts gage down he totters a bit on his little legs and then 
stands there looking at his sister

ext  the rope and the branch cu

the bark has rubbed off the branchit looks like a bone peeping 
through decayed flesh the rope is old discolored and it is 
fraying away as we look at it soon ellie like humpty dumpty is 
going to have a great fall

ext  louis rear of the car

hes set the catcarrier down and is straightening up

				ellie raptuous voice
		wheee

				louis
		ellie you heard your m

his eyes widen

ext  ellie

				ellie
		wh

sound a heavy twang as the rope breaks the tire swingwith 
ellie still inside itgoes crashing to the grass ellie screams 
and begins to crya little hurt and a lot surprised

louis and rachel run to her

			louis				rachel
	ellie are you all right	honey are you okay

ext  ellie rachel louis a closer shot

ellies parents reach the tangle of tire rope and sixyearold 
girl

				ellie
		hurrts it hurrrrts

				louis
		anyone who can scream that loud isnt
		ready for intensive care just yet
		looks like she just skinned her knee

nevertheless he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from 
the tire rachel helps

ext  gage

hes standing in the driveway by the front of the car utterly 
forgotten in the heat of the moment his diaper is sagging quite a 
bit the boy needs a change

he stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit then loses 
interest camera follows as he walks down the side of the station 
wagon little bare feet slapping on the asphalt he stops for a 
moment at the back looking at the catcarrier which louis never 
got around to opening church is staring hopefully out through the 
mesh

				gage
		hidurch

				church
		waow

gage bends down and tries to open the catcarriers door no soap 
either he cant solve the latch or his fingers dont have the 
strength anyway he stops trying after a moment

sound growing thunder of an approaching truck  a big one

ext  the road gages pov

a big tanker trucksilver body orinco written on the side in 
blue lettersblasts by

ext  gage by the cat carrier

the windlash if the passing truck blows gages hair back from his 
forehead we should be scared herenot by the truck but by 
gages lack of fear hes smiling happy

				gage
		druck

he starts down the driveway toward the road

ext  louis rachel ellie at the swing

ellie has been disentangled from the swing shes sitting by the 
wreckage at the end of the driveway weeping hysterically as much 
from tiredness as from pain i think as louis and rachel examine 
her scraped knee the wound doesnt look too serious

				louis to rachel
		would you get the first aid kit

				ellie screaming
		not the stingy stuff i dont want the
		stingy stuff daddy

rachel suddenly looks around toward

ext  the front of the wagon rachels pov

				rachel
		gages gone

				louis
		jesus the road

they get up together

ext  gage at the edge of the road

a truck is coming a great big one

ext  angle on the truck cu

the grille looks like a tombstone thats learned how to snarl

ext  gage

he takes a step into the roadand then big gnarled hands grab 
him

gage looks rather surprised at this but not worriedthis kid is 
used to being picked up and treated humanely to gage strangers 
are as interesting aswell as interesting as orinco trucks

ext  gage and jud crandall

the fellow who has picked gage up is a man of about eighty in old 
blue jeans a faded bruce springsteen tshirt over this he wears 
a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons his face is deeply 
wrinkled and kindly

joined by louis and rachel out of breath and really scared ellie

				rachel voice
		louis whats this

ext  rachel and gage

gage has been changed and rachel is following him as he explores 
the nearest edges of the new homestead they are fairly close to 
the wreckage of the tire swing and here is the head of the path 
ellie has already glimpsed

ext  louis and jud

they cross to the van the first and second movers are just 
climbing out of the van

				first mover
		you mr creed

				louis
		yes just a second

ext  rachel and gage at the head of the path

shes holding gage on her hip now and both of them are looking at 
that strange and oddly enticing path which disappears into the 
deepening twilight louis and jud join them

				louis
		the movers

				rachel
		yesi know this path louis where does
		it go

				louis
		i dont have the slightest idea when i saw
		the house this field was under four feet
		of snow

				rachel smiling
		i bet mr crandall knows

jud nods he smiles too but underneath the smile we sense that 
he is serious

				jud
		oh ayuh i know its a good story and
		a good walk too ill take you up there
		sometime and tell you the story too
		after you get settled in

he smiles at them and they smile backit is a look of 
understanding and real liking in spite of the age difference 
between the creeds and jud

ext  the creed house  night

sound crickets reereereeree 

theres one light upstairs one downstairs perhaps we see the 
path glimmering away into the field either by virtue of it being 
mown or by virtue of some gentle optical trick maybe

int  the living room  night

theres a light on in the kitchen but it just casts a dim glow in 
here the room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor its 
going to be nice but now its just a big bare box with movers 
cartons stacked all over the place

louis is drinking a can of pepsi and he looks pretty damned 
tiredanyone whos ever moved house and can remember the first 
night in the new place will understand

he finishes the last of the pepsi and surveys the living room he 
sits on one of the bigger boxes takes cigarettes from his pocket 
and lights one he drops the spent match in the empty can and 
taps into the can during the scene

sound feet coming down the stairs the door on the far side of 
the room opens and rachel comes in wearing a nightgown

				rachel crossing to louis
		kids are asleep doc

				louis
		great

he hugs her she hugs him back warmlyfor a moment they are just 
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house

				rachel
		youre not really going over to have a
		beer with that old guy are you

				louis
		well ive got a million questions about
		the area and

				rachel
		and youll end up doing a free
		consultation on his arthritis or urinary
		problems and

				louis
		did you see his shirt

				rachel giggles
		sure bruce springsteen

				louis
		i really do have a million questions
		about the areabut the thing im
		really curious about is how come this
		octogenarian yankee is decorating the
		slumped remains of his pecs with the
		boss

she laughs

ext  the path of the crandall house  night

pervasive sound of the crickets as louis comes rather hesitantly 
up the crazypaved path from the roads edge

				jud voice
		that you doc

ext  the screenedin porch of the crandall house

we hear the squeak of a rocker we see the dim red fitful glow of 
juds pall mall we see by its glow that he is wearing walkman 
earphones

ext  louis

				louis
		its me

int  the porch with jud

the walkman is in his lap he switches it off and puts the 
headphones casually around his neck like a kid

				jud
		well come on up and have a beer

int  the porch a slightly wider shot

louis comes on up jud has got a pail of ice beside his chair with 
some cans of beer in it he opens one and hands it to louis

				jud
		you need a glass

				louis
		not at all

				jud
		good for you

louis drinks half the can at a draught

				louis
		god thats fine

				jud

		prime day for himself

		good before drugs and bad luck caught
		up with them listen to this louis

he passes the headphones over louis puts them on jud presses the 
walkmans play button

sound ramblin man blasts us out of our seats

louis winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head

				jud
		im sorry wait

he turns it down

				jud
		try that

louis puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments 
its the instrumental break gregg and duane allman dueling hot 
fenders louis takes the earphones off

				louis
		nice

				jud
		i like rock and roll noi guess
		thats too mild i love it since
		my ears started to die out on me
		its the only music i can really hear
		and since my wife diedi dunno some
		times a little rock and roll fills up
		night not always but sometimes pause
		one more timewelcome to ludlow hope
		your time here will be a happy one

				louis great sincerity
		thank you mr crandall

he drinks againthey both do theres a moment of companionable 
silence here broken by the sound of a big truck they look 
toward

extint  the road through the porch screen

one of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling bynow there are 
little amber running lights on top of it its going fast too 
sweeps by in a blast of air

int  the porch with louis and jud

				louis wincing
		jesus

				jud lights a cigarette
		thats one mean road all rightyou
		remember that path your wife commented on

				louis
		the one that goes into the woodssure

				jud

				louis
		whats at the end of it

				jud smiles

		bit meantime doc

here jud raises his glass in a toast

				jud continues
		heres to your bones

louis clinks his glass against juds

				louis
		and yours

they drink

ext  route 9  night

louis crosses from the crandall side to his own and the camera 
follows as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon he 
pauses for a moment looking thoughtfullyhopefullyat his new 
house then somethingthe cry of an owl perhapsdraws his 
attention the other waytoward the path

he walks to its head and stands looking out at itit glimmers in 
a wide cut swath thats a bit ghostly in the dark

a shape suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him and louis 
recoils with a startled muffled cry

ext  church

the cat sure whoor whatelse we see his big green eyes in 
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello waow

ext  louis and church at the head of the path

				louis
		church god you scared the life
		out of me

				church
		waow

louis bends and picks up the cat as he does that truck sound 
comes again and he looks toward

ext  the road louiss pov

another orinco tanker drones by fast

ext  louis and church

				louis to the cat
		i know one thing that will keep you
		home good buddy

he starts toward the house

black and in that blackness we see a second title card the dead 
speak

int  a kitchen blackboard cu  day

written on it is monday 1 church spayed 10 am quentin 
jolander dvm and below in even bigger letters 2 ellies 
first day of school

the camera pans left showing us the kitchen there are still a 
few cardboard cartons around but the place is getting in shape

we look out the window and see the creeds led by jud crandall 
climbing the path toward the woods louis has got gage in a 
gerrypak

ext  at the top of the hill with creeds and jud

they are also at the edge of the woods jud stops and lets them 
catch up

				jud
		take a look behind you

they turn around and their faces express their wonder

				louis
		my god

				rachel
		its beautiful

ext  the view

it is indeed beautiful the creed house is in the fg route 9 
just behind it with one of the everpresent orinco trucks droning 
along but behind that is the great sweep of the penobscot river 
valley dozing under a fall sky of clear blue

ext  at the top of the hill with jud and the creeds

				jud
		you folks ready to go on

				louis
		sure

				ellie
		but where are we going mr crandall

				jud
		youll see soon enough hon

they go into the woods still following the path

ext  forest  day

these are old woods indeedhuge trunks with dusty sunlight 
shafting through them it looks as though man has never made his 
mark here

the camera pans slowly down to them on the path here it is 
carpeted with pine needles but it is just as clearly marked

jud stops louis looks glad of the rest hes sweating and there 
are wide dark patches under his arms where the gerrypaks straps 
are

				louis
		who owns the woods up ahead paper
		companies

				jud
		nope the micmac indians whats up
		ahead is all thats left of their
		tribal lands

				jud smiles
		ayuh its a funny word aint it
		you tired of totin that yowwen yet doc

				louis
		not yethow much further is it

				jud
		aw youll be okay less than a mile

he starts off again fresh as a daisy ellie scampers after him 
louis rolls his eyes at his wife and rachel rolls hers back then 
they press on

ext  the arch reading pet sematary

ext  jud and the creeds on the path

				jud stopping

				ellie excited voice

ext  ellie at the edge of the sematary

she surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight then runs 
toward the center pausing to investigate some of the markers as 
she goes we clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings

ext  rachel louis jud

they are walking slowly toward that rude archway louis is 
extremely interested in all this but its becoming clearer and 
clearer that rachel is troubled they stop and look in

				rachel
		how can you call it a good thing
		a graveyard for pets killed in the
		road built and maintained by broken
		hearted children

				jud
		well but missus creed it aint
		quite that way deah

				rachel coldly
		why

				jud
		wellwell because

				ellie voice

dangerous proposition ellie however is having the time of her 
life a branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches 
nimbly to the next one up

ext  the grownups at the arch

				jud alarmed
		no honey you dont want to go

suddenly

still looking at ellen

				jud

he sees her startled uneasy expression and laughs he ruffles her 
hair reassuringly

				jud
		nonot right out loud their stones

		marker aint nothing but a tin can

the visitors were therebut its sure there now leering at us

int  the kitchen trash can  night

there are two greasy boxes poking out with napoli pizza stamped on 
them guess dinner was burned

the camera pulls back and we se louis sitting at the kitchen 
table the table is covered with newspapers on it louis is 
putting together a complicated model boat using glue and 
tweezers hes wearing glasses

ellie comes in wearing a nightgown she watches him for awhile

				louis not looking around

				louis

she breaks down completely sobbing and louis rocks her back and 
forth

int  the hallway outside the kitchen with rachel

she is crying silently

int  ellies bedroom  night

she is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness an oblong shaft of 
light falls on her illuminating her more clearly shes asleep 
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her 
mouth

int  the doorway with rachel

rachel looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly 
closes the door

int  louiss and rachels bedroom  night

louis is in his pajamas propped up on pillows on his side of the 
bed there a number of medical books scattered around him and hes 
making notes from one as rachel comes in

				rachel
		shes finally asleep

				louis
		she was a little overexcited
		thats all poor kid

				rachel
		it was that place that creepy cemetery
		up in the woods whatever disease the
		kids in this town have got i dont want
		ellie to catch it

				louis
		jesus rachel whats got into you

				rachel
		do you think i didnt hear her tonight
		crying as if her heart would break
		here she is thinking church is going to
		die

it should be clear to us by now that despite her words rachel is 
much more upset than ellie was louis slowly puts his notebook 
aside and caps his pen

				louis
		rachelsomeday church is going to 
		die

				rachel whirls on him
		that is hardly the point church is
		not going to die today or tomorrow
		never mind i can see you dont have
		the slightest idea what im talking about

she stalks to the bathroom which adjoins louis follows she goes 
in and slams the door he goes for the knob

				louis
		rachel

sound click of the lock

louis stares at the door bewildered and upset

ext  route 9  night

here comes a big orinco truck droning along headlights glaring

int  louiss and rachels bedroom

the headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see louis 
and rachel asleep each as far over to hisher own side as heshe 
can get with a big empty space in the middle

lights and truck sounds slowly fade

int  gage  morning

cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way 
across the tray of his highchairit looks a little like a map of 
the pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon 
now he scoops up a handful and throws them

int  the kitchen table with ellie

splat eggs on the serving plate of toast

				ellie
		yeeuck gross

int  the kitchen a wider shot

rachel is at the sink doing dishes we see the blackboard with 
its message near her

louis comes in wearing a sportcoat and slacks ready for his 
first day on the joband ellie is in a pretty first day of 
school dress

				louis

words

				louis

				ellie
		missy dandridge and she says its a
		operation

int  rachel and louis by the sink

dies

				rachel

int  ellie by the cat carrier

				ellie

		go to the pet sematary

int  louis and rachel by the sink

she gives him a look as if to say there now do you understand 
what you did

				rachel
		dont be silly church is not going
		to die

				louis

		roads a lot more dangerous than the
		operation church will be just the same
		wellalmost the sameand we wont have
		to worry about him getting turned into
		catburgers by one of those damn orinco
		trucks

at this rachel tightens up still more in that funny wayshes 
actually angered by louiss reference to catburgersbut under the 
anger we sense she is deeply shocked as a prudish woman might be 
shocked by a dirty joke for rachel thats just what death is

				rachel
		thats enough of that kind of talk

				louis
		i just said

				rachel
		i know what you just said ellie
		clear your place

ellie goes slowly back to the table

				ellie sets the plate down
		im scared what if school here isnt
		like in chicago im scared and i want
		to go hhhome

ellie bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face

int  the kitchen a new angle features louis and rachel

the camera follows as they go to the table to comfort ellie

				rachel
		youll be fine ellie now you can be
		excused go and wash your face

				louis

a little frightened

int  gage

				gage conversationally
		here durch

he picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and 
throws it in the direction of the catcarrier

int  the catcarrier

church is close to the mesh looking out scrambled eggs hit the 
mesh driving him back surprised

briefcase in one hand and the catcarrier in the other he opens 
the wagons doorgate

a small car turns into the creed driveway and parks beside louis 
a rather sourlooking middleaged woman gets out and crosses the 
front of her car her color is bad this is missy dandridge she 
looks at the catcarrier

				missy
		gonna get his

				louis
		nuts cut yes thank you missy
		for introducing that colorful phrase
		into my daughters vocabulary

				missy
		dont mention it

she opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat 
pile of folded sheets she reaches for them then winces and 
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment as if with an 
attack of indigestion

				louis sees this
		hows that bellyache of yours

				missy gets the sheets
		no better and no worse

				louis
		you ought to see a doctor about it

				missy
		itll pass they always do

she starts toward the house with the sheets

ext  the side yard  morning

rachel hurries past missy who turns to look and then goes on into 
the house louis has just put the catcarrier into the back of the 
wagon and closed the doorgate as rachel reaches him

				rachel anxious
		still friends doc

louis appears to consider this seriously for a momentand then 
he smiles and hugs her they kiss

				rachel
		thank god i was a little worried

		school doc no broken bones

				louis smiles
		not so much as a sprain

ext  victor pascow and friends  morning

pascow is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one 
girl they are all yelling at each other not to joggle him not to 
drop him a small knot of horrified college kids moves with the 
bearers

pascows head is upside down to the camera which retreats ahead 
of the advancing students fixed eyes stare half of his head has 
been shattered inward before the catastrophe he was a husky male 
of about twenty hes dressed in a u of m muscle shirt and red 
jogging shorts

the camera pulls jerkily to one side allowing the bearers to 
mount the steps of a brick building the infirmary the lookerson 
break to either side the infirmary doors open

ext nurse charlton at the doors

shes the head nurse a tough old babe of about fifty

				charlton
		holy jesus

the bearers sweep past her and inside leaving a red smear of 
blood across the midriff of marcy charltons uniform

int  the infirmary reception area

the camera will show us all we need to see but its movements will 
seem almost random this is like being in the hotel kitchen after 
sirhan shot bobby

as the students bring in pascow louis comes running followed by 
steve masterton his pa standing to one side are two student 
nurses in candystriper uniforms theyre boggled and horrified

louis kneels the camera rushes forward shoving between 
onlookers louis looks at the wound theres shattered bone and 
pulsing brain tissue beneath

theres a scream the girl who was carrying one corner of the 
blanket is having hysterics

				girl
		vic vic oh christ vic

				louis to charlton
		get her out get them all out

charlton puts her arms around the girl

				girl struggling
		no no he cant die he cant die

the camera moves back down as louis takes an opthalmascope from 
steve and shines it in pascows bulging fixed eyes

charlton is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out 
the door

				louis
		steve get the ambulance over here
		right now hes got to go to emmc

his mouth he begins to seizure

one of the candystripers shrieks the camera jerks up to cover the 
student nurses one turns and throws up on the wall

charlton rushes over

				candystriper
		i cant look at iti cant stand it

				charlton slaps her
		yes you by god can go get the hard
		stretcher

as they start away one helping the other down the hall and as 
charlton starts over to where pascow lies dying on his blanket 
the camera drops to louis and steve

				louis

they hold pascows spasming body

				steve
		it wouldnt matter if we did have

drapes so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary 
privacy

pascows fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand beartraps 
louiss right wrist the dying man pulls him slowly but 
relentlessly down until their faces are only inches apart

				pascow

louis recoils breaking the grip of the handbut he cannot quite 
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes blood leaks from 
pascows mouth

				louis whispers
		wwhat did you say

pascow struggles hard to speak again at first he can only gurgle

				pascow

louis leans forward again terrified yet needing to know

with emergency lifesaving gear

pascows hand comes up and paws at louiss shirt leaving a bloody 
handprint then it falls limply back pascow is dead

steve leaves the frame and louis stares fixedly down at the body 
of victor pascow he closes the eyes

he still looks shocked by the tragedy the dying mans bloody 
handprint is partly visible on louiss shirt in spite of his 
sportcoat

louis abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of 
the road

ext  the station wagon

it comes to a slueing shuddering stop almost going in the ditch

int  louis behind the wheel

				louis
		he said my name i heard it he

int  pascow

shedgarage this door stands open louis pauses by it

				pascow low

louis goes into

int  the shedgarage

the station wagon is a dark hulk louis crosses to it and stands 
perplexed

pascow looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him louis 
turns and suddenly his face is less than an inch from pascows 
mutilated face

				pascow
		lets go doc

				louis moans
		i dont like this dream

				pascow
		who said you were dreaming

he begins to move toward the garage door after a moment louis 
follows him

ext  the field behind the house long  night

we can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woodspascow 
and behind him louis

ext  the pet sematary arch

camera holds then pans down as louis passes under the arch

ext  louis close

he looks around obviously afraid

ext  the pet sematary louiss pov

we can see why by starlight this is one scary place

ext  louis

he suddenly sees something else and now his fear is close to 
terror

ext  the deadfall louiss pov

the face is back in the tumbled branches it yawns and snarls

ext  louis

he walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized pascows hand falls 
on his shoulder louis turns terrified

ext  pascow close

				pascow
		the door must not be opened the
		barrier must not be crossed dont

		feel you have to theres more
		power here than you know

he points at

ext  the deadfall

that grinning faceand perhaps now there are other effects as 
well subtle but there dim red light a misty smoke drifting 
through the tumbled dead branches the director will know

after a moment there is a huge grunting roar from the woods behind 
the deadfallit sounds like no animal weve ever heard before 
there is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree 
like a toothpick

ext  pascow and louis

louis has crumbled to pascows feet his eyes are squeezed tightly 
shut

				louis
		please i want to wake up leave me 
		alone its not my fault you died you 
		were as good as dead when they brought
		you in

				pascow
		the power of this place is old and
		always restless sometimes the dead
		do more than speak remember doc

camera begins moving slowly in on louis

				louis

				pascow
		remember

camera is tight on louis

int  louis in bed

his eyes snap open hes in his own bedroom as he sits up the 
camera angle widens out so we can see that hes in bed alone the 
covers on rachels side are thrown back

after the initial confusion and fear louis looks deeply relieved
he looks the way i suppose we all look upon waking up and 
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all

				rachel calls

serving dish on the dish is scrambled eggs strips of bacon and 
churchs corpsestaring eyes bloody ruff and all

				rachel impatiently
		dont shillyshally louis give the
		little girl her promise

				louis

				jud after a long pause
		maybe theres a better way

ext  the start of the path to the pet sematary long  evening

louis and jud cross the road from the crandall side louis is 
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the 
other jud has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of 
his own in the other

evening shadows have grown long its maybe an hour until dark

jud and louis stop near the replaced tireswing

ext  louis and jud

jud has a walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones 
slung around his neck

				louis
		jud this is crazy its going to
		be almost dark before we get back

				jud

		get where were going louis but
		we can do itand were going to

				louis
		but

				jud
		does she love the cat

				louis
		yes but

				jud
		then come on

he puts the earphones on effectively forestalling further 
argument and pushes the play button on the walkman we can hear 
marshall crenshaw singing crystal girl jud starts away after a 
moment louis follows

ext  the pet sematary and the back of the arch  late evening

the sound of cricketsreereeree

the sound of footfalls

faintly the sound of huey lewis and the news singing working 
for a living

its now almost twilight

jud and louis enter the pet sematary louis is looking around 
curiously

				louis
		well folks here we are in louis
		creed dreamland

jud snaps off the walkman and puts the earphones around his neck 
again

				jud
		what say louis

				louis
		nothing pause do we plant him on
		the outer circle or start a new one

				jud
		were still not where were going

he walks past louis and toward the deadfall louis follows

				louis

		the place were going is on the
		other side of that

he points at the deadfall

				louis
		we cant climb over that well break
		our necks

		to step just follow memove easydont
		look downand dont stop if you stop
		youll crash through for sure

				louis
		im not climbing that

				jud
		give me the cat ill take care of it
		myself

he holds out his hand and louis sees the old man means exactly as 
he says after a moment he says

				louis
		lets go

jud starts up one side of the deadfall and in spite of its 
snarled tangles he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of 
stairs after a few second louis follows

				louis low
		thank god my blue cross is paid up

ext  their feet

first juds pass the camera then louiss partly obscured by the 
swinging catbag their feet unerringly find the right branches 
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like anklebreakers

ext  louis

hes grinning exhilarated

				louis
		god this is amazing

ext  jud

there are beads of sweat on the old mans face he looks both 
stern and a little scared

				jud
		just dont stop and

ext  louis

he looks down

ext  louiss feet

a dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot 
plunges down maybe six inches

ext  louis

he lurches to the edge of balance then regains it

				louis
		and dont look down right

he continues

ext  the deadfall reverse  twilight

jud reaches the top and starts down the far side louis reaches 
the top

ext  louis

				louis amazed
		holy

ext  big god woods louiss pov

in the dying glow of twilight this should be a mystic awe
inspiring shot theres no more scrub underbrush and junk pines 
and juniperbracken here ancient firs rise almost like sequoias 
the sunset light shafts among them this is a real forest an 
old forest and winding upward among the trees along that needle
carpeted floor clearly marked by large white stones the path 
goes on

ext  louis

hes stopped on top of the deadfall still surveying all this with 
frank amazement

ext  jud

				jud turns to look
		come on louisdont stop

ext  louis atop the deadfall

				louis grinning
		im all right im f

ext  louiss feet

one of the branches snaps louiss foot plunges his cuff rips

ext  louis juds pov

were looking up at a fairly steep angle as louis staggers off
balance he steps with his other foot misses and goes flying

ext  louis closer

he does a halfsomersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his 
back the green garbage bag flying out of his hand his flashlight 
also goes branches crack white dust puffs out from under him

ext  jud at the base of the deadfall

louis thumps to the ground nearby jud kneels beside him

				jud
		louis you all right

louis sits up groggily his pants are torn his sweatshirt is 
torn his ankle is bleeding

				louis dazed
		sure i guess i just lost my happy 
		thoughts for a second there

louis gets slowly up and retrieves the bag which is rather 
shredded nowand we can see catfur through some of the rents

				louis continues
		i shouldnt have stoppedand it
		does bite

he whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the 
light comes on satisfied he shuts it off

				jud
		no you shouldnt have stopped but
		you got away with it important thing
		is are you sure youre all right

				louis
		yes pause where are we going jud

				jud
		youll see before long lets go

he starts off up the path after a moment louis follows carrying 
the bag

ext  louis and jud from the deadfall

again there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go 
tolling up the path into the twilight dwarfed by those ancient 
firs

sound of crickets low at first then up to loud reereeree

							dissolve to

ext  louis and jud at the edge of little god swamp  twilight

lots of undergrowth here and creeping groundmist too the sound 
of crickets is now only a part of the soundtrack buzz of cicadas 
thump of frogs swampsounds

louis looks frankly doubtful

				jud
		this next bits like the deadfall louis
		you got to walk steady and easy just follow
		me and dont look down

ext  little god swamp louiss and juds pov  deep twilight

mysteriousawesomescary dead trees poke out of the murk like 
twisted hands theres scummy water standing around tussocks 
covered with long grass most of it dead theres a lot of choking 
underbrush

all of this fades away into a grim obscuring fog

ext  louis and jud

				jud
		micmacs used to call it little god swamp

				louis
		is there quicksand

				jud
		ayuh

				louis nervous joking
		are there ghosts

jud looks at him expressionlessly

				jud
		ayuh

jud starts off stepping to the first tussock after a moment 
louis follows

ext  jud cu

his face is set strange

				jud
		theres a lot of funny things down
		this way louis

ext  louis behind jud

				louis
		youre telling me

ext  jud

				jud still walking
		the airs heaviermore electrical
		something you might see st elmos
		firewhat the sailors call foolights
		it makes funny shapes but its nothing

ext  louis

he looks up and his eyes widen as he sees

ext  angle on little god swamp louiss pov

a faintly glowing ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of 
the dead trees it looks a bit like a corpse in fact i think it 
looks quite a bit like pascows corpse

as we watch it fadesfadesis gone

ext  louis

hes somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being 
scared now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the 
surface of the standing water toward himand then just fades 
into the thick mist

				louis
		its funny all right

ext  jud

				jud
		just dont stop louis you dont
		ever want to stop down here in
		little god pause and you dont
		ever want to look behind you
		whatever you hear

ext  jud and louis long angle  night

we see them moving through the mist like wraiths jud with his 
digging tools louis with his light and his heftybag coffin the 
whole swamp is glowing dimly

ext  the far side of little god swamp  night

in the extreme fg we can see firm ground sloping up ahead is a 
thick white mist and here comes jud and louis slogging through it 
and out of it both of them are wet from the knees down they head 
into the woods on the far side

ext  a low stony bluff or steep hill

in the book this is described as being almost a cliff but a rocky 
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well we can see 
steps cut into the side and two figureslouis and judtoiling 
up them

ext  jud and louis a closer shot

juds panting and out of breath louis is if anything in worse 
shape

				jud
		almost there louis

				louis
		you keep saying that

				jud
		this time i mean it

he tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars 
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow a few moments 
later louis joins him and stares with undisguised wonder

ext  the micmac burying ground louis and juds pov

the top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare but there are a 
number of rocky piles but for every pile of rocks we can see 
there are ten littered heaps as if the neat piles had been burst 
apart theres a shape to all of this and it is the shape of the 
pet sematary concentric circles

sound the wind blowing ceaselessly

ext  louis and jud at the edge of the burying ground

				louis awed
		what is this place

				jud
		this was their burying ground louis

				louis
		whose burying ground

				jud
		the micmac indians i brought you here
		to bury ellens cat

				louis
		why for gods sake why

				jud
		i had my reasons louis well talk later
		all right

				louis
		i guess sobut

				jud
		you want to rest a bit before you start

				louis
		no im okay will i really be able to
		dig him a grave the soil looks thin

				jud
		soils thin all right but youll manage

he hands him the pick and shovel

				jud
		im going to sit over yonder and have a
		smoke id help you but youve got to
		do it yourself each buries his own
		thats how it was done then

jud walks away leaving louis with the digging tools in one hand 
and the flashlight in the other after a minute louis walks out 
into the burying ground

ext  looking down into a shallow hole  night

sound the wind it blows ceaselessly up here

the holes about two and a half feet deep stubby rocks protrude 
from the sides the pick comes down hits a rock at the bottom 
and flashes fire

ext  louis

he drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits beside 
him we see a low pile of rocks and earth

				jud voice
		should be deep enough

he joins louis hes got a lot of rocks in his arms

				louis
		you think so

he notices the rocks

				louis
		what are those for

				jud
		your cairn

ext  the micmac burying ground louiss pov

those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious

ext  louis and jud by churchs grave

				louis
		doesnt look like they last long

				jud
		dont worry about that

				louis
		jud why am i doing all this

				jud
		because its right

he walks off again

louis looks after him for a moment then kneels down

ext  louis by the garbage bag

he opens it and looks in at churchs stiffening corpse

				louis
		pax vobiscum church old buddy you
		were a hell of a god cat i doubt if
		you were worth all this aggravation
		but you were a hell of a good cat

he tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave and then 
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade

ext  the cairn cu  night

louiss hands come into the frame and add a final two or three 
stones

ext  louis by the cairn

he looks at it for a moment and stands up jud is right there

				jud
		thats fine you did real good

louis looks at him

ext  the creed house  night

theres a light on in the kitchen but thats all theres silence 
at first and then the phone starts ringing

ext  louiss field  night

louis and jud are coming down the path with their tools and their 
lights they are both clearly fagged out

sound faint the telephone

				louis
		oh shit rachel

he drops the tools and sprints

ext  the creeds side yard by the tire swing

louis runs into the side yard sound of the phone is louder

ext  the kitchen door of the creed house with louis

he runs to the door and inside

ext  the end of the path with jud

he stands there eyes inscrutable

int  the living room with the phone

it stops a beat later louis enters the room he picks it up 
although he already knows its too late he listens to the sound 
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle 
disgusted

he starts to dial a number from memory

				jud voice
		louis

int  the kitchenliving room doorway with jud

				jud
		when you talk to em not one word
		about what we done tonight sfars
		you know the cats still fine

int  louis by the phone

after a moment he lowers it into the cradle

int  jud

				jud
		youll understand in the meantime
		keep your peace what we did louis
		was a secret thing women are supposed
		to be the ones who are good at
		keeping secrets but any woman who
		knows anything at all would tell you
		shes never seen into a mans heart
		the soil of a mans heart is stonier
		louislike the soil up there in the
		old micmac burying ground a man
		grows what he canand tends it

during this hes come across the room to louis and dropped his 
hand on louiss shoulder

				louis
		but

				jud
		no buts accept whats done louis
		what we done was right another time
		it might not be but tonight it was
		at least i hope to christ it was now

ext  the road with jud

sounds boops and beeps of a touchtone telephone ringing then

				dory goldman voice
		goldman residence

		hi doryits louis

during this another sound has been growing an approaching truck 
as jud gains his side of the road he looks back and we read fear 
on his faceno matter what he said to louis hes sorry for 
tonights piece of work

a moment later a highballing orinco truck cuts between the camera 
and jud

int  louis in the living room  night

combined guilt and unhappiness hes looking at his hands which 
are still dark with the dirt from churchs grave

int  the goldman living room with ellie

before he can answer she puts the phone in gages hand ellie and 
rachel watch amused as gage gobbles into it perhaps rachel 
encourages him to say a few words

int  the creed lving room with louis

from the telephone comes the sound of gage talking and chortling 
louis is not listening his eyesand his mindare far away

ext  the creed house  morning

louis is raking leaves on the side lawn near the tree with the 
tire swing after a moment or two of this he props the rake 
against the tree and starts toward the garage he goes in

ext  the garage with louis

its dim in here louis is crossing to the door which communicates 
to the kitchen as he passes the station wagon he hears a cat 
hiss he turns

int  church ecu

hes on top of the car but at this point we probably dont 
notice the camera is so close that church looks like hes coming 
right down our throats hes hissing angrily

int  louis

he recoils and stumbles backward with a cry he hits a toolrack 
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a loud jangling 
noise

int  on top of the station wagon with church

he jumps down frightened by the noise and the camera tracks as 
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight

int  louis

he gets slowly to his feet again hes getting over his fright but 
we can see hes totally freaked out by what gave him that fright 
he goes to the garage door and looks out

slowly along a row pushing a wheelbarrow there are several 
pumpkins in it jud is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a 
ramones sweatshirt hes wearing his headphones and we can hear 
the romantics doing what i like about you jud is singing along 
and bopping a littleas much as his arthritis will allow if you 
can dig it

he takes out his pocketknife and slits the pumpkinvine he gets 
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up he turnsand louis is 
right there kind of a cheap jump but always fun looking 
totally stunned

				jud
		spirit of the north country not a good
		spirit wendigos are great liars and
		tricksters according to the stories 
		and if one touches you

jud pauses perhaps a flustered and gathers his thoughts

				jud
		maybe it really was a wendigo
		i aint the one to say it wasnt
		or maybe it was just some disease
		whatever the reason those that were
		left moved on but they left that
		placethe way it is now

jud shrugs and drinks

landscape is weird surreal cricket sounds amplified in fact 
there are a lot of swampy marshy soundstoo many it sounds 
almost prehistoric

sound harsh screaming laughter

louis stops he looks slowly around at

ext  mistface louiss pov

a demonic face takes shape in the mist and floats slowly toward 
the camera it runs out a tongue thats about nine feet long

its eyes blow out blood and thick gooey stuff runs from the 
sockets

ext  louis

he closes his eyes after a moment he opens them

ext  little god swamp louiss pov

nothing there

				louis
		see just imagination just

ext  louiss feet

we can barely see them because they are thick in mist but he is 
standing on a couple of low marshy tussocks suddenly a thick 
tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers 
around his ankle

				louis
		nothingthere

he turns around and begins to walk again

ext  louiss feet

the tentacle falls away

ext  louis in little god swamp

myriad sounds none of them pleasantlaughter gobbling howls 
screams sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of 
escaped lunatics louis continues on regardless

ext  woods

louis comes into the frame hes obviously tiring now but he 
keeps moving along

sound approaching footsteps big ones thudding ones something 
is coming which sounds approximately the size of a tyrannosaurus 
rex and it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder louis 
looks plenty scared

sound a falling tree

ext  woods louiss pov

those sounds keep getting closer and closer another tree falls
we see this one and now we see a shapejust a shape

hes scared almost to death his face turns upupup

ext  the woodsand the shape louiss pov

it is vaguely manlike perhaps sixty feet tall perhaps eighty we 
dont see it very well nor do we have toim not even sure its 
flesh and blood but there is a clear suggestion of a head now it 
turns and looks downlooks at louis creed we see great yellow 
eyes the size of lighthouse lamps

it makes a huge grunting soundand then walks on

ext  louis

the sound of footfalls is slowly diminishing

				louis
		it was the wendigo dear god i
		think the wendigo just passed
		within sixty feet of me

slowly he begins to walk again

ext  louis a new angle

in the extreme fg is a tree which has just fallenit is no 
small tree either but a great big old fir

louis approaches it stops looks at the tree looks down at

ext  the forest floor louiss pov

here is a gigantic animal trackif it was full of water louis 
could swim in it it looks like no animal track weve ever seen 
before three big claws at the end of it

ext  louis

looks up again his face is set and hard

				louis
		it doesnt matter come on gage

he starts to walk again

ext  the micmac burying ground

sound the wind lonesome and keening

the camera moves slowly toward the slope dreaming its way over 
those rocky cairnsmost of them burst apart

sound tortured breathing panting

louis toils his way into view carrying his bundle he reaches the 
top he makes his way slowly into the burying ground he stumbles 
over a rock falls down slowly gathers his things together and 
gets up again he goes a little further and then stops and looks 
at

ext  a broken cairn and the grave beneath louiss pov

we can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag

ext  louis

he slowly kneels down he puts the canvas tarp to one side and 
slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag by now he is 
clearly a man approaching total exhaustion

ext  a country road with an aries k

it tracks past the camera

int  the aries k with rachel and pascow

both of them look tense rachel is bolt upright behind the wheel 
suddenly bang as one of the tires blow

ext  the aries k

it goes skidding and slueing across the road the rear tire half 
off the rim it climbs the curb and hits a tree

int  rachel

she lurches forward but shes wearing her seatbeltgood girl 
she unbuckles it and gets out

ext  rachel

she looks at the car which now has quite a bit more wrong with it 
than just a scratch up the side

rachel slumps near tears louis isnt the only one whos been 
through a lot tonight

				rachel
		now what

pascow comes from around the tree as rachel walks to the road 
looking for cars or something he looks urgent and upset

				pascow
		its trying to stop you do you
		hear me its trying to stop you

rachel looks around uncertainlya little afraid as she scans 
the scene she looks atand throughpascow

				rachel
		is anyone there

after a moment of silence she turns back to the road lights 
appear and brighten as a car approaches rachel steps to the 
shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb surely for 
the first time in her life

the car sweeps by her without slowing

ext  gages cairn cu

louiss hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it the 
camera pulls back and we see him surveying his work beside him is 
the canvas tarp now open and empty

absently louis stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag where his 
tools have also been replaced and stands up with a wince one 
hand goes to his lower back he looks down at the cairn

				louis

louis is moving down the path as he passes the tire swing he 
pushes it setting it in motion

int  the garage

louis slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the 
kitchen church is under the table but louis doesnt see him

int  the upstairs hall

sound of louis slowly plodding up the stairs he comes into view 
dirty and exhausted his hair hanging in his face he walks down 
the hall toward the master bedroom

int  the bedroom

the clock on the bedtable reads 217 am louis falls facefirst 
on the immaculate bedspread and lies still

in this shot we should note the closet door is standing open

ext  the micmac burying ground featuring gages cairn

the camera moves in slowly holds nothing for a beat then

a small white hand slams up through the rocks hopefully scaring 
the living shit out of us

camera moves closer as the hand begins to feel around it takes 
one of the rocks and pushes it aside another another another

the sounds are not encouraging it is grunting and growling there 
is nothing human here

rocks begin to tumble as gage starts to come out of his grave

int  the creed bedroom with louis

fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater

ext  rachel

my babe is still takin a hike but here comes another vehicle

ext  the deadfall in the pet sematary

the camera moves in on that snarling face

sounds gage coming dead dry breath low snarling noises

deadfall

pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg

int  the creed kitchen with church

hes under the kitchen table green eyes gleaming i think he 
loves dead hates living

sound the doorlatch church miaows

int  the kitchen a new low angle

gages shoes grit slowly across the linoleum leaving dirty 
tracks church turns to watch gages passage and then follows

int  the bedroom with louis

camera holds on louis as those gritting footsteps approach then 
we pan to the closet on the floor is louiss little black bag we 
hold on this as the footfalls near a small white hand enters the 
frame and pulls the doctorbag out of the closet now another hand 
enters the frame and opens the bag the hands search around inside 
and bring out a scalpel

they hold it up the gagething makes a contented sound

ext  the orinco truck on route 9  night

it sweeps past the camera

int  the cab with rachel and driver

				rachel

		license right now

ext  jud on his porch

more deeply asleep than ever suddenly from inside comes the 
sound of quiet riot singingscreaming bang your head its the 
stereo and boy is it cranked

jud straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair his 
hands go first to his earphoneshis first thought on waking is 
that its coming from thereand then he hurries inside

camera pans down to small muddy tracks on the porch floor

int  the living room with jud

he hurries in turns on the light and rushes across to his stereo 
system which is stateoftheart digitalit looks like a flying 
saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room he 
shuts it off and looks around frowning

sound todd rundgren singing bang on the drum all day at the 
top of his voice

juds head snaps toward the sound

int  a sony radio cu

the camera pulls back as jud hurries across the kitchen to the 
counter where the radio is he turns it off looking around more 
bewildered than ever

				jud sharply
		whos here

he walks toward the door which gives on the hall

int  the hall with jud

its dimly lit by lightspill from the living room and kitchen

				jud
		come on stop playing games

sound molly hatchet flirtin with disaster being played top 
end from upstairs

jud hurries up let me suggest that there is a certain psychology 
at work herefor the moment hes more concerned about waking the 
neighborhood with all this highdecible rock and roll than with 
the prowlerand he would certainly know whoor whatthat 
prowler was if he had time to think

int  juds bedroom

he enters and turns on the light we see a portable phonograph 
with the record turning jud rushes over and turns it off

he looks around and we see by his face that he knows

				jud
		gage pause are you the one
		playing games

he goes to the window and looks out at

intext  the creed house with the station wagon juds pov

int  the bedroom with jud

he turns slowly and walks toward the bed

				jud
		gage come on out

he reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocketknife he unfolds 
the blade

				jud
		i want to show you something

sound miaow

int  the doorway with church juds pov

int  jud by the bed

				jud to the cat
		how did you

int  juds feet

a small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt 
of the coverlet and slashes juds calf

int  jud

he screams with pain and staggers backward

int  juds feet

the other hand shoots out gage grabs one of juds ankles and 
pulls

int  jud

with a startled yell he falls

int  jud and gage

this ones gotta be pretty rough george will know what to do we 
finally see gage but it should be clear to us that its not 
really gage at all some daemonic presence is riding inside the 
mouldering disfigured shell of gage

there is a struggle jud is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel 
perhaps he gets gage a time or two with the pocketknife

gage screams and gibbersnothing intelligible here only sounds

jud expires

gage sits on top of himand then bites into his throat

ext  route 9 between the crandall and creed houses

headlights rachels truck has arrived it pulls up

rachel opens the passenger door which is on juds side

ext  angle on the cab

we can see pascow sitting in the passenger seat where rachel just

he puts the doctorbag down on the bed and roots through it he 
comes up with three syringes still wrapped in paper and puts 
them aside then he roots around some more and comes up with 
several ampoules he holds one up for inspection and we can read 
the word morphine on it very clearly

int  the bedroom with louis

he carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the 
window his hair has gone partially white

he fills all three syringes with morphine using two ampoules for 
each syringeie enough to kill a polar bear and puts them in 
the left breast pocket of his shirt he puts the spare ampoules in 
the right breast pocket of his shirt

louis is slowly going insane what remains of his rationality is 
like a rapidly fraying rope

				louis
		what you buy is what you own and
		sooner or later what you own comes
		home to you wasnt that what you
		said jud wasnt that pretty much it

he leaves the room

ext  the front door of the creed house

to get the syringe into the cat and church almost gets away

of checking rooms first the bathroomand the shower curtain is 
of course pulled louis yanks it back nothing

he checks the linen closet nothing goes back to the hall looks 
down it he walks slowly along it he checks one room its a 
guest room shadowy and empty

bunch of ceramics inside it shatter loudly louis flinches back

he gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain 
he sees the skirt on the bedspread he lifts it he is nose to 
nose with jud who is dead with his eyes open an expression of 
incredible horror on his face

the door slams

louis bolts to his feet as giggles fade down the hall

slowly he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread 
which has mercifully fallen back into place

				louis
		im sorry jud im so sorry im

theres a squeaking squealing sound

louis turns around he gets up again he starts for the door then 
he turns back and speaks to jud again

				louis
		im going to set things back in
		order ii know just what to do

he goes out

int  the hallway with louis

he takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast 
pocket

				louis
		gage

another squeaking sound and another giggle

louis starts slowly forward he gets about halfway down the hall
and our nerves are tuned to the breaking pointwhen there is a 
squealing creak and a grating thump from overhead

int  ceiling trapdoor

this happens fast the trapwhich presumably gives on the attic 
with a set of folding stairsrises and rachels body plunges 
down through and then hangs swinging she has been bound around 
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of missy dandridge

half her face is gone eaten

int  louis

he screams and backs against the wall twang the last silver 
thread parts

int  the trapdoor with gage

he leaps down crashes on the floor and then picks himself up he 
is waving the scalpel

				gage screeching
		alleealleeinfree alleeallee
		infree alleealleeinfree

int  louis and gage

i wont choreograph all the moves but gage slashes his stunned 
father up pretty badly with the scalpel hes screeching the whole 
time louis finally begins to react he grapples with the little 
critter and tries to get the syringe into him no good its 
batted out of his hand just before he can do it it breaks

louis and gage fall to the floor louis gets the other syringe out 
of his pocket but its also knocked out of his hand only 
consolation is this one isnt broken it rolls off along the 
floor louis finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes 
on and plunges it into gages neck

				gage
		no fair no fair

he gets to his feet clawing for the needle lolling out of his 
neck hes lost all interest in his father he goes staggering 
away hes slowing down he goes to his kneesand falls on his 
face

louis watches this and then his vacant halfcatatonic gaze 
goes to

int  rachel louiss pov

she swings slowly back and forth

ext  the back yard of the crandall house

time has passed its late afternoon louis comes out with a 
sheetwrapped form in his arms rachel of course

he sets the body down and goes back inside

int  the kitchen with louis

hes splashing around a can of coaloil when hes got the room 
wetted down to his satisfaction he goes to the door lights a 
match and tosses it

flame runs across the floor the fire is slow at first but then 
it begins to gain rapidly

louis goes out

ext  the back lawn with louis

he picks up the sheetwrapped form of his wife and walks around 
the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows

ext  the front of the crandall house from across the road

louis appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road
