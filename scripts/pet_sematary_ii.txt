fade in

int  lemarche castle tomb  night 1865

a storm is raging outside we hear the clap and roll of thunder

tomb stairway 

rats scurry away down the scumcovered steps as the glow of a 
lantern and footsteps herald someones arrival

genvieve lemarche

emerges around the bend mid30s cultured beauty her dress and 
face are smeared with grime and is that blood we see too god 
only knows whats happened to her

genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open 
window

window

lightning streaks across the night sky outside we catch a glimpse 
of the moon disappearing behind the clouds

genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs the tomb itself

water trickles in through cracks in the lichencovered walls 
pooling on the tomb floor

genvieve moves forward her lantern throwing distorted shadows 
over everything

in front of her is anton lemarches stone sarcophagus
genvieve kneels in the water one hand resting on the spiked iron 
railing which surrounds the tomb she reaches the other hand 
towards a scumcovered plaque brushing the grime away

thunder and lightning reach a crescendo as

a skeletal hand rises out of the water reaching for her

genvieve screams the lantern falls from her grasp sputtering 
out the hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her 
breast instead

genvieve starts to laugh hysterically

				director os
			exasperated
		cut thank you renee can we
		throw some light on the set

				genvieve
		im sorry

suddenly it is lighter genvieve cant stop laughing the groping 
monster hand disappears back beneath the water

we pull back revealing 

its not 1865 the lemarche castle tomb is in fact a 90s movie 
set we are inside a soundstage on a raised set so the slugline 
should really read

knocks over the power box which sparks just as

crewmembers scream and scramble back

all the circuits are blowing lights exploding and showering 
sparks over the whole set this is not part of the movie

renee

its awful she shakes her smoking hands frozen to the iron 
railing by the electricity running through her

suddenly renee falls forward against the iron her face begins to 
smoke and singe

the lights continue to blow casting a strobic effect over the 
soundstage adding to the chaos

on geoff

as he witnesses the whole event he tries to rush forward but 
someone restrains him

ext  a dreamlike fog

a form drifts forward materializing out of the fog

its a casket appearing as if its floating among the clouds 
pulling back we see that its moving along a conveyor and now 
we can make out the faint form of a plane as the conveyor descends 
from the cargo compartment

the casket reaches the end of the conveyor a tag marks its final 
destination bangor maine hands reach in and lift the casket 
four baggage handlers hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and 
carry it off

				handler 1
		is it true she grew up around
		here

				handler 2
		yeah over in ludlow

				handler 1
		huh never met a movie star
		before

				handler 3
		well youre a little late for an
		autograph

the baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance the 
fog closes around them and we

								dissolve to

ext  pleasantville cemetery  day

we drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below off in 
the distance a crowd of mourners are gathered around a grave

				priest vo
		i am the resurrection and the
		life saith the lord

closer 

the headstone is adorned with an iron plaque it reads simply

			renee hallow matthews
				19551991

				priest vo
		she that believeth in me
		though she were dead yet shall
		she live and whosoever liveth and
		believeth in me shall never
		die

the casket is slowly lowered into the open grave as it descends 
we see geoff and his father chase standing at the forefront of 
the crowd renees grave is next to those of her parents

among the mourners is marjorie hargrove an attractive local girl 
in her early twenties

further down the hillside a wall of news reporters are gathered 
behind a ropedoff media boundary there is a blinding flurry of 
photo flashes as the press records the scene before them

a sheriffs department patrol car cruises up the cemetery drive 
pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters

out of the car steps gus gilbert gus is nearly forty with a 
sheriffs uniform fitted to his solid ageless frame gruff maybe 
a little selfimportant gus likes being a big fish in a small 
pond

				gus
			drawing near
		lets keep it back folks
		try to show her a little
		respect

a reporter ducks under the media boundary moving in for a closer 
shot

he doesnt make it two steps before hes intercepted by gus gus 
grabs the reporter and shoves him back

				gus
		hey what did i just say

gus means business one look into his eyes reveals his intense no 
nonsense approach

				reporter
		asshole

the reporter backs off

back at the graveside 

beneath the gloomy ominous skies the lines on chases face shade 
him as a decade older than his thirtyfive years chase gently 
places a comforting hand on geoffs shoulder

geoff inches forward pulling free of chases touch drawn to his 
mother drawn from his father the only blemishes on his youthful 
rosy cheeks are the tears the endless tears

				priest vo
		i know that my redeemer liveth
		and that he shall stand at the
		latter day upon the earth

geoff looks upon the casket gazing into the abyss of despair

following the ceremony

the crowd has dispersed

geoff is standing at the base of renees grave his eyes fixed 
unmoving unaccepting

chase is nearby watching not wanting to intrude on geoffs 
private moment

gus quietly moves in at chases side

				gus
		did she always have reporters
		following her around like this

				chase
		pretty much so

gus glances at geoff

				gus
		i hear you moved into town

				chase
		i wanted to get geoff out of
		la just start things over you
		know

gus nods now his eyes fall on renees headstone

				gus
		i remember when renee left she
		couldnt wait to get out of
		ludlow she used to say that
		life moved too slow here

chase forces a smile

				chase
		thats renee alright

				gus
		i suppose so

lazy oaks embrace a vintage twostory victorian home in the rural 
neighborhood of ludlow maine a commercial moving van is parked 
out front

marjorie the girl we saw at renees funeral is coming down the 
sidewalk she checks the address on the front of the house then 
heads up the driveway

int  downstairs hallway

moving boxes clutter the downstairs

chase is weaving through the maze doing an inventory on the 
boxes

a sweaty pair of movers are climbing up the stairs each is 
hunched  over with a garment box balanced on his back the side 
of each carton is boldly labeled renee  attic

				mover os
		weve got six more of these you
		sure you want them all in the
		attic

chase is contemplating a compromise when geoff appears from the 
kitchen doorway

				chase
		geoff what if we just give
		the clothes to goodwill well
		keep the rest just the clothes

geoff shakes his head firm and deliberate denial

				geoff
		youre the one who wanted to move
		nobody wouldve touched them if
		you didnt want to move here

chase weakens giving in

				chase
		all the renee boxes go in the
		attic sorry

marjorie knocks on the open frame of the front door

geoff recognizes her from his mothers funeral she flashes him a 
warm smile

				marjorie
		hi im marjorie hargrove your
		new housekeeper

marjorie has a naive friendly quality about her shes also 
blessed with eyepopping genetics standing there outside the 
door looking more than a little nervous we cant help but like 
her needless to say she doesnt look like your typical 
housekeeper

				marjorie
			re chases reaction
		is something wrong

				chase
		uh no you just look
		different than you sounded on the
		phone please come in

marjorie enters she grins at geoff again yep shes nervous 
alright

				marjorie
		im real excited about working
		for you mr matthews

				chase
		well were glad to have you
		marjorie you can call me chase
		by the way

marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of renees garment 
containers

				marjorie
		ive always admired ms hallow
		that scene she did in blue
		midnight where her lover meets
		her at the train station
			she sighs
		i mustve watched that movie four
		times

chase smiles marjories enthusiasm is endearing

just then one of the movers loses his grip a garment box bounces 
down the slope of the stairs when it reaches the bottom dresses 
spill over the floor

				marjorie
		oh ill get that

marjorie moves for the spill the first dress she touches is a 
beaded peach evening gown her fingers linger on the fabric

				marjorie
		this is gorgeous she wore this
		at the emmys didnt she

geoff moves forward acting overly defensive

				geoff
		hey dont touch her stuff it
		made her crazy when people touched
		her stuff

marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of geoffs statement

chase catches her eye shrugging apologetically

a van is parked outside the rear side panel is masked off with 
tape and a stencil chase grabs the corner of the tape and 
carefully peels it back revealing a crisp new business logo

square quiet relaxed as rural as they come

ext  veterinary office  day

chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office

on the door is chases nameplate and on the weathered wall is an 
outline of letters where the name and title quentin yolander 
doctor of veterinary medicine once was

geoff is first out of the van

int  examination room  day

geoff and chase move inside the offices look like they were built 
in the 40s a dark corridor stretches down the center of the 
suite faded green walls are solid with few exteriors its 
creepy in here

heavy grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does 
find its way in nothing looks like its been updated in the past 
fifty years

				chase
		this doesnt look so bad

chase sweeps a curtain aside revealing the interior to geoff 
dust swirls in the air

				geoff
		how long ago did this guy retire

				chase
		its been a few years

geoff takes a look around growing uncomfortable

				geoff
			skeptical
		a few

geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow 
darker and more dismal with every step he moves on into the 
boarding room

int  boarding area  day

rows of kennels are stacked along the walls smothered with 
cobwebs ancient rusted surgical equipment is scattered 
everywhere the place is a mess windows are boarded up and 
shadows cloak the room

over to the right geoff hears a rustling

a cardboard box on one of the shelves jiggles something is moving 
around inside it

geoffs eyes widen still morbid curiosity propels him forward

the box rustles again he reaches for it and

a creature leaps out at him howling geoff screams and jumps 
back the box tumbles over and

a cat crawls out behind the protective mother are four of the 
cutest kittens weve ever seen mewing away

geoff sighs just as chase rushes into the room

				chase
		whats wrong

				geoff
			embarrassed
		nothing i just got spooked by a
		bunch of furballs

inside the box is a note chase reaches for it it reads and a 
warm welcome to you

				chase
		great now ive opened an
		orphanage too

one of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at geoff with 
sleepy eyes her fur is striped

				geoff
		well ill take one if its
		okay

geoff lifts the fragile creature cradling it in his arms

				geoff
		she looks like a tiger

chase spies an old broom resting in the corner

				chase
		tell you what you do some
		sweeping up here and shes yours

geoff nods and chase moves back out into the hallway

geoff sets the box back upright and lowers tiger in with the other 
kittens he reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away 
the cobwebs

just as soon as he turns his back tiger climbs the side of the 
box spilling over onto the floor

int  examination room

chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies when he places 
them in the cabinet he stirs up a layer of dust

tiger scampers by as chase coughs his way out of the cloud of 
dust

int  waiting area

tiger sees the front door ajar and as she approaches to explore 
what lies beyond

the door swings open

zowie a siberian husky is staring back at her hes black and 
white with blue eyes with a mask that is at once menacing and 
majestic

a pudgy thirteen year old boy drew has a hold of the dogs 
collar

zowies bark sends tiger scrambling

drew loses his grip as zowie yanks free a strong paternal 
command calls after drew from outside

				voice os
		drew you get a handle on that
		dog now

int  examination room

chase spins around at the commotion as tiger darts across the 
floor with the barking dog in pursuit

mayhem ensues as zowies big paws slip on the slick tile

geoff rushes in from the boarding area

tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney

zowies snoot wedges beneath the base inches from tigers tiny 
striking paw

drew slides in on his knees renewing his hold on zowies collar 
he pulls the dog back

geoff rescues tiger from beneath the gurney

drew shrugs sheepishly

				drew
		sorry he gets kinda hyper

drews stepfather gus gilbert enters the dreaded domineering 
voice of authority in drews life we know him as the sheriff at 
renees funeral

				gus
		hell he thought it was lunch
		how ya doin chase

			aside
		drew where the hell are your

geoff the boys shake

				geoff
		hes a cool lookin dog

zowie lurches forward eager to shower affection on geoff geoff 
strokes the dogs soft mane

				geoff
		whats his name

		zowie

drew puts his palm under zowies chin and turns him for chase to 
see there are several scabbedover gashes on his left cheek

				gus
		damn dog stuck his nose in on my
		rabbits and they ganged up on him
		i swear that dogs an idiot

				drew
		is he gonna be okay

with one eye on zowie chase sprays some antiseptic on the 
examination table and wipes it clean

				chase
		lets have him hop up here

drew prods zowie zowie jumps up onto the table chase looks over 
the facial lacerations then turns on a penlight and examines the 
dogs eyes

gus passes a lingering look over tiger he reaches in to pet her 
making sure it meets with geoffs approval

				gus
		when i was young i thought cats
		were the girls and dogs were the
		boys

				chase
		there are three more girls where
		that one came from looking for
		homes

drew perks up at the thought but gus shoots it down

				gus

geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his mountain 
bike

				geoff

ext  van  day

as chase pulls away we see the handmade sign taped in the back 
window

				priceless kittens
				free to a good home

ext  school  day

drew is among a small circle of boys he recognizes geoff walking 
his bike from the van the largest of the boys clyde takes 
notice of the unfamiliar face

clyde is fifteen going on twenty you know the type local bully 
held back a year or two

				clyde
		check it out thats the new kid
		the son of that movie star

mischief gleams in clydes eyes as he watches geoffs every move 
the other boys follow suit clyde always takes the lead

geoff fields their penetrating stares for a second his eyes 
connect with clydes then he moves on into the building

among the boys drew is the reluctant participant

int  classroom  day

mrs gordon is addressing a room of seventh graders

geoff is doodling in his notebook feeling acutely out of place as 
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new 
classmates are giving him

				mrs gordon
		people this is geoff matthews
		hell be joining our class for the
		rest of the school year

as mrs gordon points to him geoff drops his face even lower 
this is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer hed like 
to throttle mrs gordon

a frecklefaced boy doug fires off a question

				doug
		hey whats hollywood like do
		you know eddie murphy

				geoff

				mrs gordon
		why dont we save that for later
		doug

a girl with braces susan continues the interrogation

				susan
		what about julia roberts

				mrs gordon
		susan thatll be enough

susan shuts up geoff sinks even lower in his seat

the kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room

but one classmates eyes are still on geoff its clyde

clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in geoffs jacket he
catches a glimpse of tigers bobbing nose popping out

int  hallway  day

geoff joins the stampede of kids as the bell releases them for the 
day almost immediately clyde and his cronies stevie and brad 
fall in step behind him drew hangs slightly off to the side not 
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation

				clyde
		whats the hurry junior where
		you off to

clyde quickens his pace pulling ahead of geoff and stopping in 
front of him stevie and brad move in on either side surrounded 
by peers its apparent how small geoff is for his age

on the wall next to them is a bulletin board display clyde 
glances at it geoff follows his gaze

display

its one of those corny school affairs with construction paper 
letters spelling out we remember renee hallow beneath that are 
pictures of renee clipped from various magazines cloyingly 
tasteless

				clyde
			feigning remorse
		too bad about your mom papers
		said it was pretty gross getting
		fried like that guess you saw
		it huh

geoff nods clyde raises his eyebrows pulling geoffs jacket 
open

				clyde
		so what are you hiding there

				stevie
		when you bring a friend to school
		youre supposed to introduce him

geoffs arm tightens protectively around tiger

				geoff
		her names tiger

				clyde
		tiger dont you think thats
		kind of a pussy name
			reaching out
		can i hold her i promise ill be
		real careful

clyde has a convincing way about him geoff reluctantly hands the 
kitten over clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would 
never question his sincerity

geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in 
clydes tone something sinister

				clyde
		hey geoff you ever seen a
		kitten run

				geoff
		ive seen her run around the
		house

clydes eyes narrow he takes a couple of steps back geoffs 
heart starts to sink

				clyde
		no i mean really run
			beat
		like this

clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with tiger brad 
and stevie fall in behind him laughing

drew shrugs apologetically hes torn but he tears off after them 
nonetheless

				geoff
		shit

geoff runs off in pursuit of them

ext  school  day

geoff rushes from the building searching the dispersing crowd 
there they are tearing from the bike racks pedaling for the 
street

clyde sees geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as 
they ride by

geoff runs for the bike racks

ext  road  day

clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town riding out 
onto the open road

clyde glances back toward the center of town

geoff is so far behind hes barely visible

clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead raising tiger nose to 
nose with him

				clyde
		having fun yet

clyde and his smirking buddies ride on out of frame

with geoff

giving the pedals all he can struggling to keep pace with the 
boys

further along

scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead cochran lake 
stretches into the distance beyond the housing

clydes clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a 
residential property the twostory house is weathered and boarded 
up it looks vaguely familiar creepy

and when we find the mailbox post we know why the name is faded 
but theres no question who once lived there five bold letters 
creed

geoff whips by in a blur still in pursuit

ext  countryside  day

clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes theyve taken 
position on top of the slope of the hill standing at the foot of 
the path to the pet sematary

antics

				drew
		come on clyde just tell him
		where the cat is

				clyde
			turning on drew
		i told him where the cat is
		now shut up fuckface

clyde punches drew in the arm drew shrinks back

geoff flashes a hateful stare at clyde

all of the boys but clyde are uncomfortably silent theres 
something frightening about clyde something that extends beyond 
the standard bully antics we begin to get the feeling that this 
kid is genuinely deranged

				clyde
			relishing the
			moment
		you heard about the creed murders
		yet and the place where the dead
		come back to life

he motions to the path behind him

				clyde
			continuing
		its just back there just down
		that path

				drew
			meekly
		clyde its not funny anymore

				clyde
		oh so you got a problem
		whatre you gonna do fatass you
		gonna sic big bad old gus after
		me

drew shuts up clyde turns back to geoff drawing closer

				clyde
		what do you think geoff maybe
		you could dig up your mom and take
		her back there maybe if you pray
		real hard shell come back

with this last remark clyde has pushed too far geoffs face is 
red with anger

				geoff
			quietly
		just give me the cat asshole

clydes grin falters a moment

				clyde
		excuse me maybe im a little hard
		of hearing but did you just call
		me an asshole

clyde pokes geoff in the shoulder

				clyde
		you mad geoff cause if you are
		you should take a shot at me

this time clyde shoves geoff back even harder

				clyde
		come on you pussy whats the
		matter with you

clyde moves forward again and geoff suddenly lashes out catching 
everyone off guard

for an instant drew marvels at geoffs tenacity

clyde lunges he hammers geoff with blows

outsizing him by forty pounds clyde tosses geoff to the ground 
geoff struggles but clydes grip proves arresting

clyde throws geoff onto his stomach forcing his face into the 
dirt it looks as if hes ready to smother his opponent

drew is the first to rush in brad and stevie quickly follow it 
takes all three of them to peel clyde off geoff

clyde gets to his feet and backs away theres great pleasure in 
his crazed eyes as he watches geoff coughing and gasping

				clyde
		fuckin asshole

satisfied hes handed out enough ill will for the day clyde turns 
away

drews attentions remain on geoff as clyde strolls by he grabs 
drews arm and swings him around

				clyde
		this way fatboy

stevie and brad follow as the group passes geoffs bike clyde 
gives it a kick knocking it over then theyre gone

geoff pulls himself to his feet brushing off the mess he heads 
up the path in search of tiger

ext  pet sematary  day

the woods here have grown long with shadows the air is still and 
the sound of birds is conspicuously absent

a wooden archway frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard 
scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a childs barely 
legible attempt at pet sematary

geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude crowded graves 
collars leashes bird cages and other accessories adorn the 
makeshift crosses and headstones

geoff moves along the outer circle of markers each crafted by a 
childs caring hands

as he searches he cant help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs 
on the outer circle he sees a crateboard marker memorializing 
smucky the cat he was obediant

moving inward the markers are older the ones he can still read 
convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death

here is a wide flat upright board planted deep in the earth in 
memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march 1 1965

the next three rows are illegible the inscriptions are weathered 
beyond recognition and then chiseled into sandstone hannah 
the best dog that ever lived 19291939

and now meow faint but very much alive

geoff picks up his pace weaving quickly toward the center

there he finds tiger trapped in a rusted old birdcage its base 
swallowed by the grave

geoff opens the door and frees tiger stroking the trembling 
kitten

geoffs eyes are drawn to the far perimeter to the deadfall

the deadfall looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of 
skeletal remains an abstract stairway to things beyond a wind 
picks up just then sending leaves skittering in waves across the 
ground

ext  drews house  dusk

crude cages house dozens of rabbits situated alongside the 
garage a sign above the cages reads pet rabbits  1000 bells 
positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play

gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage

finishing it off he hangs the plug next to an outside socket 
moving onto the next chore he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into 
feeding slots for the hungry rabbits

setting the feed aside he takes a seat opening one of the cages 
he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap gently petting its soft 
fur

one of the cages starts to vibrate

gus gives it a look a pair of rabbits arent interested in 
eating theyre joined in fast and furious passion

gus gets a chuckle out of the sight

				gus
		way to go romeo

gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch and before he goes he sinks 
the plug into the socket an electrical charge dances along the 
base of the cage a deterrent for intruders

laying at drews feet in the living room drew is watching a music 
video on tv

pass the rabbit dens zowie alters his path drew gets a handful 
of his collar and pulls him back

across the yard is an enclosed dog run twenty feet long by ten 
feet wide drew puts zowie inside with the dog food

drew strokes zowies mane affectionately then backs away closing 
the woodframed door to the dog run

int  drews kitchen  night

amandas about to put the roast on the table when gus nuzzles up 
behind her breathing down her backside with his drink in hand 
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of 
the neck

gus eases his free hand around between amanda and the counter and 
presses his palm firmly into her crotch drawing her body tight to 
him

she stiffens at his intimate hold uncomfortable with his timing

				amanda
		gus please

at the back door drew is watching from beyond the screen 
disgusted by the sight of gus pawing his mother drew swings the 
door open as loud as he can to signal his return

gus plants a last kiss on the back of amandas neck and backs off 
but before he goes he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving 
platter leveling his leering eyes at amanda he stuffs it into 
his mouth suggestively

				gus
		god damn youre good

drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table returning his 
attention to the tv where another music video is on

gus glances at the tv annoyed by the music he drops into his 
spot at the head of the table blocking drews view drew leans to 
the side for a better look gus takes notice and leans to the same 
side to obstruct his view

				gus
		youre breaking the law here
		drew

				amanda
		really gus it wont bother me

gus ignores her inching forward with a confidential harsh 
whisper

				gus
		your moms spent the last hour
		cooking stop being a little jerk
		and show her some appreciation

drew aims the remote control at gus as if to shut him up and 
silences the tv

amanda approaches with the roast the moment its on the table 
drew starts dishing up a hefty serving gus spears drews fork 
with the serving fork

in the still of the night gus rabbit pens sit unattended and 
then we hear the tinkling of dog tags snoozing rabbits awaken as 
zowie lumbers into frame

zowie rises on his hind legs pressing his paws to a cage blue 
sparks fly as zowie is jolted with the electrical charge

		what drew what did you say

gus throws drew aside brings the rifle back up and fires another 
random shot after the fleeing dog all the while his eyes remain 
on drew as if this were the boys lesson to be learned

he squeezes off one more shot

a pained yelp echoes from the hillside zowies yelp

drew whips his head aside in sickened shock even gus is sobered 
by the unexpected hit

all they can hear now are zowies whimpering cries diminishing in 
the night

drew shoots gus a look of such unbridled hatred that gus is 
speechless he backs away from gus and darts off toward the dark 
hillside

when gus turns back for the house amanda is standing there

				amanda

nothing until a faint cry drifts back at him

deeper in the woods

zowie limps into frame blood is flowing from the bullet wound in 
his left hindquarter trailing from his suspended leg every step 
is a strain

drew

comes upon a break in the trees the hanging moon outlines the 
knoll stretching beyond and then the strained breathing the 
hushed whimper

drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll

zowie is just beyond lying on his side at the end of the bloody 
trail his chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every 
effort to survive

drew drops to his knees at zowies side and cradles the dog in his 
lap shaking his head in denial

zowies weak eyes shift gazing longingly at drew

drew strokes the fur under zowies chin hardly able to see the 
dog through his glaze of tears

zowies eyes drift off his chest falls and doesnt rise again he 
falls limp in drews arms drew hugs zowie even tighter and he 
begins to weep

from a distance

road a whistle catches his ear

		i was just going by your house
		wheres your bike

the closer geoff gets the more he sees of drews despair then he 
sees the dried blood staining drews clothes

				drew
		zowies dead

geoffs heart sinks an unspoken moment of sympathy passes between 
the boys fighting the emotions drew finally speaks

				drew
		i have to bury him i dont want
		to go out there alone

theres such grief in drews words that geoff cant resist he 
glances toward his house to make sure he hasnt been seen then 
blends into the woods

ext  pet sematary  day

drew carries zowies relaxed form in his arms geoff is following 
balancing a pickaxe and shovel

arriving at the graveyard geoff searches the outer perimeter for 
a vacant stretch of soil finding one he lets the heavy tools 
fall to the ground

				geoff
		is this a good spot

				drew
		im not burying him here

				geoff
		why not

				drew

drew heads for the base of the deadfall with zowie in his arms

geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him

				geoff
		hey wait up

ext  the bog  day

geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall

beyond is a dark swamp a bog looking unlike anything one would 
expect in maine tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation 
that looks almost prehistoric gnarled trees rise up from the 
murky earth blocking the sun from view

geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with 
drew somewhere off in the distance we hear an unearthly sound 
not a bird not any animal known to man

spectral shapes flicker at the edge of geoffs vision sinking 
back into the shadows as geoff tries to focus on them

				geoff
			uneasy
		drew where are we going

drew doesnt respond he continues on without another word hell
bent on finding this better place

further along  day

at the boundary of the bog a stairway of huge wide stones rises 
from the blanket of ground fog bordered by fir trees leading up 
the hillside the final leg of drew and geoffs journey

				drew
		this is it i wasnt sure if it
		even really existed

				geoff
		what did

				drew
		the old indian burial ground

drew starts up the stone steps geoff has no choice but to follow

ext  micmac burial ground  day

even in broad daylight the flattopped mesa has a sense of 
foreboding isolation theres an almost palpable sense of 
wrongness about this place as if the darkness of a dying black 
hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth

drew and geoff approach the circle of rocky soil they stand at 
the border looking it over in eerie silence

somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly sound again 
only this time its closer

				geoff
		look lets just get this over
		with

even drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into 
he gently sets zowies body on the ground

				drew
		if this doesnt work dont ever
		tell anyone i did this okay you
		gotta promise

geoff nods and hands over the digging tools drew swings the 
pickaxe sinking it into the ground

				geoff
		you want me to help

				drew
		you have to bury your own thats
		the way the indians did it its
		like a rule

backing away from the burial ground geoff takes a seat on a rock 
at the border of the forest from there he watches

drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the 
rocky ground

we move in on geoff whos looking on with skeptical intrigue as 
the rhythmic sound of the tools continues

geoff shrugs pondering such a thought

geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum offering 
one to drew with only a quick glance away from the grave drew 
snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth geoff does the 
same

this is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog fur shiny and 
wet the gaping gunshot wound in his rear zowies head hangs low 
his eyes gleaming red the husky is covered with dirt from head to 
toe

drews eyes widen in astonishment

zowie staggers across the room towards drew nails clicking on the 
floorboards drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog 
moves closer

zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed across drews lap 
and slowly perfunctory his tongue licks drews cheek this last 
action of zowie displaces drews fear tears well up in the boys 
eyes

its a womans voice a familiar one now we hear the rhythmic 
creak of a rocking chair and with it comes the voice again 
humming a haunting lullaby

wideeyed geoff turns his head toward the source

a womans nondescript form is seated in the rocking chair across 
the room rocking forward her face passes into a swath of 
moonlight

its renee with the rock of the chair her face recedes back into 
the shadows her soothing hum remains

and again her face passes into the swath of light and again it 
retreats

geoff raises his hand reaching out for her

renees hand rises from the shadows reaching for him

but suddenly the room begins to stretch

the rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes 
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their 
control

lightning flashes in the bedside window renee is falling farther 
and farther away

bolts up from his pillow awake now face wet with perspiration 
it was a nightmare except if it was a nightmare why do we still 
hear

geoff slowly turns his head once again repeating the actions of 
his dreams

in the shadows the chair is still rocking as it comes forward

the chair

for a pulse he checks a number of places then shakes his head 
totally confused

				chase
		i cant seem to find a pulse it
		must be so weak its not

dark clouds paint the foreboding sky a broken pulse of lightning 
streaks through the dense haze

abandoning their bikes next to the path drew and geoff approach 
the archway the graveyard beyond is deathly silent

they pass beneath the archway entering the clearing

and now a soft chilling voice drifts over the graves

				voice os
		geoff honey mommys here

geoff freezes in his tracks awestruck as

a womans body

swoops down from the darkness above materializing out of nowhere 
a fluttering negligee flowing blonde hair

renees face appears out of the shadows masked with sadness

geoff swallows the lump in his throat

renees form keeps coming but even as she approaches her visage 
grows less distinguishable just a phantom countenance now a 
shadow framed by golden hair resting atop a veiled body

shes coming so fast that shes upon geoff in no time he fumbles 
back startled out of his wits

the body is upon him now flailing wildly geoff thrashes and 
struggles screaming bloody murder

gradually he realizes the body isnt fighting back geoff eases 
his struggle lets his scream fall off

now he hears wild mischievous laughter

drew pulls the body away its just a heavy wad of stuffed 
clothing a dummy dressed in a negligee capped by a blonde wig 
it dangles near the end of a slanted wire

clyde stevie brad and a half dozen other costumed kids appear 
from the nearby cover of bushes doubled over in laughter

clyde tugs at a piece of twine thats connected to the back of the 
dummys head and makes spooky sounds the dummy jumps around on 
the slanted wire

clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward

				clyde
		look at this junior here
		practically shit his pants

clyde drops down nose to nose with geoff whos still recovering

				clyde
		maybe youre too chicken to hang
		out with the rest of the boys
		you gonna run home to daddy now

geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet he stares into 
clydes eyes

				geoff
		fuck off

geoff pushes past clyde and moves on into the graveyard somehow 
managing to keep his dignity intact

drew follows then the rest of the boys leaving clyde staring 
after them standing alone with the dummy

crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer turning as gus

gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes he 
fires one up

a sickened look flushes through amanda as gus pulls his eyes away 
from her and marches upstairs

ext  pet sematary  night

by now nearly two dozen costumed kids have gathered at the pet 
sematary in the midst of the graves a small storytelling 
campfire burns a number of the boys sip beer trying to pretend 
that the bitter aftertaste doesnt bother them

clyde sits up front at fourteen hes the elder statesmen of the 
group with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other 
clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn

				clyde
		yeah that old louis was one
		sick fuck digging up little gage
		like so maggots pouring out of
		that kids eyes

clyde whistles he drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke 
ring sees he still has an audience

				clyde
		ellie was the only creed that
		lived then one night a few
		months later ellie freaks out
		and she hacks up her grandparents
		with an axe
			beat
		police found her licking their
		brains off the blade they
		locked her up in a psycho ward and
		all she said were two words pet

clyde stares at the wideeyed kids he grins takes a swig of 
beer and moves in for the kicker

				clyde
		oh yeah almost forgot heres
		the best part two nights ago she
		escapes word is she was heading
		for maine man i hope she doesnt
		show up out here
			feigning concern
		shit we wouldnt even notice her
		not if shes wearing a costume
		she could be one of us

clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group the kids uneasily look 
at each other making sure they know whos behind each and every 
costume

suddenly clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror

				clyde
		oh my goddd

clyde lifts a trembling finger pointing beyond the group of 
spellbound listeners

				clyde
		its its

the kids are afraid to turn around assuming clydes rigged up 
some unspeakable terror

and for an instant a look of real horror washes over clydes 
face

a figure

is coming up the path beneath the archway rising out of the 
swirling mist a frightening silhouette backlit by the moon

but then clyde realizes who it is

				clyde

crosses

scans the area with his flashlight illuminating the various beer 
cans

				gus

geoff pulls drew to his feet

gus passes the flashlight over the woods kids duck away 
retreating from their hiding places

the flashlight sweeps toward drew

drew freezes spotlighted by gus beam a burst of lightning 
floods drews horrified face

				gus
		get out here joker

geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby out of gus light

behind gus the wooden cross is completely on fire now

				gus
		you out here making a fool of me

drew shakes his head in instant denial

				gus
		im warning you buddy you dont
		play by the rules im gonna
		shadow your ass for eternity

drew makes a break from his spot in the woods he weaves through 
the markers arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid gus

but gus is quicker he zigzags through the crosses and 
headstones to intercept drew

gus gets a handful of drews collar and yanks him in

				gus
		you little shit

gus draws his free arm back and smacks drew across the face drew 
goes down

geoff

is looking on from the woods horrified torn

drew

cowers on the ground trying to scramble away

geoff bolts out into the firelight staring defiantly at gus in 
silent accusation

gus is beyond furious lightning flashes again

				gus
		you get out of here geoff
		matthews this is between me and
		my boy

geoff doesnt move gus starts to advance forward

but the growl emanating from the woods gives him pause 
everyone turns

a rustling is heard in the bushes and zowie emerges into the 
building firelight flashing his fangs at gus his eyes glow red

gus freezes studying zowie

zowie inches forward poised for the attack

				gus
		call off your dog drew

drew shifts his eyes from zowie to gus too terrified to heed such 
a command

zowie brushes past drew and geoff moving in on gus

gus eyes shift to burning cross at his side with a swift boot 
he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip

swinging the cross like a primitive weapon gus connects with the 
side of zowies head

zowie spins a full circle from the impact but he lands on all 
fours unphased taking the next step toward gus theres 
something clearly not of this world in zowies vicious stare

				gus
			terrified

all drew can manage is a faint appeal

				drew
		zowie

zowie goes for gus launching into the air

				gus

and sinking his glistening fangs into gus neck

an eruption of blood showers the closest headstone

gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog his 
screams are suddenly cut short as zowie rips out his throat his 
arms flail weakly at his sides then grow still

drew and geoff stare at the scene wideeyed with shock

zowie looks up from gus neck with dripping red fangs for a 
moment his eyes settle on drew then zowie bolts off 
disappearing into the night

				drew
		oh god oh god

drews eyes shift to geoff whose face is flushed with sickened 
fear

				geoff
			a whisper
		is he dead

in dazed shock drew moves in for a closer look at the body

gus eyes are wide open blood is still pumping in rhythm from his 
jugular with each weakening beat of his heart its a gruesome 
image against the roaring fire

drew kneels at gus side he wants to touch him to shake him 
awake but with every attempt he draws his hand back

				geoff
		is he breathing can you hear him
		breathing

drew leans forward turning his ear toward gus gaping mouth and 
as he inches closer

gus fingers twitch

his hand jerks up and closes around drews neck gus stares up at 
him with his crazed menace

drew screams his fingers claw at gus hand desperate to pry it 
loose

but then gus hand relaxes as his last dying ounce of 
strength fades away

drew shrinks back crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing 
firelight dances over it he turns his tearfilled gaze to geoff

				drew
		oh man geoff we killed him
		we killed him
			beat
		whatre we gonna do

geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead mans face

				geoff
		we could bring him back

drews eyes widen at the suggestion

and now gazing down on gus body and on the boys we pull up 
into a slow spiral

we move ever higher until we are looking down upon the entire pet 
sematary at the sound of a shovel cutting into rocky soil we

sleep tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest 
slowly we move back towards the window

in a flash of lightning

gus face

appears outside washed in the haunting white glow streaked with 
mud caked with blood staring in at geoff

geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of thunder and whips his 
gaze to the window before he can focus

the pulse of lightning fades away and with it gus face only 
darkness remains beyond the window pane

geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom unaware of gus appearance 
he sinks back to his pillow already hurtling towards sleep once

closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds

hes holding a small poodle in his lap its big brown eyes are 
staring back at him

				yolander
		youd be so much more interesting
		with blue eyes

and now one of the poodles eyes pops out yolanders finger 
comes through from beneath the eye socket

on closer examination we realize that the dog is not alive at 
all yolander has his hand inside the hollowedout carcass

he carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and 
selects the right shade of blue a shot of whiskey rests nearby

yolander reaches up into the poodles belly and fits the blue eyes 
securely into place

theres a knock at the door yolander ignores it maybe hes deaf 
another knock yolander turns towards the door annoyed at the 
intrusion and behind that annoyance theres a touch of madness

pulling back we see the rest of the room stuffed animals are 
crowded from floor to ceiling a product of yolanders obsession 
with taxidermy

				yolander
		im immortalizing a poodle state
		your business

yolander presses some stuffing into the poodles gut and begins to 
sew up the stomach

yolanders attention remains on the needle as he meticulously 
stitches the belly

		analysis they tell me i sent
		them the blood of a dead animal

at this yolander breaks his concentration the needle pricks his 
hand blood oozes from the puncture dripping onto the dogs 
stomach

chase stands in the doorway startled it doesnt take a genius to 
figure out that the good doctor is drunk

		why are you bothering me about
		this cant you leave it be

				chase
		i um

chase glances to the right and steps back

is perched nearby frozen in midpounce it takes a second for 
chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed

now chase sees the rest of the room a whole zoo of stuffed 
animals looking like a rural version of the bates motel

look in gus eyes then slowly a limp smile creeps over him 
sending a chill up geoffs spine

theres no other response

cracking open the chamber drew loads two shells into the chamber

ext  countryside  night

a moonlit horizon unmoving silent the kind of silence that 
pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination

and now a lone figure appears on the horizon its zowie moving 
at a deliberate pace

atop a knoll

zowie takes pause the tinkling of his collar tags resumes as he 
drops over the horizon line cutting down the hill

int  chases house  night

chase sits in the den looking exhausted and disheveled in front 
of him the tv is on renees face stares out at us chase hits 
the remote and rises moving to the back door

he checks the deadbolt then secures the chain link as a backup 
from somewhere outside we hear a dog howl

chases eyes drop to the doggy door a holdover from the previous 
owner chase bends down and latches the door

now he pauses at his desk considers then pulls something out 
of the bottom drawer its a gun

int  hallway  night

chase moves to the front of the house securing that door 
satisfied he turns off the light and heads upstairs

we stay at the foot of the stairs 

moving into darkness shadow and form begin to take shape we hear 
a low growl and see a flash of red eyes its zowie already in 
the house

int  chases bedroom  night

coming through the door from the downstairs chase stops cold

renee is on the bed clothed in a negligee lying across a blanket 
of rose petals her eyes meet his with powerful longing

				renee
		chase i miss you so much

				chase
			drymouthed
		renee

chase approaches slowly fearful that this is all a dream

renee reaches out her hand they touch this is not a dream

				chase
		oh god

chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as renee draws 
his body to hers

they kiss once twice not a dream

renee rolls chase over forcefully climbing on top chase sinks 
down into the center of the bed as renee straddles him

slowly renee slips off the top of her negligee

				renee
			a whisper
		i can come back chase

and sinks down on top of him kissing him hungrily

her nipples graze his chest then her breasts flatten as she 
grinds her hips against his

almost instantly the weight of her grows unbearable chase fights 
to pull his mouth from hers to breathe

				chase
		no too heavy

there is no pleasure in his words just unmitigated horror as 
renees body comes down on him harder

				chase
		cant breathe i cant

chases eyes

pop open frenzied as he comes out of his dream

chase is alone on the bed but hes still feeling the weight 
pressing down on him

zowie

is laying on his chest staring back at him rearing his teeth in 
a growl

zowie lunges forward jaws flashing and chase twists sideways

gnashing teeth connect with chases shoulder then with the 
pillows where chases head used to be a blizzard of down feathers 
erupts

chase scrambles out of bed flailing for the gun on the bedside 
table

the gun spins out of reach and across the floor

chase dives for the gun and reaches it just as zowie leaps to the 
floor in a panic chase fires wild

zowie abruptly turns and smashes through the bedroom window 
sending glass flying

ext  house  night

zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below 
disappearing into the night

int  chases bedroom  night

chase looks on in terror finally he pulls his eyes away from the 
shattered window

and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror 
something that sends a chill up his spine

the flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress but 
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of rose petals 
slowly settling to the bed

int  bathroom  morning

chase is barechested at the mirror applying a dressing to the 
dog bite on his shoulder

marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry she 
stops short at the sight of chase standing there in his boxers

chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled

				marjorie
		i didnt mean to i was going to
		empty the hamper

chase turns shaking off the scare

				chase
		its okay

marjories eyes cant help but fix on the dog bites scattered over 
chases chest and arms

				marjorie
		what happened to you

				chase
		i had a little runin with zowie

				marjorie
		you sure did

marjorie sets the laundry aside

				marjorie
		here let me do that

marjorie looks over the antiseptics chase has laid out on the 
sink saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide she gently 
cleanses the gashes on his arms

theres nothing overtly sexual in her actions but the gentleness 
of her touch doesnt go unnoticed by chase

				marjorie
		i hope he doesnt have rabies

				chase
		he doesnt i dont know what he
		has but im hoping to god its
		not infectious

chase stops and looks at marjories reflection in the mirror

				chase
		marjorie what do you know about
		the creed murders

marjorie stiffens for a moment obviously the creeds are a sore 
spot for the people in this town

				marjorie
		did you ever play that game where
		you pass a story down a row of
		people and see how screwed up it
		gets by the time its done
		people say louis creeds son came
		back from the dead and it drove
		him crazy
			she rolls her eyes
		he killed his wife and himself
		and thats the end of story
		anything else belongs in the
		national enquirer

marjorie tapes the bandage over chases shoulder too tight 
chases groan snaps her back to the reality at hand

				marjorie
		sorry now tell me what that has
		to do with zowie

chase closes his eyes shutting out the pain

				chase
		i wish i knew

int  library  day

chase approaches the counter looking to the elderly librarian for 
assistance

				librarian
		what are you looking for hon

				chase
		do you have anything on the creed
		murders i cant find the 
		microfilm from that period

the librarians smile vanishes she lowers her voice focusing her 
attention on some paperwork

				librarian
		we dont keep anything on file
		from that far back

				chase
		but youve got files from the
		previous years

				librarian
		we have nothing on the creed
		murders sir can i get you
		something else

chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on 
him townspeople withholding a dark secret

chase slowly backs away eager to escape the field of hostile

of a motorcycle

in geoffs direction

seeing him drew brakes and pulls his bike into a uturn pumping 
furiously to catch up with geoff

on geoff 

now geoff hears the whine of clydes motorcycle he glances 
back

clydes spotted him revving the engine

geoff pedals like mad but its no use clyde is closing in on

laughing clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of geoffs handlebar 
he jerks it sideways

				clyde
		oops

geoffs front wheel turns perpendicular the bike pitches forward 
throwing geoff into the dirt ahead

clyde broadies his bike to a stop with the engine idling he hops 
off

before geoff can get to his feet clyde has picked up geoffs bike 
and planted it upside down in the dirt

				clyde
		guess your dads not here to save
		you now is he

clyde gets a handful of geoffs collar and drags him over toward 
the bike with his free hand clyde cranks the pedal

the back wheel spins faster and faster

				clyde
		you ever seen a tire take off a
		nose

through the blur of the spokes we see geoff eyes widening 
fearfully

				clyde
		neither have i

clyde forces geoffs face toward the spinning tread

				clyde
		might even kill ya wheel might
		chew right into your brains you
		could visit your mom

geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage 
but his arms dont reach beyond the spinning wheel

clyde is full of deranged glee fueled by geoffs fear

but now a hand grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of 
clydes neck and yanks him off of geoff

clyde reels finding

gus standing there behind him he looks bad real bad his 
bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping his 
face is unearthly pale hes deteriorated considerably since 
yesterday

				clyde
			startled
		jesus christ gus

gus levels a threatening gaze at geoff

				gus
		go home

but geoff remains frozen gus fixes him with a stare that could 
turn flesh to stone

				gus
		i said go home

geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over he gets a running 
start making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back

on the knoll nearby

drew stops short of the ravine watching from afar as gus steps 
toward clyde

below 

clyde throws up his hands hes frightened but he tries to muster 
up a cocky front

				clyde

			nervous laughter
		whatre you gonna do give me a
		ticket i mean shit gus

clyde grows increasingly wary of gus evil stare gus steps 
closer

				clyde
		you cant lay a finger on me

wrong gus lashes out backhanding clyde across the face

clyde falls to the ground flat on his back with his nose gushing 
blood terrified

gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle with one hand 
under the back of the seat and the other working the accelerator 
handlebar gus advances toward clyde

gus kicks the bike into gear and revs the accelerator

the rear wheel spins on the pavement it would be moving forty 
miles an hour

clyde cant believe his eyes pleading

				clyde
		gus what are you doing

				gus
		im just fucking with you

gus plants his foot against clydes chest pinning him and lowers 
the spinning rear wheel toward clydes neck the wheel whines like 
a circular saw

gus lowers the wheel then jerks it away flashing a sadistic 
smile

just when clyde thinks gus is backing off the wheel comes down 
again

				clyde
			wailing
		stop it man stop it

gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning 
wheel at the terrified bully

but this time as the wheel comes down

clydes wool scarf defying gravity gets swept up swallowed into 
the gears

and along with the scarf here comes clydes screaming face we 
can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows

blood sprays up over gus arms and chest and then we hear the 
sound of crunching bones jamming the motorcycles gears

his grip

				gus
		you got a permit for that

opening the chamber gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses 
the gun aside

				gus
		didnt think so

gus fires up the drill the bit spinzzzzzz he dives at chase 
knocking him back against the counter the drill bit sinks into 
chases arm

chase screams as gus withdraws it now he presses it into chases 
shoulder chase is on the verge of blacking out now the pain is 
unbearable

gus withdraws the drill once again aiming now for chases eye

				gus
			maniacal
		no brain no pain chase think
		about it

the whirling drill bit is millimeters away from chases eye he 
clutches gus arm trying to force the drill aside

at the last second adrenaline kicks in and chase diverts the 
drill it sinks into the countertop nearby stuck

gus roars lashing out but chase manages to duck away

chase catches sight of his gun on the floor he scrambles for it 
scooping it up

bullets are rolling across the floor every which way chase slaps 
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber

gus hands clamp down around chases neck he swings chase around 
and slams him against the wall lifting him off his feet

chase gasps as the life is literally crushed out of him

he brings the gun up beneath gus chin and jams it into his ruined 
throat gus just keeps on throttling him

				gus
			insane
		just remember chase i had renee
		first and now im gonna have her
		last

blam the top of gus head blows off his body is thrown back by 
the incredible force tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a 
heavy thud

chase sucks in precious air then his head snaps up

				chase
		geoff

ext  gus house  night

chase stumbles from the house its a wonder hes even conscious 
he swings open the van door and throws himself inside sinking the 
key into the ignition

int  attic  night

marjorie is now seated before renees theatrical makeup mirror 
entranced shes wearing the beaded peach dress

with the help of renees vast array of cosmetics marjorie has 
turned herself into a stunning beauty

the lipstick isnt quite right turning to the countertop 
magnifying mirror she carefully touches up her ruby red lips her 
face fills nearly the entire mirror

except for one rim which reflects the dark shadowy attic 
behind her

a huge eye joins her reflection in the distorting mirror marjorie 
nearly jumps out of her skin she spins around

				marjorie
		jesus geoff dont sneak up on
		me like that

but no one is there

the makeup mirror catches another glimpse renees red lips 
magnified tenfold the lips begin to move

				renee
			a whisper
		did you really think you could be
		like me

renees fist swings in smashing a panel of the mirror

marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying 
glass and as her hands come down she finds

renee standing before her her ghostly form silhouetted by 
moonlight curtains billowing around her we never fully see her

marjories face goes white with fear

				renee
		such a young face but youve got
		potential

renee grabs a fistful of marjories hair viciously yanking her 
head back

				renee
		well do the eyes first you
		always start with the eyes

renee lashes out slashing a mirror shard across the skin beneath 
marjories right eye marjorie screams

int  geoffs room  night

geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs he rocks forward rising 
from his bed

185   omitted

int  hallway  night

geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway looking up at the 
open door all he hears are the faint sounds of movement

				geoff
		marjorie you know youre not
		supposed to be in the attic

geoff starts up the stairs

int  attic  night

geoff trepidatiously enters he weaves through the maze of gauzy 
curtains and then he sees her

renee is standing in the midst of the attic shes perfectly made 
up gorgeous just as she was on the day she died she smiles 
warmly

				geoff
		mom

				renee
		i came back for you geoff were
		going to be together again

renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him through the 
haze of his tears geoff doesnt see the sinister vacant gleam in 
her eyes

int  chases van  night

reaching the house chase skids to a stop across the lawn

188b  omitted

int  attic  night

chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp the spring coil 
swings the creaking door shut behind him

from chases vantage point he cant see them yet he makes his 
way around the stripped dressmakers model past an upright 
dressing mirror and then he sees

marjorie

slumped against renees bed like a ragdoll we can only see half 
of her face it looks untouched chase reaches for her

				chase
		marjorie

marjories head rolls sideways exposing the other half of her 
face the skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back

chase turns his head away and thats when he sees them

renee and geoff

holding each other tightly geoff has his head buried in renees 
breast renee looks up from her son meeting chases gaze her 
voice is both seductive and terrifying

				renee
		hello chase

chase gasps the word horror doesnt do the moment justice

				chase
		oh my god

				renee
		we can try again chase we can
		make it work this time

chase sinks back against the wall hes lost a lot of blood and 
his strength is leaving him

				chase
			shaking his head
		no

				renee
		dont you love me anymore chase

				chase
		youre not renee renees dead
			screaming
		geoff get over here now

but geoff just holds his mother tighter a hint of annoyance 
flickers through renees eyes she strokes geoffs hair

				renee
			looking at chase
		geoff honey why dont you go
		downstairs your father and i
		need a moment alone do it for
		me

geoff looks up at his mother mesmerized she releases him from 
the embrace he brushes past chase without a glance and heads for 
the attic door

				renee
		geoff

geoff pauses at the door looking back renees words have a 
hauntingly familiar ring

				renee
		i love you

geoff smiles turning away he opens the door and

clyde

is standing there an axe perched on his shoulder his face is 
torn to shit bones and brain matter exposed hes covered from 
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood he looks worse than any of 
the undead weve seen a total walking nightmare

				clyde
			grinning
		hey junior wanna play

whoosh clyde swings the axe sinking it into the wall just in 
front of geoffs face

geoff tumbles back onto the floor snapping out of his trance

clyde brings the axe down

and geoff rolls to the side barely avoiding decapitation

				chase
		geoff

chase stumbles forward to rescue his son as he does so clyde 
brings the axe back up smashing chase in the head with the blunt 
end

chase goes down unconscious

				clyde
		oops looks like daddy got a boo
		boo

clyde turns his gaze back on geoff

				clyde
		now where were we

geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as clyde moves into the 
room

renee passes behind clyde she slams the attic door shut and snaps 
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist locking them all inside

scared out of his wits geoff makes it to his feet clyde swings 
again and misses

geoff grabs hold of the axe handle struggling and the two boys 
go down

renee

moves to the vanity she sweeps a hand across it sending 
everything crashing to the ground crystal perfume bottles 
shatter spilling their contents over the floor

renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on she touches the 
flame to the perfumesoaked floor

flames roar into existence racing across the floorboards 
igniting the curtains

we see the flames reflected in renees soulless eyes

on geoff and clyde

as they wrestle with one another across the floor bloody spittle 
drips from clydes face he flashes a feral snarl

clyde lunges forward and tears into geoffs shoulder with his 
teeth

geoff screams his hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a 
mirror shard he jabs it up and into clydes eye

somehow geoff manages to roll out from under clyde he rises to 
his feet

clyde lets loose a demonic roar he charges slashing the axe 
wildly knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike 
nothings going to stop him nothing

flames are consuming the attic licking the rafters igniting the 
canopy drapings devouring everything smoke is rolling across 
the floor

geoff reaches a far wall hes trapped in a corner theres 
nowhere else to go behind geoff is a circuit box insulated 
cables run from the box down through the attic floor geoff 
turns

and here comes clyde

				clyde
		here it comes buddy here it
		fucking comes

clyde swings geoff ducks the axe hits the circuit box behind 
him severing the insulated cables

as clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try geoff 
reaches for one of the sparking cables

clyde raises the axe above his head

				clyde
		eat it asshole

				geoff
		eat this

and geoff shoves the live cable into clydes mouth

sparks shoot out of clydes eyes and ears he jerks back and 
forth writhing in a horrific replay of renees electrocution

then clydes face blows apart in a gout of ruined flesh and blue 
flame the circuit is blown and the smoking body falls

geoff drops the cable the blazing inferno is closing in he runs 
to chase

chase is barely conscious geoff drops to his knees and pulls his 
father to his feet

				renee os
		dont leave me again geoff

geoff turns

renee

is standing in the midst of the flames reaching out the makeup 
and morticians wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her 
face begins to melt away

				renee
		dont leave me alone

geoff turns away horrified with chase on his shoulder he 
reaches the door locked geoff sets chase against the wall

he spots the axe still clutched in clydes hand geoff drags the 
axe free from the dead boys grasp and goes to work on the door

ignoring renees cries geoff swings the axe again and again 
chopping the door apart he coughs through the smoke the flames 
are almost upon them

finally the wood splinters apart geoff reaches through and 
grasps the outside handle pulling the door open then he turns 
and lifts chase up once more

at the door geoff pauses for one final tearful look back then 
his face hardens and he turns away pulling chase to safety

				renee
		no geoff no

on renee

alone in the fiery storm screaming flames devour her flowing 
white dress her face doesnt even look remotely human anymore

and as the inferno slowly closes in we

								dissolve to

ext  veterinary office  day

we pull out from a sign on the door that says closed

chase is just now locking up the door hes bandaged up looking a 
little worse for the wear but happy to be alive he turns 
grinning

geoff

stands near the van holding tiger in his arms

				geoff
		all set

				chase
		all set

chase joins geoff at the van and together they climb inside chase 
starts the engine pulling away from the office

we stay on the van 

as it moves off down the street passing the familiar landmarks of 
sleepy ludlow

rising up 

we follow the van as it sweeps out of town ludlow looks picture
perfect from our birds eye vantage point charming and quiet

				chase vo
		so wherere we going

				geoff
		anywhere but here

we continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky losing the van 
amidst the rolling maine countryside and we

								dissolve to

ext  micmac forest  day

rushing over the woods just above the tree tops its an ocean of 
swaying green beneath us a forest as ancient and mysterious as 
anything on the earth

and suddenly 

the endless trees fall out from under us we find ourselves above 
the flattop mesa of the micmac burial ground swooping downward

the ground surges towards us we see renees open grave

the quality of light is different now we hear the wail of the 
lonesome wind and perhaps the whisper of something altogether 
alien

and on the unsettling note we

								fade to black


the end
