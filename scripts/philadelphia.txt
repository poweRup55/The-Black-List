                    my client is being forced to
                    breathe known carcinogens daily
                    other residents are coming forth
                    on a daily basis to add their
                    voices of outrage

                              andrew
                    your honor i submit there were
                    no complaints until counselor
                    began knocking on doors
                    drumming up business and the
                    dust which counselor refers to
                    has appeared on only three
                    occasions each time it has
                    been examined and the results

                    i know what it means your
                    honor imagine how the children
                    in this neighborhood have been
                    made to feel the pounding of
                    construction ringing in their
                    ears as this skyscraper a
                    tribute to mankinds greed
                    grows daily casting an ominous
                    shadow over their lives filling
                    them with dread even as they are
                    surrounded in a black toxic
                    fog blocking out the sun while
                    poisoning their lungs and
                    counselor calls it harmless

his back turned momentarily to the judge andrew mouths to
jamey not bad but he whips around serious again

                              andrew
                    your honor counselor is
                    attempting to portray my client
                    as a hideous manifestation of
                    evil and corruption but
                    nothing could be further from
                    the truth rockwell has
                    generously contributed ten
                    thousand dollars to this
                    neighborhoods schools clinics
                    and youth centers granting a
                    restraining order on the
                    construction site will throw
                    hundreds of philadelphians out
                    of work and will lend
                    validation to this contemptible
                    and groundless nuisance suit
                    which speaks directly to the
                    kind of greed and treachery that
                    today is threatening the very
                    fabric of our society

judge tate looks skeptically at both lawyers

                    interests me yes sir

wheeler kenton and seidman proceed with the male ritual of
preparing cigars to be smoked snipping the ends with a brass
clip rolling them over their tongues to wet them sliding the
cigars in and out of their rounded mouths

andrew holding a cigar but not preparing to light it watches
with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye

wheeler leans back in his chair swirling a brandy snifter
he exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure

                    its an antitrust action

                    sell it kronos will get undersold
                    right out of business for me the
                    legal principle involved is
                    copyright infringement

                              wheeler
                    bearing in mind that bill

                    copyright and antitrust were
                    enacted to prevent exactly the

                    due respect this is
                    preposterous it doesnt make
                    any sense it sounds as if were
                    talking about someone else
                    pardon the lack of humility but
                    ive had the distinct impression
                    i was kind of one of the
                    rising stars around here and i
                    feel that wasnt just my
                    imagination and i also think i
                    deserve to know whats really
                    going on here charles

                              kenton

                              wheeler
                    i hoped the challenge would
                    improve your performance you
                    could say it was a carrot

                              andrew

                    for gods sake that alone is
                    inexcusable it would have been
                    catastrophic for us put

                    theres no coming back from an

                    even kissing someone with aids is

the librarian turns away shrugging to a patron indicating
shes done all she can do

as joe continues to watch one of andrews neighbors picks
up his books and moves away

joe rises gliding down an aisle of books keeping one eye
on andrew who concentrates on his work

joe approaches nonchalantly as if he justhappensto be
sauntering by suddenly he notices andrew

                              joe

joe comes back

                    how did they find out

                              andrew
                         a second then
                    one of the partners spotted a
                    lesion on my forehead

nearby a chinese professor looks up startled when she
hears the word lesion

                              joe
                    uh huh

andrew concentrates on his work once more

                              joe cont
                    how do you get from one lawyer
                    spotting a lesion which could
                    have been a bruise to the
                    partners deducing you had aids
                    and basing a decision to
                    terminate you on that
                    conclusion

the chinese professor moves away

                              andrew
                    good point

andrew removes a legal pad with kenton written in big
letters across the top and lots of notes underneath

                              andrew cont
                    the partner who spotted the
                    lesion walter kenton used to
                    work for benton myers in dc
                    theres a paralegal there maria
                    torres shes had lesions on
                    and off for three years she
                    says it was common knowledge
                    around the office that her
                    lesions were caused by aids

                              joe
                    they didnt fire her

                              andrew
                    no they didnt fire her

                    whistle on you suddenly youre

                    slightly above child pornographers

                    fail to settle the smallest
                    difference among ourselves with
                    mutual respect if we continue to

                    fall lower on that list and when
                    people lose respect for lawyers
                    they lose respect for the law and
                    when this society loses all respect
                    for the law well be murdered in

                    a cheeseburger may be satisfying

                    that said
                    live still i am life

                    i am the god that descends
                    from the heavens to the earth

                    think the thing i love the most

                    not that often but
                    occasionally you get to be
                    part of justice being done
                    its really quite a thrill when
                    that happens

                              belinda
                    why did you recruit andrew beckett
                    to your firm

andrew uses all his strength to concentrate

charles wheeler speaks with great sincerity

                              wheeler
                    if youre the owner of a major
                    league ball club you recruit the
                    hot rookie and andy was tremendously
                    promising as a young attorney
                    thats why we went after him
                    thats why we hired him and
                    thats why we stuck with him
                    year after year waiting for
                    the promise to be fulfilled but
                    it never was

                              belinda
                    you kept giving him another chance

                              wheeler
                    of course we did when youve
                    groomed someone they way we groomed
                    andy nurturing him lavishing all
                    kinds of special treatment on him
                    youve made quite an investment
                    we were waiting for his promise to
                    kick in and deliver but
                    ultimately we could no longer
                    ignore the gap between the promise
                    and the reality this is one of
                    the saddest times in my life to
                    sit in this court testifying to
                    andys ultimate failure to make
                    the grade to discover that he is
                    one of those people who wants to
                    benefit by the system but doesnt
                    want to play by the systems
                    rules to think youknowsomeone
                    only to find out you dont know
                    them at all its heartbreaking

                              belinda
                    thank you thats all for now

                    society you have to make
                    certain sacrifices

wheeler keeps speaking

parts of his body

as joe comes into the room jill rises to take the shopping bags
from him joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others

people keep their voices low but theres a certain energy and
happiness evident in the room

on andrew watching his friends and relatives with sparkling
eyes and a weak but grateful and peaceful smile

on joe glancing across the room catching andrews look

andrew smiles at joe and pats his hospital bed indicating he
wants joe to sit there

exterior andrew and miguels loft building day

a taxi arrives and an elegant welldressed older couple
step out

                                                  cut to

rachel opens the door of the loft finding miguels family
on the other side very dignified handsome people who have
just arrived from spain they enter the apartment where

a wake is in progress lots of food people sharing stories
about andrew some people laughing one or two softly crying
as they hug each other

someone has set up a memento table with pictures of andrew
at various stages of his life and things that meant something
to him like programs from the opera a ballcap photos of his
favorite cat etc

theme music plays but we hear bits of dialogue under the
music youre miguels parents do you remember when
andy i went to college with andy etc

bud beckett sits alone very quiet

miguel leads his parents over to bud bud looks up rises
extending his hand to miguels dad miguels father shakes his
head in sadness reaches for bud and pulls him into his arms for
an embrace

camera moves through the crowd seeming to search for
something

camera zeros in on the tv set across the room where black and
white images are flickering ignored by everyone

as camera gets closer to the tv it becomes apparent that the
images are black and white home movies converted to video

the home movies feature a brighteyed little boy

andrew

riding a bike with training wheels

swinging wildly at a wiffle ball

as camera tracks into the tv party sounds and theme music
fades people are still talking still laughing still
crying but we cant hear them any longer instead

we hear only the soundtrack from the home movies

andrew shouting gleefully as he chases a new puppy

andrew squealing as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool

andrew on a swing going higher and higher

and laughing

fade to black

roll end credits



may we never find space so vast 
planets so cold heart 
and mind so empty 
that we cannot fill them 
with love and warmth
