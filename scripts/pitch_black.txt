     note the hard copy of this script contained scene numbers
     and some omitted slugs they have been removed for this
     soft copy

     note also the hard copy of this script was in the non
     preformat font times new roman this has been changed
     to preformatted text for this soft copy









though mentioned often in the script the creatures in pitch black are 
seldom seen at length rather they are glimpsed they are heard they are 
felt they are really the embodiment of your nocturnal fears a howling 
coyote that jars you awake the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too longthe sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits chimera of the night the point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters 
for pitch black is at its heart a story of humanity and courage  and 
lack of the same

     next forward locker its riddled with holes one dead crewie

     ext ship  planets atmosphere  day

     the ship plows through the upper atmosphere antennae pylons
     already disintegrating


     int passage to flight deck

     heart battering her ribs fry runs forward using handholds to
     steady herself over a headset

                              owens vo
               they trained you for this right fry
               fry

     she doesnt answer


     int flight deck  day

     fry harnesses in starts running switches  but fumbles a few
     times making mental errors finally she gets crashshutters
     open to reveal

     cloud strata sweeping up past the windscreen like floorlights
     on a dropping elevator were sheddingbigaltitude


     int navbay  main cabin

                              owens
                crisis program selected number two of
               this system because it shows at leastsomeoxygen and more than 1500  would you
               shut the fuck up

               at surfacelevel okay so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change


     int flight deck  day

     as fry runs more switches


     int ship  day

     as jettison doors close around the ship


     int flight deck  day

     as fry flips up a securitylatch  and thumbs the switch below


     ext ship  planets atmosphere  day

     multiple shots explosive bolts rapidfire around the ships
     skin blowing away nonessentials that hinder aerodynamics 
     including big deepspace drives but this last separation puts
     the ship into a dangerous roll


     int flight deck  day

     out the windscreen cloud strata roll vertiginously fry throws
     actuators


     ext ship  planets atmosphere  day

     and airbrakes deploy she manages to kill the roll but the
     ships still coming in nosehigh

     passenger compartment it scares him for anewreason

                              owens
               fry whatre you doing


     int flight deck  day

     fry flips up a new securitylatch intercutting

                              owens
               fry

                              fry

               back there

                              owens
               you mean that load of passengers

                              fry
               so what we should both go down too
               out of sheer fucking nobility

     tortured silence frys thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin jettison 50 people


     int main cabin

     selected shots of faces inside cryolockers among them johns
     hes primeoflife badge on display some kind of cop shaken
     awake he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
     from his finding

     riddick small black goggles hide his eyes a metal bit wedged
     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace a readout admonishes
     lockout protocol in effect absolutely no early
     release


     int flight deck  day

                              owens
               look fry company says were responsible
               for every one of those

               companys not here is it

                              owens
               when captain went down you stepped up 
               whether you like it or not now they
               train you for this so 

                              fry
               and there wasnt a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash sitethatshow they train you
               on a fucking simulator

     owens unbuckles from his chair

                              owens
               dont touch that switch

     overcome by guilt fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction
     but a huge jolt puts the thumb right back

                              fry
               im not dying for themshe pushes it but this time


     ext ship  planets atmosphere  day

     no bolts fire nothing separates from the ship that screams down
     through the clouds


     int navbay  main cabin

     now we see why owens reopened the jettison doors locally  andblockedthem open

                              fry
               owens

                              owens

               level this beast out


     int flight deck  day

     seething anger and guilt fry pops more airbrakes shedding more
     speed more heat the shipdoeslevel  but its still being
     pounded hellishly she tries to get a stable view out

     just a glimpse of landscape before

               what the shit was that

     sunlight flares from every fractured edge its like looking
     into burning diamonds and fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world now she has to rely on

     a groundmapping display 120 meters altitude and dropping


     int cryolocker  day

     intercut johns realizing hes in some kind of shitstorm he
     claws at safety restraints


     int flight deck  day

     riddicks cryolocker empty johns reaches for his holster
     gone torn right off his belt no prisoner and no weapon

     getting the chain on his necktwisting hard using the chain as
     a chokecollar johns flicks open a baton swings it up at

     riddick still in body chains and mouthbit clinging to a
     ceiling support riding out the baton blows

     seconds from blacking out johns strains forwardforwardand
     finally breaks riddicks grip on the support he keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that

     riddick slams headfirst into the deck johns lays the baton on
     his neck

                              johns
               one chance and you blew it riddick

     int flight deck  crash ship  day

     darkness a light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit
     its packed with dirt no signs of life about to search
     elsewhere johns turns back at

               hey me over here

     his light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt johns
     crawls closer checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her fry buried to the gills

     int main cabin  crash ship  day

     johns helps fry through the carnage shes stunned by it all 
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be

     realizing shes in navbay fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover

     owens still strapped to his chair metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart dead fry reaches out to touch him

               thought theyd be safe inside but
                         looks down shaft
               someone forget to lock the back door

     shazza joins him at the shaft gazing on the human remains

                              shazza
               so thats what come of me zeke an you
               saw it you was right there

               just wanted his o2
                         a beat
               though i notice he tried to ghost my ass
               when he shot up that stranger instead

     shazza cant deny it she looks at him differently now the man
     she once beat while in chains she takes off her breather

                              shazza
               take it

     ext spired hills  dusk

     the spires the sound seems to come from there


     ext sky  dusk

     as the rings eclipse the red sun


     ext crash ship  deep dusk

     a second darkness sweeps over the survivors now they all stop
     beholding


     ext spired hills  deep dusk

     something pouring from the spiretops backlit by coronal light
     it first seems to be smoke or ash  but soon we realize these
     are living things hatchlings squealing in delight over their
     first nightfall


     ext crash ship  deep dusk

                              johns
               jesus how many can there

     they keep coming filling the sky with thick waves mercifully
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away but now one wave cleaves
     from another  and does a quick aboutface

                              paris
               just a suggestion but perhaps we should
               flee

                              fry
               cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold
               lesgo lesgo lesgo

     they run reach the cargo hold turn back to see

     riddick and shazza still coming hearing the squealing wave
     descending on them

     riddick and shazza hit to the dirt hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead

     close on shazza horrified hard to breathe like being
     underwater

     close on riddick he watches in awe no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars experimenting he
     eases a boneshiv into the hatchlings instantly its whittled
     down to nothingits like a river of razor blades

     the hatchling keep coming shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold can she make it should she even try

                              audrey
               tell her to stay there stay down
               shazza just stay down

     shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold suddenly the
     hatchings vanish a beat is it safe shazza gets to her
     feet

                              fry
               no no no no no

     and the wave is back enveloping shazza


     intext cargo hold  deep dusk

     standing in the mouth of the cargo container the others get a
     last glimpse of shazza as she flies by the doors caught up in
     the funnelcloud of hatchlings then shes simply gone


     ext crash ship  deep dusk

     still on the ground riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street now he gets up smacks his hands
     clean strolls for the hold behind him

     a rising gangclicking

     close on fry she knows the sound better than anyone


     ext spired hills  deep dusk

     the spires are crumbling torn down from within


     ext crash ship  deep dusk

     reaching the cargo hold riddick turns around for one last look
     push in as he sheds goggles  and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes

     riddicks pov in degraded image we see the predators  adult
     hatchlings  emerge from the spires theyre large mammalian
     hammerheaded they click with echolocation sounding out the
     world they havent inhabited in 60 years

     int cargo hold  night

     vaultlike doors boom closed

     the survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship
     somehow theyve been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave listening to the howls of the sabertooths

                              audrey
               what ifwhat if shes still out there

                              imam
               perhaps the way they see with sound
               reflecting back

                              fry

     the underside of riddicks chin

                              riddick

                         to audrey
               theyre afraid of our light that means

                              imam
               and youre certain you can find the way
               back even in the dark

     worst sounds fall behind we can see it in their sweatsheened
     faces the faintest hope that maybe theyve survived the seventh
     circle of hell but then

     the torches spit and sputter

     audrey hears pattering on the metal shield

     blood falls anewone torch dies yet somehow comes back to life

     imam upturns a hand checking the liquid for color but this
     blood has no hue
