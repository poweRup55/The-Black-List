planet of the apes

fade in
1	ext starfield  night
a sprinkling of stars against the black backdrop of endless space we tilt down  down through nothingness and more nothingness until 

blazing colors  reds blues sizzling whites  explode across the sky  a second burst erupts  then a third  and we continue to tilt down until a familiar sight dominates the screen

2	the statue of liberty
were not in outer space after all  just new york city another round of fireworks lights up the sky and off in the distance we hear cheering super title 4 july 1998

3	ext times souare  night
packed streets the whole city seems to have turned out for the show drunken revelers tourists hookers and hustlers cops on horseback  greeting each new pyrotechnic display with whoops of giddy hilarity

4	ext brooklyn heights  the promenade  night
manhattan just across the harbor lady liberty to the south young couples in love families with kids  theyre all lined up six deep at the promenade railing clapping and cheering

5	ext rooftop  spanish harlem  night
a dozen or so teenage kids up on the roof necking smoking drinking beers playing loud music  all grinning at the fireworks one of them looks upward at the sound of a faroff whistling   suddenly his face is bathed in red light a screaming comes across the sky a fireball streaks down from above      and it stems to be coming directly toward him with a yelp of fear he dives to the tarandgravel surface of the roof the other kids turn see whats coming and join him there

2

6	ext promenade  that moment
panic in the crowd as they see the fireball approaching it looks as though its going to slam smack into manhattan

7	ext times souare  that moment
chaos pandemonium times square turns the color of molten lava as the fireball streaks past overhead so close it almost seems you could reach up and touch it the cheers have given way to hysteria 

8	ext promenade  that moment
all spectators have now abandoned the promenade the skys ablaze with light its high noon  at midnight

the fireball slices downward from the clouds clearing the battery 
nearly shaving the top story off the world trade center it slaps into the 
harbor with the percussive force of an exploding bomb

9	ext rooftop  night
the kids on the roof slackjawed at the light show a beat  then they begin whooping and applauding wildly

10	ext new york harbor  night
a vast redhot cloud of scalding steam rising from the water    and spreading across the night sky until the cityscape of manhattan is completely obscured behind it  fade through to

11	ext new york harbor  day
the harbor is congested with ships coast guard cutters two oceanographic research vessels a container ship half again the size of the exxon valdez and a floating crane military helicop ters are circling lazily above it all

the decks of the various vessels are swarming with people  not just crewmen but military observers government bureaucrats civilians  and all eyes are on the crane as the chain begins to rise

a charred black mass breaks the surface of the water

3
its no meteorite its a machine  of inexplicably baroque design with ornate curlicues filigree nodules and modules protruding in all directions it looks not unlike a pair of sherman tanks joined together siamesetwin style at the cannon turrets or a flying rorschach blot 

12	ext fishing boat  that moment  day
the disgruntled captain of a ramshackle fishing boat is watching the action with binoculars his crew cant set sail while the harbors blocked and theyve already lost half a days catch

captain
thats a weather satellite 

one skeptical crewman is reading the post the pageone banner headline screams weather satellite nearly flattens manhattan

fisherman 1
they dont close off the whole harbor for no damn weather satellite 

13	ext harbor  on floating crane
the crane hoists its cargo high into the air and pivots  swinging the strange alien craft into position over the deck of the container ship 

14	int hold  container skip  that moment
technicians in airtight safe suits are preparing a great plasticene shroud once the craft has been lowered into the ship the shroud will be sealed around it forming a sterile tent no one knows what theyll find inside the craft  but they dont want it getting out prematurely

15	ext deck  container ship  that moment
a twelvefoot wall of scaffolding has been erected around the hold of the ship more scientific gear is mounted on it an xray machine an ultrasound unit a heatsensing device coast guardsmen clamber up the scaffolding like monkeys helping the crane operator guide the craft into the hold

technicians stare at their various monitors and telemetric readouts the ultrasound operator shouts into the hold   

4
ultrasound man
its hollow its hollow jesus     theres something moving in there 

a thermal printer spits out a hard copy of the ultrasound screen a  fuzzy manlike silhouete is plainly visible within the craft

ultrasound man
oh man herb  this looks like a  

an explosion interrupts him

a hatch has blown open just beneath the left wing  and now dangling from its chain the whole craft begins to rotate whatevers inside is about to come out

several guardsmen dive from the scaffolding to the deck others are too scared to move

and a couple reach instinctively for their sidearms   

voices from hold os
dont shoot dont shoot 

16	int craft  that moment
a pov shot from within the craft  looking through the open hatch at the frenzy outside as the craft turns a guardsman comes into view  clinging to the scaffolding wideeyed with horror

in the foreground a whitegloved hand rises suddenly into frame    and an inhuman voice croaks out something that sounds like 

voice
plleeeeeeeezzz    

guardsman i
jesus 

whatever he sees drives him into a frenzy he starts shooting

17	ext deck  outside the craft  on guardsmen
a blur of motion the passenger of the craft bleeding pitches forward through the open hatch and hangs there half in half out a second guardsman lunges at the guy with the gun 

5
guardsman i
you idiot what are you  

they grapple the craft dangling in midair rotates around  and the open hatch door knocks both guardsman to the deck

screaming and confusion all around the crane operator swings the pod hard left trying to avoid any further injuries like a big wrecking ball the craft slams into the scaffolding causing it to collapse

the crane operator tries to hoist the pod away from the damage as it rises we zero in on the dead passenger dangling out of the open hatch a trickle of blood runs down the side of the craft   

   and pools on the deck    where it seethes and churns like a living tumorous organism   

   until a small quantity of bubbling pink organic slop arises from the puddle of blood and begins to crawl away across the deck

boots sprint past splattering the moist pink crawling goo into several discrete globules but the globules regroup as if driven by some primordial homing instinct into a single pulsating mass the undulating blob squirts out a tendril and drags itself across the deck  over the railing  into the harbor

18	ext fishing boat day
the captain lowers his binoculars and snorts in disgust

captain
your tax dollars at work  stow the goddam nets lets go home 

he takes a last bite of his sandwich chucks whats left overboard

a seagull spots breakfast and swoops toward the captains leftovers it snags a hunk of meat and lets out a startled squawk the bird flaps its wings furiously trying to take flight 

 but a long pink tendril pulls it downward the keening gull vanishes beneath the waves as we

cut to

19	int hospital  birthing center  day
an enormously pregnant woman is drinking from a water fountain in the hallway of a modern maternity ward super title 12 april 1999  nine months later

she lets out a little squeak a helpful nurse rushes to her side 

pregnant woman
i think i felt another contraction 

splattering noises on the tiles her waters broken she looks down lets out a little exclamation of embarrassment   

nurse
dont worry well take care of that the birthing room is all ready for you 

the pregnant woman glances down the hallway where the corridors intersect several doctors appear to be in a big hurry a guy in a suit uses a key to summon the freight elevator

the elevator opens  and the doctors push what looks like a chrome sarcophagus onboard its three feet long on a rolling cart with a refrigeration unit beneath it 

pregnant woman
what in the world is that 

nurse
oh its    its for preemies
swiftly turning her around
this way 

a scream echoes in the hospital corridors not the scream of a woman in labor  this ones a man

the pregnant woman glances back over her shoulder  just in time to see an hysterical father at the end of the corridor with orderlies and doctors swarming around trying to calm him dawn

nurse
this way please 

she steers the pregnant mom down the hall away from the commotion 

7
20	ext hospital rooftop
a helicopter touches down on the rooftop helipad and a group of specialists from the centers from disease control in atlanta debark 

they carry themselves with the natural authority of young hotshots  the best and brightest in their field

leader of the pack is dr susan landis a handsome woman in her early thirties with a face full of quick ironic intelligence insatiable curiosity boundless good humor when shes on the job though she takes on a crisp nononsense almost military demeanor  and just now she is well and truly on the job she hits the tarmac moving   

drengel
susan thanks for coming so quickly  

dr engel is 64 heavyset distinguishedlooking hes at the head of a phalanx of doctors and hospital administrators she gives him a warm smile as the two groups head en masse for the rooftop elevator

susan
for you black plague couldnt keep me away  whats the latest holding at five 

engel
it was five yesterday susan today its 
grimly
ill let you see for yourself 

21	int hospital  observation room  day
the whole gangs scrubbed down and changed into surgical gear theyre
looking through a glass window into a maternity ward lined with cribs
the room is sealed  and the obstetric nurses are wearing safe suits
engel
now get ready for this i dont think any of
you have ever seen anything like it    
engel gestures to a nurse on the other side of the glass she gingerly
lifts an infant from its crib    pulls the swaddling back from its face   

several of the cdc hotshots jump back in shock the newborn infant is
leathery wrinkled with liver spots and rotting yellow teeth it weighs
nine pounds it looks like an eightyyearold man

8
susan
ive seen it hutchinsongilford    
cdc hotshot
neonatal progeria right accelerated aging in
the womb 
susan
kids are usually dead by the time theyre ten 
engel
no susan no if it was hutchinsongilford i
wouldnt have called you up from atlanta
gesturing to the nurse
weve got three neonates here all born today
this one was 3 pm  just over an hour ago 
the nurse leans over a crib unwraps a baby it has a full head of oily
hair  the acnecovered face of an adolescent
engel
this one was noon 
same routine baby 2 looks like a sallow balding middleaged man
engel
and this one was 745 am    
before the nurse can pull back the blankets a tiny clawlike hand
shoots out from the third crib  waving with knobby arthritic fingers

susan stares compassionately at the ancient wizened infant she
knows its pointless but she cant stop herself from waving back
engel
when theyre born they look normal within
twelve hours    theyre dead of old age 
the cdc crew are already buzzing among themselves
susan
 youve had five of these 
engel
i told you susan it was five yesterday 
engel raps on another observation window  this one curtained off

9
inside a nurse draws the curtain back allowing susan to see   

   an entire roomful of afflicted babies thirty or forty of
them in various stages of disintegration

all heads turn at a new round of shrieks and wailing from
anguished parents in the hallway the cdc crew falls deadly silent 
ashenfaced its as if theyve just seen the end of the human race
engel
we havent had a normal birth today 
22	int hospital  conference room
its been commandeered by the cdc high command who have taken
over every available phone jack to plug their laptops into the net there
are several open pizza boxes on the central table
engel
 and we dont know what to do with the
parents you heard what the maternity ward
is like its bedlam 
susan
forget about containing it itll be in all the
papers by morning 
a cdc worker albert rushes up to susan with a printout
albert
heres what weve got eight in chicago
eleven in pittsburgh four in our beloved home
town of atlanta    
susan
airline hubs 
albert
 and jersey is crawling with em 
susan
lets hope for a contact vector if its airborne
were kneedeep in shit creek 

10
engel
its incomprehensible hutchinsongilfords a
spontaneous mutation how could it be infectious 
susan
my guess is its not if you isolated the
mutagen you could reproduce it  transfect
the population by virus catch the virus and
the mutagen kicks in    
engel
but that would mean somebody had to  
susan
tailor it yeah the big question is when if
this stuffs had nine months to spread    
susan looks up at the sound of a choked sob from across the table in
the midst of all the frantic activity one of the cdc team a young woman
named donna has totally lost it she sits frozen over her laptop screen
face buried in both hands

susan goes over and lays a consoling hand on her shoulder
susan
take a break donna grab a catnap well
get by without you for an hour 
donna
no no im fine ill 
just that quickly her hands are racing over the keyboard again
susan
whoa thats no suggestion thats an order 
donna looks up at her holloweyed tears trickling down her cheeks
donna
susan im two months pregnant 
theres nothing susan can say stunned she sits down beside her
colleague the two of them embrace

11
23	int cdc  four months later  day
susan and albert at an electron microscope the grainy image from
the microscope appears on a large overhead monitor

theres a tiny tendriled pink organism floating among the red and
white corpuscles   
susan
thats our vector 
albert
whose blood are we looking at 
susan
yours it doesnt like you youre not going to
get pregnant its just loitering around with
nothing to do 
she nicks a switch the image on the monitor changes lots of little
pink critters occasionally shooting out pseudopods at passing corpuscles 
sometimes actually ingesting them
susan
this is me its interested no action yet but
definite possibilities and this    
flick  another new image pink blobs everywhere feasting
albert
jesus its an orgy 
she gives him a tight little cockeyed smile 
susan
six months pregnant work to do cells to
invade dna to ruin    
albert
what is it its not a virus exactly it  
susan
albert i dont have a bleeding clue what it is
theres nothing like it on the books all i
know is its awfully good at what it does 
she turns off the monitor they sit there in glum silence

12
albert
that last sample was that donna 
susan nods wearily
albert
shes still going to carry the baby to term 
susan
i guess shes hoping for a breakthrough i
guess shes counting on us to   
the odds against them are too enormous she cant even say the words
24	int television studio  night
a remote linkup site for abc nightline a camera crew bustles
around a bank of monitors on which we see live footage of a a smug
reverend b a state dept terrorjsm expert and c ted koppel
at his desk in foreground the other two composited behind him
reverend an monitor
the year 2000 is upon us ted were seeing
the fulfillment of biblical prophecy theres no
question the last days are at hand 
terrorism expert on monitor
its a simple failure of policy weve known for
years that the international terror network is
heavily invested in biological weapons  
the third guest is susan taping live right here in the linkup studio
and shes listened to this stuff long enough
susan
no no this is not something you can buy
from your neighborhood arms broker this is
generations beyond anything we can do  
terrorism expert
yet somebody did it  if it didnt come out of
our labs then  
reverend
all things are possible with god 

13
susan and the expert roll their eyes let out snorts of frustration
the reverend sits there smiling buddhalike in his serenity
koppel
reverend exactly what are you getting at 
reverend
as a nation ted weve denied the sanctity of
human life weve put our trust in scientists
like the young lady here instead of in god
and now with this horrible plague our own
sins are finally coming back to  
susan
oh come on reverend is it biblical prophecy
or is it my fault lets make up our minds 
terrorism expert
wed all love to hear your explanation 
susan on tv
its not divine retribution its not islamic
fundamentalists i know this sounds absurd
i know its ludicrous but its the only expla
nation that makes sense
long pause
this plague did not originate on earth weve
been invaded 
25	int susans apartment  later  night
she opens the door slams it shut behind her and lets out a gasp

the lights are on theres a strange man in her favorite reading chair
over by the wall of books hes fortyish jamaican perpetually bemused
hes smoking a pipe hes made himself very much at home
susan

dodge
dr landis 
he jumps to his feet shows her what hes been reading its a textbook
on viruses the author is susan herself

dodge

susan

wincing dodge looks past her into the hallway susan turns abruptly
 and finds herself staring at two feds in dark suits and shiny shoes
posted on the landing outside her apartment door
dodge
well thats just it dr landis its not exactly
what youd call an invitation
dodge points to the suitcases the feds barge in and grab one apiece
susan is too bewildered to protest

26 ext desert  air force base  day 
okay call it roswell  a topsecret underground facility hidden in the
new mexico desert the only signs of it on the surface are a series of
plane hangars carved out of a semicircular cliff wall

a military helicopter slices through the cloudless skies and
descends toward a vast mesa at the foot of the cliffs great horizontal
panels set into the door of the plateau slide back to admit it 27 t helicopterpav a usaf pilot up front in the rear are susan and dodge shes looking about in amazement as the helicopter descends past sentry towers and great swiveling antiaircraft guns mounted in the sheer cliff walls

16
dodge looks bored hes smoking his pipe paging through a sheaf of
computer printouts for him its just another commuter flight
28 rvt underground complex  day 
norad would be green with envy everywhere you turn theres a
research team working at a bank of fantastically expensive equipment
its the sort of place james bond villains hang out when theyre plotting
to overthrow the world

a glass elevator capsule disgorges susan and dodge
susan

you think you know where the plague originated 
dodge

ill let troy tell you about it 
to a technician

dino is troy up yet 
dino

youre just in time for his wakeup call 
susan
checking her watch

dr troy believes in getting his beauty sleep 
dodge chuckles enigmatically he leads susan to a nearby lab area 
where dino is rotating a glassandchrome sarcophagus seven 
feet long and refrigerated into an upright position

susan almost gasps as the lid pops open a hiss of frosty air 
comes gushing out   

dr alexander troy climbs slowly out of the cryounit and stretches
hes stiff and extremely cold hes also stark naked
troy

how long 
technician

36 hours how do you feel 
troy

frosty any dermal damage how do i look 

17
susan

you look smaller on tv 
troy looks up sees susan realizes hes at a social disadvantage
dino offers him a bathrobe he pulls it on hurriedly   
dodge

we can usually talk him into wearing pants  
susan landis alexander troy 
troy

dr landis your great admirer im glad you
could come on such short notice 
susan
snidely

i had lots of help 
troy

susan

troy

29 int laboratorv day 
susan at a microscope examining tissue and blood samples
susan

yeah thats it this tissues crawling with
the stuff 
at her side are troy dodge and another scientist in a lab coat 
weldon stewart thirtyish slightly pudgy on the nerdy side

18
stewart

the pink stuff the vector it appears to be
some kind of selfreplicating organic machine
   all it does is reproduce and  
susan

 and attack fetal dna have you figured out
the coding yet do you know how its programmed 
stewart shrugs helplessly susan swivels around on the lab stool
and fixes the three men with her steeliest gaze
susan

why dont we all just lay our cards on the
table boys i dont know where you got that
tissue sample im looking at    but i know
its not human 
dodge

we shouldve gone public a year ago    wed
be that much farther ahead    
susan

we thought we had it contained but there 
was blood loss  from the wound  
susan

stop it just tell me in english   
troy

susan theres someone wed like you to meet 
30 int observation room  day 
green light floods a sealed vacuum chamber  visible through a 
wall of unbreakable glass on the other side suspended from a 
tangle of wires hangs the frozen corpse    of an orangutan

in a spacesuit a bloodstained spacesuit with a neat round bullet 
hole in the abdominal area
troy

we picked him out of new york harbor
about fourteen months ago 

19
susan

whered he come from 
dodge

best guess right now is an earthlike planet 
orbiting alpha centauri 
troy

poor guy traveled almost five lightyears to 
earth  and a 19yearold coast guardsman 
shot him on sight 
susans gaze is riveted on the orang his eyes remain open even in
death he seems to be looking right at her  pleading
susan

so someone put a diseased lab animal in a 
spacecraft  and shot it to earth 
the men exchange a look    chuckle among themselves
stewart

thats what we thought at first 
troy

then dodge here started playing with the 
navigational computers 
dodge

the math was driving me crazy at first we 
count on our ten fingers  base ten well this 
baby was all programmed in base twenty 
susan

  fingers and toes 
grins all around the boys are warming up to susan they think alike
troy

that was no lab animal that was the pilot 
cut to
3l aerial pov shot  the crahd canyon  day 
a pov shot from the cockpit of a supersonic infinitely maneuverable 
aircraft rocketing through the grand canyon we swoop

20
dip arc right and left do a barrel roll  all at nauseating 
vertiginous speed barely avoiding the sheer rock walls on either side
technician os

okay im killing your left engine youre 
going into a tailspin 
pilot os

do it do it do it 
suddenly were screaming down toward the floor of the canyon
32 int flightsimulator lab  day 
were looking at a guy in a gyroscopic simulator he wears a 
virtualreality helmet which gives him the aeriallandscape view 
weve just seen as he works the joystick the harness hes strapped 
into pitches and yaws just as an aircraft would the simulator is 
capable of 360degree motion in all directions so hes being swung back 
wards forwards upside down its like being in a milkshake machine 

hes a hellraising hotshot of 26 and his name is cmdr david astor 
voices call out from the floor below the simulator
troy

astroboy 
dodge

hey astroboy 
astor shaves a sharp turn just a little too close he lets out a 
scream the gyroscopic harness jerks bucks jitters    and 
comes to a dead halt

astor pulls off his vr helmet cursing a blue streak
astor

goddammit troy you pinheaded needle
dicked sliderule sucking son of a mentally defective monkey you just made us crash on a alien goddam landscape 
troy

sorry theres someone i want you to meet 
astor unstraps himself climbs down from the gyro unit he takes one

21
look at susan and turns on the oily charm
troy

susan landis cmdr david astor our pilot 
astor

the gene queen my pleasure i thought you were coming in a couple of weeks ago 
susan

my invitation was lost in the mail 
astor

let me apologize for anything my colleagues may say or do they come from a distant isle where beautiful women are only a myth 
he bows formally kisses her hand  like an overthetop parody of eddie 
haskell
troy

astroboy was in the psychopathic ward
the only way he could get out was to 
volunteer for this mission 
susan

  what mission 
astor

they havent shown you yet follow me 
38 int hangar  day 
metal doors roll back blinding sunlight pours in inside the 
hangar a fortyman ground crew of mechanics is swarming 
around an utterly staggering sight

its a starship  the same one we saw dredged out of new york harbor 
its no longer a charred blackened mass its been restored to its full 
pristine butterflywinged glory technicians are even now buffing it 
to a high sheen it looks ready to lift off

the boys cant help themselves they break into big grins every time 
they see it and susan does likewise

22

susan
oh my god  does it fly 

troy
chuckling
cmon ill let you sit in the captains chair 

34 int spacecraft  day 
as they enter the interior is divided into a number of cramped compartment the bridge area has a large observation port  and beneath it an instrument console which duplicates the one in astors simulator

susan wanders around wideeyed shes actually standing inside 
an artifact from another world
troy

i was hoping to reverseengineer the drive  
learn to build one from scratch but the 
plague tightened up our schedule 
susan

you mean     
dodge

it was programmed for a roundtrip all along 
so as long as weve got our boarding pass    
astor

were gonna fly this sucker right back where it 
came from 
as she moves from the bridge toward the rear compartments of the ship 
she sees a row of five chromeandglass sarcophagi  just like the one 
we saw troy in
susan

cryogenic tanks so thats why you were 
relaxing in the deepfreeze    
troy

the trips going to take six years the ships 
not big enough for food and water so  
dodge

well need a good rest anyway 

23
the five sarcophagi are all labelled with the names of their future 
occupants susan traces along with one finger  until she gets to the fifth 
chrome coffin which bears no name
susan

troy stewart astor dodge    
pause smiling

one berth still open whos number five 
the others just stare at her it takes her a good three seconds to get the 
picture and off her shell shocked expression we
cut to
int int mexican restaurant  night 
a sixpiece mexican marimba band supplies the soundtrack a waiter 
brings a fresh pitcher of margaritas over to a table near the outdoor 
patio where we find troy dodge stewart and astor theres a 
fifth place setting  susans  but shes not in her chair

stewart potted is drawing minkowski diagrams on cocktail napkins 
hes explaining relativity to astor an unreceptive student
stewart

now we accelerate for a year  travel at max 
speed for four  and in the last year we 
decelerate of course due to relativistic time 
dilation six years for us will be thirtyfour on 
earth but if we send our findings back by 
radio there should still be a handful of fertile 
premenopausal women    
a gorgeous cocktail waitress slinks past astor eyes her and 
claps stewawt briskly on the shoulder   
astor

hold that thought stewart im gonna get us a fresh batch of cocktail napkins 
he jumps up dogging the waitresss heels troy meanwhile is 
anxiously scanning the restaurant
troy

what happened to susan 

24
dodge

ladies room i think  
troy

that was ten minutes ago 
the two of them exchange a nervous look troy heads outdoors
36 ext desert night 
shes wandered down from the outdoor patio into the desert shes out 
among the cacti wandering along a dry creek bed staring at the stars 
troy wanders up behind her
troy

   need a little air 
susan

im sorry i was just listening to all of you talk 
about the future  and i got this awful 
clammy sense that the future was all used up 
troy

children are the future take them away and 
you take away hope 
a weird pronouncement coming from troy she looks at him askance
susan

you have kids 
troy

no i did but    no 
she waits for a further explanation after a few seconds she realizes 
theres not going to be one troy has some sort of emotional wound 
that he doesnt want probed she respects his wishes
susan

whyd you pick on me troy there are others 
in my field that are at least as qualified more 
experienced    
troy

its not a flattering answer 

25
susan

im past caring about politesse 
troy

we had three candidates you were the best  
and you had the least to lose 
she looks at him as if hes slapped her in the face
troy

the others had families obligations ties   
reasons to stay behind 
susan

i had a calico cat once till it died 
troy

you have a sister in florida youve been 
engaged twice you broke it off both times 
you havent had a date in seven months  
susan

well christ ive been working havent i 
troy

 which puts you in exactly the same category 
as the rest of us weve all had our lives 
collapse around us we get on with it we do 
our work 
her mood softens a little
susan

i dont want the destiny of the race on my 
shoulders thats all 
shaking her head

they still line up outside the cdc pregnant 
women every day they know theres nothing 
we can do for them but they show up anyway 
 just wanting to see us or touch us or  
troy

susan if we stay here we die if we go there

she searches for the tiny twinkling pinprick of alpha centauri the camera 
tilts up  up  upward into the heavens    and we
dlssolve to

a brilliant starfield like the one we just left and in fact we might 
think were still back in the new mexico desert   

  except for the black spacecraft that appears out of nowhere and 
comes zooming right at us the camera whlp pans with it as it 
speeds beyond the ringed splendor of saturn vanishing into the icy dark

needless to say the second chronometer is ticking off the minutes at a 
visibly faster clip than the first

we move back through the ghostly silence of the ship past lab gear and 
radio telescopes to the passenger compartment  five frostedover

then a sudden grinding noise as gears come to life lights flick on
in the darkened craft oxygen hisses through ventilation grates   

troys cryounit expels a little cloud of condensatlon as the seal 
breaks the chrome  glass lid retracts and he floats out weightless 
he grabs an upright takes a deep breath and pulls himself down to the

critters in my time but this  
troy looks up astor is floating horizontially two feet overhead

asshole im even glad to see you 
astor lets out a texas whoop reveling in his own weightlessness 
he kicks off on a bulkhead launching himself toward the cockpit up

dodge

give me a bagel and a new york times 
this gets a laugh out of the boys susan joins in but then  
susan

what the hells that 
small purple globules the size of a poker chip art floating in the

ate numerous bits of shattered glass   
susan

all eyes turn to the fifth coffin the chrome half of the lid is still in place 
but the glass is missing except for a few ragged shards stuck in the

dodge touches one of the purple poker chips

they exchange nervous looks susan peers around a corner and the 
bloodless bonewhite corpse of stewart floats out to greet her 
theres a big open gash on the back of his left hand
susan

he mustve cut his hand when the glass blew 
dodge

wouldve emptied out in a couple of seconds

and it never coagulated no oxygen till now 
stunned silence  till astor sticks his head in from the cockpit area
astor

save it for later man your stations now

hes probably been dead for a decade or two 
the rest of us are one hour to touchdown and 
we got us a way funky port stabilizer

troy

better wear the excursion suits anyway well 
need to keep warm 
46     ext mountain basin  night

out of the craft and into their new environment

theres snow and ice everywhere you ook four moons of various 
sizes shine above low on the horizon hangs the tiny red orb of proxima 
centauri the smallest sun in this triplestar system because of the 
planets orbital angle proxima centauri never sets it burns like a 
perpetual nightlight bathing the landscape in a dim dull neon glow

susan rises to the challenge she twists two knobs on eithcr side of 
her collar breaking the airtight seal then she lifts her helmet off and 
takes a deep breath

two breaths she laughs the others follow suit within moments 
theyre all breathing the rarefied air of a new world and laughing
pull back to
47     pov shot  from rocks  on mountain basin
their laughter echoes in the distance from this rocky perch high 
above the basin we can see the whole tableau the ship its passengers 

 and as dawn breaks over the mountains we can see something else as 
well the unmistakable silhouette of a crude stonetipped spear in the 
foreground  and clutching it a human hand
48     ext mountain basin  day
troy and dodge are a short distance uphill from the ship standing 
over a mansized pile of rocks dodge pulls a tiny american 
flag from his pocket and plants it at the head of the grave they 
linger there a moment saying their silent farewells to stewart

astor and susan are unloading gear from the spaceship in the glare 
of the triple sun the snow around thc ships begun to turn slushy
astor

whoa little lady let me carry that for you 

31
susan

enough with the chivalry okay im not some delicate nower crazy as it sounds women can lift crates just iike men 
astor

by now dodge and troy have come trudging down to join them the two scientists take seats on newlyunloaded crates
troy

four women and astroboy its macabre 
astor
well like it or not gentlemen the four of us just may be humanitys last chance to perpetuate itself as a species
susan is reeling from this line of discussion waving htr hands shaking her head in disbelief she wanders back to the ship
susan

whoaaa check please 


49     pov shot  on the foursome
now were watching them from the vantage of an unseen observer moving gradualy closer past icy boulders around trees   
susan

excuse me  boys  i just put the radio box over by this rock  and now its gone 
nervous looks all around they hear a bird call from among the boulders  awfully close then anothcr  as if answering the first   
dodge

lets get back in the ship 

32
no debate necessary the four of them back cautiously toward the craft scanning the plain the surrounding boulders
50     int spacecraft  a moment later
the moment theyre inside with the hatch closed they hear a series of metallic clangs against the outtr skin of the craft
troy

someones throwing shit at us   
astors way ahead of him on that count he ignites the vtol rockets
51     ext plain  on spacecraft
several rocks and a crude spear bounce off the ship we pan down to the rockets blasting fue onto the snowy plain   

we hear a strange creaking noise  and then without warning a great big fissure opens up under the spacecraft
52     int craft  that moment
suddenly the craft pitches sideways everyone in it is thrown to the floor troy drags himself up to the console  stares out the viewport at great slabs of ice breaking up beneath them 
troy

jesus christ were on a lake 


53     ext plain  on spacecraft  that moment
the ships at a 45degree angle and slidlng rapidly into the icy waters the hatch blows astor and dodge dive out and tumble across the ice to safety susans next 

 but when she hits the ice it gives way beneath her troy sees her disappearing into the freezing water 
troy

susan 
 and without hesitation dives in after her

33
54     underwater shot  beneath the ice
shes sinking like a stone he grabs her tries to swim to the surface but cant  shes too heavy another thirty seconds and theyre goners

the ship continues to slide into the water troy drags susan laterally to the ship  catches hold of the open hatch and manages to pull them both along the exterior of the hull toward sunlight   


55     ext lake  a moment later
they break the surface gasping troy lifts susan out and they flop on the ice exhausted and hypothennic teeth chattering from the cold their suits are full of water another minute or two out here on the floe and their suits will be full of ice instead
susan

shshouldve    shshouldve let me    
troy

youre the most important cargo wete got 
shuddering

suits full of water  well freeze if we  
a spear whizzes between their faces and mbeds itself in the ice

they look around dodge and astor have been taken captive by a huntlng party  two dozen shaggy furclad stone age men
55     int cave  day
in the deepest pocket of a labyrinthine cave dwelling we find our four heroes seated around a fire dodge and astor are still wearing their excursion suits but troy and susan are bundled up in borrowed animal furs

theyre being guarded by a tight circle of women and old men the women chew hides the geezers chip flint tools a child paws at the odd fabric of astors suit astor slaps back makes a facc at him

the child breaks into wild hyenalike laughter his mother grunts and whacks him sharply upside the head
astor

hey troy i forgct which one oi these guys was the spaceship designer 

34
troy

look theyre human that doesnt make them the dominant species 
dodge

theyre obviously dominating us 
astor

a bunch of women medicare patients  hell why wait we can take em right now

susan

the men are down at the mouth of the cave astor theyre having a council meeting 
troy

probably deciding whether to worship us or eat us 
dodge

with a nice chianti 
dodge
astor

listen theres a crate of rifles down by the lake if we can get to em  if just one of us can get to em    
dodge pulls out his pipe and lights it with a zippo the tribesmen gasp awed and fascinated at the sight of the tiny flame

he holds it out for an old man to touch the old man lets out a yelp and dodge quickly snaps the lighter shut almost at once three of their guardians clamber off over the rocks to bring this shocking news to the tribal leaders troy laughs   
troy

that settles it were gods 
dodge

hey im the god you three can be my little elves 
the tribal leaders come hunying into the rear cavern dodge rises boldly to his feet holds up the lighter and demonstates its use

35
the tribesmen gasp in unison they start to move in toward the flame  but the merest gesture from dodge sends them back cringing 
astor

man you got this god shit down 
the tribesmen chatter and grunt excitedly among themselves but then abruptly they freeze  going absolutely silent our four captives stare at one another in confusion a deathly hush in the cave   

then they hear it

distant musical notes  the sound of a hunters horn signalling the start of the chase 

 and suddeniy the tribespeople are running off in all directions some toward the back of the cave some toward the front five seconds later troy and the gang are standing there alone and unguarded


57     int cave  near mouth  pov troy
theres a huge campfire blazing in the large vault at the mouth of the cave and the trlbe is running around it in a shrieking panic some leap out of the cave others crawl into cramped nooks and crannies the horn sounds again  accompanied by a throbbing warlike drumbeat

troy and susan emerge spot the cave entrance just past the campfire  and find themselves staring out at an unbelievable sight

hoverlng just outside the mouth of the cave is a whirlybird and seated in it aiming what looks like a bazooka directly at us   

  is a gorilla in full military dress

he fires a canister of tear gas rattles across the cave floor an instant later everyones choking on noxious green fumes


58     ext cave mouth  that moment
a blllowing green cloud pours out of the cave  and with it men women and children who dive out gasplng onto tht steep rocky slopes below the cave mouth is flanked by gasmasked gorillas with guns and prods one of them yanks on a cable   

 and a huge net springs up to snare the humans as they come tumbling headoverheels fiom the mouth of the cave

36
59     int cave  deep tunnel  that moment
in the swirling gas its aimost impossible to see dodge has fallen in with a batch of tribesmen who are tacing deeper into the cave

theyre clambering up a craggy wall toward an airhole  just big enough to crawl through screams and waillng as the tribespeople climb over one another in their panic to get out

dodge stares up at the airhole its as if someones standing outside opening and closing a trap door letting one human out at a time

60     ext airhole  on the slopes  that moment
outside we can see that two gorillas are holding a wooden plank in place over the airhole

61     int cave  tunnel  a moment later
dodge at the airhole the plank opens two grinning gorillas stare down at him horrified he leaps back down over the mass of bodies the others continue lemminglike toward their fates as he races deeper into the cave looking for anothcr exit


57     int cave mouth  a moment later
the rifletoting gasmasked ape guards on either side of the cave entrance the one on the left leans around to have a peek insideand the redhot end of a big flaming log freshly plucked from the campfire slams squarely into his gut dropping his rifle with a shriek he loses his footing and goes bouncing off among the rocks

troy steps out of the cave and heaves his blazing louisville slugger down the side of the cliffs the second ape guard calls out through

troy

help help 
ape guard ii climbs down from his perch to investigate he starts to cut across the cave mouth but the instant he steps onto the ledge  astors hand closes around his collar  and sends him slamming to the cave floor the last thing this ape ever sees is susan poised above him with a big nasty boulder about to pulverize his skull

grabbing the dead apes rifle astor and susan hook up with troy on the rocks above the cave as they scan the landscape they can see that theyre in the midst of a truly massive operation

fleets of trucks and allterrain vehicles down below  a veritable army of gorillas and chimpanzees and in the skies four more helicoprers fumigatlng all the nearby caves with tear gas
troy

weve got to go up its the only way

more humans making their way downhill  including astor who sticks out like a sore thumb in his spacesuit a tribesman collides with him from behind knocking him off his feet

he gets up cursing  then hears a metallic snap arid a howl of pain the tribesman is writhing leg caught in a steel bear trap  as astor surely wouldve been if hed kept to the same path

he reaches the campsite and the crate of rifles rips off the lid reaches down  and feels a bee stlng on his neck

its a tranquilizing dart he barely has time to yank it out before he topples to the ground in a heap an ape in sun goggles skis up to thd site stops on a dimc he gapes in puzzlement at astors odd garb at the crate of rifles he reaches into his designer parka and pulls out a cellular phone
66     ext high ground  that moment
troy and susan keeping low to the ground working their way from one hiding place to the next with gunshots echoing all around them

they take cover amid a cluster of boulders to do some quick recon if they can make it across a big flat expanse of snow they might be able to hide out in the rocky cliffs beyond unfortunately apes on skidoos are crisscrossing the plain picking off stray humans   
troy

troy if we could grab one of those things

susan

look out therts one coming up behind us 
troy braces himself against the boulder at the last instant he swings his rifle up into the approaching snowmobiles path wham  the skidoo keeps going but the gorilla stays behind

as her gaze moves from one screen to the next she brings up the appropriate audio channel we focus in on individual screens with her  first aerial footage of a taging fire churning black smoke into the skies over los angeles

just past that we find the president ducking terrorist bullets at an oval office press conference and armed riot cops rousting homeless squatters in what used to be an elementary school back when there were still kids and dick van dyke still bickering with mary sler moore three decades into the 21st ccntury

she stares at him for a long moment he chuckles engagingly

but when i tald him about the baby i crushed him i could see it in his face he was absolutely broken    like a wild animal when it finally realizes youve tamed it

you cant crush troy zaius youd better kill him because youll never crush him 
he strokes her belly gently but with an unmistakable hint of menace

well discuss it again when the time comes is there anything you need in the meantime

the guards nod and step inside as zaius marches off down the hall he takes susans letter from his pocket and opens it  begins to read then breaks into gales of hearty laughter
183   int lab  on susan
behind her the orang guards arc loading josies cage onto a wheeled cart as she listens to the echo of zaius laughter in the halls a strange bitter vengeful look crosses her face    and over this we hear
susan vo

shurgging

119
troy

oh jesus she sent a horse to tray 
zira

 beg your pardon 
troy

its an ancient story zira the trojan horse the greek army couldnt get past the walls of troy    
pause

so they built a giant horse left it outside the city as a peace offering  a gift and when the trojans rolled it inside their gates the greek army burst out of its belly and killed them all 
zira

well its a repulsive story all right but i dont see what it has to do with  
troy

shes the horse zira the little girl is a trojan horse 
zira

talk sense damn it you cant put an army of killers inside a little girl 
troy

yes you can 
he grins fiendishly she finally realizes what hes talking about

troy scoops the flailing josle up into his arms as zira runs to fetch a hypodermic needle
troy

hold still darling itll onfy hurt a bit  
zira jabs the syringe into josies backside and as it fills with blood we cut to
187   int cathedral  day
tight on a bejewelled silver chalice full of red wine a chimpanzee altar boy carries it on an ornate tray to the orang high priest 

120
 who mutters a few words of blessing over it then conveys it to the robed orang elders so that each in turn can take a sip   

in the congregation just behind the orang pews at the front of the chimp section we frnd troy and zira  both taking an unusual interest in the communion ritual ziras fidgeting like wild about to jump out of her seat trying to look anywhere but at the altar

troy however is staring directly at zaius  the ast of the elders to take his sip the two of them make eye contact zaius raises the chalice almost imperceptibly  a jaunty private toast troy smiles back

the ethereal choir music dies down and the priest takes his pulpit
high priest

many of you have noticed that we welcome today a most unusual guest  unusual in that he is a human and in that if the stories are true he comes from a distant world 
all eyes are on troy  some ape parents are even hoiding up their toddlers so the kids can get a look at him he nods his head humbly
high priest

some have called him a living rebuke to the holy dogma of simian divinity nothing could be further from the truth this talklng man has been sent among us as a test of our devotion and a call to action    
the old boy goes into a vicious hacking fit  so violent he has to turn away from the pulpit one of the elders rushes to his side and pours him a glass of water he gestures that hes okay   
high priest

where was i  call to action  a call to spread grodds message of love and mercy to all the many worlds of the firma firmame 
more coughing and gagging even worse than before this time the high priest makes a real show of it  leaning on his staff bringing up sputum staggering in circles before he finauv hits the carpet

worrted murmurs among the congregation as the elders cluster around the priest someone signals the organist to strike up a tune

121
troy glances at zira but she wont return his gaze shes staring guiltily at her shoes
188   int priests chambers  day
the high priest is sprawled on a sofa covered by a stack of blankets coughing so hard hes convusing the royal physiclan can barely keep him still long enough to shoot him full of antibiotics
zaius
coughing

what the hell is wrong with him 
the royal physiclan shakes his head  not a clue meanwhile the other elders are beginning to hack and quiver as well   
elder i

my heads splitting i must be feverish 
elder ii

are you sure its a good idea for us to be in here  in the room with  with his holiness 
zaius has lost his voice he coughs up phlegm into a handkerchief an orang in military garb peeks in

high priest

troy

elder i

demands from a human the gall 
troy

elder ii

hes bluffing 
zaius

of course hes bluffing hed never threaten the lives of his friends  all those innocent chimps and gorillas who admire him so  
troy

but zaius it doesnt affect chimps or gorillas no more than it affected the little girl you brought me 
zaius realizes hes been played his cronies al glower at him
troy

   it only affects the profaundly stupid 
losing it altogether zaius takes a swing at troy troy grabs his hand in midair and shoves him backward
zaius

in the rear cabin we find zira josie and a collection of bundledup shuddering orangs the high priest is on a stretcher iv in his arm troy returns and takes his seat beside zira  who whispers
troy

troy grins and shrugs  beats me
191   int olympus base  day
ziras experimental humans  adults and childrcn alike  are romping about in the ruined landscape under the dome enjoying their new fretdom frolicking among the columns and statues
191   int olympus base  coridor  day
a couple of sick orang guards are slumped on the floor halfdead janitorial servorobots cheerfully tidy up around them

cornelius limps into the corridor he leans the guards weapons up carefully against the wal then begins dragging the guards themselves by the feet dawn the spotless hallway to

dying orangs everywhere the beds are full the folding cots are full any more patients and the floor will be full

as cornelius drags the new arrival inside susan moves from one sick orang to another administering shots from a hypodennic

cornelius

they should come around we wont be here long enough to find out 
194   ext olympus base  landing field  day

cornelius is waiting on the airfield when the imperial jet iands hes got a big stack of ordnance waiting on the tarmac  stolen from inside

troy emerges from the plane followed by zira and josie then zaius and the delegation of hacking feverish orang elders cornelius tosses him a rifle from the pile as zlra rushes to embrace him
cornelius

susans on her way out shes rounding up the humans from the colony 
zaius

for grodds sake can we get inside freezing out here 
troy

go on in if you want were staying out here 
troy gestures toward the massive mercy ship the orangs noticc that the boarding stairway is already open and ready for passengers
elder

the mercy ship youre taking the mercy ship why we built that ship at a cost of 

125
cornelius

you built nothing humans designed that ship humans engineered it  like everything else in this place all you did was steal it 
zaius

twhy cornelius you sound bitter 
cornelius

susan was right zira there was a race of humans here and they built a technological paradise    which the orangs have spent the last ten thousand years plundering 
troy

go warm up the engines    
zaius

hold it troy you dont think were going to let you go without the antidote 
zalus nudges the gorilla pilot forward hes got a gun too but cornelius turns and points to a nearby snowy peak   
cornelius

see that red flag up there thats where youll find it its a 45minute hike in good weather 
elder i

45minute hikd how do we know what well find up there it could be an empty crate 
troy

did you bring the sample like i asked 
cornelius tosses troy a small corked vlal full of yellow fluid
troy

theres only enough for one it takes a while to kick in but if you dont mind waiting    
elder i

i suppose we should give it to his holiness 
zaius

are you joking 

126
zaius grabs at the vial laughing troy casually pitches it into a snowbank ten or fifteen yards away the elders dive at the drifttrampling each other in their efforts to get there first
elder i barks at the gorilla pilot
elder i

what are you looking at get up there and find that crate 
the gorilla trudges off as the orangs resume their rugby scrum motors begin to grind overhead the monorail which runs uphill from the airfield to the dome has started and the gondolas are in motion
troy

that must be susan rev up the ship 
over at the snowdrift zaius comes up with the vial concealing it in his paw so the others wont see he pops off the cork and downs its contents then he pulls a fountain pen from his pocket  uncaps it to reveal a flashing red light and a tiny microphone   
zaius

now 
195   ext dome  monorail platform  that moment
susan slams the door on a gondola full of frlghtened humans and sends it off on the long ride down to the airfield she herds the last batch aboard car 2 then climbs on herself  
196   int gondola 1  moving
the humans in gondoia 1 are petrified as they ride down  the adults more so than the childnn they take one look at the ground a hundred feet below and shriek most of them cower on the floor of the gondola and one brave soul whos standing up   

   gets himself killed  by a sudden burst of machinegun fire
197   int gondola 2  moving
the gunfire seems to be all around them pinging off the metal sides of the gondola making it rock laterally susan cant tell where its coming from she pulls her human companions down out of the range of fire and then ventures a quick look poking her head up   



127
she cant believe what she sees

the skies are full of flying gorlllas    at least a dozen of them wearing jetpacks strapped to their backs the packs come equipped with stabilizer wings which make the gorillas look like a nightmare vision from everyones childhood    the winged monkeys of oz

susan ducks just in time as a flying ape fires a burst at the gondola
198   ext airfield  that moment
down below troy is equally agog he picks up a rifle begins flring at tht flying apes in three tries he manages to pick one off the gorilla goes flying in a wild spiral trailing smoke as he hits the snow

way off in the distance he sees a couple of terrifled humans in the first gondola diving out they plunge a hundred feet to their doom   

zlra reappears on the stairway of the mercy ship
zira

troy whats happening 
troy

take cover start shooting 
he tosses her a gun from the pile  then picks out three of the biggest he can find for himself an empty gondola swings down makes the turnaround and starts back uphill toward the dome troy jumps aboard and starts the ascent guns blazing

zira takes cover beneath the giant mothwing of the mercy ship and begins snipino at inroming gorillas meanwhile over at the snowdrift the elders spot an opportunity

ziras occupied which means theres no one watching the plle of guns on the tarmac  no one but sixyearold josie gesturing silently to one another they sneak up toward the rifles   

   and stop in their tracks j0sie unattended has plucked an automatic rifle from tht pile she sits crosslegged on the tarmac to play with the bolt she glances over at zira to see how you work these things   

the orangs hesitate smile wave nicely at the little girl one bold elder wanders up closer gestures for j0sie to hand over her gun

j0sie frowns mine she squints at zira one last time   

128
   and opens fire mowing down two of the elders in their tracks the gun jerks and bucks in her grip josie laughs in riotous glee and fires again

the second burst leaves only zaius standing he dives behind a rock   
199   int gondola 3  on troy
jumping up ducking down shooting at gorillas who shoot back he picks off two more flying gorillas but its not enough  the cavalry is about to arrive two armored copters appear on the horizon

a rocket whizzes past the gondola  explodes in the snow a halfmile away a second rocket goes off near one of the giant pylons which support the monorail the pylon buckles  but holds 

troys at the midpoint of the uphill ride a few yards away susans gondola passes him on the descent they have just enough time to make eye contact before they have to duck down again

copter fire strikes the pulley assembly from which troys gondola hangs bolts pop the gondola rocks  tilts 

one end drops its obviously about to go troy shaves his rifle over the monorail cable  grabs the other end with his free hand  and jumps hanging on for dear life he sldes down the cable until he reaches the empty gondola behind him he drops inside   
200   ext airfield  that moment
the copters closing in a rocket zips past and detonates near the mercy ship the force of it knocking zira into the snow as shes getting up she hears the roar of turbine engines behind her   

zaiuss imperial jet is screaming down the runway  taking off
201   int imperial jet  that moment
the jet lifts off the high prlest smams from the passengcr cabin   
high priest

what is this where are we going 
in the cockpit we find not zaius but cornelius  teeth clenched fists wrapped around the throttle an armored copter is visible through the canopy  hovering over the dome dead ahead

129
cornelius

straight to hell    your holiness 
201   on copter  above the dome
the jet rams smack into it  a thunderous explosion   
201   int olympous base  that moment
   sends the flaming wreckage of both crafts crashing through the great overhead dome  down the shaft  into the nrins of the ancient city more explosions follow the walls of the shaft begin to quake and crumble snow and ice come toppling in from above   
204   ext troys gondola  that moment
the car rocks the good news is the plane collision took out a couple of flying gorillas with it the bad news is theres still one copter to go    and the monorail has stopped dead troys a sitting duck

he peers over the edge  sees the other gondolas stalled out down the slope theyre not far from the airstrip  but theyre still thirty or forty feet above the ground too high to jump out

the copter makes another pass a rocket hits a pylon   

this time the pylon doesnt hold it buckles the monorail cable slips a pulley and goes slack the floor of the gondola drops out from under troy  then the car stabilizes dangling at a weird angle   
205   int susans gondola 2  that moment
same deal humans scream around her as the gondola falls then stops  falls then stops again there hanging on for dear life but as the pylon buckles and the cable slips theyre getting closer to the ground

another lurch leaves them fifteen or twenty feet up thats good cnough for susan she grabs a rouple of her companions by the scruff of the neck and plunges over the side of the gondola   

   landing in a snowdrift shaken but intact she grabs her metal case and herds the other humans downslope toward the airfield

130
206   int troys gondola  that moment
hes just hanging there a hundred feet up waiting to drop gunshots ping off the gondola he jumps up to return fire  and cant no ammo

the rifles useless he drops it to the floor af the car  where he spies a longshoremans hook used to guide the gondola when it stops to let passengers off he grabs the hook flattens himself against a wall

a bold gorilla comes flying up he knows troys out of bullets and hes planning to take him out at pointblank range

until the hook swings up and plants itself in his leg

the gorilla shrieks as troy reels him in  simultaneously leaping from the gondola and wrapping his arms around the apes waist the jetpacks not designed to carry this much weight   

   and the two of them spiral wildly thtough the air looping the loop twisting and turning as they grapple   

they hit the snow with troy on top the gorilla underneath  like a big hairy snowboard jets still fuing they toboggan downhill then the ape slams into a rock  head first  and troy goes flying   
207   ext airfield  that moment
amid machine fire from the copter troy sprints aboatd the mercy ship the hydraulic stairway retracts behind him
208   int craft  a moment later
he bursts onto the bridge  finds susan zira j0sie and the surviving humans strapped in and ready to go

then lets blow this pop stand  hi 
he grins at her she grins back the ship begins to lift off gforces slamming the passengers back in their seats   

   but by the time they gain a couple of hundred feet in altitude the remaining armored copter sweeps past in front of thtm firing another rocket the rocket explodes just beneath them

zira
arent we going down   

troy
yup 

zira
isnt that a  

troy
yup 

the it zira means is the end of the slope which looms a couple of kilometers ahead beyond it theres nothlng  a sudden drop into a deep craggy canyon troy gives it the gas   

214   ext slope  on the craft
flying gorillas watch as the ship roars toward the abyss but theres an upturn just at the edge of the slope  and when they hit it troy fires the jets full blast using the mountain as a gigantic ski jump

it works the ship roars upward into the sky  splattering the flying apes like bugs on a windshield as it acceleratts into the stratosphere

215   ext aerial shot  on ship
from the edge of outer space we watch as the ship hurtles upward toward us leaving the planet of the apes behind

216   int bridge  five minutes later
space looms ahead the passengers are finally starting to relax

now weve got six years to kill 

133

susan
could be worse on earth its thirtyfour 
smiling
i knew youd get us out of there 

troy
you gave me the tools to do it you and cornelius    

he glances at zira who smiles wanly and fights back a tear

now troy unstraps himself from his console chair he floats up toward the roof of the bridge weightless   

troy
come here 

susan unstraps too floats up toward him the two of them go into a tight zeroavity embrace rolling around in midair kissing laughing

then a shriek josies just unstrapped too  and shes bugging out everyone laughs  except zira whos watching the console

zira
troy somethings wrong with our oxygen supply the auxiliary tank is breached    
beat
make that two auxiliary tanks    

217   int ship  engine rooms  a minute later
troy scooting weightlessly thtough the ship pulling himself along horizontally by whatever handholds he can find when he arrives at the engine room he gets a downright nasty surprise   

lord zaius is disabling the oxygen tanks one by one

zaius
sweetheart did you miss me 

troy braces both feet against a bulkhead and launches himself at zaius they collide  tumbling upward toward the ceiling

zalus hits first braces himself below him troy rears back to throw another punch  but when he connects the force of his own blow sends him hurtling back toward the floor zaius laughs   

134

zaius
as newton said  for every action    

he pushes off from the ceiling  lands with both feet against troys throat  and bounces off toward a nearby hatch

218   int hydroponics chamber  that moment
enough vegetatlon to feed an army is growing here in the artificially lit hydroponics tanks troy bursts in chasing zaius 

 but zaius is behind him hanging upside down over the door he kicks troy into one of the tanks which shatters  spilling water globules and clumps seaweed upward into the air 

zaius
careful people are starving in china 

troy
then dont play with your food 

troy grabs a shard of jagged glass and launches himself upward at zaius  who sidesteps him somersaulting through the next hatch

219   int airlock  a moment later
troy follows the hatch door hisses ominously shut behind him in a glass closet he sees a handful of excurslon suits  and realizts that zaius has lured him into an airlock theres another hatch on the far side of the room and beyond it lies the vacuum of space

zaius
vaya con dios amigo    

zaius has wrapped bimself up in mesh webbing strung against one wall hanging on tight he hits a switch  the space hatch rises

 and in the instant before the air explodes outward from the airlock troy leaps up and grabs onto the mesh webbing hes stitl got the shard of glass in his hand he slashes wildly at the webbing 

 which pops free from its mounting on the airlock wall 

 and sends troy and zaius entwined tumbling out into the void

135
220   ext space  outside ship
as they spiral away a corner of the webbing snags in the airlock door its their only lifeline to the ship but now theyre in total vacuum  and as studies tell us a human can sunrive for no more that two minutes in a vacuum

gasping they shout imprecations at one another no words come out theres no sound in space

zaius wrestles with troy trying to break his hold on the mesh but troy has a sudden lastditch inspiration  a flashback to stewart his colleague who died on the voyage out   

in slomo his fingernails rake across zaiuss face tearing away strips of slmlan flesh 

its like vesuvius erupting with a soundless scream zaius takes off rocketing away from the shlp like a punctured balloon as every last drop of blood in his body spews out gusherlike into the vacuum of space

the orang lord cartwheels off into the void by now troy is beginning to drift away from the ship and in a few seconds the vacuum will claim him as well in the instant before he loses consciousness   

   a whitesuited arm wraps itself around his throat troy looks up at the face behind the visor  a chimps face its zira beautiful zira in an excursion suit umbilically connected to the ship  dragging him back to the safety of the airlock

the last thing troy sees before the airlock hisses shut is the eerily beautiful sight of zaiuss blood hanging in the blackness before him    a thousand tiny globules catching the light of the triple suns like a vast endless swarm of purple fireflies

fade through to

staring at their son

   revealing a spectacular manhattan skyline all lit up

she clasps his hand the two of them beam at each other

224   ext airstrip  night
the ship appears on the horizon slowino ovethead as it shifts into vtol mode were watching from behind a chainlink fence at the far end of the airstrip as the ground crew in their fullbody jumpsuits swarm about pteparing for the spactships dcscent landing llghts bracket either side of the runway

225   ext airstrip  on decending ship  a moment later
the big ship touches down gently  a perfect landing after a moment a hatch pops and a big hydraulic stairway lowers to the tarmac

139
troys the fist one out the lights from the tower and the runway are so bright hes practically blinded but he can still make out the huge crowds of spectators on the other side of the chainlink fences that border the airstrip and even if he couldnt he can hear the excitement  the laughter the cheering

squinting he raises his arms in a gesture of triumph the crowd roars  and another roar greets each new spacefarer who descends the stair susan with jack in her arms josie zira   

flashbulbs pop in the distance a number of spectators seem to be trying to climb over the chainlink fence and it strikes troy that the crowd noise is beginning to take on an odd almost savage tone   

offlcial vehlcles come driving across the tarmac waved on by the ground crew with their illuminated batons disturbingly all the members of the ground crew share an odd hunched posture

by the time the vehicles arrive and troy can make out the faces of the passengers he understands why cverything has struck him as subtly wrong

theyre apes

and they have guns the blood drains from troys face as he pulls his family into a protective embrace now field lights flash on and he can see the spectators on the other side of the fence   

all apes jumping chattering squealing for blood

as armed apes surround the landing party a gorilla in a generals uniform climbs out of a jeep and strolls over baring his huge white incisors he extends a hand to troy   

gorilla
dr troy welcome home 

susan lets out a horrible shriek which echoes over the airfield as we pull up and away  echoes until its drowned out by the guttural grunts of a thousand onlooking apes
