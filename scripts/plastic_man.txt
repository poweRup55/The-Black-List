fade in

int  cage

we are a lab mouse

our world is a cage the laboratory beyond the wire mesh
has the sprawling limitlessness of a universe with dark
endless voids and immense technological instruments
gleaming with celestial light

we can hear a womans voice though we cant understand
what she is saying

there are several other lab mice in our cage and as the
voice gets closer there is sense of mounting apprehension

we fight the other mice pushing into the far corner

suddenly the world beyond the mesh is eclipsed by the
woman  if we were not a mouse we might think she was
beautiful

she opens the cage and a panic erupts  there is nowhere
to hide as her hand reaches in and takes hold of us

the cage seems to fall away as she lifts us

we can barely hear her voice over the blood pounding in
our ears

she turns us over and we see an enormous hypodermic needle
that she uses to inject us with a sapphireblue fluid

we are then placed in a small airtight tank  there is a
small plexiglas window and several tiny holes  after a
moment we hear the hiss of valves opening

a milky fluid suddenly floods the chamber and we begin to
feel nauseous our vision blurring and distorting

as quickly as the fluid filled the tank it now drains

the godlike hand again lifts us from the tank but
something is wrong because 

we slip through her fingers

the ground rushes up at us but when we hit 

we bounce  and bounce

flip flopping the bounces coming quicker and quicker
lower and lower until we are racing across the floor
free

we see the woman in her white lab coat screaming at her
assistant as they try to corral us

we dodge zipping across the floor looking for a way out
when we see set in the tile floor a drain

the world swirls with us as we dash towards it the dark
holes widening as we dive at them plunging headlong into
blackness 

tumbling down the rabbit hole

after a long silent moment we hear a man sneeze

int  dime store

the darkness becomes a curtain that is yanked open as the
same man steps out talking to himself

					man
		hi susan no  hi susie

we realize he has just stepped out of a photo booth

we do not see his face moving with him staying waist
high as he waits for the photo strip

					man
		howdee susan no hello there
		doctor bright  no no no  hello
		susan

a smoldering octave lower

					man
		hello susan

the green light flashes and the strip of black and white
pictures drops into the gate

we descend past each picture of the mans face framed
tightly as if each was a panel in a comic book

each face seems like someone who has a secret or who is
trying to look very smart

except for the last one which looks like he was about to
sneeze

the man grabs the strip

ext  susan brights brownstone  morning

an upscale neighborhood  brownstones and coffee houses

dr susan bright woman steps out of her door  she is
the scientist that we saw in the opening scene

she is in a hurry juggling a briefcase an armful of
books a cup of coffee and her keys as she heads for her
car

she is bent to the car door as we glide up behind her

					man
		hello susan

the voice hits her like the hymlich maneuver

					susan
		oh my god

					man
		what god would that be

she turns around and we see the man daniel eel obrien
black leather activist  we cannot tell if he is dangerous
or just trying to look dangerous

					susan
		daniel

					obrien man
		what  no kiss  not even for old
		times sake

she forces a smile and gives him a hug

his hand slips into her lab coat pocket and then away

					susan
		when did you

					obrien
		been out for six months now

					susan
		really  what have you been doing

					obrien
		you know this and that

she smiles

					susan
		still chasing litterbugs

his grin has an edge to it

					obrien
		somebody has to

					susan
		same old daniel

					obrien
		oh no  not by a long shot  i may
		look like the old daniel obrien
		but on the inside nothing is the
		same

					susan
		is that so

					obrien
		oh yeah  see susie a man doesnt
		do the hard time and just pick up
		where he left off  oh no  the big
		house does things to a man

					susan
		the big house

					obrien
		the big house

					susan
		jesus daniel  it wasnt rykers
		island  it was work camp for white
		collar criminals

					obrien
		a cage by any other name would still
		smell like sweaty ugly men

sounds like the same obrien to her

					obrien
		you know ive been following your
		work at argon labs

her smile disappears

					obrien
		ive been thinking about you a lot
		all these years locked up in my
		cell  id tear through every issue
		of the midwest science journal
		looking for your latest findings
		watching as you slowly worked your
		polymerization experiments up
		through single celled organisms to
		that holiest of holies the fruit
		fly  exciting stuff  i got to tell
		you it really kept me going

					susan
		i guess i should be flattered

					obrien
		i remember you said nanotechnology
		was going to change the world

					susan
		it already is

					obrien
		ive read theyre using it to repair
		cancer cells

					susan
		and for cleaning up oil spills

					obrien
		right  you predicted it

he moves closer eyes smoldering

					obrien
		do you ever wonder what happened to
		us susie

					susan
		it was a long time ago daniel  we
		were young different people
		heading in different directions
		thats all

she backs away

					obrien
		yeah

					susan
		well it was good to see you
		daniel but i have to be going

					obrien
		sure  can i ask you one more thing
		you havent published anything in a
		while  how come

she shrugs getting into her car

					susan
		nothing really worthwhile

					obrien
		thats what i thought

she closes the door

					obrien
		be seeing you

she watches him turn and walk away in the rearview mirror
she guns her cars engine and the sound rolls into 

the roar of smokestacks gaseous flames burning into boot
black clouds

ext  calumet city  day

an industrial wasteland towering smokestacks and
warehouses of corrugated steel factories and chemical
plants built around a small lake that shimmers with an
oily iridescent sheen while its shores churn a frothy
green bile

one of the more distinct buildings in this skyline of
black steel and bluegas flame is argon laboratories

it is a heavily secured compound  there are two oblong
buildings  one is the main lab building the other is a
chemical warehouse

where the two buildings are connected a third structure
rises on a steel framed skeleton like a water tower

this is argon tower and at the top of the two story
private manor built beside a helicopter pad is a
twinkling glass conservatory

int  argons office

a pair of gleaming redpatent leather stilettoheeled
shoes click delicately across the floor

					woman
		icarus

we follow the high heels through the office until we see
the base of a statue and the name chiseled into stone
icarus argon

we rise up the nineheadshigh heroically proportioned
statue and see icarus argon as he once was a single
halogen highlights the massive davidlike physique

she crosses the sprawl of the office and everywhere are
mementos marking the milestones of argons life  his face
beams on framed magazine covers peoples sexiest man
alive and times man of the year  a 1989 mr universe
trophy is almost lost in the thicket of awards

the woman calls to the wheelchairbound figure slouching
behind a black obelisklike desk

					woman
		icarus i thought i would find you
		here

she is mrs poppy argon a stunning woman of cosmetic
perfection and a body that might have been surgically cut
from a comic book

she designs her own dresses made from argon rubber or pvc
usually red to match her collection of high heeled shoes
and boots

					poppy woman
		you never came to bed

he says nothing

					poppy
		have you been here all night

she moves around him and we get our first look at the new
icarus argon

					poppy
		how are you feeling today

he is an unwrapped mummy brown flesh drapes over stringy
cords of muscle like a wet paper bag  his eyes hard
white marbles lined with red cracks coldly stare up at
her

					argon man
		i feel like i felt yesterday

she feels his forehead

					argon
		like rotting meat

					poppy
		youre not rotting meat

he lifts his arm

					argon
		oh no  smell this

					poppy
		icarus please if you want me to
		give you a bath just say so

					argon
		no  im getting used to it

she opens a manila folder setting several sheets of paper
on a tray in front of him

					poppy
		fine  now i need your signature on
		this today

he snatches the pen from her and begins signing everything
she lays in front of him

					argon
		what about dr bright

poppy sighs

					poppy
		shes working as fast as she can
		icarus  it will be ready soon

					argon
		its ready now i know it is

					poppy
		she says its not

					argon
		shes lying  she lost the first one
		on purpose

					poppy
		she did not  the mouse ran down the
		drain

					argon
		she let it escape because she wants
		me to die

					poppy
		dont be a child icarus  she is
		just another scientist and like all
		scientists she doesnt care about
		anything outside the world of the
		laboratory

she gathers her papers back into the folder

					poppy
		right now she is still concerned
		about the unstable molecular waste
		generated by the first experiment
		i am sure that when she solves that
		problem she will be ready for the
		second test

she pats him on the head

					poppy
		now you be a good boy today and take
		your medicine and poppy will make
		you forget about everything tonight

she blows him a kiss wiggling her long rednailed
fingers

ext  main gate

susan brights car rolls up to the main gate  inside her
car she is searching for her security card key

the guard notices and steps out of the booth  she rolls
down the window

					guard
		something wrong dr bright

					susan
		i cant find my key card

					guard
		not a problem  just let us know if
		its lost and well make you a new
		one

					susan
		thanks

he returns to the booth and the gate arm waves up

ext  admiral hotel  day

a poorly painted sign in the window reads  transients
welcome

int  admiral hotel

close on susan brights argon id as an xacto knife
carefully cuts out the photo

obrien is hunched over working diligently  the hotel
room behind him is the kind of place where cheap would
be the politically correct adjective

there are piles of nondescript scientific journals and
reference texts everywhere  the walls around him are
covered with clipped articles and we repeatedly glimpse
the words nanotechnology molecular engineering
assemblers and replicators

using a colored marker he colors in one of the serious
looking black and white photos from the strip

there are only twelve colors in the set of markers so the
result looks somewhere between warhol and turnervision

he compares it to the color photo of susan  shrugs good
enough

int  susan brights lab

susan is not listening her face as frozen as her picture
her mind somewhere else

					nebbleman
		without the nanobot it appears there
		will be no way to stabilize the
		waste entirely  even at subzero
		temperatures it remains active

dr nigel nebbleman is susans assistant  more nebbish
than man

					nebbleman
		i wonder if there is a way we could
		catch that mouse  susan  susan are
		you listening to me

she blinks

					susan
		what  oh im sorry nigel  i was
		just thinking

					nebbleman
		aaabout

					susan
		this morning  i saw someone i
		havent seen in a long time

					nebbleman
		a man

					susan
		yeah  i knew him when i was still
		in school

					nebbleman
		what did he want

					susan
		im not sure  thats the funny
		thing about him  hes the kind of
		guy that you never know what he
		wants or what he might do to get it

ext  street

obrien is moving against the general flow of traffic on a
crowded street

he notices a man in a business suit with a briefcase in
one hand a white styrofoam cup of coffee in the other

the man apparently in a hurry slugs down the last of the
coffee crumbles the cup in his fist and without a second
thought tosses the cup into the hedge

					obrien
		hey

the suit walks right past him oblivious to obriens
outrage

obrien looks back at the cup and then the man  a single
word hisses from his lips

					obrien
		litterbug

he rushes to the hedge and seizes hold of the cup then
whirls back chasing after the bug

					obrien
		hey  hey you  hey litterbug
		mr litterbug

he grabs the bug by the shoulder and spins him around

					obrien
		excuse me but i believe you dropped
		this

the litterbug a very large litterbug laughs

					litterbug man
		yeah  so what

					obrien
		so what  so what  for starters
		how about littering is a crime

					litterbug
		hawhaw  why dont you run off and
		find a cop and ill wait right here

					obrien
		why dont you just put this in your
		pocket so when you see a garbage can
		you can put it where it belongs

					litterbug
		why dont you just shove it up your
		ass  hawhaw

the litterbug starts walking away but obrien continues
to dog him

					obrien
		what is it with you litterbugs  is
		it a territorial thing marking your
		turf with your garbage

					litterbug
		you better quit pushing me pal

					obrien
		i just want to know what goes on in
		the mind of a litterbug  what
		chemical is secreted by your smooth
		brain that tells you its okay
		just chuck it

					litterbug
		look asshole i dont got time for
		this  if you got a problem you
		better take care of it yourself

					obrien
		oh no no no  no can do  you
		enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus
		this receptacle becomes your
		responsibility and i dont care if
		its a styrofoam cup or the exxon
		valdez  youve got to learn to take
		responsibility

					litterbug
		what are you going to do  make me
		throw it out

					obrien
		ill do whatever i have to do

fists clench as they eye one another up and down until the
litterbug laughs again

					litterbug
		jeesus  youre crazy as catshit
		you win  gimme the cup

smiling obrien starts to give him the cup

					obrien
		believe me later on youll feel a
		lot better about this

when suddenly the litterbug seizes obriens wrist
yanking him off balance as he pops him square in the nose

a second blow to the gut doubles obrien over and a
briefcase to the back of the head drops him to the
sidewalk

					litterbug
		later on youre going to feel a
		whole lot worse  hawhaw

he kicks him in the gut

					litterbug
		next time mind your own business

he walks away as obrien squeezes the styrofoam cup
cracking it in his fist

					obrien
		no good stinking litterbug

int  susan brights lab

susan is still talking to nebbleman

					susan
		do you remember about five years
		ago that uh incident at purnell
		labs

					nebbleman
		oh yeah  they were working on
		molecular assemblers too werent
		they

					susan
		they also tried using viral rna
		as the bonding element

					nebbleman
		thats right  cdc found out and
		closed them down

susan looks into the mouse cage as nebbleman remembers the
rest

					nebbleman
		yeah somebody broke in and stole
		the samples one of those animal
		rights groups right  i remember
		now they freed all the monkeys
		which caused that huge pileup on the
		massachusetts turnpike right

					susan
		yeah  but it wasnt a group  it
		was one man

					nebbleman
		thats the guy

she nods

					nebbleman
		and you think he knows what were
		doing here

she nods again

					nebbleman
		oh

ext  main gate

a security card slides through the gate box

the arm raises and daniel obrien drives in waving to the
security man who absently waves back

int  security office

we glide through the frosted glass and out through the
inverted letters spelling security

					sim
		so you think this psycho
		environmentalist character stole
		your security key to break into the
		lab

the head of argon security sitting behind his enormous
desk is dt sim a little guy with something to prove

his silent partner is doby an enormous man with the face
of a mastiff

					susan
		it might be paranoia but ive never
		lost my keycard before

					sim
		paranoia is what separates the
		secured from the unsecured

he smiles enjoying his own cleverness

					sim
		just a little saying weve got in
		the security business dr bright
		we get paid to be paranoid  we
		worry so you dont have to

he lights a stogie

					sim
		a lot of people think security is
		just a job but for me its a way of
		life  its a state of mind

he blows a cloud of smoke into the air

					sim
		if this nutcase did take it and has
		half a brain hed use it right
		away before we could invalidate it

					susan
		yes that is what i was thinking

					sim
		in fact would it be safe to say
		based on your general knowledge of
		this character that he is already
		in the building

					susan
		yes he might be

int  argon lab  close on colored id

that obrien forged clipped to the pocket of a lab coat

we notice that he also inked in some dark glasses and a
moustache

smiling nodding he moves through the busy corridors with
a sense of inconspicuous conspicuousness

susan appears from around a corner walking toward him as
he turns away  something about the tall moustached man
catches her eye when 

					nebbleman
		susan  susan

nebbleman hurries to catch up

					nebbleman
		what did security say

					susan
		theyll in validate the key
		probably nothing

					nebbleman
		well you got another problem

					susan
		the replicators

					nebbleman
		worse  mrs argon wants to talk to
		you  shes waiting in the lab

					susan
		this day just keeps going from bad
		to worse

int  susan brights lab

from inside the mouse cage we see poppy looking down at
us  her perfect red lips slightly curling into a sneer

					poppy
		vermin

					susan os
		can i help you mrs argon

as susan enters the lab nebbleman fades back and
disappears

					poppy
		i spoke to dr argon this morning
		and he remains frustrated over the
		loss of the original nanobot

					susan
		i am aware of dr argons
		frustrations

					poppy
		he believes that the second nanobot
		should be ready for testing by now

susan does not want to hear this now

					susan
		dr argon is going to have to muster
		a little patience  i was rushed
		into testing the nanobot on that
		mouse and now we are dealing with a
		toxic waste that has the potential
		to make three mile island look like
		spilled milk

susan stares daggers

					susan
		under the circumstances i cant
		fathom what makes dr argon think we
		are ready for anything bigger  if
		cnn or hell if the epa knew
		what was in my basement 

					poppy
		is that a threat dr bright

					susan
		look as i have said and will
		continue to say the instability of
		the assembler waste remains my
		priority 

					poppy
		while you remain on the staff at
		argon laboratories your priorities
		will always be the same as dr
		argons priorities  i imagine that
		is a simple enough equation for a
		bright girl like you to figure out

poppy smiles  susan suppresses the urge to smash her head
with a microscope

					poppy
		if you dont have any questions
		ill let you get back to doing your
		job

					susan
		just one question  since dr argon
		no longer has feeling below his
		waist how is it that youre still
		able to do your job

poppy glances up at the security camera in the far corner

she leans close to susan and whispers

					poppy
		i could have you fired right now

					susan
		you wont  thats why youre
		whispering

poppy glares at her then spins on her heels and leaves

still fuming susan turns to a special computerized
vaultlike machine which is the nanobot freoncontainment
system

at the top there is a sealed plate that is connected to
an electron microscope

she touches the plate almost lovingly letting her anger
drain away

nebbleman skulks back in

					nebbleman
		he wants another test

she says nothing

					nebbleman
		i bet he hasnt read a single report
		weve written on the waste problem

					susan
		i hope youre right  id feel a lot
		worse if he had read them and just
		didnt care

					nebbleman
		what are you going to do

					susan
		what ive always done  as long as
		im the only one who can build the
		nanobot im the only one who can
		say when it should be tested

as they return to work we rise up to the unblinking eye
of the security camera

int  security booth

the security booth is sims world he is intimate with
every detail of each small framed monitor

					sim
		hey dobe ever wonder if this is
		how god feels looking down on us

doby says nothing

					sim
		yeah me neither

ext  argon labs  day

the sun a brilliant ball of lemon yellow slowly begins
to curdle 

transmogrifying into a full moon pale and winter blue
against a night sky

int  storage room  night

a dark room filled with barrels labeled explosive
materials  contains trinitrotoluene

a barrel lid cracks open  two eyes peek out

obrien unfolds himself awkwardly climbing out of the
empty barrel

int  stairwell

obrien slithers up the stairs clinging to every shadow

int  hall

like a ghost he glides down the dark empty halls moving
only when the surveillance cameras pan away

int  susan brights lab

the door hiccups and obrien slips inside

on hands and knees he crawls toward the center of the lab
where the nanobot is stored

again we peer out through the wire mesh of the mouse cage
obriens head pops up in front of us

					obrien
		oh no pows

he ducks down just as the camera sweeps overhead  he pops
back up

opening the cage he frees all of the little mice

					obrien
		never leave a man behind

he grabs the last one ducking under the arc of the
camera

int  security booth

there is a flash of white in the corner of susans lab

					sim
		did you see that

doby nods

					sim
		looked like a mouse

int  susan brights lab

the cage is empty

obrien finds the security panel of the nanobot
containment system  he sprinkles graphite dust on the
keypad

when he blows on the dust four numbers remain covered
1689  from his pocket he pulls out a folded paper

it is filled with a list of all the numbers relevant to
susans life such as birthdays phone numbers and
significant dates

his thumb stops at august 6th 1991  birth of nanobot

					obrien
		never good at remembering numbers
		were you susie

he types the date and the pressurized seals gasp  the
plate rises revealing a glass tube filled with a sapphire
blue liquid

					obrien
		thats your baby aint it

he is about to touch it when the lab door suddenly swings
open

he ducks  holding his breath he waits  the room is
silent

slowly quietly he peeks out  a flashlight blinks near
him and he ducks back down

he hears a whisper

panicking he starts to creep toward the door when a beam
of light suddenly pools around him

					sim
		look what we caught here

obrien cant see because of the light in his eyes

					sim
		one big muther of a mouse

obrien bolts running straight into dobys chest

a giant fist hammers down onto the top of his skull as his
eyes roll up into his head

								    fade to black

fade in

on nightmare

trapped beneath searing laboratory overhead lights
argons hideous face hovers over us a cracked lipless
smile revealing ulcerous gums and stained teeth

					argon
		ive been waiting for something like
		this my whole life

the voices warp through the watery space

					poppy
		bad boy got caught with his hand in
		the cookie jar

the faces float over obrien like disembodied heads

					sim
		you should have stayed in jail pal

argon grips obriens head under the chin  poised between
his fingers is a gleaming stainless steel hypodermic
needle

					argon
		for every environmentalist anti
		industrialist animal activist that
		has shoved their myopic
		protectionist causeofthemonth
		crap down my throat i shove this
		down yours

he sticks the needle into obriens neck  obriens eyes
flutter the voices and faces stretching away

argons thumb depresses the plunger

					poppy
		you sure you know what youre doing
		icky

inside the hypo blood blossoms all around us as the
sapphire fluid containing the nanobot is injected into
obrien

we rush with blurred speed into his blood stream as we see
the nanobot a microbiotic machine that resembles a
snowflake

as it bounces from protein cell to cell falling away from
us it begins to blur as we hear what sounds like muzak

the shapes focus again as we realize that we are now
looking down into the aisle of a grocery store

the two parts of the nanobot become obrien and susan
joined together by the grocery cart they are pushing

flashback  int  grocery store

it is the 1970s  obrien is a granola hippie activist
type extra crunchy  susan still loves oreo cookies

					susan
		nanotechnology is going to change
		the world danny  im telling you
		in ten maybe twenty years life is
		going to be a totally new kind of
		experience

obrien is not listening repulsed by the stock lining the
shelves

					susan
		and what i love about molecular
		science is the way it revolutionizes
		how we have to think  it unifies
		the entire world on a single level
		everything is completely connected
		sometimes i can really feel it
		everything around us just a small
		part of a whole  its really
		wonderful

					obrien
		yeah well see

					susan
		well see  what does that mean

					obrien
		well see how wonderful it is after
		you spend the next twenty years
		making agent orange

					susan
		god daniel im not going to make
		agent orange

					obrien
		you think the chemists that invented
		agent orange twenty years ago were
		in school saying boy i really got
		some good ideas for a highly toxic
		incendiary defoliant  you think
		oppenheimer was dreaming about
		mushroom clouds before the war

she tries to ignore him

					susan
		weve had this conversation already
		daniel

					obrien
		all im saying is that the companies
		that have money for the kind of
		research youre interested in have
		money because thats what theyre
		interested in  money

she stops the cart

					susan
		im sorry i brought the whole thing
		up  if youre gonna flip your wig 

					obrien
		i cant help it suze  its this
		place  you know how i get in these
		stores  they freak me out  all
		these tiny boxes little cans filled
		with eight syllable god knows what

he grabs a can of spam

					obrien
		look at this  theyve taken all the
		food out of food  when you start
		talking about the future this is
		what i see  huge vats of spam  you
		are what you eat and theyre turning
		us into spampeople

he shoves the can back into the shelf

					obrien
		you think its a coincidence that
		they have all these aisles lined up
		like this like a little maze
		were all lab rats running through
		their maze pulling lever a or lever
		b each designed to create some kind
		of biochemical dependency  all the
		while theyre everywhere watching
		us twoway mirrors surveillance
		cameras nodding to each other
		making little notes

					susan
		youre insane

					obrien
		am i  look  right there  thats
		exactly what i am talking about

a little boy is trying to get a box of trix cereal from a
shelf that is too high

					obrien
		lever a

he jumps several times unable to grab the economysized
box  obrien walks over to him

					susan
		daniel  dont  oh no

the tips of the kids fingers are slowly coaxing the box
from the edge

					obrien
		let me help you kid

the kids face widens into a smile until obrien pushes
the box back

					kid boy
		hey

					obrien
		you dont want this

					kid
		yeah i do

					obrien
		you have no idea what this is doing
		to your body

					kid
		i like trix

					susan
		daniel give him the trix

					obrien
		susan this is the future of america
		here

					kid
		trix are for kids

obrien grabs a box of shredded wheat

					obrien
		here kid this is great stuff  why
		dont you give it a try

					kid
		i want trix  mommy

the boys wail swells unnaturally loud as we rise up
distorting as it becomes 

the pressurizing of the test tank

int  test tank

obrien jerks awake  he is inside a dark steel capsule

there is a wet sucking noise as the hoses are opened and
the white assembler fluid begins pumping into the tank

					obrien
		mommy

int  lab

argon watches the gauges climbing on the tanks with a mad
gleam in his eye

poppy stares at the computer flickering through the model
simulation

					poppy
		icky this is so exciting

sim looks a bit nervous

					sim
		how long do you leave him in there

					argon
		until hes done

he laughs until the tank shivers

the whole unit is now sizzling hot  a coolant line
bursts

each of them backs away as the tank vibrates under
mounting pressure like a water balloon that is ready to
burst

					poppy
		 icky

the tank explodes splitting open like a can of whipped
cream

we see the world through the eyes of obrien as he rises
from the burbling marshmallowamnion  everything has a
sense of unnatural viscosity as if reality had been remade
with molasses

the room curves and warps our eyes like carnival mirrors
we see a distorted argon staring at us in awe

					argon
		my god it works

now we see obrien

he has been completely polymerized his entire body
shifting and flowing like a drunken wave machine

the rubbery flesh of his face looks too heavy hanging
slack  his eyes bulge and loll as he tries to focus

					argon
		grab him  hurry  grab him

doby is the closest and he snatches obriens arm
obrien reacts yanking his arm which thins to a strand of
spaghetti and whips free

obrien stumbles backwards quivering like a jello slinky
until his bare foot which seems more a puddle than a
foot lands on the main floor drain

his leg slips immediately through the sieve as he slaps
down to the floor one leg sprawled out in front of him

he blinks

then the rest of him falls through

sim grabs at the pile of clothes covering the drain but
daniel obrien is gone

from below the drain we look up at argon and the others
staring down

					sim
		thats impossible

					poppy
		its a miracle

					argon
		its an organicpolymerization

behind them the tank core continues to melt down
gelatinous waste splattering the room

					poppy
		icky  whats happening

					argon
		who cares  weve got to find him
		hurry

his chair heads for the door

int  storm drain

a six inch pipe opening groans with the sound of
stretching rubber

fingers suddenly reach out and grab the edge of the hole

there are a series of cartoonlike sounds as obrien pulls
himself out emerging from the opening like toothpaste

after a struggle he pops free snapping into normal human
proportions

cradling his head he stands up in the corrugated metal
drain

unsure of what has happened or why he is naked he
stumbles out into the creek his bare feet squishing into
the muddy water

ext  argon labs

the moon throbs overhead in a sky of dark crushed velvet

sim and dobys flashlight beams dart and bounce as they
sweep the compound

they find the drain pipe and sim throws his beam down it
careful not to get his shoes muddy

					sim
		ah for the love of god i aint
		going in there

he looks at doby

					sim
		you check it out

int  elevator

poppy and argon ride up in the elevator that connects the
main lab to argon tower

					argon
		it works poppy  it works it
		works

					poppy
		now icky i dont need you winding
		yourself up  i need you focused and
		in control

					argon
		but poppy you dont know what this
		means 

					poppy
		you dont either  we wont know
		anything until we find that guy and
		find out if hes alive or what

					argon
		yes thats true  we have to find
		him run tests determine if the
		polymerization is stable

					poppy
		in the meantime were going to need
		someone to deal with that mess in
		the lab  i dont think we should
		call dr bright

					argon
		oh no  no  well get her
		assistant  whatshisname
		nebbishman

					poppy
		nebbleman

int  main lab

nigel nebbleman enters the building  he is wearing a
raincoat over his pajamas that are covered with small
bunny rabbits

poppy is waiting for him

					poppy
		dr nebbleman thank god youre
		here

in her high heels she is taller than him and when they
embrace his head lays against her ample bosom

					poppy
		ive been nearly hysterical with
		fright  thank god you came  i feel
		so much better that youre here

					nebbleman
		what happened

poppy leads him to the stairwell

					poppy
		as i told you on the phone theres
		been an accident  a terrible
		accident

int  susan brights lab

we hear nebblemans voice crack with panic as he rushes
towards the double doors of the lab

					nebbleman os
		oh my god  oh my god  oh my god

the moment he bursts in and sees the ruptured test tank
melting into the white mucous of the assembler waste 

he faints

					poppy
		great

int  argons office

nebbleman lifts his face from the paper bag he was
breathing in  panic is cracking his voice

					nebbleman
		okay  alright  okeydokey  now
		we need the nanobot  the nanobot
		that initiated the reaction  once
		we have that we can stabilize the
		meltdown  simple really  no
		problem

					argon
		the nanobot is gone

nebblemans voice rises several octaves

					nebbleman
		gone  what do you mean gone  gone
		where

his knees buckle as argon does not answer

					argon
		dr nebbleman we are scientists
		you and i and men of science are not
		concerned with emotions and
		opinions  we are concerned with
		facts

nebbleman is hyperventilating like a mouse caught in a
glue trap

					argon
		the fact is that the milk has been
		spilled and now we need you to tell
		us how to clean it up

					nebbleman
		cleaned up  it cant be cleaned up
		without the nanobot the waste cant
		be stabilized  thats what weve
		been trying to tell you  the only
		thing we can do is run  run  run

argon signals to poppy  poppy slaps nebbleman  nebbleman
is quiet

					argon
		facts dr nebbleman  facts
		youve been using cryogenics to
		control the waste from the mouse
		experiment havent you

					nebbleman
		well yes  the replicators are not
		as active at low temperatures

					argon
		then perhaps we can use liquid
		nitrogen to keep the meltdown under
		control

					nebbleman
		that might work

					argon
		poppy order the trucks from the
		gary plant  and were going to need
		a containment crew

					poppy
		a containment crew is going to
		attract a lot of attention

					argon
		youre right  place a call to our
		friends at the network and to mr
		joplin at the epa

					nebbleman
		how did this happen  how did the
		nanobot activate the assembler
		fluid  if im going to help i
		have to know what happened

argon studies nebbleman for a moment

					argon
		all right dr nebbleman  come with
		me and ill tell you everything

motoring his chair around argon leads nigel to the
conservatory

the elevator slides open and sim gets out leading a muddy
doby

					poppy
		mr sim did you find him

sim has obriens wad of clothes tucked under his arm

					sim
		no but if hes alive i think i know
		where he might go

he holds up the key to obriens hotel room the plastic
key chain stamped admiral hotel

int  admiral hotel  night

a muddy bare footprint black grime against green shag

we pull back and see another then another the tracks
leading toward the white light of the bathroom door

we close in on the bilious white of the steam the warble
of obrien whimpering and shivering even in the scalding
water

he begins to sneeze and cough as if something were
tickling the back of his throat  he snorts at it
inhaling through his nose trying to suck it out

finally he spits a clear siliconlike wad of phlegm that
remains connected to his mouth by a long rubbery strand

he spits at it and it stretches until he flicks it off
with his hand

it hangs on the wall for a moment like a sticky rubber
slug before being swept down the tub drain

int  susan brights lab

we rise through the floor drain

wearing a special insulated contamination suit nebbleman
is on hands and knees examining the lab floor

he lifts a hand and we see an impression that gradually
fades as if the ground were a sheet of foam

he slaps it hard and the tile ripples like a waterbed

					nebbleman
		oh god its worse than i thought

he runs for the door leaving a trail of footprints

					nebbleman
		get that crew in here  now

ext  argon lab  night

outside the lab a flurry of activity erupts

thick hoses are attached to the belly of giant tanker
trucks

brilliant portable kliegs illuminate the grounds like a
ball park

men in bulbous insulated space suits milk the tankers
filling scubalike canisters that are worn on their backs

the bold letters on the back of the tanker read  warning
 liquid nitrogen

slowly we move toward the o in nitrogen it opens in
front of us like a yawning tunnel which we descend into

int  admiral hotel room  day

obrien is in a deep sleep mouth wide open his breathing
rasped  turning his face deeper into his pillow he is
suddenly unable to breathe

he sucks for air with a strained gurgle  his eyes pop
open still suffocating and he bolts upright

we see that his neck has been twisted around like a
knotted sheet

his head spins around and snaps back into place

					obrien

		mommy

he is dizzy and confused  he rubs his head and neck
panic seeping into his expression as he begins to remember
last nights events

he looks down seeing the muddy footprints on the carpet

obrien touches his neck where he was injected

					obrien
		uh oh

suddenly the door whaps open sim and doby filling the
frame

					sim
		good morning mr obrien

still in his underwear obrien jumps from the bed

					obrien
		you  i remember you

					sim
		im real touched  now get your
		sundays on  were going for a
		ride

he throws obriens pants at him

					obrien
		what  im not going anywhere

					sim
		oh yes you are

					obrien
		i get it  youre the goon fetch
		boy  the zookeeper argon calls in
		when one of his guinea pigs gets
		loose

					sim
		thats right

sim opens his coat showing obrien his firearm

					sim
		only this aint no tranquilizer gun
		now lets go

					obrien
		forget it pissboy  you tell argon
		he can call my lawyer

sim reaches for his gun

					sim
		the hard way it is

obrien heaves a yellow pages at sim which sails past his
head  he leaps behind the coffee table

sim points the gun at obriens head

					sim
		not smart  you forgot ive got the
		gun

obrien on his toes keeps the table in between him and
sim

					obrien
		then lets see you use it bucko
		dr argons not going to take it
		very well that you killed his
		experiment

sim snorts

					sim
		okay  okay  doby

he waves doby to the other side of the table  but before
they can grab him obrien spins away from sim and bolts
for the window

he throws it open yelling

					obrien
		help  somebody help me

sim and doby tackle him from behind

					sim
		ill take care of this  hold him

sim raises his gun high into the air 

					sim
		lights out

and brings it down on obriens head  it rebounds off of
obriens skull which in turn rebounds off the floor

					obrien
		ow

sim raises it again

					sim
		i said  lights out

and again smashes obrien in the head to no effect

					obrien
		ouchhh  cut it out

sim looks at the gun then repeatedly brings a hail of
blows onto obrien whose head bounces off the gun and
floor like a dribbling basketball

obrien grabs his head as sim tires

					obrien
		jesus

panting sim holsters his gun

					sim
		get his legs

obrien lunges grabbing the window sill as the two men
each take a leg

					obrien
		no

they heave at his legs trying to wrench him from the sill
obriens body raises off the floor

struggling and straining with all of his might obrien
looks up to secure his grip and his eyes go wide

obriens arms have begun to stretch  he looks back over
his shoulder to see that his legs also have begun to
stretch

sim and doby seem to notice at the same time that they
have stretched obrien halfway to the door

					sim
		holy shit

the two men let go of obriens legs and he is flung like
a slingshot out of the room

					sim
		holy shit

he cartwheels in the space outside the window splayed and
flailing spastically

the people nine floors down scream as obrien plummets
toward them

obriens tearing eyes clamp shut in the face of onrushing
pavement a faint sound caught in his ear  an ascending
twang like a tightening guitar string

whump  obrien hits the ground unsure if hes alive of
dead

a woman screams

he rattles his head and opens his eyes  there is a woman
in front of him her face buried in her hands

obrien tries to stand

					obrien
		oh god  am i dead

hearing him the woman peers out from shielding fingers
she looks up at his arm and screams again

obrien is confused  slowly he turns following her gaze
up up up  his arm stretches up to the ninth story
window like a safety line his hand still gripping the
sill  his face contorts in horror

obrien screams letting go

loopy wet spaghetti strands collect on the sidewalk in a
pile as his arm falls  the crowd collectively inhales
the hand plops on the top of the pile like some strange
garnish

obrien whimpers

a car screeches to a stop and obrien jumps back at the
sound  as he lands his body jerking to the side his arm
suddenly begins reeling in like a fishing line

the crowds heads swivel back and forth watching the arm
snap back to normal in a loud whipcrack

					obrien
		oh god

he cradles the arm under the stare of the gapers block
chest heaving he stumbles back two steps

he shoots a look up at his apartment window  the shadows
of sim and doby look down

he bolts

int  admiral hotel room

sim and doby watch openmouthed as obrien disappears down
the street

					sim
		this is going to take some
		explaining

sim whips out his cellular phone and dials

					sim
		mrs argon  its sim

					poppy vo
		mr sim  do you have him  hes
		alive

					sim
		oh yeah hes alive  technically

					poppy vo
		and you have him

					sim
		we lost him

int  argons office

poppy sits atop the massive ebony slab of argons desk
the phone pressed to her ear

					poppy
		here you tell him

she smiles and hands the phone to argon

					argon
		mr sim you know i sooner kill the
		messenger then listen to bad news

int  admiral hotel room

sim swallows hard

					sim
		dont worry there dr argon  he
		gave us the slip in a manner of
		speaking  but were definitely
		closing in on him

doby frowns

					argon vo
		mr sim when you do locate him  do
		not scare him off again  just watch
		him  i think you can handle that
		right mr sim

					sim
		you got it dr argon

he hangs up

					sim
		shit

sim slams his hands on the desk and looks down to find the
pictures of dr bright a heart encircling it

					sim
		hello

ext  argon labs  day

we are looking through the lens of a local network news
camera on location outside argon labs  the camera rack
focuses and pans to network reporter spencer lamm

					spencer
		tawney im standing in front of the
		security station just outside of
		argon labs in calumet city  since
		seven oclock this morning when
		security guards barred the weekend
		staff here at argon labs rumors
		have been circulating as to the
		nature of the accident that occurred
		here last night

he looks over his shoulder as an unmarked tanker rolls
past the security gate

					spencer
		all we know for sure is that at
		930 am two sedans carrying the
		county sheriff and men who have been
		identified as highranking officials
		of the epa entered the argon
		offices and have not come out

int  susan brights brownstone

we pull back revealing the reporter on television in the
kitchen

					spencer vo
		we expect a statement some time
		today but until then we can only
		speculate that whatever did happen
		here which has crews working around
		the clock no one was prepared for
		this has been spencer lamm live at
		argon labs

susan drops her coffee cup when she hears the name  she
rushes to turn up the volume but the special report is
over

she is searching the other stations when someone pounds on
her door

through the peephole she sees obrien his face warped by
the wideangle lens

					susan
		oh shit

with the chain still on she opens the door

					obrien
		susie  you gotta help me

					susan
		daniel what are you doing here

					obrien
		please susan  i need help
		something is wrong with me

					susan
		sorry daniel im a physicist not
		a psychiatrist

					obrien
		no something is really wrong
		look

he stuffs his arms into the threeinch slot between the
door and the jamb then squeezes his body and head through

susan steps back her mouth falls open

					susan
		you you

she points at him then at the television

					obrien
		they did it to me

					susan
		the nanobot

as obrien spits the story out his gestures become more
animated

					obrien
		last night argons goons grabbed
		me the big one hit me probably did
		severe craniosacral damage and bam
		i drop to the floor and then argon
		was there and it became like a bad
		dream  everyone was laughing as he
		stuck this big needle in my neck and
		then im not sure what happened but
		i came to in a metal tank and they
		drowned me with white goo and i
		thought i was dead everything soft
		and blurry and the next thing i know
		i wake up back in my hotel and
		argons goons bust in and we fight
		and i fall out the window and again
		i thought i was a goner but i hit
		the ground and i bounce and i look
		up and my arm is really really long
		and i know i know i shouldnt have
		been in your lab but jesus christ
		susan feel my skin feel it  it
		feels like plastic

he reaches his arm across the room and she feels his hand

					susan
		 just like the mouse

					obrien
		mouse  what mouse

					susan
		my first organicpolymerization was
		a lab mouse

					obrien
		what happened to it

					susan
		i dont know

he jerks his hand away

					obrien
		you dont know

					susan
		it escaped from the lab before we
		could finish the experiment

					obrien
		but youve polymerized singlecelled
		bacteria and the fruit flies i know
		you have

					susan
		yes

					obrien
		then you must have at some point
		tried to reverse the procedure

she nods but it is not the kind of nod he was hoping for

					obrien
		oh no no no  youve got to be
		able to fix me  please susan tell
		me you can make me normal again

					susan
		once the subject was polymerized we
		were unable to reassemble the
		original organic structure

his legs go wobbly

					obrien
		oh god please  this cant be
		happening  i cant be plastic  a
		plastic man

					susan
		daniel

					obrien
		im a plastic man  a plastic man

she slaps him his chin flaps back and forth before
snapping into place

					susan
		we dont have time for hysterics

					obrien
		we dont

					susan
		what has happened to you is nothing
		compared to what is going to happen
		to calumet city if we dont hurry

int  kitchen

she hands him a glass of water and drops several pills
into his open palm

					obrien
		what are these

					susan
		mostly caffeine diuretics  help you
		go to the bathroom

					obrien
		why

					susan
		the nanobot is still inside you
		its programmed to exit through the
		urinary tract  we need it as soon
		as possible so swallow those

he stares at the gleaming plastic capsules

					obrien
		pills you know how i feel about
		pills

					susan
		if you dont want to do it this way
		i can remove it surgically

he gobbles them down

					obrien
		why do we need it

					susan
		the nanobot is the only thing that
		can stabilize the waste

					obrien
		what waste

int  argon labs  day

a blast of icy smoke coughs from the nozzle of a liquid
nitrogen pack

two men in their heavy insulated space suits work over the
broken chamber where obrien was polymerized dousing the
assembler waste with their liquid nitrogen hoses

the lab has become a winter wonderland

the lights have quit and the room is lit only by the green
and yellow fluoroglow sticks worn on the helmets of the
workers

the assembler waste covered in frost bubbles and churns
lavalike and the two men fire another burst of frozen
gas

frank tater crosses to the door his boots crunching on
the icy floor

int  hall

dr nigel nebbleman also wearing an insulated suit waits
for him

					nebbleman
		well frank

frank lifts his helmet

					frank
		ive never seen anything like it
		we cant get a handle on it

int  basement lab

it is in this poorlylit basement that dr bright does
most of her work

					susan
		to put is simply the nanobot inside
		you is a microscopic machine encoded
		with information like a strand of
		messenger rna that is programmed
		to synthesize your molecules with
		the polyisoprenes of the assembler
		fluid rebuilding your entire
		organic system on a molecular level

					obrien
		that was simple

she sighs

					susan
		the nanobot combined your molecules
		with the plastic molecules in the
		white assembler fluid so that on a
		molecular level you now have more in
		common with a good year tire than a
		human being

					obrien
		got it

					susan
		the problem is the byproduct
		created by the process

					obrien
		the waste

as they talk we move along a stainless steel table where
susan is conducting a series of tests with the waste

these tests reveal the stages of molecular deterioration
caused by the waste

					susan
		only part of the molecule from the
		assembler fluid bonds to your
		molecules  the part left over is a
		highly charged unstable molecule we
		call a replicator

she puts on a pair of protective gloves and grabs one of
the test cylinders

					susan
		the effect these replicators have on
		any matter organic or inorganic is
		similar to the molecular
		deterioration caused by nuclear
		radiation

the pressurized seal sighs open and she pours the contents
out

					susan
		ive been measuring the levels of
		deterioration  as with radiation
		the more exposure the more damage
		it does

a white egg rolls into her gloved palm

					susan
		i dropped a single replicator in
		with this egg two days ago

she hurls the egg at the ground and quite naturally at
this point it bounces back

he catches it  it squishes between his fingers like a
racquetball  he pulls at it  it stretches like silly
putty

					obrien
		its polymerized like me

she takes the egg back

					susan
		the replicators start off like
		assemblers but the replicators
		never stabilize

					obrien
		what happens

she opens another cylinder and pours it out  and oval
shaped wad of gray sludge splats onto the lid

					obrien
		that was an egg

					susan
		three days ago it was

					obrien
		what do these replicators do to
		people

					susan
		with enough exposure the same thing
		they do to everything else

he swallows hard watching the eggwad cling like snot
from the lid as she reseals the cylinder

ext  main gate  day

spencer lamm is on the scene which continues to escalate

					spencer
		here in calumet city a bomb has
		just dropped  through anonymous
		sources we have learned that argon
		labs may have been the victim of an
		attack by a radical environmentalist
		group  no such group has yet to
		claim responsibility but we are
		expecting confirmation of these
		rumors at a press conference
		scheduled this afternoon

int  lab

susan puts the cylinder of slime back into a large freezer
unit filled with similar cylinders

					obrien
		so right now theres little
		replicators spreading throughout
		argons lab

					susan
		thats right

					obrien
		isnt it already too late then

she shakes her head opening a final cylinder

					susan
		there is a fortyeight hour period
		during which the waste can be
		stabilized

the contents slide into her hand

					susan
		the nanobot will start a chain
		reaction and transform the
		replicators through a double
		hydrogen bond creating an ionic
		solid instead of a polymer

the egg seems fossilized half way to becoming the wad of
slime  she hands it to obrien  it is as fragile as a
glass spider web

					obrien
		yet another miracle of modern
		science

she ignores the sarcasm laced in that comment

					susan
		i think while were waiting we had
		better run some basic diagnostics on
		you

					obrien
		youre the doctor

ext  susan brights brownstone  day

across the street a dark lincoln ominously glides to a
stop

int  sims lincoln

sim settles back watching the building for any sign of
obrien

					sim
		now we wait

both he and doby are licking ice cream cones  for a
moment it is the only sound in the car

					sim
		darn good cone

int  basement

obrien is sitting on a table his shirt off while susan
listens to his lungs with a stethoscope

					susan
		breathe deep

the air rushes out

					susan
		lungs sound fine  you didnt have
		any preexisting physical
		conditions did you  allergies
		infections

					obrien
		no why

she removes the stethoscope and grabs the light scope

					susan
		my theory is that during the
		polymerization the nanobot should
		correct any malformed or defective
		molecules  open

his mouth stretches impossibly wide for an amazing view of
the glands at the back of his throat

looks fine

					susan
		that theory is the reason argon has
		been pushing me to test the second
		nanobot  he believes its the only
		thing that will save him

she picks up a hypodermic needle

					susan
		id like to run a few sample blood
		tests to get an idea of how stable
		your condition is

obrien is beginning to bounce a bit the caffeine pumping
through his veins

					obrien
		okay  sure  youre the doc

tearing open a needle package she inserts it into the
plastic hypo

					susan
		hold still

she fights to poke the needle through his resilient skin

when the sliver of metal pops through tiny superball
bubbles of blood bounce into the cartridge like pingpong
balls in a bingo machine

					susan
		amazing

she fills another cartridge when he begins to chatter his
rubbery teeth vibrating against each other

					susan
		is something wrong

					obrien
		no no i just feel wired

his whole body begins to twitch and ripple

					susan
		its probably the caffeine

suddenly he realizes he has to go to the bathroom

					obrien
		whoa  whoa  i gotta go  right
		now

she slips the needle out and he bolts off the table

					susan
		wait

she grabs a glass beaker as his hand shoots back and snags
it

int  bathroom

he bursts in fumbles with the beaker and his zipper then
lets it rip

					obrien
		ahhh

his eyes close as we hear him filling the beaker  it is a
strange sound more like a solid than a liquid

the sound bothers him and he looks down  what he sees
terrifies him

int  basement lab

susan is looking into a microscope at the blood samples
when he comes tearing down the stairs

					obrien
		susan

					susan
		what  whats wrong

he throws the beaker onto the table as if it were
contagious

					obrien
		look at this

					susan
		what about it

he sticks a stirring rod into it and pulls it out  the
contents are extremely viscous like rubber cement  a
wispy strand dangles from the end of the stick

					obrien
		just look at it

					susan
		the polymerization probably
		synthesized into a kind of methyl
		cyanoacrylate  so whats wrong

he looks as if he is about to cry

					obrien
		thats not biodegradable

she cant stop herself from laughing

					obrien
		oh yeah real funny  yukyuk
		lets laugh at everything a man
		believes in

					susan
		im sorry daniel but you have to
		admit its pretty ironic that you of
		all people would be the first man
		ever polymerized  its got to mean
		something

					obrien
		means  oh no  we wont know what it
		means until the end of the story and
		maybe then it wont seem quite as
		funny to you doctor frankenstein

the smile disappears

					susan
		whats that supposed to mean

					obrien
		just giving credit where credit is
		due

					susan
		you have no one to blame but
		yourself

					obrien
		blame the victim

					susan
		victim my ass  you stole my
		security key and used it to break
		into my lab to do who knows what
		kind of damage  maybe this is the
		end of the story and you finally got
		what you deserved

					obrien
		this is what i deserve for trying to
		protect the world from a madman and
		his mercenary physicists

					susan
		youre not protecting the world
		youre obstructing progress

					obrien
		i dont consider uncontrollable
		toxic waste progress

					susan
		and im sure you thought columbus
		was going to sail off the edge of
		the world

					obrien
		but lo and behold he found another
		world that progress could
		annihilate

					susan
		come on i dont see you living in a
		cave

					obrien
		and i dont see you sunbathing at
		chernobyl

she stops first smiling caught by an odd sense of deja
vu  he smiles feeling the same thing

					susan
		just like old times

					obrien
		yeah  old times

there is an awkward silence

					obrien
		i want you to know that i really
		appreciate you helping me

					susan
		im glad you came to me for help

they arent sure what to do

					obrien
		i feel very emotional right now  a
		bit out of control

					susan
		probably the caffeine

					obrien
		do you have something to bring me
		down

					susan
		no problem

int  argons office

john joplin highranking epa official listens as dr
nebbleman tries to explain what has happened

argon and poppy are also in the office

					nebbleman
		the nanobot is a molecular machine
		it uses the assembler fluid to
		polymerize a whole system of carbon
		based molecules as in say a human
		body

his eyes shift nervously to argon who nods encouragingly

					nebbleman
		once its complete the waste from
		the assembler fluid is left
		destabilized with groups of highly
		charged attractors capable of
		bonding to any carbon molecule
		exposed for a long enough period

					joplin
		hold on son  are you saying that
		they can bond to people

					nebbleman
		with enough exposure it appears
		they can bond to anything

					joplin
		well what will they do to people

nebbleman glances nervously at argon

					nebbleman
		well at this time i mean that is
		to say it is difficult to
		project 

					argon
		look john nobody wants to find out
		what happens  thats why youre
		here  we need your help on this one
		and thats why that suitcase is
		here

poppy opens it for him  the root of all evil  stacks and
stacks of it

					joplin
		let me assure you dr argon the
		epa is as always on your side

int  susans living room

it is later

obrien is stretched out on the sofa in a valium fugue
his long supple limbs conform to the curves of the
cushions dangling over all sides

his head is on the floor neck distending down from the
arm rest

midsnore he wakes up yawning

from his upside down view he sees the refrigerator

					obrien
		 food

int  basement lab

susan is looking through a microscope trying to find the
nanobot

					susan
		come on where are you

int  kitchen

obrien opens the fridge

rubbernecking he looks inside while his body lies on the
couch

					obrien
		hey susie  im hungry

int  basement lab

she is still glued to the microscope

					susan
		damn it

she pounds her fist against the lab table

					obrien os
		uh oh  i remember that temper

					susan
		daniel i didnt hear you come
		down

she turns and finds his head almost floating perched on
his neck arching erectly up the stairs

					obrien
		whats wrong

					susan
		the nanobot its not here

					obrien
		its still inside me

she nods watching his head bobbing cobralike around her

					susan
		youll have to start drinking
		fluids lots of fluids

she reaches out and touches his neck  he smiles

					susan
		how far can you stretch

					obrien
		i dont know

ext  susans backyard  day

standing in the square of rich green grass obrien looks
up

he lifts his head and takes a deep breath staring at his
fingers spread against the blue expanse above him

					susan
		go ahead  reach as high as you can

from above his hand we see obrien nod nervously and
begin to reach 

his face dr bright the square lawn the house one by
one seem to fall away 

spreading out under the hand until the ground seems like
the sky did moments ago

int  sims lincoln

sim and doby lean into the front windshield of the black
lincoln watching obriens arm telescope into the sky

					sim
		thats why i love the security biz
		just when you think youve seen
		everything

he whips out his cellular  dials

ext  susans backyard

dr bright stares openmouthed at the armribbon as it
rises impossibly like a kite

she turns and sees obriens body thinning almost
spooling out like a ball of yarn until his pants fall down
to his ankles

he feels the draft and turns to see her looking at him

					obrien
		oops

he grabs his pants as his arm returns with a rushing sound
that ends with a loud rubbery clap

					obrien
		ill end up back in jail for
		indecent exposure

dr bright nods vaguely already lost in thought

					obrien
		what

she reaches out and feels his hair

int  basement lab

a scalpel saws through several strands of obriens hair

					susan
		that should do it

his hair is shorter and she drops the strands with the
rest of it into a ziploc bag

					susan
		im going to go out for a while  i
		want to take the blood samples to a
		lab that has the equipment i need

					obrien
		what did you want my hair for

					susan
		something else i want to try

she puts the ziploc bag in her briefcase and gets the
blood samples

					obrien
		i could go with you

					susan
		i think it would be better for me to
		go alone  im sure sim is looking
		for you  just sit tight  ill bring
		you back a pizza

					obrien
		no cheese

					susan
		i was hoping you were over that
		remember to keep drinking fluids

int  limo

poppy argon and john joplin are inside as it pulls up
outside cook county courthouse

					poppy
		how do i look

she is dressed in a twopiece pvc business suit smart yet
slutty  argon smiles

					argon
		positively paradoxical

int  susans living room

obrien is stretched out on the couch watching the itchy
and scratchy show on the television

he is drinking a two liter bottle of coke without
stopping  his adams apple bobs like a cartoon as he
swallows

we can hear the coke fizzing in his distending stomach
it swells like a water balloon

finishing the bottle he tosses it into a garbage bag
filled with empties

he lets out a super hero style belch then settles back
chuckling at the cartoon

itchy gets a frying pan to the face

on the table there is a vase filled with dried flowers
he empties it and with the vase walks over to the hall
mirror

slowly he forces the vase over his head

when he yanks it off his head keeps the shape  he starts
to laugh and his face pops back

there is a series of gurgling sounds from his stomach as
he realizes he has to go

he bolts for the bathroom his hand whipping out for the
beaker

same  bit later

hes finished and he sets the beaker back where it was
he thinks and mumbles

					obrien
		technically i dont even have to
		go to the bathroom

we move closer and closer to the beaker through the glass
into the golden fluid 

shrinking as we move through the murk down to the
molecular level where we squeeze between chains of
elastomers 

and find the nanobot

int  cook county courthouse

the press room is small considering the sizable horde
that is packed wall to wall shoulder to shoulder to see
ceo poppy argon and the epa deliver their statements

the white noise of press chatter reaches a fevered pitch
as the county sheriff leads poppy argon and several epa
officials in

john joplin steps to the podium and the crowd noise dies

he leans into the bouquet of microphones opening his
statement

					joplin
		good afternoon  the intent of

a man shouts from the crowd

					man
		who are you

					joplin
		oh  im john joplin special
		investigator for the epa  the
		intent of this press conference is
		twofold  number one to affirm that
		there has been a slight chemical
		spill at argon labs  cleanup is
		already under way

flashbulbs burst

					joplin
		and number two that the epa in
		conjunction with members of illinois
		county sheriff department and the
		fbi have concluded that the spill
		was not accidental

the press begins to titter and joplin raises his voice

					joplin
		last night argon labs was the
		target of what can only be described
		as a terrorist act

another barrage of flashes

					joplin
		the single assailant sabotaged
		certain chemical storage units
		creating the toxic spill

					man
		are there any suspects

					joplin
		the only thing i can say is that the
		perpetrator was photographed by
		argon security cameras  the rest of
		the details of the case until a
		later time will be kept in the
		highest confidentiality  thank you

the press erupts  who was it  was it a group  have you
identified him

joplins eyebrows go up and he turns back to the podium

					joplin
		oh yeah  his names daniel
		obrien

the entourage begins to file out under a barrage of
questions  spencer lamm fights to get his crew in front
of poppy

					spencer
		mrs argon do you have anything to
		say to this obrien character

poppy looks at the mic several others surrounding it

					poppy
		all i can say is that when these
		radicals act outside the law
		recklessly endangering the
		environment and human lives it
		clearly demonstrates that they are
		the menace and we are the victims

int  susans living room

the television is on though muted

we hear obrien grunting and the sound of sweaty rubber
rubbing against rubber

the door opens and susan enters a pizza box in one hand
briefcase in the other

					susan
		daniel

as she enters she notices something is different about
the furniture  there is a second fleshcolored love
seat

obriens head suddenly pops up

					obrien
		surprise

his head rises from the top of the back

					susan
		thats pretty good

					obrien
		getting used to it

he starts to get up becoming human the round padded seat
swelling into buttocks when he realizes he is naked

					obrien
		whoa

he pops back to a chair

					susan
		dont worry i got just what you
		need

a leg of the chair shoots out as he grabs his underwear
from the pile of clothes

susan sets the pizza down and opens her briefcase

					susan
		i have a friend at a textile lab
		she helped me

the obrien chair pulls the underwear up over the front
two legs covering the cushion as he stands changing back
to normal

					susan
		tada

she holds up a tiny red suit that looks big enough for a
gi joe doll

					obrien
		whats that

					susan
		its a crime fighting costume what
		do you think  its underwear so if
		you lose your clothes youll still
		be decent

					obrien
		thats going to fit me

					susan
		like a glove

he pulls at it  it stretches easily

					obrien
		you made this out of my hair

					susan
		sort of  we used a process similar
		to the vulcanization of rubber and
		added bulk with a chain of
		chloroprene elastomers

he shakes his head

					obrien
		i bet you still kill at scrabble

she smiles

					susan
		go on try it on  oh wait

she reaches back into her bag

					susan
		there was some extra so i made
		these

in her palm are two little red boots

					obrien
		cute

as he crosses to the bathroom we see the television is
again updating the crisis at argon labs

					susan
		did you go

					obrien
		on the counter

she grabs the sample heading immediately for the
basement when the television catches her eye

int  bathroom

obrien crams one foot in and then the other  the
material stretches miraculously

					obrien
		groovy

int  susans living room

obrien bounds out of the bathroom

					obrien
		in brightest day nor darkest
		night  no evil shall escape my
		sight

susan is silent in front of the tv the sound now on  she
is still holding the beaker

					obrien
		what is it

he moves around her and sees his own face on the screen

it is the black and white photo of him about to sneeze

at the bottom of the screen is the title voice of dr
warren wertham

					dr wertham vo
		 an extremely volatile individual
		given to emotional outbursts

					obrien
		wertham  thats no good

					susan
		who is he

					obrien
		the head shrinker at the prison

					dr wertham vo
		 paranoid delusions and prone to
		hero fantasies all of which are
		characteristic of a form of
		infantile dementia

					obrien
		ha  what a crock  he couldnt be
		more wrong could he

she says nothing

					obrien
		i said could he

the sneeze picture shrinks to an insert over the anchor
woman tawney towers shoulder

					tawney vo
		once again at this time
		authorities continue their statewide
		manhunt for the man believed
		responsible for the situation
		developing at argon labs  as
		reports come in news center 5 will
		continue to update you

susan cuts it off

					susan
		oh no  theyre trying to blame you
		for the accident  that means they
		must not have been able to control
		the replicators

					obrien
		i cant go back to jail  i gotta
		get out of here

					susan
		youre not going back to jail  all
		we need to do is find the nanobot
		once the meltdown is under control
		then we deal with argon 

suddenly the front door explodes open the jamb easily
splintering under dobys girth

doby and sim barrel in pistols pointing

					susan
		what in the hell

					sim
		pipe down brain lady  and you

the gun sweeps toward obrien

					sim
		id curb that monkey business
		lessin you want to find out if that
		rubber skin of yours is bulletproof
		now keep your hands where i can see
		them

he notices the urine sample

					sim
		whats that

susan doesnt miss a beat

					susan
		lemonade  do you want some

she offers him the beaker  sim considers it

					sim
		no thanks

back to business

					sim
		put it down and lets go  someone
		wants to talk to you

he waves them out the front door as she sets the beaker on
the counter

ext  susan brights brownstone

the black limo fires up as the foursome approach  sim
opens the back door for obrien and dr bright

					sim
		get in

int  limo

in the artificial coolness daniel obrien sits with
icarus argon across from poppy susan and dr nebbleman
in the rear window we see sims lincoln follow

poppy brandishes a chrome revolver from her handbag

argon smiles in the shady light makeup covering the more
abrasive features of his spotty skin

					argon
		my apologies to you both for the
		rather rude invitation but i had to
		see you  and dr bright your
		house isnt

he motions to his blanketdraped legs

					argon
		wheelchair accessible

					susan
		dr argon i demand an explanation

					obrien
		i can explain it  attempted murder
		wasnt enough for him  he wants to
		add kidnapping to the charges

					argon
		if youd like we can go straight to
		the authorities  i understand they
		are very interested in talking to
		you

obriens only response is to grind his teeth in silence

					argon
		we havent been properly introduced
		mr obrien  i am icarus argon

he offers his hand taking obriens

he closes his eyes beginning to caress obriens hand
between the withered brown flesh of his own

					argon
		do you know how i made my first
		fortune  poly vinyl chloride
		pvc  it was almost thirty years
		ago when i first held a credit card
		in my hands  there was something
		about the way it felt  i told
		myself paper was doomed  this was
		the future

he looks at obriens hand lets go

					argon
		 plastic

					obrien
		wow that is one moving story  take
		it easy on my heart strings  now i
		really feel guilty complaining about
		you shooting me up with your poison

					argon
		poison  im surprised at you  you
		lack vision mr obrien

					obrien
		youre lacking a few things too
		ethics morals common decency and
		oh yeah deodorant

argon smiles  his coolness irritates obrien

					argon
		look at me mr obrien  i once
		competed for mr universe but now i
		am reduced to this a withered
		shell  a prison of rot

he leans into obrien

					argon
		people ask me what i did to myself
		i answer what didnt i do  i
		treat me body like i treat the rest
		of the world as a force to be
		controlled  most people believe
		there is something sacred about the
		human body about nature  they are
		the same fools who thought the
		world was flat

obrien smirks

					argon
		the body is just another part of
		nature and ever since we gave up
		trees for central air there has
		been nothing sacred about nature
		nature is the enemy mr obrien
		and science is our greatest weapon
		against her

					obrien
		you egomaniacs make me laugh
		natures going to bury you like she
		buries everyone else

argon laughs

					argon
		not anymore mr obrien  the
		nanobot has changed that

					susan
		if you think i would ever give you
		the nanobot after this you are
		deluding yourself

					argon
		you dont have to give it to us
		because dr nebbleman can just cut
		it out of him

					obrien
		ha  morons  its not even in me
		anymore

everyone reacts

					argon
		what

before obrien can say anything else susan slaps her hand
over his mouth

					nebbleman
		she could have given him something
		to stimulate his kidneys

					argon
		dr nebbleman take care of them

argon grabs the car phone while nebbleman removes a loaded
syringe from a black case

					argon
		mr sim i want you to return to dr
		brights  i believe she is hiding
		something of ours there

					susan
		no

we see the lincoln turn off the highway

					susan
		daniel do something

with eye blurring speed obriens arm rockets out as he
grabs for the needle  nebbleman screams as obriens hand
molds over his own

poppy wheels on obrien as nebbleman falls screaming
wrestling against his own hand

before she can raise the gun dr bright lunges grappling
for control

the gun fires wildly

					argon
		no

the bullet ricochets around the cabin before embedding in
the seat cushion in between nebblemans legs

obrien pushes the hypo plunger down squirting the
sedative in nebblemans face  nebbleman screams

					susan
		daniel go  ill be all right  get
		the nanobot

he nods yanking the door handles but they are locked

he glances quickly around the limo then dives at the rear
seat body thinning flattening into the crack where the
seat meets the back 

leaving poppy clinging to his empty clothes as he
disappears from the cabin

nebbleman can hardly catch his breath

					nebbleman
		where did he go

					argon
		the trunk

as soon as the words pass argons reptilian lips there is
a click and the trunk opens behind them

					argon
		ott shake him

ext  limo

obrien stands and the limo begins to zigzag hard on the
open expressway

argon smiles through the small rear window as obrien
tries to keep his balance

					obrien
		here goes nothing

obrien throws an arm at a passing truck going in the
opposite direction seizing hold of it 

slinging himself like a rubber band 

into the air tucking his knees to his chest bracing
himself  he becomes 

a red comet that crashes into an oncoming cadillac caving
in its hood and rebounding into the air soaring over a row
of homes

a rumpled heap he lands heavily in a plot of backyard
bushes

					obrien
		ow

he stumbles to his feet shaking away the cobwebs

					obrien
		damn

his teeth grit  muscles flex

obriens pov

rockets into the air 

shooting straight up racing forward bounding over power
lines and rooftops

int  limo

order has been somewhat restored

poppy presses the barrel of her pistol into dr brights
midsection

dr nebbleman is still redfaced from the physical
exertion  his glasses begin to fog and he cleans them
with his kerchief

the phones rings

					nebbleman
		yes

					sim vo
		its sim  were almost there

					nebbleman
		mr sim watch out  obrien escaped
		and could be on his way

ext  apartment building backyard

two small children are playing in their sandbox

suddenly a red foot stomps down between them the thin
leg stretching up into the sky  it rocks forward and
pushes off and away

the two kids stare at each other blankly

ext  susan brights brownstone

sim and doby head for the front door sim still on his
cellular phone

					sim
		you want to tell me what im looking
		for

					nebbleman
		ive only been invited to her house
		once but i know there is a basement
		lab that she uses for private
		research

					sim vo
		okay

					susan
		you were never invited to my house

					nebbleman
		youre looking for a urine sample

					sim vo
		bingo

ext  susan brights brownstone

sim stares toward the basement when out of the corner of
his eye he notices 

					nebbleman vo
		the fluid should be murky yellow in
		color and extremely viscous

the beaker of lemonade

int  city street

obrien grabs the top of a building and he vaults over as
though hopping a fence

int  susan brights brownstone

sim inspects the beaker as if he might taste it  he takes
a whiff

					sim
		wait a minute  this aint no
		lemonade

int  limo

susan glares at nebbleman

					sim vo
		whats it smell like

					nebbleman
		smell  uh something like
		methylcyanoacrylate

					sim vo
		like crazy glue

					nebbleman
		yes  thats it  hes got it  oh
		god hes got it

ext  susan brights brownstone

obrien watches from behind a light post as sim and doby
cross from susans walk to the lincoln

he slinks down among the row of parked cars and edges out
toward the street

the black lincoln starts toward us getting bigger filling
our vision then passes over 

and we see obrien clinging to the chassis like a rubbery
max cady

ext  calumet city  day

the afternoon sun has started its descend over the
industrial landscape  tongues of exhaust flame lick up at
the orange popsicle sky

ext  main gate

the black limousine eases through the gate against the
swell of media

the steel garage door rattles down like a modern
portcullis

int  argon labs

the barrelshaped limo driver helps argon into his
wheelchair

					poppy
		gently ott  gently

					argon
		dr nebbleman i want to know the
		moment the nanobot arrives  the
		instant understand

					nebbleman
		of course sir

					susan
		dr argon i know you want to use
		the nanobot on yourself but you
		mustnt  the situation is critical
		right now  the replicators are
		growing exponentially  if we wait
		much longer it will be too late
		you have to use the nanobot to stop
		the meltdown

					argon
		dr bright i dont have to do
		anything

					susan
		but in another twentyfour hours the
		core meltdown will be beyond the
		stabilization period  there will be
		no way to stop it

					argon
		to be brutally honest with you
		susan as long as the nanobot does
		to me what it did to that idiot
		obrien i dont give a rats ass
		about what happens after that

the sincerity of his smile unnerves her

					susan
		you cant mean that

					argon
		come with me susan  i want to show
		you something

int  argons office

the elevators open and poppy argon and susan get out

					argon
		something to drink dr bright

					susan
		no thank you

					argon
		youll forgive me but all the
		excitement has left me extremely
		parched  poppy

poppy gets him a cocacola while susan notices the statue
of argon

					argon
		a monument to my past  i much
		prefer the future  come

int  conservatory

the moist air envelops them as they enter

					argon
		this is my garden  few people have
		seen it because it means so much to
		me  i am hoping as a fellow
		scientist you can appreciate it

it is a botanical nightmare  huge sealed tanks feature
bizarre plantlife bred and genetically engineered
indiscriminately like a blind man pairing a sock drawer

susan moves onto the yellow brick lane a look of horror
wrinkling her face

					argon
		gardener

a man in a green jump suit looks up  this is the
gardener  he is never without his red sprayer tank slung
over his shoulder and is always wearing an old snouted gas
mask

					argon
		would you excuse us

he disappears as the three start down the path

					argon
		every species every organism is the
		only one of its kind created
		through crossbreeding or chemical
		and radioactive mutation as well as
		genetic manipulation

inside atmospherically controlled tanks life exists where
it should not  translucent palmy ferns bask beneath a
deadly drizzle of acid rain  crystalline cacti flourish
around the soft glow of a radioactive isotope

					argon
		i spend more time here than anywhere
		else nurturing them treating them
		because they all require very
		special care

he gazes into a sealed geranium at a single flower with
petals the color of a dead fish  it is being fed drops of
photophorescent paste from tubes that hang like ivs

					argon
		poppy calls them my children and i
		suppose thats how i feel  that i
		have given birth to all of them and
		there is nothing as precious or as
		beautiful as ones own children

poppy smiles at him as they stop in front of a tank where
seamonkeylike creatures titter and play inside their
toxic solarium

					argon
		we will always love most that which
		we create  dont you agree susan

					susan
		does that mean oppenheimer loved the
		atomic bomb

she cant believe that she just used an obrien line

					argon
		more than he would ever admit  his
		child changed the world  what could
		make a parent more proud than that

int  argon labs

the black lincoln glides into the garage

the door closes behind them and the car eases into the
parking place the cement block in front of the car reads
dt sim chief of security

from under the car we see the feet of sim and doby sweep
by then disappear as the two men enter the lobby of argon
tower

obrien drops to the ground from the lincolns drive shaft
letting out a string of whispered expletives

int  conservatory

argon slurps from the cocacola watching susan

					argon
		i brought you up here dr bright
		because i want you to understand
		that we are on the path  the only
		difference is that you are walking
		with your head down afraid to look
		up to see where the path is going

					susan
		i suppose you are going to tell me
		where it is going

					argon
		i ask you what is the purpose of
		science  what is the point of all
		our relentless exploration
		investigation and experimentation
		it is to understand a single
		physical phenomenon or to
		understand them all  to cure one
		disease or to cure every disease
		if science is simply a means what
		then is the end

his wheelchair clicks and hums toward her

					argon
		look up  look above you susan and
		tell me what you see

she looks up through the glass roof of the conservatory at
the sootstained sky

					susan
		pollution

					argon
		do you know what i see  i see man
		making his own clouds  i see man
		coloring his own sky and like this
		garden it is a site that makes my
		heart sing

he licks his lips

					argon
		this is our world susan and once
		you realize that you will
		understand that the only place our
		path can end is on the throne of
		heaven  science is the quest for
		divine perfection

					susan
		how do you know were not heading in
		the wrong direction

					argon
		i look behind us i look to the
		past to a world steeped in rot and
		decay  i think of the acropolis in
		another century reduced to little
		more than dust  i see the faces of
		rushmore eventually losing all
		distinction and then i look at
		this

he cradles the plastic bottle of cocacola

					argon
		and i imagine it in a thousand years
		as perfectly shaped as the day it
		was made

he smiles at her

					argon
		i find that thought exceptionally
		reassuring

nebbleman burst through the glass doors

					nebbleman
		theyre here  theyre here  we
		have the nanobot

					argon
		excellent  how long until the
		assembler tank is complete

nebblemans glasses steam up from the humidity as he
stumbles toward them

					nebbleman
		dr makeo is working on it now sir
		i estimate at least another six
		hours

					argon
		in the meantime why dont you find
		something useful for dr bright to
		do

					susan
		i swear to you argon if you dont
		stop the meltdown that nanobot will
		be the last one i ever build

					argon
		susan i sense you are having
		difficulty understanding the
		situation you are presently in  i
		ask that you keep in mind that i am
		ready to reduce an entire city to
		gelatin to get what i want

susan notices the guards posted at the door

					argon
		if i were you id be careful about
		making promises that you will be
		unable to keep

his smile is as subtle as a knife point

int  hall gallery

obrien sneaks ever so silently edging toward the door at
the opposite end

the walls are covered with an impressive collection by
artists like dali picasso and bacon picturelit
dramatically

as he nears the end he suddenly hears voices moving
toward him  he jumps back searching for a place to hide

two armed guards enter

					guard 1
		who are we supposed to be looking
		for

					guard 2
		some guy in red underwear

they do not notice the bizarre red portrait hanging on the
wall

					guard 1
		how are we supposed to know the color
		of his underwear

int  hall

a guard is posted outside susans room

int  susans room

scientific equipment is piled in a room that looks like a
guest bedroom

awkwardly filling the center of the room is a long
industrial freezer unit

nebbleman and susan are alone

					nebbleman
		these samples were taken from the
		surrounding area  all the pertinent
		information is on disk

nebbleman lifts the lid cold air puffing out spilling
over the freezers edge

					nebbleman
		what we need to know is expansion
		rates how soon the replicators will
		reach the edge of the compound

inside there are several normallooking objects taken from
the lab including a metal stool a microscope and several
glass beakers

she stares at him numbly

					susan
		i dont believe this is happening

					nebbleman
		susan dr argon is giving you an
		opportunity here

					susan
		opportunity

that snaps her up

					susan
		theres a guard outside my door
		im a prisoner nigel  do you
		understand that

					nebbleman
		dr argon would say we are all
		prisoners

					susan
		argon is a lunatic  i cant believe
		i was stupid enough to believe i
		could control him  you heard what
		he said nigel  he doesnt care if
		all of calumet city is turned to
		jello  how can that not affect
		you

					nebbleman
		because i am a new man susan  i am
		a man of vision  your problem
		susan is that youre always looking
		down  if youd just look up youd
		see the big picture and in the big
		picture men of vision do not dwell
		on what might be lost  they focus
		on what can be gained

					susan
		is that what argon told you

					nebbleman
		no  well not those exact words

					susan
		nigel cant you see hes using you

					nebbleman
		of course he is but at least there
		isnt a security guard outside my
		door

					susan
		youre afraid of him

					nebbleman
		who isnt

her eyes narrow

					susan
		daniel obrien

int  hall

obrien tiptoes past an intersecting hall when he
hears 

					security
		hey

obrien freezes

					security
		hey you

the security man is a hundred feet away but before he can
even get his gun out 

obriens arm shoots down the hall a huge hand
reaching 

covering the security mans entire head before he is able
to scream

the hand is like a plastic bag over his head that he cant
get free of until he finally blacks out

obrien lays him down gently  his arm snaps back and he
tiptoes away

int  susans room

nebbleman smirks cleaning his glasses

					nebbleman
		im not interested in being a hero
		susan  im not interested in self
		delusion and romantic sentiment

he puts his glasses back on

					nebbleman
		im a scientist  i have lived my
		whole life by the diagnostic
		application of fact and the fact is
		argon is going to get whatever he
		wants so if i were you id give it
		to him

					susan
		you mean the designs for the
		nanobot  you think after this im
		going to give them to him

					nebbleman
		i think that either youre going to
		give them to him or hes going to
		make you give them to him

					susan
		make me  how  you think hes going
		to torture me

nebbleman shrugs

					nebbleman
		i would

he smiles and that makes it worse

					susan
		get out  get out now before i hurt
		you

nebbleman stammers before scurrying for the door

int  hall

obrien is searching different rooms stuffing his head
between door and jamb calling susan in a hushed
voice

the elevator at the end of the hall opens and he hears the
electric whine of argons wheelchair together with the tap
of poppys stiletto heels

he presses himself flat against the nearest door

					poppy
		do you think she will give us the
		designs

					argon
		eventually  these things are always
		a matter of leverage

					poppy
		and you think obrien is that
		leverage

					argon
		that remains to be seen

obrien peeks out and sees that they are heading straight
at him

					poppy
		and you still believe hes going to
		come here

					argon
		based on what we know of him that
		would seem inevitable

					poppy
		do you think she loves him

					argon
		she must feel something for him
		after all she and i did create him

it seems they are about to see him but when they reach the
double doors obrien is gone

she throws open the door and he follows her into 

int  poppys bedroom

everything is red pvc gleaming like patent leather

					poppy
		do you think she loves him like i
		love you

it is a womans question and it annoys him

					argon
		poppy are you in one of your moods
		again

					poppy
		no icky this is real

she closes the doors behind them

					poppy
		ive been thinking a lot since this
		all started  thinking about us

uninterested in the direction of the conversation argon
notices that there are two identical ottomans

					poppy
		you know how i feel about you  you
		know how much i need you  how much
		i trust you  i would do anything
		for you

					argon
		why are there two ottomans

					poppy
		icarus please  this is important

she sees him staring at the ottoman and steps up onto it
heels gouging into the padding

the ottoman gurgles

					poppy
		look at me icarus  look at my
		body  ive done everything changed
		anything you asked me to  we will
		always love most that which we
		create  is that still true

					argon
		yes  yes of course it is

					poppy
		then you still love me

					argon
		poppy please just tell me what you
		want

she steps down and kneels close to the wheelchair

					poppy
		i want to know what will happen if
		the nanobot works on you become like
		obrien a plastic man  what will
		happen to me

he realizes what she is asking

					argon
		you want to be polymerized

timidly she looks up into his eyes

					poppy
		plastic means forever doesnt it

his smile is like a razorcut lips slowly widening

					argon
		that it does my dear  that it
		does

she smiles until he pulls away and begins wheeling out

					poppy
		icarus

					argon
		i promise my dear i will give the
		matter some consideration

					poppy
		consideration

					argon
		if you honestly trust me then
		youll have to trust me

he closes the door

angry she turns away looking for something to hit  she
picks up a hairbrush instead and begins violently brushing
her hair in the vanity mirror

behind her in the mirror we see the ottoman scurry
mouselike to the closest door

int  bathroom

obrien stands up in agony holding his back where her
heels dug in

a clattering noise draws him to the door  he peeks out
just as she pulls down the zipper on her dress

shrugging out of the sleeves she walks toward the
bathroom

obrien searches the room where the bedroom was red the
bathroom is completely white

there is nowhere to hide except 

the toilet  he climbs in as the door opens  she drops
her dress and kicks off her shoes

as she moves to the tub obriens hand reaches up and
pulls the flush

she hears the toilet flush looks at it wiggles the
handle

int  susans room

susan is moving around the room thinking

in her gloved hands is the glass beaker which she is
wringing nervously wadding crinkling and pulling at it
so intensely it sounds like popping bubble wrap

she looks at the windows and at the black steel bars
outside

we rise above her moving toward the chandelier toward
the single light bulb that is apparently burned out

until we can see into the grayish glass and find the tip
of the fiber optic cable

int  security booth  close on monitor

as if looking through a window down into susans room

					sim os
		ubi ubiqu ubiqu

wider angle

sim is reading from a dictionary

					sim
		ubiquitous  present or seeming to
		be present everywhere at the same
		time omnipresent

he looks up

					sim
		i like that

int  pipes

obrien zips through the intersecting elbowing maze of
pipes

int  bathroom

another toilet seat peeks open  the room is empty
obrien climbs out

he grabs a towel drying himself as he quietly cracks open
the door

when he sees susan at the desk he cant believe his luck

					obrien
		susan

she nearly jumps out of her skin

					susan
		daniel

they rush to each others arms

					susan
		i dont believe it  youre here
		oh thank god

					obrien
		you didnt think i could just leave
		you

					susan
		i didnt know what was going to
		happen  i was just so worried
		something was going to happen to
		you

					obrien
		what could happen  im the plastic
		man remember

she remembers argon

					susan
		oh no  argon  we have to stop him
		before he uses the nanobot  we have
		to get the nanobot

					obrien
		where is it

					susan
		argons private lab

					obrien
		lets go

they start for the door when susan whispers

					susan
		wait  theres a guard

obrien almost laughs

					obrien
		hell never know what hit him

he grabs the handle and throws open the door

susan cant see what he sees but she knows by his
reaction its not good

					sim
		saviorfaire is everywhere

obrien backs up into the room pushed by a very large
gun

					sim
		i am mr ubiquitous aint i
		obrien

doby enters behind sim with several heavilyarmed guards

					sim
		you know what ubiquitous means
		dont you  it means here we go
		again

sim laughs very loudly as argon wheels in poppy at his
side

					argon
		welcome to my home mr obrien  as
		you can see weve been expecting
		you

sim laughs again

					obrien
		this is wonderfully accommodating of
		you all  now i wont have to come
		looking for you

					sim
		you were looking for us

					obrien
		yeah i have something ive been
		meaning to give you

					sim
		yeah and what might that be

					obrien
		an assbeating  would you like
		yours first mr sim

sim cocks his gun and now obrien smiles

					sim
		just try it  come on  do
		something  move  anything
		anything  just twitch blink i
		dare you  i double dare you

obrien becomes completely rigid frozen like a smiling
mannequin

sim doesnt know what to do  he looks around the room
when 

obriens tongue lashes out like a frogs and snatches
the gun

					sim
		thats disgusting

obrien levels the gun at argon and everyone reacts

					obrien
		i should kill you right now for what
		you did to me

					argon
		maybe you should but you cant

susan screams as doby grabs her and pins a gun to her
head

					susan
		run daniel  get out of here

					obrien
		im not leaving without you susan

					argon
		you dont have to leave mr
		obrien  weve prepared a wonderful
		room for you  i think youll find
		it quite comfortable so
		comfortable in fact i doubt youll
		ever want to leave

as he speaks they all pull out white oxygen masks

					argon
		gardener

the gardener appears sprayer in hand and rushes straight
at obrien aiming the nozzle into his face

obrien tries to back away to find air but the nozzle is
everywhere pumping a mist that envelops both of them

coughing choking unable to breathe the gas begins to
take effect  obrien collapses the gasmasked figure
standing over the soft rubbery head

					susan
		nooo

poppy and argon exchange quiet smiles

					susan
		what are you going to do to him

					argon
		do  well i suppose that depends on
		you

she knows what he wants and her head drops

int  conservatory

the gardener adjusts several gas tank valves and we follow
the feed lines up to the top where the humidifier blower
breathes into the sealed cell

the gasses drift down to the bottom where we see the
supple red puddle of obrien

floating on the edge of consciousness obrien lifts his
head  outside the curved plexiglas he sees warped faces
staring at him

					obrien
		 susa

his eyes roll and his head pitches forward slapping and
flattening out against the plexi

dr bright touches the glass

					susan
		what did you use

					argon
		a light mixture of oxygen dioxide
		and sodium pentothal  hell sleep
		thats all

she takes a last look at him then steadies herself as she
turns to argon

					susan
		i give you the design you let us
		both go  thats the deal

argon nods

int  argons private lab

makeo and nebbleman watch as the new assembler tank
finishes its test run

the tank looks like a cross between a giger sarcophagi and
a dry cleaning machine

the motors and pumps suddenly stop as the lab grows quiet

					nebbleman
		 its ready


int  susans room

susan is at the desk her jaw set her face blank in a
kind of analytical trance

int  security booth

sim and doby are alone at the control center

sim is trying to concentrate on susan with the same
intensity that she is concentrating with

he fails

					sim
		you know why i hate smart women

doby says nothing

					sim
		theyre always thinking but you
		never know what theyre thinking

int  susans room

suddenly she walks to the far wall and turns out the
light

int  security booth

the monitor goes dark

					sim
		whyd she do that

int  susans room

in the dark she takes her chair and wedges it under the
door handle  she puts on the protective gloves

					susan
		all right argon  you want a fight
		you got one

then throws open the freezer unit

int  conservatory

in a drugged haze obrien searches the edges of his
prison

his head and limbs move with a strange fluidity rising
and falling like the molten blebs of a lava lamp

his fingers find the gas line opening in the blower

taking a deep breath he sticks his arm into the tiny hole
and pulls himself up inside

we follow the coils of copper tubing down into the
different tanks of gas

we hear the tink tink as he pounds against the metal
canisters

unable to hold his breath he rises through the gasfeeds
back to the opening where he emerges like a giant red
droplet of water 

falling and splashing back into his cell

int  poppys bedroom

poppy is helping argon undress

					argon
		can you feel it poppy  the
		presence of the moment  can you
		feel the weight of its significance

					poppy
		oh yes icky  i can feel it

					argon
		this is what my entire life has been
		directed at this moment this
		threshold

					poppy
		okay arms up lean forward

he leans over her shoulder and she holds him up while she
takes his pants off

					argon
		i stand on the verge of mans
		greatest triumph over the forces of
		nature

pants down she sets him back into the chair

					argon
		gently gently  my metamorphosis
		will be more than a simple
		transformation

she pulls his feet free of each pant leg

					argon
		it will be an ascension

					poppy
		im so excited icarus

she stands helping him with his robe

					poppy
		i was wondering if youd finished
		considering

					argon
		considering what

					poppy
		what i asked you earlier

he realizes what she is talking about

					argon
		poppy please 

					poppy
		if you loved me like i loved you

					argon
		poppy this is not the time

there is a knock on the door

					argon
		yes

dr makeo enters

					makeo
		we are ready for you sir

int  hall

sim doby and several security guards are outside dr
brights room

					sim
		dr bright  this isnt doing anyone
		any good

he knocks yelling at the door

					sim
		this aint very cooperative
		behavior  im going to tell dr
		argon that you aint cooperating

he shoves at the door but it doesnt budge

					sim
		come on  we know youre in there

no answer  he turns to doby in disgust

					sim
		break it down

int  susans room

we hear doby slam against the door but it holds  across
the dark room we see susan standing at the window

					susan
		come on come on

she is holding the glass beaker against the iron bars
infecting them with the replicator fallout

body batters the door again

she drops the beaker and grabs hold of the two bars  they
bend like thick rods of rubber

					susan
		yes

the next blow vibrates through the entire frame

ignoring it she grabs hold of the stool that was also
taken from the lab

stretching out one of the legs she ties it to one of the
nonpolymerized bars

the door splinters at the hinge

hurrying she squeezes herself and the stool out between
the rubber bars

standing on the ledge she makes a crucial mistake  she
looks down

the roof of the main laboratory is forty feet away

ext  main gate

chatting with the other reporters spencer looks up and
sees dr bright standing outside the window

					spencer
		holy shit  jumper

he grabs his cameraman

					spencer
		get this  get this

int  susans room

the door shrieks cracking open

out on the edge susan closes her eyes

					susan
		itll work  its got to  its got
		to

holding tightly to one of the other legs of the stool she
takes a deep breathe and 

steps off the ledge

she falls the stool stretching surreally but it is not
pliable enough to reach the roof below

halfway down it slows about to bungeebouce her back up

her body jerks as the leg wrenches from her grip 

sending her cartwheeling into the open air

she seems to hang for a moment watching the stool
shrinking back to the window

she screams

ext  main gate

every camera is locked on her

ext  roof

there is nothing between her and the roof except the force
of gravity  it sucks her down

plummeting helplessly hurtling she screams again as 

she slams onto the roof but instead of being splattered
against it 

she bounces up

the polymerized roof gives like a trampoline tossing her
lightly until she lays on her back staring up at the
window adrenaline bubbling out of her in laughter and
tears

ext  main gate

the cameraman looks at spencer

					spencer
		theres a logical explanation  has
		to be

int  susans room

sim finds the stool still tied to the bars

outside he sees susan climbing down through a roof access
door into the quarantined lab

					sim
		oh shit  wheres argon

int  argons private lab

argon sits in his wheelchair eyes blazing as nebbleman
draws the nanobiotic fluid into a hypodermic needle

					nebbleman
		of course you understand dr argon
		that once the nanobot is inside of
		you there is no going back 

					argon
		shut up and do it

nebbleman forces down a swallow and sticks the needle
into his neck

int  main lab

susan moves through the unreal reality of the polymerized
building

her feet sink with every step into the floor

door handles bend like kneaded dough

the concrete formed steps in the stairwell pillow out
under her weight and she loses her balance 

groping for the rail that also distends

					susan
		this is insane

int  argons private lab

argon sheds his robe and wearing black bikini briefs he
starts to climb into the tank

makeo tries to help him

					argon
		no  ill do it myself

his legs withered and atrophied like sticks of beef
jerky drag behind him  with obvious effort he pulls
himself into the chamber

wheezing he can only nod to dr makeo who closes and
seals the chamber

dr makeo cranks the pressurized balloon valves watching
the gauges as the chemicals begin to flow from the mixing
vats into the main chamber

there is a muffled scream as the chamber begins to fill
knocking and shaking slightly

several nervous glances are exchanged as the gauges begin
to climb

int  conservatory  close on red teeth

of a strange serrated shaft

obrien has formed his arm into a massive tire jack which
spans the walls of his transparent cage

his other arm works the lever with slow determination
ratcheting up the shaft

outside the tank the polyethylene window begins to bulge
where his hand presses

obrien glares beneath his heavy eyelids

					obrien
		come on obrien 

int  main lab

susan sneaks out of the stairwell  down the hall she
sees two members of the containment crew in their heavy
protective suits  each has a tank strapped to their back
and is hosing the entire hall with liquid nitrogen

they do not notice her as she heads the other way trying
not to let the floor squeak

int  conservatory

above obrien the humidifier hisses sodium pentothal
wafting down

he grits his rubbery teeth and cranks the lever

it clicks one more tooth

the walls swell warping creaking as the lever arcs back

					obrien
		just one more

sweat pours down his face but just as the tooth clicks
the arm shaft bends and 

obrien collapses into a watery pile

int  main lab

the tank rumbles as poppy chews at a perfect nail

					poppy
		i cant stand it  how much longer

nebbleman watches his timer for a moment then counts it
down

					nebbleman
		five four three two  drain it

makeo throws open the drain valves as nebbleman monitors
his improved waste system

					nebbleman
		its working its working

makeo unscrews the tank locks and steps back

steam wheezes from the opening as a strange figure
emerges covered in a saran wrap caul

hunched over the figure coughs a gelatinous mass from its
lungs as it tears itself free of the layer of polymerized
sweat

no longer a debilitated cripple argon rises to his feet
as everyone sees the massive physique restored to all its
former glory

					poppy
		oh my god

his arms reach out to the heavens as he lets loose the
scream that has been trapped for so long inside

ext  main gate

the scream sends a chill through the reporters

int  lab hall

					susan
		oh no

the crew members hear the scream and stop working  one of
them notices her

					crew 1
		hey  hold it  stop

they rush at her  searching for any kind of weapon susan
grabs a fire extinguisher from the wall

swinging it like a club she lets the first one have it
but 

it too has been polymerized and the red tank bounces off
his skull

					susan
		nuts

					crew 2
		lady youre in serious trouble

he throws her back against the wall which she springs off
of kicking him in the balls 

finally finding something solid

screaming he falls to his knees his hose spewing liquid
nitrogen

the second man grabs her causing her to drop the
extinguisher into the puddle of foaming nitrogen

they wrestle until she tears herself free snatching hold
of the extinguisher  she whips around 

clubbing him again but this time the frozen tank explodes
over his head frothing like a shattered beer bottle

he falls to the soft matlike floor


int  argons private lab

sim and doby emerge from the elevator and head for the
lab

he hears poppy giggling and argons new booming voice

					argon os
		its fantastic to be plastic

sim pushes into the lab and sees argon still wearing
bikini briefs bouncing poppy into the air with his huge
rubberized arms

					sim
		holy

argon hears him

					argon
		exactly right mr sim  you have
		entered one of the holiest places on
		earth

he catches poppy and she cuddles against his chest

					argon
		this lab shall forever be
		consecrated ground and you mr sim
		stand here a witness to mans
		ultimate triumph  the
		polymerization of human flesh

nebbleman is behind him using a razor to cut his hair
like susan did to daniel

					nebbleman
		sir please try to hold still

					sim
		so i guess it worked

					argon
		worked  worked

argon laughs

					argon
		a watch works mr sim  a
		bureaucrat works  what transpired
		here cannot be measured by the word
		work

his chest swells as if he were posing down for mr
universe

					argon
		what you see before you is the
		culmination of evolution  the
		realization of the one driving
		desire at the heart of all great
		human endeavors the desire for
		immortality  the polymerization of
		human flesh is no mere molecular
		transmutation no simple scientific
		procedure it is nothing short of a
		miracle  a miracle that marks the
		ascension of man from the finite to
		the infinite  from the transient to
		the everlasting

his perfect white teeth highbeam the room  poppy stares
adulation oozing from every pore

					poppy
		oh icky

argon kisses her hard

					sim
		look i dont mean to rain on
		everyones ascension here but we
		got a little problem

					argon
		speak

					sim
		dr bright has escaped

argon breathes deep controlling his temper

					argon
		if you let her reach those reporters
		outside the main gate mr sim 

his hand whipwraps around sims throat

					sim
		 gurk understood

int  main lab

wearing one of the protective suits susan pushes through
part of a containment crew heading for the elevator

most of the crew is surrounding the captain

					crew 3
		the whole west wing is gone
		captain

					crew 4
		its in the phone lines 

					crew 5
		its spreading to the underground
		pipes 

					crew 6
		we gotta get out of here

the captain notices susan

					captain
		hey  where are you going

thinking fast she points to her crotch as though needing
to go to the bathroom  the captain nods

int  conservatory

obrien is deflated head cradled in an arm coil  his
other arm is raised against the perspex wall

he has turned his finger into a glass cutter moving it
around and around in a slow deliberate circle

int  poppys bedroom

argon stands before the mirror wearing a new black suit
like obriens

					argon
		excellent work dr nebbleman  you
		have outdone yourself

					nebbleman
		thank you sir

poppy steps behind him running her hands over his body

					poppy
		oh icky you know what latex does
		to me

someone knocks at the door

					argon
		enter

sim does

					sim
		dr argon everythings starting to
		come apart here  you hired me to
		take care of these matters of
		security and i am trying but
		elements are making my job
		impossible

					argon
		have you found dr bright

					sim
		no  the captain of the containment
		crew is closing down the main lab
		he says the area has got to be
		evacuated

					nebbleman
		hes probably right sir the
		building is probably going to
		collapse under its own weight

					sim
		and if we evacuate what do you want
		to do with obrien

					argon
		itll be better for us if he simply
		disappears  the gardener will know
		what to do

					nebbleman
		wait wait can i at least have his
		body

					argon
		donated to science  perfect

int  conservatory

the glass cutter tracing the circle has completely lost
its shape his finger squeaking against the plexiglas

the gardener leads sim doby and nebbleman towards
obriens geranium

					sim
		can i ask you something  do you
		ever take that mask off

the gardener shakes his head

					sim
		doesnt it get hot

the gardener nods

at the end of the path they reach obriens tank
obrien sleepily lifts his head

					sim
		sorry pal  check out time  moral
		of story next life mind your own
		business

the gardener begins to shut off the valves  the gauges
drop to zero as the gas opening at the top of the tank
rasps and goes silent

immediately obrien knows that he is going to suffocate

he screams and pounds on the plexi

they all watch as his soft rubbery fists mash uselessly
against the walls of the tank

					sim
		even a plastic mans gotta breathe
		eh doc

nebbleman is too entranced to reply

at the far end of the conservatory the door swings open

sim glances over his shoulder and sees a member of the
containment crew striding toward them

					sim
		what are you doing here  youre
		supposed to be looking for the
		woman

					crewman
		we found her

the voice is muffled by the headgear

					sim
		what  did you say you found her

body catches the scent of something fishy  he turns to
the crew member

behind sim obrien sucks at the thinning air his punches
growing weaker

the crew member lunges at sim but doby is ready 

seizing hold of the small body while tearing off the
helmet revealing susan bright

					nebbleman
		susan

					sim
		wellie well dr bright  youre
		just in time

obriens eyes bulge when he sees her but he knows it is
too late  his hands press against the plexi his eyes
melt into silicon tears

					susan
		nooo

like a wild animal she bites doby twisting free just long
enough to jump at sim and 

snatch the gun from his belt

sim grabs her wrist and they fight for control until susan
manages to squeezes off a single shot 

that punches a hole in obriens tank

the hole is tiny but it is all plastic man needs

he dives at it thinning to a pencil driving himself
through

he emerges from the other side like a genie freed from
his lamp

					sim
		uhoh

afraid now sim twists susans arm behind her back and
yanks the gun free

nebbleman cowers behind doby

the gardener slips away hurrying for his spray can

obrien faces sim his eyes blazing with malice
aforethought

sim hides behind susan holding the gun to her barely
able to see over her shoulder

					sim
		here we go again eh obrien  i
		got the gun i got the girl  all
		you got is some rubber underwear

he laughs feeling a little better

obrien points a single finger that creeps slowly at sim

					obrien
		ive been thinking about you mr
		sim

sim watches it as the tip shapes into a fish hook

					obrien
		all the different ways that i could
		kill you

					sim
		oh yeah

he aims the gun at obrien

					sim
		maybe youre ready to find out if
		that hide of yours is bulletproof

					obrien
		the question is are you

sim thumbs back the hammer

					obrien
		because once you pull the trigger
		if that bullet doesnt kill me we
		both know youre a dead man

sims hand shakes

					sim
		i aint afraid of no plastic man

boom

the bullet sinks into obriens chest pushing his flesh
back with a shrieking stretch projecting it out behind
him impossibly until 

the bullet stops

obrien looks back at sim whose eyes fill with fear

susan dives to the ground as the bullet comes rushing back
and 

with a resounding whip crack hits sim right in the chest

sim sinks to the ground dead

doby howls and rushes obrien who turns his fists into
sledgehammers

nebbleman bolts but susan snatches hold of him

					susan
		do you know the best thing about
		having you as an assistant nigel

she wrings the lapel of his lab coat

					susan
		was knowing that if you ever pissed
		me off i could always kick your
		ass

she winds up just as nebblemans eyes cross

					nebbleman
		ohhh

he faints into a bruise colored bush  she shakes her
head

obrien pounds the sound of chirping birds into dobys
skull as susan sees the gardener rushing behind him

					susan
		daniel

but the spray can is already hissing pumping out deadly
clouds of red gas

					obrien
		not this time pal

obrien clasps his hands together and forms a giant
bellows that sucks up all the gas

					obrien
		lets see how you like it

he shoves the nozzle of the bellows into the filter of his
gas mask and squeezes

the dark glass eyes fill with smoke as the gardener
thrashes around trying to get the mask off

he stumbles flailing wildly and smashes into the
seamonkey geranium

the little creatures swarm all over him as he collapses to
the ground

obrien turns just as susan rushes into his arms

					obrien
		you saved my life

					susan
		did you think i could just leave
		you

they hold each other tightly feeling the volatile
electrons charging the air creating an intermolecular
bond between them

					obrien
		susie i

					susan
		you dont have to say anything
		daniel  im a scientist  i know
		whats happening  i recognize the
		classic symptoms  dizziness
		shortness of breath sweating
		palms i can feel my adrenals
		secreting my parasympathetic
		nervous system quivering the
		estradiol coursing through my entire
		body

her lips move closer to his

					susan
		and i know theres only one way to
		cure it

she kisses him and almost melts the polymerized lips right
off his face

the kiss is so intense it shakes the entire building
around them

ext  argon tower

the metal frame supporting the tower has finally been
affected by the replicators

two of the legs squash out causing the other legs to bend

int  conservatory

they break the kiss realizing that the building is
actually shaking

					obrien
		what in the

					susan
		oh shit the meltdown  its spread
		to the tower

					obrien
		weve got to get the nanobot

					susan
		its too late  argon injected it

					obrien
		you mean hes polymerized like me

she nods

					obrien
		that means the nanobot is still
		inside him

					susan
		yes

					obrien
		what would happen if i threw him
		into the core

					susan
		the same thing i suppose

thats all obrien needs to hear

int  poppys bedroom

what is happening beneath the red rubber sheets of poppys
bed is beyond anything ever pictured in the kama sutra

poppy screams as the earth moves again

argon sticks his head out

					argon
		did you feel that

					poppy
		did i  ive been waiting for that
		for years

					argon
		not that

the building shivers and leans again

					argon
		that  its the fallout  we have
		to get out of here

ext  argon tower

the tower leans a few more degrees as outside the lab
bedlam erupts

the containment crew and security force scatter from the
building like rats pouring from a sinking ship

ext  main gate

spencer grabs hold of the fence watching the tower lean

					spencer
		we gotta get in there

he notices that the fence is warm

					spencer
		hey whats up with the fence

he pulls back and it stretches like gum

int  argons office

obrien and susan are arguing in the office  the floor
weirdly tilts under them

					susan
		daniel just forget argon  lets
		get out of here  well find another
		way to stop the waste

					obrien
		we dont have time to argue susan

hes dragging her toward the door to the roof

					obrien
		im going to set you down outside
		you have to get over to the
		reporters outside the gate  we have
		to warn people whats happening

she doesnt like being dragged anywhere

					susan
		youre not going after argon

					obrien
		i have to

					susan
		do the words hero fantasies mean
		anything to you  how about
		infantile dementia

that hurts

					obrien
		maybe youre right but so what
		im going to beat the snot out of
		him

she is about to continue the fight when the elevator opens
and ends it

argon and poppy get out

					argon
		how apropos

					obrien
		aint it

the men begin circling each other

					argon
		as you can see i am a new man just
		like you

					obrien
		oh no  youre not like me  in
		fact im betting youre the same
		greedy remorseless egomaniacal bad
		guy you always were

obrien pumps up a huge fist  his forearm then goes slack
as he begins swinging the fist like a medieval morning
star

					argon
		it remains to be seen who is the
		good guy and who is the bad guy
		history is written by the victor

					obrien
		the only history im gonna write is
		your obituary

he lunges the fist arcing down as argon awkwardly
counters 

the blow connects snapping argons head back

					poppy
		icky

					susan
		get him daniel  knock his block
		off

poppy hisses at susan as the two women now edge toward one
another

obrien presses his attack battering and bludgeoning
argon 

every blow landing with a loud rubber smack that
reverberates through argons teeth

desperate the villain flails back long ropy limbs trying
to tie obrien up as 

his extending legs drive both men flying backwards 

crashing through the enormous vistawindows

					susan
		daniel

ext  main gate

the reporters are lifting the fence and scrambling inside

spencer hears the window explode and sees the black and
red intertwined bodies 

still locked in combat pummeling kicking biting 

cometing straight to the earth

kaboing

the force of the fall blasts them apart each rebounding
into the air 

obrien flipping righting himself as he lands on his
feet

argon quickly recovers

spencer does not

					spencer
		thatthats not possible

int  argons office

the two women smell blood

					susan
		okay barbie lets get this over
		with

					poppy
		dont worry four eyes

from her bag poppy whips out a razor knife

					poppy
		its not going to take long

ext  grounds

obrien and argon have at one another again

spencer stands in the white wash of his cameramans light

					spencer
		we are just outside argon labs and i
		can without fear of hyperbole say
		that what is happening behind me is
		the most unbelievably fantastic
		thing the world has ever seen

argon is learning quickly morphing his body the way
obrien does

					spencer
		two men if they are indeed really
		men locked in mortal combat

pure jackthekingkirby pugilistics

					spencer
		one of them apparently the dangerous
		radical environmentalist authorities
		have been searching for  the other
		appears to be icarus argon or at
		least icarus argon fifteen years
		ago

fists flying blasted bodies hurling through the air only
to bounce right back

					spencer
		there are times singular fleeting
		moments when a man glimpses an event
		which he knows is going to change
		the world  although i do not fully
		understand what is happening here i
		sense that this fight is somehow
		about the future of the planet

argon suddenly realizes that obrien is leading the battle
closer and closer to the main lab

					argon
		i know what youre doing

					obrien
		you mean besides kicking your ass

					argon
		you think you can use me to stop the
		meltdown

obriens face reveals nothing

					argon
		its not going to happen

his arms shoot up to the helicopter pad but obrien snags
hold of him

					obrien
		not so fast icky i promised you an
		assbeating and im just getting
		started

boom  fistimprinted in the middle of argons face

int  argons office

poppy slashes viciously at susan driving her back into a
corner where 

she ducks behind the statue of icarus and shoves 

tipping it over onto poppy who screams falling back as
the statue smashes to the ground

susan grabs one of the broken arms and backhands poppy
before she gets to her feet

susan is about to finish her off when the building tilts
again throwing her crashing over the desk

ext  grounds

the tower squeaks again legs bending giving way
throwing the crowd into a panic

if obrien even notices we cant tell  his attack is an
unrelenting fury 

fists like jackhammers 

like wrecking balls and ballistic missiles

bomb after bomb rearranges argons face  his body growing
soft and supple his knees turning to syrup as 

obrien winds up the haymaker

					obrien
		well argon according to you this
		makes me the good guy dont it

kaboom  lights out

argon hits the ground with a wet smack

int  argons office

poppy is up first delivering a stilettoheeled kick to
susans face knocking her out

the building trembles again and poppy forgets susan and
hurries to the roof door

ext  grounds

the crowd has burst apart running from the building
while obrien shoulders argon and heads for the main lab
floor

int  roof stairwell

poppy pushes outside to the roof  the helicopter has
shifted toward the tilted edge

she climbs into the pilots seat

int  lab stairwell

obrien climbs the polymerized stairs in giant steps  he
is heading for susans lab when 

argons eyes snap open

int  argons office

susan wakes up as the building continues to groan

she goes to the elevator but it no longer works  she then
sees the open roof door

int  hall

argon attacks with snakelike speed whipwrapping both
arms like twin boa constrictors around obriens neck

a small gak spits out as obrien feels his windpipe
pinch

ext  roof

the helicopter blades begin to chop as susan flings open
the roof door

int  hall

obrien throws himself backward against the wall trying
to smash argon off him but 

everything is polymerized

they bounce and roll into a smaller lab argon wrapped
around obrien like a creepingivy vine

obrien thrashes through the room slamming into stainless
steel scientific equipment 

only to bounce off them like they were nerf toys

desperate he hurls them both at a large window but 

the polymerized glass balloons out both bodies visible
inside the bulging bubble that 

snaps back slinging them across the lab and out into the
hall

ext  roof

susan tries to climb into the helicopter when the tower
tilts more violently than ever

the helicopter slides out hooking its landing gear on the
guard rail flipping up out of control killing the
engine

thrown free susan slides toward the same edge where the
helicopter dangles precariously

below them is the roof of the main lab

int  main lab

obrien falls to his knees  he is ready to give up when
he sees something

his face as red as his suit his breath a tiny rasp he
begins to crawl

					argon
		die  die  damn you  why dont you
		just die

the world spins and goes spotty as he collapses

					argon
		yes

but his hands keep going cartoon fingers groping down the
hall toward 

the tank of liquid nitrogen still laying near the broken
fire extinguisher

the hands take hold of it 

					argon
		no  oh no

and come rushing back like the cavalry

argon screams as the nitrogen sprays out soaking his
arms freezing them solid

a little frosted obrien slips his head free while argon
tries to crack apart his arms

he looks up and sees obrien aiming the nitrogen again

					argon
		no  obrien  dont  please

obrien lets him have it full frosting blast

he grabs hold of him and with two huge steps bursts into
susans lab

int  susans lab

the room pulses with a seething sense of sickness as
everything turns to gray slime like a rotting banana
turning brown

fluorescent lights drip like stalactites from the drooping
dropceiling

equipment hangs like swampmoss or sits in puddles like
melting chocolate

the center of the room is a crater the floor sagging
limply like a wet napkin

at the bottom of the crater where the assembler tank used
to be is a pond of pale glowing goo

argon cracks his jaw loose  they stand at the edge of the
crater

					argon
		please obrien dont do this to
		me  ill give you anything you want

					obrien
		yeah im going to finish what you
		started 

obrien sees the finger slither out like a black tentacle
around his leg  obrien slips free and 

hurls argon out over the crater

argon screams as his finger reaches for the soft pipes
above the dropceiling

the finger finds a hold just before argon hits the white
pool  he bounces dangling above it

					argon
		you cant do this  you owe me
		obrien  i made you plastic  i
		made you

					obrien
		thats right  and making me was the
		biggest mistake you ever made

obriens hand sears at us shaping into a huge pair of
scissors

argon screams as the scissors clip through the finger
strand 

dropping argon into the pond of moonmilk

almost immediately there is an reaction

the pool sizzles and begins to swell into a single
volcanic bubble

obrien whirls and runs

ext  roof

susan carefully slides to the edge reaching out to help
poppy

					susan
		grab my hand

int  conservatory

the building is shaking as nebbleman wakes up

int  lab

the bubble continues to swell

int  hall

obrien races through the rubbery hall

ext  roof

poppy is struggling to get out of the safety harness
when 

int  main lab

the bubble bursts

int  hall

the force of the blast launches obrien into the air and
he recoils tucking himself into a ball 

superbouncing down the hall

ext  roof

the building shivers from the explosion and the helicopter
pitches back

swinging out from susan who loses her balance and slips

int  susans lab

the chain reaction spreads out from the crater as
molecules shift rebounding changing into an ionic
solid 

like blown glass that is cooled too quickly 

shivering with the sound of cracking ice floes

ext  roof

the tower tips again ready to fall at any moment

susan clings to the rail while inside the helicopter poppy
is no longer struggling

she is staring up at the enormous full moon above her

					poppy
		icky

ext  main lab

obrien dives from the lab as part of it collapses with a
shower of crashing glass

ext  roof

the rail gives out and the helicopter falls

it seems for a moment to drift like a snowflake as poppy
reaches at the moon

					poppy
		plastic means forever

it hits the roof and shatters through it as though it were
sheet candy

susan is thrown out over the edge dangling from the rail
as 

the helicopter shatters through the building with an ear
bleeding crash before its metal carcass bursts into
flames

as susan clings to the rail she looks up and sees
nebbleman  he stares at her through his broken glasses

					nebbleman
		this is all your fault susan

he bends toward her clutching fingers

ext  grounds

obrien is searching everywhere for susan

					obrien
		susan  susan

ext  roof

nebbleman is peeling up her fingers when 

the tower begins to fall

with a final metal shriek the legs give out completely
still holding on susan falls with the tower

nebblemans eyes bulge as he is thrown over the rail and
into the fiery abyss

obrien looks up as the tower arcs down and sees susan
clinging dangling about to be buried beneath it

					obrien
		noooo

a red rubber rocket sears across the night sky

susans grip fails and she drops into 

obrien who has flattened himself out like a giant luge
chute

she slides away as the tower collapses into the fiery
oblivion falling lightly into the soft waiting arms of

					susan
		my hero

they kiss

we rise above them reaching up for the moon in all its
luminous glory watching as it morphs into a blazing sun

we pan down to a new day

ext  city street

obrien is carrying a brown bag filled with groceries
susan is walking beside him

she suddenly starts laughing

					susan
		god when we were in that store all
		i could think about was that one
		time when we were in school and
		you attacked that little kid who
		wanted some cereal  do you remember
		that

					obrien
		i remember i was trying to help

					susan
		god what a fight that was

					obrien
		we were different people then

					susan
		do you suppose that was our problem
		we met before our time  i think
		that happens a lot  people events
		planets all just circling each other
		waiting for that moment when
		everything clicks into place

obrien is no longer listening to her staring at
something like an attack dog

					susan
		that moment of synchronicity where
		everything seems to work out just
		the way it should

walking straight toward them is the litterbug

					susan
		i suppose if there were a god it
		would be those moments that would
		make me believe in her or him

just like he did before the litterbug gulps from a
styrofoam cup

					susan
		daniel what is

she sees what he is staring at just as the litterbug
crumbles the cup and pitches it into the bushes

					susan
		oh no

the litterbug continues toward them

					susan
		daniel please dont not today
		its such a nice day

she watches him bracing for the attack jaw working
hackles raising fists clenching

					susan
		aww shit

the litterbug reaches them shoves his way past and
obrien 

lets him go  he smiles

					obrien
		youre right  it is a nice day

he walks over and picks up the cup himself

					obrien
		i can throw it out  no big deal

she cant believe it  his arm shoots out and a moment
later whaps back the cup is gone

she smiles and he wraps his arm around her

					susan
		things do change

					obrien
		i guess they do

they stroll on and we glide back in the direction his arm
shot 

where we see the litterbug wedged head first into a wire
meshed trash can kicking like an inverted cockroach the
styrofoam cup stuffed in his mouth

and we close on the sign 

keep litter in its place

								    fade out

					the end
