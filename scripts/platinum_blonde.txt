               that takes in a long shot of the room the door to the 
               hall opens and a correctly attired valet appears he closes 
               the door noiselessly goes over to the windows and draws 
               the brocaded drapes aside then he crosses to a covered 
               object and with a small flourish removes the cover  
               revealing a birdcage he approaches the bed

               as dawson the valet stops beside the bed the valet leans 
               over and speaks distinctly

                                     dawson
                         mr smith sir—

                         mr smith sir

               still no response the valet taps the bedclothesshrouded 
               shoulder gently

                                     dawson

               stew still stares at him then he nods to himself  thinks 
               he gets the idea stew kicks back the covers and sits on 
               the edge of the bed in his pajamas still sitting on the 
               edge of the bed he starts to slip his feet into a pair of 
               slippers the valet bends on one knee to help him

                                     stew

                         drunk sir

               stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown but 
               again the valet beats him to it  holding it for him and 
               helping him slip into it

                                     stew
                         yes i must have been pretty much

                         with my pants—

               the valet picks up his pants

                                     stew
                         did you take anything out of those

               stew pulls out a cigarette the valet without missing a 
               beat leans over and offers a light a wary stew accepts

                                     stew
                         hmmm so mrs smith engaged me a

               stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a 
               small table waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal 
               the valet is right behind him holding up his bathrobe for 
               stew to step into

                                     stew
                              putting on the 
                              bathrobe

                                     stew

                         youre all right but im sorry i 
                         dont need any valleys today

               the valet pays no attention to him but walks around the 
               room picking up the clothes that stew has flung about

                                     dawson
                         oh but indeed you do sir if you

                         your clothes help to dress you  
                         its really most essential sir

               stew with his cigarette between his lips stands watching 
               the valet as he retrieves the various articles of castoff 
               clothing the valets manner is somewhat patronizing he 
               walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers 
               preparatory to laying out fresh things for stew suddenly 
               stew stalks over to him takes him by the shoulder and 
               yanks him around to face him

               130 closer shot  stew and dawson

               the valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the 
               belligerent expression on stews face

                                     stew

               stew is rapidly losing his temper

                         to your face would you

               the valet puts a bewildered hand to his face

                                     dawson
                         oh no sir—

               stew releases him with a definite motion toward the door

                              gesturing violently
                         outside

               the valet gazes at stew as if he thinks the man is insane 
               he is considerably alarmed

                                     dawson

               the valet hurries off carrying the birdcage as he nears

               miss wilson follows butler out of scene gallagher is left 
               alone she wanders about the huge ballroom peering here 
               and there searching for stew finally she comes to a large 
               open french door and steps out

               int terrace leading off schuyler ballroom

               and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden

               int secluded spot in garden

               stew his head cupped in his hands is seated on a stone 
               bench gallagher wanders into scene she sees stew and 
               stops stew does not move gallagher with a happy smile 
               on her lips moves closer to him stew suddenly becomes 
               conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up he 
               sees gallagher his face breaks into a happy grin

               to his backside bingy straightens stiffly then removes a 
               bottle of alcohol from the target area
