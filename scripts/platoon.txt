               fade in

               a quotation against a black screen

               rejoice o young man in thy youth

               the sound now of a c130 air cargo plane roaring over us and 
               we cut sharply to

               ext airstrip  base camp  vietnam  day

               as the c130 coasts to a stop the hatch rotating down on a 
               hot dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in vietnam nothing 
               seems to live or move in the midday sun

               titles run

               a dozen new recruits step off the plane unloading their 
               duffel bags looking around like only the new can look around 
               their hair regulationclipped crisp new green fatigues 
               fitting them like cardboard

               chris taylor is just another one of them  as he turns into 
               a tight closeup to look at a motorized cart pulling up 
               alongside hes about 21 new meat his face unburned yet 
               by the sun is tense bewildered innocent eyes searching 
               for the truth

               they fall now on a heap of body bags in the back of the cart  
               two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane flies  
               hundreds of flies  buzz around them the only cue to their 
               contents

                                     gardner
                              next to chris 
                              southern accent
                         that what i think it is

                                     soldier 1
                              a look
                         i guess so

               an uncomfortable look between them

                                     sergent
                         okay lets go

               as they move out chris eyes moving with the body bags being 
               loaded onto the plane moving over now to a motley half dozen 
               veterans bypassing them on their way to the plane they look 
               happy very happy chatting it up

               they pass the newboys  and they shake their heads their 
               eyes full of an almost mocking pity

                                     veterans
                         well ill be dipped in shit  new 
                         meat sorry bout that boys  sin 
                         loi buddy you gonna love the 
                         nam man forfuckingever

               chris looking at them they pass except for the last man 
               who walks slower than the rest a slight limp his eyes fall 
               on chris

               theyre frightening eyes starved hollow sunken deep in 
               his face black and dangerous the clammy pallor of malaria 
               clings to him as he looks at chris through decayed black 
               teeth then the sun flares out on him and hes past and 
               chris looks back disturbed its as if the man was not real 
               for a moment there as if he were a ghost

               chris walking duffel bag on the shoulder looks up at the 
               lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky a rushing sound 
               now of frightening intensity an effect combining the blast 
               of an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to

               ext jungle  somewhere in vietnam  day

               the sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we 
               move down into thick green jungle we hear the sound of men 
               coming a lot of men the thwack of a machete brush being 
               bulled we wait they are getting close

               the credits continue to run

               subtitle reads december 1967  bravo company 25th infantry 
               division  somewhere near the cambodian border

               a sweating white face comes into view chris  cutting point  
               machete in one hand whacking out a path for the platoon m
               16 in the other he looks like hes on the verge of heat 
               exhaustion breathing too hard pacing himself all wrong 
               bumping into things tripping not quite falling he looks 
               pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle an urban 
               transplant slightly neurotic and getting more so

               his rucksack is coming apart as well about 70 badly packed 
               pounds banging noisily

               behind him barnes now comes the platoon sergeant then the 
               rto his radio man humming lightly others are behind the 
               column snaking back deep into the brush

               we cut around some faces of the platoon  all to be seen 
               later young faces hard and dirty after weeks in the field 
               exhausted yet alert fatigues filthy sleptin torn 
               personalized hair way past regulation length medals 
               bandannas a jungle army boys

               chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters transfers 
               the machete to his other slightly less blistered hand the 
               kid cuts on  struggling but trying on his last reserves of 
               strength smashing almost straight forward through brush 
               not even bothering to look ahead he smells something looks 
               around slows his pace eyes working around to the base 
               of a tree he moves past it

               and as he does so the camera from his pov comes around on a 
               dead decomposing 10dayold gook  eyes starting from its 
               sockets worms and flies feasting

               chris draws his breath in terrified barnes suddenly appears 
               alongside his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the 
               gook to chris

                                     barnes
                         what are you waiting for he aint 
                         gonna bite you move out

                              digs
                         somebody once wrote hell is the 
                         impossibility of reason thats what 
                         this place feels like i hate it 
                         already and its only been a week  
                         some goddamn week grandma
                              checking his raw 
                              blisters
                         the hardest thing i think ive 
                         ever done is to go on point 3 times 
                         this week  i dont even know what 
                         im doing a gook could be standing 
                         3 feet in front of me and i wouldnt 
                         know it im so tired we get up at 
                         5 am hump all day camp around 4 
                         or 5 pm dig foxhole eat then 
                         put out an allnight ambush or a 3
                         man listening post in the jungle  
                         its scary cause nobody tells me how 
                         to do anything cause im new and 
                         nobody cares about the new guys 
                         they dont even want to know your 
                         name the unwritten rule is a new 
                         guys life isnt worth as much cause 
                         he hasnt put his time in yet  and 
                         they say if youre gonna get killed 
                         in the nam its better to get it in 
                         the first few weeks the logic being 
                         you dont suffer that much i can 
                         believe that if youre lucky you 
                         get to stay in the perimeter at night 
                         and then you pull a 3hour guard 
                         shift so maybe you sleep 34 hours 
                         a night but you dont really sleep 
                         i dont think i can keep this up for 
                         a year grandma  i think ive made 
                         a big mistake coming here

               as he speaks we cut around to various shots of the platoon 
               members on the perimeter  shaving eating cooking playing 
               etc

               towards the end of this voice over we cut to sgt barnes 
               moving towards the platoon pc a powerful face a quiet 
               angry fixed stare a thick trimmed moustache that helps 
               conceal a network of plastic surgery grafts and scars the 
               distortion from the jaw up the left side of his face to his 
               forehead punctuated by a severe indentation above the left 
               eye where a bullet once penetrated his skull

               walking with him is sgt oneill as they join wolfe sgts 
               elias and warren at the platoon pc where theyre huddled

                              wary silence

                              eager to elaborate

                         who do you want on ambush sergeant

               barnes doesnt bother acknowledging the question barely 
               glancing at the lieutenant to him a necessary evil everybody 
               knows whos really in charge of the platoon barnes flicks 
               his gaze to elias

               concluding the debate no further argument barnes rises  
               the meetings closed lt wolfe hasnt said a word looking

                         thinks hes cochise or something

               his resentment directed partly at the way in which elias 
               carries himself the natural sense of grace  and the dignity 
               it bestows

                                                                    cut to

               junior scowls swears looks around for his rifle in the 
               mud

               chris crawls back to his position curling himself up in his 
               soaked poncho teeth chattering from the cold rain 
               splattering over him a long beat he sighs the sigh kicking 
               off the next image

               chris jerks awake  very suddenly very frightened the rain 
               has stopped the jungle sounds are loud cicadas night 
               animals water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf and 
               the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains chewing 
               at chris face he looks around startled

               tex is asleep junior is asleep what happened he looks at 
               his watch the mosquitoes are eating him alive he buries 
               his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck 
               but he cant see a beat he moves again miserable from the 
               bites another beat then suddenly the sounds of the jungle 
               shift  some of the animals dropping out a different tone  
               a piece of wood is stepped on a rustle of bush

               chris sees something lifts an edge of the towel to peek 
               out

               a shadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 
               15 yards it looks like a man but it doesnt move at all 
               it listens

               chris his heart in his mouth tries to peer through it 
               its a bush it has to be no human being could stand that 
               still his heartbeats are up the moments take forever but 
               deep down  somewhere in his psyche  he knows who it is

               the figure now shifts ever so slightly  and moves it is a 
               human being oh my god

               chris looks around tex seems like a mile away why doesnt 
               anyone fire he casts a desperate look at his rifle at his 
               grenades encrusted with mud but in spite of all his training 
               he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his 
               enemy

               the figure seems to whisper something back then turns and 
               comes down the trail now a second and third figure appear 
               behind him  all in helmets and packs all coming right past 
               chris position ten yards nine

               chris is rigid with terror stark eyes pleading with tex to 
               wake up but out of reach he is about to have an anxiety 
               attack his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear 
               him

               the first figure is now directly in front of chris on the 
               trail looking left and right a rattle of his equipment a 
               creak of leather a smell the mans face now catches the 
               moonlight and his eyes come around on chris

               oriental eyes looking right at him startled chris staring 
               back hypnotized it all happens very fast the figure murmurs 
               something in vietnamese a warning he swivels

               a flash of muzzle fire a raking cough of automatic fire  a 
               grenade explosion

               chris is hurled to the ground helmet bouncing off scattered 
               confused jarred all hell breaks loose around him with noise 
               and shouts

               three explosions rip out into the night  and one of the 
               enemy is caught in a brief instant looking like an xray 
               his body lifted and swirling in the air then enveloped in 
               swirls of smoke

               chris alone breathes deep feeling the full effect

               ext base camp  night

               a relief against the long harsh hot day we see lights on 
               all over the camp sounds of music laughter from the 
               barracks

               int underworld hutch  night

               king leads chris down to a specially constructed cellarlike 
               hutch dug deep into the ground on an isolated edge of the 
               battalion perimeter ammo casing and canvas are piled over 
               it and sandbags surround it from the outside very little 
               sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door made 
               of ammo crates past a lookout adams pulling security 
               hitting a joint but alert king motions to him its cool

               inside is another world chris looking around amazed its 
               like a private cabaret for the heads who are there cooling 
               out boxes of food from the states beers whiskey bottles 
               crates functioning as tables hammocks hanging from poles 
               electric fans tape decks paraphernalia

               the boys are all dressed up in their saturday night rags  
               the clothes are clean the headbands the medallions are 
               out anything distinctive and individualistic on the 
               tapedeck jefferson airplanes go ask alice

               to chris it is a new world and rhah the resident head 
               sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red 
               bowl in a three foot long montagnard pipe seems to be the 
               lord of final judgment in this smoky underworld

               across his naked chest birds and snakes are tattooed around 
               his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side 
               on his knuckles love and hate are tattooed in his eyes 
               a dancing satanic fire a poor rural southern white in his 
               grizzled late 20s he could be a biker king giving chris 
               the onceover

                                     rhah

               chris understands takes the bowl hesitates then smokes 
               it the contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out  
               he starts coughing theyre all laughing

                              with distaste
                         if youre gonna do it man least do 
                         it right

               building up to it his eyes shaking with conviction at the 
               whole insanity of the world he neighs with all the venom he 
               can muster

                                     rhah
                         baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

               they all laugh and applaud king smoking from the pipe passing 
               it back to chris who takes another hit doesnt cough this 
               time looking around wondering about these guys

                                     lerner

               funny as chris finishes his hit on the pipe looks up across 
               the smoke already dazed surprised to see elias suddenly 
               there  leaning out of his sling in a far corner of the hooch  
               a monkey is draped around his neck with silver bracelets 
               rings a necklace  like a sensual little egyptian whore 
               elias playing with it spaced out in a sleeveless vest tiger 
               pants dancing eyes on chris he swings out the hammock 
               comes over with the monkey

               meanwhile manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of 
               blues directed at chris joined by big harold and francis 
               all of them clicking their hands

                                     manny  big harold  doc

               elias pulls out a remington 870 shotgun jacks it to the 
               rear points it at chris

                                     elias

               chris does so slowly a little worried elias takes a hit 
               and blows it down the bore  shotgunning it into chris 
               lungs chris staggers back coughing everybody laughs hey

               as he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl his eyes 
               performing a funny little hop skip and jump as he holds 
               it his face turning red

               the monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck worried 
               elias then blows the smoke out in its face the monkey hating 
               it

               the group laughs

               sign of acquiescence there is also the added element of

               of the bullets as they thud into the dirt yet his eyes remain 
               fixed on chris in wonderment

               chris firing out the magazine seems to expend his bloodlust  
               he ceases noticing  for the first time  the eyes of the 
               young man they arent stupid  nor fearful  but filled 
               with resignation and despair  a despair that chris in 
               disgust of himself recognizes

               chris lowers the rifle silent

               the young mans impassive face shines now with tears that 
               sad young look  as if death itself wouldve been a release

               the woman is still ranting when barnes turns to her quite 
               casually levels his m16 and puts a bullet in her head  
               she goes down as if poleaxed

               his face like a mime a click of the fingers and he leans

               mocking child danger in his soul excitement sex  the 
               elias that chris saw in the smoking session in base camp

               meters off snapping the magazine out of his ak to reload  
               a live gook

               chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in 
               the hole this is the moment chris realizes it its now or 
               never if chris intends to get the gook hes got to make a

               perfect he wont get another chance he heaves the frag 
               drops and rolls away the throw is perfect the golden arc 
               of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner it twists 
               cleanly in the hole the explosion muffled but deadly

               on his face he cant seem to believe he did it pointing 
               his m16 before him he advances on the hole looking over

               pushing his face back hits him hard once twice

               a knife whipped out of barnes boot and pressing against 
               chris throat chris bleeding from the nose and mouth

               rhah suddenly spinning into action fast now realizing what 
               barnes intends to do

               barnes eyes tremble in the candle light his scars ugly a 
               spasm clenching and locking his facial muscles then suddenly 
               he is calm again very calm we sense a man of enormous self
               control

               suddenly he flicks his knife across chris leaving a mark 
               below his left eye

               chris gasps looking up at barnes rising off him the boots 
               alongside his face

               the men looking on the tension lowering

               his forehead long hair blowing in the wind barnes mark 
               below his eyes slicked out now like a jungle veteran looking 
               down at the village where the massacre occurred

               the village is still a smoking ruin a few peasants and water 
               buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct

               bunny next to chris pops his gum indifferent barnes 
               next to him shifts reads a map

               rodriguez is praying his mouth moving without audible words 
               getting ready for the drop

               king is making last minute adjustments in his pack

               bunny now nudges chris points the church in the jungle 
               where elias was killed is visible an outline of the cemetery 
               uncomfortable memories play over chris face

               of the jungle now creeping up on the perimeter he turns and

               chris face as he sees the smoking man

               we come around and see what chris sees in the light of the 
               flame a face that smiles at him like a deaths head a large 
               ugly blister on his mouth whiskered pale  but smiling a 
               sick man wouldnt smile like this but he is smiling too 
               intimately as if he knows chris from way back but he 
               doesnt or does he perhaps it was the man chris first saw 
               at the airstrip when he came incountry the same expression 
               of evil of a man who has seen too much and died but still 
               lives

               chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him

               the man stands sucking on his cigarette stretches he is 
               thin and very tall towering over chris

               back a leisurely confident stroll in that moment there 
               is an explosion from way out in the jungle about a quarter

               the artillery keeps pounding into the ambush area now small 
               arms fire can be heard picking up at random spots along the 
               perimeter the battle like a tide is obviously moving closer 
               to them

                                     francis

               flares now shoot up over the perimeter reds greens yellows 
               squeaking as they float down on their parachute hinges 
               throughout the ensuing battle the perimeter is illuminated 
               at spotty intervals  sometimes arctic bright sometimes 
               unexplainably dark til new flares shoot up

               chris francis rhah all look up at the light and hug their

               runs out of the foxhole chris suddenly reacting to a noise 
               out front gripping francis and pointing to the sound

               a body is thrashing towards them about twentyfive yards 
               not yet visible but a little awkward and lungy in its 
               movement as if desperate

               francis tense is about to pop his grenade when chris grabs 
               him

                                     chris
                         hold it
                              loud whisper
                         who is it

               but the body keeps coming lurching now falling

                         no

               a pop  then a fizzle of blue light as the figure hits their 
               trip flare  revealing itself to be large with no helmet 
               and gasping terrified of the trip flare

                                     terrified soldier

                         in here man hurry

               the soldier now runs in like a fullback going down for the 
               tackle sprawling into the hole knocking chris and francis 
               down beneath him

               he is sweating terrified a white boy with an unrecognizable 
               filthy face no rifle no helmet his fatigues torn all over

               from the collision the soldier sucks down the canteen

                                     terrified soldier

               he tears off leaving francis in a state of incipient panic  
               he looks at chris

               just outside the bunker a master sergeant spots something 
               in the flarelight two figures with helmets running towards 
               him at an angle

                                     master sergeant
                         hey you boys which company you

               a sudden burst of fire cuts the sergeant down in his tracks 
               and the figures fly by

               soldiers in the immediate area spot them

                                     soldier 3

               int perimeter 3  battalion cp  night

               but the second sapper runs right into the bunker in a kamikaze 
               charge the light from inside momentarily revealing a bulky 
               satchel strapped on his person and the face of the astounded 
               major

               in their foxhole chris and francis look at the curling ball 
               of flame stunned

               shapes moving in the trees chris blows his claymore handles 
               one explosion on top of the other out front then return 
               fire flashes from a muzzle rakatak rakatak raka
               tak the heavier sound of an ak47

               chris opening up with his 16 then being blown down by a 
               grenade explosion at the edge of the foxhole then nothing 
               a pause chris ears ringing slightly concussed

               suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a 
               faulty loudspeaker crackling out from the jungle a pidgen 
               english the words mauled then a snatch of patriotic north 
               vietnamese music played from a scratchy old record

               chris uneasy looking at francis who looks terrified the 
               sound now of a whistle two hoots then a sharp third then 
               yelling

               chris grabbing francis arm pointing there is a voice 
               directly out to the front of them  muttering something in 
               vietnamese no more than 20 yards away but unseen its like 
               hearing a casual conversation from another room then the 
               sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions  
               encompassing the foxhole

                                     chris
                              to francis a whisper
                         out of the hole fast

               chris crawls out stops looks back francis wont leave 
               hugs the shelter

                                     chris
                              a fierce whisper
                         goddamit francis move your fucking 
                         ass now they gonna blow it

               reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out of 
               the hole francis finally sparked now moves out both of 
               them bellying it into the brush behind the hole

               not a moment too soon an rpg rocket whistling in

               the foxhole takes a direct hit caving in whirls of smoke 
               spinning off it

               chris and francis look back covered with debris they hear 
               movement

               shadows are swarming towards the foxhole firing into it to 
               finish them off

               francis grabs chris leg indicating they get out of there 
               chris hesitates  a moment a decision made now in angry 
               passion  rises up and charges the nva

               shadows scatter and tumble caught by his surprise close
               range fire

               chris moving forward into them blasting agile his instincts 
               finely tuned and totally insane in this moment of time 
               indifferent to his life he yells insanities pumping himself 
               up with the adrenaline of courage

                                     chris
                         die you motherfuckers yaaaaaaaaa

               screams from the dark shadows they fall

               chris smashing a wounded shadow with the butt of his gun 
               down into the foxhole he jumps back into it reoccupying 
               it blasting the dead gook

               opening fire out to the front driving the shadows back

               francis watching this amazed after a moment of doubt he 
               too tears back out to join chris in the foxhole unbelieving 
               as he jumps in with him

                                     francis
                              joining in the frenzy
                         yaaaaahhhh killlll

               then stunned again to see chris suddenly rise up out of the 
               foxhole and charging forward into the jungle he is now over 
               the edge

                                     chris
                              charging off into

               a shape suddenly out of nowhere looms up fast behind bunny 
               running at him

               junior insane now with fear runs smack into a tree knocked 
               senseless and reeling to the ground

               bunny turning back too late the crazy drughigh shape is 
               yelling something like

               and jumps right into the hole blasting bunny pointblank in 
               the chest

               bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole 
               thuck a boot in the gaping hole where his chest was bunny 
               his eyes uncomprehending a muzzle is jammed into his mouth 
               breaking his teeth with an ugly sound another yell from the

               it must be fast it must be a hard cold decision now

               he pulls out his kbar and with one last anguished hesitation 
               drives it into his thigh muscle

               francis yells out and collapses in his hole

               dirt waits tentatively as soldiers arrive at his hole 
               theyre a little awed by the sight of the toughlooking 
               oneill emerging from his foxhole like sgt rock dozens of

               rhah alive and well is poking around the nva corpses with 
               a long gnarled walking stick looking like a crazy johnny 
               appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles 
               and wearing a red bandana tied in a fourknot around his 
               head

               as one of the apc soldiers carves an ear off a dead nva 
               rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an nva 
               troop in full rigor mortis extracting what he thought was 
               there  a wrapped cellophane of heroin

               rhahs face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it then 
               snorts it with a certain satisfaction of triumph over the 
               grim circumstances

                                     rhah

               it all from somewhere deep in his brain passing

               groups of soldiers looking like bowery bums and moving like 
               rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs 
               with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed

               passing a bulldozed pit with heaps of nva bodies in them a 
               bulldozer pushing another set of bodies in like photos of a 
               nazi death camp

               nearby two burly soldiers lift a woman nurse and with a

               give a shit standing apart from the radios looking numbly 
               at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters

               chris intersects him now harris eyes looking blankly then 
               nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement just coming 
               to the edge of tears choking it back and turning back 
               these are his sons who are lost a good officer

               sgt oneill watches the loading process forlornly from the 
               distance captain harris intersects him

                                     harris

                         yes sir 

               and as harris moves away oneill is left thinking finally 
               there is a certain frustration to his actions he has taken 
               such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is 
               precisely to stay in this jungle inevitably his time will 
               come  one way or another

               his eyes now follow the medivac chopper upwards whatever is 
               left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it

               as the chopper rises off the battlefield chris who is 
               sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open

               now the trees the skyline and the chopper is moving fast 
               over the devastation the jungle forever locked in his memory

                         rest of my days as i am sure elias

                         two fathers but be that as it 
                         may those of us who did make it 
                         have an obligation to build again 
                         to teach to others what we know and 
                         to try with whats left of our lives 
                         to find a goodness and meaning to
