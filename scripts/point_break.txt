fade in

we are in the belly of a wave
light refracts in a constant collision of water
slow motion the hallucinatory prisms like liquid
diamonds taking flight dreamlike


ext  ocean  dusk

backlit against a flaming sun a solitary surfer glides
across the green glassy peak  time is stretched until his
movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world
total zen concentration  body weight centered eyes
forward and on the next section


ext  urban street  dusk

slow motion on a black sedan
creeping along store fronts  past a winchells
people splash steps down rainwashed sidewalks in dream
motion  the sedan turns past the first virginia bank and
into an alley


int  black sedan

two men and one woman in suspended time put on overcoats
and hats  under their hats strips of scotch tape stretch
taut from the base of their nose to their forehead
hideously distorting their features  makes them look like
human pigs


ext  ocean

silvery in this light almost metallic as if from some
futurescape  the lone surfer shreds a long endless
right wall
accelerating into real time  as he stares into the pit
digs in drops into the sweet spot on the wave hunkers
down
his moves becoming aggressive frenzied


int  black sedan

an m16 clip is smacked into place and cocked with a
cachack  ammo clips are snicksnicked into handgun butts
and a long clip is sssnicked into an uzi
watches are checked  the pig nose people nod to each
other


ext  bank

pig nose 1 steals into position near the glass doors
slams his back to the wall weapon to cheek breath fast


ext  ocean

fast now  the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face
of the wave  the surfer trims down the line pivoting the
board and going straight down carving the bottom  he
slashes viciously back toward the lip and

in a radical inverted air attack sails six feet above the
wave in an explosion of water


int  bank

baaaaaammm
glass doors explode open and pig nose 1 spins inside  he
fires a burst into the ceiling  brraamm

                         pig nose 1
          everybody on the floor

people drop
very fast here
two bandits handle bank employees and customers
another pig nose watches the door
pig nose 1 moves behind counter uzi and canvas sack in
hand


int  surveillance van

dark monitors show slow scans of the bank interior
two men wear headphones and black windbreakers with fbi
stenciled on the back  one watches with binoculars

                         binoculars
          bingo  were on  lets go
          wheres the big college
          quarterback  are you with us
          utah


ext  bank wall

a man in his twenties  his head spins revealing rain
slicked hair and face eyes wide bright  an edgy
handsomeness to him
he pops a stick of wrigleys in his mouth rests a shotgun
on one leg and leans against the wall  he wears a
headset through which we hear the fbi guy yelling for
him
this is johnny utah

                         binoculars filtered
          utah where the hell are ya

utah takes his headset off


int  bank

pig nose 1 leaps over the counter holds a canvas sack
filled with booty from tellers drawers

                         pig nose 1
          fuckin shake it

pig nose 2 nods with his snubby nose hurries toward the
exit


ext  first virginia bank

the bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the
alley where they jump into the sedan  the driver the
woman pig nose punches it and the tires whirrr on the
slick pavement
the sedan launches down the alley

utah running  like a freight train  splashing through a
crossalley  he doesnt break stride as he slams his
shoulder into a large steel garbage dumpster
driving it like a football training sled into the alley
where

the sedan locks em up seconds too late as it skids and
slams into it crunching into the brick wall and
still alive  grinds into reverse back down the alley
headlights smashed it guns it backward as

utah leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car
he has a brick in his right hand  he cocks it back
johnny heaves the brick thirty yards and

smash  the brick explodes into the windshield
spiderwebbing the glass
lady pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into
her face

                         lady pignose
          son of a bitch

the car slews backward onto the street slamming a parked
car  lady pignose slams the thing into drive cuts the
wheel hard and punches it skidding on wet pavement

utah hurtles from the alley  he leaps somehow tackles
the drivers door handle and is dragged along the street
he pulls himself up reaches inside the window and whips
the steering wheel hard right

the sedan fishtails into a parked toyota  utah bounces
forward slamming into the asphalt  glass shards and
crushed steel are strewn everywhere as radiator steam
whistles hot

pig nose 2 riding shotgun is trapped  cant get his
crushed door open  the driver pushes open her door
gropes for her pistol  utah springs  no respect for a
lady  he slams the door pins her arm and slams again and
again until the gun drops  utah kicks it away as the
woman collapses in pain

pig nose 1 bails out and runs across parking lot  utah
leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the
shotgun

                         utah
          halt  fbi

pig nose 1 spins  we sense reckless anger  he raises
the uzi  utah squeezes the trigger

no death  no blood
just buzzers and flashing bulbs
pig noses flak vest lights up like a pinball machine
utahs laser weapon hit the kill zone  pig nose rips
the tape off his face and the fbi cadet shakes his head in
disgust

observers step forward  bank customers  bank tellers
all fbi personnel  medical staff offer the woman driver
assistance  pig nose 1 heads for johnny but is subdued
by other agents

                         pig nose 1 fbi cadet
          i wanna say just two words to you
          asshole simulation  johnny
          fuckin utah  guys like you will do
          anything to win

utah stares back in defiance
the surveillance van pulls up nearby
binoculars runs out and pinches two fingers together
right in johnnys face

                         binoculars
          this far utah  youre this far
          from being the most overqualified
          guy burger king ever had  get me

                         utah
          yes sir  sir

                         binoculars

johnny gestures to the car

                         utah
          i did stop the perpetrators

utah turns to go  as he passes he casually raises his
lasershotgun and retriggers pig noses flak vest
lights and buzzers
pig nose explodes  more agents restrain him
screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys
utah walks off down the simulated street past a sign
which bears the fbi seal and reads combat village
quantico virginia

                                            dissolve to

red sky  a luminous pacific  five foot faces  nice

underwater

a blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines
voom  a figure rockets down into frame in a curtain of
bubbles  a gawky agent in less than stylish fbi trunks
flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom
of a pool


int  gymnasium pool  day

the pool casts wavy distortions upon two dozen men all
grumbling as they stand in line wearing tshirts with fbi
logos sweats and sneakers  we hear a splash and the men
shuffle forward

                         pappas vo
          the dolls love this baby  it brings
          them luck when they rub it  right
          between their buttons

close on tape measure wrapped around a generous belly
pull back to reveal veteran agent corey measuring the
ample waist of angelo pappas  this 54 year old silver
haired greek stands rubbing his belly like a zulu chief

                         corey
          angelo we need a bigger tape

                         pappas
          just read the goddamn number

          still a 46  maybe we can cinch it
          down wear a girdle

                         pappas
          screw you and this holistic fitness
          crap  at least my arms dont flap
          in the wind

corey secretly squeezes his bicep as
a whistle blows  a broad shouldered man wearing an fbi
cap barks at the greek

                         big shoulders
          okay pappas lets put on the
          blindfold  wanna see you retrieve
          at least two bricks from the bottom

johnny utah enters the pool area in the distance  says
something to one of the agents  is pointed toward us as
corey ties the blindfold and guides pappas to the edge of
the pool

                         pappas
          ive been in the field 33 years
          fired my piece 23 times in the line
          of duty and i got no idea what a
          blind man fetching bricks has gotta
          do with being a special agent

johnny has walked up  pappas blindfolded turns directly
to utah as he continues thinking its corey

                         pappas
          added to which indignity i got
          three months left to retirement and
          they saddle me with some blueflamer
          fresh out of quantico for a partner
          some quarterback punk johnny unitas
          or something

                         utah
          the shit they pull huh

pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool
huge backblast of water  the other agents hoot and
holler
corey swears and wipes off his clipboard
johnny steps to the edge looks down
we see the blindfolded pappas groveling along the bottom
the other agents cheer as pappas heads for the surface

                         corey
          here he comes  hold up a fish
          hell take it right outta your hand

pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters
for breath  he grabs the edge and angrily slaps two
bricks on the tiles  he rips off the blindfold looks up
and frowns

a hand enters frame to help him up  pappas takes it and
johnny hauls him on deck

                         corey
          hey shamu this is your guy

pappas eyes the new agent warily  extends his hand

                         pappas

int  sedan  day

series of tight shots
ecu sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the
seconds
magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun
velcro straps of second chance body armor are fastened
white gloves are pulled snug over strong hands
a silk tie is straightened  a shotgun slide is cocked
the sweep hand approaches the twelve
a latex mask is pulled over the back of a mans head

                         voice
          the little hand says

the mask turns into full closeup  it is ronald reagan

facing three shotguns and one very large handgun
reagan sights down the pistol

                         reagan
          use a gun go to heaven

the guard freezes  white and sweaty
tricky dick slips up to him and collects the pistol
kennedy covers the stunned customers

          all tellers step back from the
          counter  hands on heads  move

the presidents move fast
reagan leaps onto the counter  stands up where he can see
all
nixon hurdles to tellers side and they start moving down
the line together  reagan controlling the room as nixon
quickly empties the tellers cash drawers into the sack
his hands move like lightning

                         reagan
          just stay cool  everybody stay
          cool  heads down  eyes down  the

          another 45 seconds of your time
          thats all  then  whoa tricky
          dick

nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and
tosses it to the bank manager  who reflexively catches
it
then drops it like a hotpotato just before
it explodes into a cloud of blue ink  the manager is dyed
blue
burnt money showers on the terrified customers

kennedy exits first followed by reagan
lbj pauses under the surveillance camera drops his
trousers and moons  thank you is written across his white
butt

high angle distorted wide shot  lbj hoists his pants and
splits followed out by nixon who exits backward with the
famous double peacesign held high overhead

whaaaaam  johnny is clobbered by a wave
hes flipped off his board and hits the water facefirst
as the wave crashes over him  other surfers steer clear

pappas lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink
shorts purple vuarnets and a tshirt emblazoned with
surf this across the chest  a picnic basket sits close
at hand  he winces at utahs wipeout  shouts from his
beach chair

                         pappas
          i think you gotta hit them straight
          on

                         utah
                  out of breath
          got it

utah holds the tip steady gouges the face of a wave and
squirts out the other side  another wave rises and utah
glides up over the hump  he clears the swell and the
ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake  triumphant
over having made the lineup he sits up on the board and
falls over

pappas slices a green apple some feta cheese and eats off
the knife

utah climbs back on his board  whistles and hoots sound
as surfers spot a new swell  utah watches as the regulars
start catching rides  suddenly he feels like a lost dog
on a busy freeway
a young local in a neon wetsuit slashes past him inches
away

                         local
          outta the way you dick

another shredding viciously is blasting toward him

                         local 2
          move it kook

johnny paddles rapidly ducks under
sees another bigger wave coming
pissed off at himself at the downycheeked hotshots
at the frustration he turns his board around and starts
paddling hard
he somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the
top of the board then struggles up  hes standing 
sort of
arms pinwheeling he topples in a nasty crash
right in front of a shavedhead surfer on full
afterburner

johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray  his board
shoots out
it smashes sideways into razorhead
the guy does an ugly endo
utah comes up gasping for air arms flailing
his board floating a few feet away tugging at his ankle
he drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath
razorhead already back on his board paddles over
points to a small dent in the fiberglass

                         razorhead
          you dinged my board kook

utah looks up in apology as
a crushing right hook smacks his face
knocks him under
razorhead pulls a knife from a sheath held by a thong
around his neck  as johnny surfaces razorhead slashes in
a vicious arc
severing utahs leash close to the board
his flamejob surfboard bobs away

                         razorhead
          politeness counts asshole

the surf punk plunges under a wave disappearing

                         utah
          goddamn sonofa

before utah can finish another wave engulfs him and he
tumbles to shore razorhead nowhere to be seen

on pappas as johnnys flamejob board washes in at his
feet  he calmly picks it up as utah staggers into frame
out of the kneedeep whitewash  johnny rubs his jaw
spits blood

                         pappas
          kid maybe this aint your sport

utah grabs the board out of pappas hands and stalks off
across the beach


int  utahs bedroom  night

johnny dead asleep  silence  then brrrrr
he jacknifes up like he just took 20000 volts  his eyes
read panic  he rolls up legs scissor against tangled
sheets and he collapses over empty boxes  he stumbles
like a blind man through the mess until he finds
a tiny indianapolis colts football helmet with a digital
clock for eyes  500 am  johnny emits a drawn out
groan


ext  ocean  dawn

deafening boom as a monster wave crashes below a sky the
color of slate  a distant pacific storm has brought the
swell  10 foot faces  glassy green walls the size of
houses beckoning from beyond the soup

a lone figure bobbing out beyond the break
the surfer disappears behind the swell
then reappears grinning across the smooth offshore
barrel

utah wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard
craning forward to get a better look
the surfer is a woman
she moves with liquid grace in perfect harmony with the
sea long hair flying out behind her  she undulates like
a dancer
dipping carving slicing making it look sooooo easy
johnny shakes his head  oh man if she can do it

                         utah
          fuck it

he stands grabs his board and heads out into the icy
foam

ocean break
a horizon of whitecaps churn behind him
he lies on his board rising and dropping with the swell
so far so good  he spots a wave  a fluid graygreen
house rising forever rising  utah turns  paddles  the
house catching him lifting him high upon its roof

utah is committed  he gets to his feet as his board
slices along the lip  he peers over the falls down the
face  holy shit   it looks like niagara  he loses
balance and spirals airborne falling bullseye into the
impact zone  the entire force of the wave crashing upon
him plunging him down into the

washing machine underwater

where he spins like a whirling dervish lashed to a
slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of god
he is held prisoner in a greygreen churning nightmare
like a sixton pit bull has him by the neck shaking him
he looks around  cant tell up from down
wham  his head slams into the bottom  rocks and sand
stunned he struggles toward the light finally bursting
to the

surface  gasping for breath
the good news is hes breathing the bad news is hes
surfaced in the impact zone  another wave crashes down
stuffing him back into the washing machine  leaving no
sign of life in the white froth  the orangeade surfboard
launches high into the sky spinning like a misfiring
trident missile trailing its broken leash like a kite
tail

in the washing machine utah tumbles in a cold green hell
his chest is convulsing needing air now
suddenly a figure lunges down into frame
a hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him
toward

the surface  the woman surfer bursts through the foam
grabs her board for leverage  hauls utahs head above the
water with one strong arm
he is choking coughing slapping fatigued arms against
the surf panic registering in his movements

                         woman surfer
                  yelling above the
                   roar
          swim goddammit  come on  move
          it

the woman gets her board under one of his arms for support
and sidekicks fiercely into the wave holding him in a
painful grip
with powerful strokes she helps utah make it to calmer
water outside the break  the big waves just forming up
lift them and drop them as they pass  muted thunder when
the waves hit the beach  she drags him half onto her
surfboard
practically slamming his face into the board
hes coughing out saltwater

on the woman our first good look at her
she is exquisite  hair slicked tight to her high
cheekboned face she looks sleek and feral with eyes that
burn bright
especially when shes pissed

                         woman
          look crazy son of a bitch  you
          wanna commit suicide you do it
          someplace else

she undoes her leash and swims rapidly off returning in a
few seconds with johnnys board  he takes it from her and
flops over it still coughing
wipes at the saltsnot running out of his nose
there is a cut over his eye from when he rearranged the
rocks on the bottom

                         woman
          look at this pigboard pieceashit
          its still got the price tag on it
          for chrissakes  whatd you do buy
          it yesterday  youve got no
          business out here whatsoever

still gagging and gasping johnny manages a goofy grin

                         utah
          well i saw you and

                         woman
          yeah you saw me and you figured
          that if a mere girl can do it a big
          strong stud like you shouldnt have
          any problem  right  well you
          figured wrong dork

she yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away
from him

                         utah
          hey  uh how do i get back in

                         woman
                  without turning
          carefully tough guy  very
          carefully

                         utah
                  yelling now
          my names johnny utah

                         woman
          who cares

                         utah
          im telling you so when you look
          back on this moment you can
          think there was this guy named
          utah and he was pretty much a dork
          but maybe not such a bad person and
          i let him drown in conditions he had
          no business being in whatsoever
          when i could have easily helped him

johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore
thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him
hes stoic in the face of certain death

                         utah
                  over his shoulder
                   gamely
          bye

                         woman
          wait  jesus christ
                  swimming back to
                   him
          youre fucking crazy you know that
          you go in there youre gonna eat it
          on the rocks  here follow me

the woman paddles parallel to the shore and utah pumps
along behind her  she gets him away from the rocks then
starts watching the incoming swell timing it to the lull
between sets

                         woman
          go when i say  but stay down  just
          lie on the board  alright lets
          go

utah paddles rapidly following her watching what she
does
he is borne up by a low glassy wall
he bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak
tumbles  stands unsteadily grabbing his board  runs
clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes
sucking water out
on terra firma he looks back to see the woman kickout
gracefully and disappear beyond the wave

he flops on the sand  shivering  miserable

starts down the wall

watches intently

utah backlit in glorious slow motion tries a little turn
and feels his feet slip out  he slams down buttfirst on

blast of diamond spray

wet towel at his ass cheering him up

a lone surfer slashing through the pilings of the pier  a
real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind
him
silhouetted against a crimson sky and backlit spray the
figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion
that is somehow balletic
laying out bottom turns torquing his body and blasting
the lip a few times moving so fast his long dark hair
stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car
window on the freeway

trims down the volcanic wall carves the bottom pivots
pumps to the top gouging the lip getting six feet of
air

suddenly a football whistles through the air above utahs
head
he watches as
the bodhisattva board under arm walking out of the
whitewater makes a onehanded chest catch

a few yards away two teams of surfers play football
utah gazes down the beach at the bodhisattva
almost 30 years old his body lean and hard as a tree
trunk  hardness in the face accented by long comanche
hair

catch  bullseye  she shoots bodhi a look  something
crosses her face
bodhi smiles  tyler doesnt  then it passes
she chucks the ball to utah
who drops his board and makes the catch in one move
he spins the football on his fingertip drops it on his
foot kicks it up into his hands  razzle dazzle  he
grins evilly

he keeps balled up in his other hand

                         utah

ext  latigo beach  day

extreme long lens scans the beach from a height  a gray
miserable day  beach crowd thin except for diehards

the image drifts across faces bodies  surfers walking
with boards
talking sitting with pubescent girls
the image settles on johnny astride his board bobbing
beyond the break

on pappas scanning with powerful binoculars from his car

close on utah out among the flock of hardcore surfers
ostensibly waiting for a wave his eyes search the others
around him clicking methodically from face to face
finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a
ride
the modest wave carries him toward the beach as he
balances tense and styleless

he passes someone weve seen before  the razorhead from
the first day  in concentration johnny doesnt see the
guy
but razorhead definitely sees him

johnny reaches the beach and jogs up the sand  he picks
up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair  a
glimpse of the walkietalkie hidden beneath

                         utah
          big zippo so far  how about you

                         pappas radio
          patience hotshot  patience  itll
          be subtle if its here at all

pappas watches as johnny crosses toward the outside shower
next to the public restroom
long lens view of utah passing out of sight behind the
building

at the shower johnny sets down his gear and opens his
wetsuit to the warm saltfree jet of water  tracking
slowly in on him as he lets it pour over his face
a hand enters frame shutting off the water suddenly

tight on utah his eyes opening

reverse revealing razorhead and three others
they are powerfully built surfnazis
scalps shaved on the sides  hair military short on top
lengthening into pigtails in the back  tattoos  wrist
chains

before is bunker  they spread out flanking him

                         warchild

                         bunker

                  good natured
          okay so this is where you tell me
          all about how locals rule and yuppie
          insects like me shouldnt be surfing

          were just going to fuck you up

                         utah
          oh

as they lunge utah grabs his board and swings it in a
whistling roundhouse  its edge slams warchild in the gut
and folds him double  the bad news is warchild gets an
arm around it and brings a piledriver hammerpunch down
the board splits into two pieces
utah drops his end as the others close  a flurry of
punches and kicks most of which he blocks  but hes lost
the offensive
bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karatestyle
sidekick

tight on utahs towel talking with pappas voice

                         pappas
          johnny  you there

angelo gets out of the car fast  he jogs twenty feet and
raises the binoculars  catches a glimpse of the carnage
around the edge of the building  breaks into a run
massive legs pistoning

johnny hits the ground hard  he rolls and comes up fast
the razorhead brothers are a little surprised

                         archbold
          the dude can fight

warchild grabs utah from behind  gets him in a headlock
archbold and tone pin his arms  bunker starts working him
like a practice bag  at this moment johnny is getting
the proverbial shit beat out of him
suddenly a new figure blurs into frame

bodhi seizes bunker and flings him aside  he spins with
remarkable agility and drives his heel into warchilds
face
utah breaks free staggering back on the sand  the fight
is still there in his eyes

bodhi is at his side  holding the others at bay with a
raised hand and an evil look

                         bodhi
          back off  now  just let it go

                         bunker

                  holding his bleeding
                   nose
          fuck you

everybody has backed off a bit panting
utah steps toward bunker  like hes maybe going to shake
hands

johnny answers with a lightning roundhouse that hits with
a crack  they can hear it in pomona
bunker hits the ground  flat out  lights out
tone archbold and warchild lunge like dogs
bodhi yanks utah out of the line of fire

                         bodhi

          it a rest
                  to utah

they begin to walk stepping over the pieces of johnnys
board

                         bodhi
                  under his breath
          do me a favor johnny just keep
          walking

tone starts to go after them  archbold grabs his arm
they help bunker up  warchild holds he bleeding nose
utah and bodhi start up the stairs turn a corner and run
headon into a huffing pappas
the big man clocks a battered but intact utah
we see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a
second

eighty feet below

they are immediately distracted by the small crowd
gathering around grommet who has his nose pressed flat
against the center of a dart board
his eyes swivels back to roach standing fifteen feet
away dart in hand getting ready to throw

                         grommet
          do your worst man

roach drains a beer in one gulp spies the sharp needle
point of the dart then squints at the target
rosie moves through the small crowd collecting bets

suddenly roaches arm snaps back  a collective hush
in a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is
airborne

twaaapppppp  bullseye  centimeters from flesh  grommet
secretly exhales  roach howls as rosie rains money on his
head
the crowd goes wild

utah studies her a moment  hes caught the faintest hint
of regret in her voice  but also the straightahead
pragmatism  he looks down at the waves pounding
mercilessly against the rocks

bodhi glides into the group and sits his expression dark
and enigmatic  the beautiful girl kneels behind him
massaging his neck  he seems not to notice

nathaniel howls
tyler watches utah watching bodhi  notices how he is
mesmerized by these war stories  bodhi smiles
unexpectedly

he and nathaniel slap a warm brotherly handshake
utah notices that tyler is giving him a dark look
she gets up suddenly and walks away from the group

                         utah
                  to the surfers
                   covering
          uh  i need another beer

he heads out after tyler


int  hallway  den

johnny moves through the house looking for her  as he
passes the den he sees tyler standing inside and goes
into the dark room
it is the only personalized space we have seen in the
house
a kind of shrine to the bodhisattva
shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels
maori masks a blowgun a skeletal shark mouth two feet
across a huge fossil ammonite an unbelievable variety
of tribal artifacts and marine specimens
the books include political literature eastern religion
philosophy  a strange hodgepodge of titles and authors
nietzsche marx the tao steal this book the book of
five rings frederick forsyth thrillers

tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and johnny walks
up behind her  shots of bodhi surfing a monster wave
mountainbiking skydiving flying an ultralight airplane
bungeecord jumping cliff diving
every kamikaze activity in the book

                         tyler
          bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies
          i hope youre not buying into this
          banzaibullshit like the rest of
          bodhis moonies

                         utah

          johnny  youve got it  and bodhi
          can smell it a mile away  hell
          take you to the edge and past it
                  she looks past
                   johnny sees
                   something
          hey bodhi

utah turns  bodhi is in the doorway

                         bodhi
          johnny has his own demons dont
          you johnny

bodhi seems to stare into him
utah breaks the look  turns back to the photo gallery
bodhis eyes swivel  he ponders something  looks at
tyler

                         bodhi
          feel it

roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway
wondering what happened to their leader  he turns to
them

                         bodhi
          gentlemen its time

hoot and cheers  everyone bursts into motion  yelling
and running through the house

                         utah
          whats goin on

                         tyler
          swells here johnny  bodhi always
          knows

bodhi returns from another room with an allblack
surfboard  it gleams like obsidian  near the tip in
small gray letters it says stealth fighter  bodhi
thrusts it into johnnys hands
the others whoop maniacally
johnny feels the challenge  the pull of the tribe

                         bodhi
          lets go utah  time for a little
          stealth mission

                                            cut to

ext  latigo beach  night

six dark figures walk toward us out of shafts of light
the headlights of bodhis chevy 4wd and tylers porsche
the figures are bodhi johnny tyler and the other
surfers
rosie hangs back with the idling vehicles tattooed arms
crossed  he puffs on a cigarette

a wide shot matte of the beach shows a pool of light
from the headlights beyond it a vast silver ocean under a
black sky  the full moon casts the world in cold
monochrome  the little figures reach the sea

                         roach
                  a voice in the
                   distance
          gaping barrels  way overhead man

closer as moonlit figures run into the water
utah stands on the beach hoping his eyes will adjust

                         utah
          i can barely do this in broad
          daylight

                         tyler
          come on  at least no ones gonna
          see how bad you are

johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the
water
he strokes powerfully out through the black swell

utahs ebony board pierces the wave and he slides down the
backside to where the others are waiting  roach and
nathaniel silhouettes nearby see one they like and take
off yelling
johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him

                         utah
          i gotta be fucking crazy

                         bodhi
          yeah but are you crazy enough

grommet gets a ride slicing across in front of them
a ghost moving off into the silvery distance
tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one  its
johnnys turn

                         bodhi
          footballs a manmade game  you
          keep score with numbers  but in
          this theres no field no rules no
          opponent  just you and the wave

                         utah
          i know that part  tell me something
          i can use here

                         bodhi
          ive watched you once or twice  you
          surf like its some kind of street
          fight  you jerk along from moment
          to moment fighting everything that
          comes at you  always trying to win

                         utah
          a flaw im working on

                         bodhi
          the only way to win out here is to
          surrender  you have to feel what
          the wave is doing accept its
          energy get in sync  just feel it
          all moving in the blackness you
          dont need to see

                         utah
          yeah right vision is highly over
          rated

bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline
without looking back he senses the incoming swell

                         bodhi
          this ones got your name on it
          johnny

utah looks  huge glassy face perfectly formed  black
and terrifying

                         bodhi
          lets go

bodhi digs in with both hands driving himself forward
johnny starts grabbing water right behind him  the wave
picks them up

                         utah
          shit im gonna die  im gonna die
          now

johnny uses the patented tylerpop and makes it to his
feet  suddenly hes going like a shot
he moves back on the board trims out slowing down
maintains a fragile control
on pure adrenalized instinct heart pounding he falls in
behind bodhi taking the same line along the roaring black
face

bodhi is like the silver surfer ahead of him in the
moonlight
not wanting to drop too far behind johnny walks a little
forward on the board  the nose dips picking up speed

johnny starts letting the speed work for him learning
that he can make long floating turns up and down the
glassy face

feeling the water under his feet the tons of water piling
up behind him feeling its awesome power and borrowing a
little of it

the silver surfer and the quarterback rocket through the
night
utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face
bodhi looks back  gives him a thumbs up
then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom
slashing back and climbing
utah tries it feels the drop like freefall feels the
speed
he makes his bottom turn nearly falling
the grin dropping off his face

he falls in behind bodhi again as the wave wraps over them
like a great black wing

tyler paddling back out watches them shoot past her
utah raises his arms above his head and howls like a gonzo
wolf as they go by
she grins to herself watching him
knows hes gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for
life


ext  beach parking lot

rosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement
firepit

angle through the heat haze above the flames  tyler
punches through a few feet away  she paddles toward him
coming alongside

                         tyler
          you had enough

                         utah
          yeah  i just want to sit out here
          for a minute

he watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle
swell between sets lifts and drops them  his face is
somehow childlike
a slow grin spreads itself across his face

                         tyler
          look at you

                         utah
          what

                         tyler
          well usually you have this sort of
          intense scowl of concentration like
          youre doing this for a school
          project or something i dont
          know like somethings driving you
                  she puts her
                   fingertip to  his
                   forehead
          see its gone  if i didnt know
          better id say you looked almost
          happy

                         utah
          i i dont know  i cant describe
          what im feeling

                         tyler
                  smiling
          you dont have to

her face seems luminous in the moonlight  the ocean
silver  the shore a shimmering line of gold  the sky
black velvet

utah turns to tyler eyes exploring her as in a dream
water beads on her dark skin like crawling diamonds
he glides closer holding her board like an uneasy horse
alongside his
he runs his fingertips down her arm

                         utah
          goosebumps  come here

she leans closer and he rubs his hands up and down her
arms warming her  his hands stop on her shoulders
he pulls her to his mouth  her tongue meets his
she wants this
he is surprised by the fierceness of her kiss which
overwhelms his

tight on the zipper of her shorty wetsuit as johnnys
fingers draw it down  slowly down to where it ends
between her legs
he spreads the front and slips his hands inside along her
ribs

                         tyler
          those are cold

                         utah
          warm them up

she moves his strong hand onto her breast
his fingers massage her coldstiffened nipple
she moans and grabs his wet hair in her other hand
pulling him into another intense kiss


ext  ocean  underwater

looking up from the bottom  we see the silhouettes of two
boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight
camera tilts down to show the bottom
the dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks
a big shark browses gracefully ignoring the lovers
their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored

                                            dissolve to

ext  beach  night

tylers porsche stands alone in an empty lot
her surfboard sticks up in back next to utahs stealth
fighter
rosies fire is burning low
tyler halfwrapped in a blanket from the car straddles
johnny on the sand like she straddles her board  the
blanket slips down
naked silhouettes in the firelight
she arches her back as they move together in prefect sync
grips his shoulders and stares into his face her teeth
bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain
she makes love like she does everything with honesty
and intensity
utah surprisingly is gentle and slow
he strokes her hair after she collapses onto him

                                            dissolve to

ext  beach  dawn

ecu johnny as he cracks one eye open registering the dawn
light
he bolts up looking around  tyler is asleep beside him
with the quilt from the car pulled up tight to her chin
she looks radiant in sleep
he grabs his watch out of the sand and looks at it

                         utah
          holy shit

long lens on utahs sedan fishtailing through the alley
narrowly missing dumpsters and parked cars
he pulls up next to several unmarked fbi sedans  no one

utah jumps out tucking in yesterdays shirt stuffing his
beretta into his waistband  he also shoves a small
leather case into his belt

utah pulls open the door to one of the unmarked cars and
rips a walkietalkie out of the charging rack on the front
seat
running he passes a gate  goes back  looks

his pov  four men huddled behind a garage  cole munoz
and two other agents  all with guns and walkietalkies

pappas has his shirt hiked up as another agent babbit
tapes a microphone transmitter to his stomach  pappas
talks into his top button

pappas pulls the loose hawaiian shirt down over the radio
mike gear and his stalwart 38 snub
he steps out from behind a fence and walks along the
sidewalk toward bunkers house two doors down  he is
wearing polyester shorts and sandals and carrying a dog
leash

                         pappas
          here scooby  where are you boy
          here scooby  you furball piece of
          shit

cole and munoz snap around the corner of the garage and
sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house

utah circles back out through the alley  tracking with
him as he makes it to the neighbors back hedge and crab
walks toward bunkers house  babbit and another agent
make it to the front corner of the stucco house staying
out of sight of the windows

angelo is walking up to the fallingdown porch of this
lowrent roachhotel

johnny is elbowcrawling between the house and a tall
hedge
he slides quietly in below a bedroom window
he pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his
waistband  removes something from it  a dental mirror
moving slowly he raises it above the window sill angling
it where he can see inside

tight on dental mirror johnnys pov
we see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind
tone is lying on the bed wearing headphones  cranked up
speedmetal
his eyes are screwed shut and his fists pump to the beat
like karate on 40000 volts
the door to a bathroom is open and the blackhaired girl
can be made out behind rippled shower glass

tight on doorbell as pappas rings it

utah jumps at an explosion of sound  he spins in a
microsecond pistol aimed at a lawn mower
through the hedge we can just see the neighbor sixtyish
and polyester clad as he adjusts the choke on the roaring
machine about two feet from johnnys face  utah exhales
and lowers the gun  wipes sweat from his eyes

tight on pappas smiling openfaced and goofily charming
as

the door opens revealing a girl we havent seen before
she has hair like bleached fiberglass black eyemakeup
and nails  ramonesstyle wardrobe  she looks tense and
wont open the door very far

                         fiberglass
          no

utah blinks at what he sees

his pov in the little mirror
like a silent pantomime under the roar of the mower he
sees bunker and warchild come flying into the room
they are hyper and manic  eyes wild
bunker leaps clear over the bed
grabs a combat shotgun from the closet  throws it to
warchild  tone is oblivious
bunker thumps him in the chest and tone leaps up like an
overwound toy gaping what the fuck we read his lips
saying
bunker grabs a steyr assault rifle white knuckled while
tone fumbles around and comes up with a 45 colt auto

                         utah
                  into his headset
          babbit  get angelo out of there

warchild slams into the wall next to bunker

                         warchild
          theres two guys by the back door
          ducked down

          christ man im gonna blow the dude
          up

scared and vicious like a cornered dog  we believe him
bunker jacks the bolt on the steyr  warchild cocks the
shotgun


ext  house

johnny is pissing himself  he can see it all going down
so fast he doesnt have time to think
he goes into motion  slipping rapidly along the wall to
the next window
the bathroom window

pappas at the front door makes his move
he pushes the door open breaking the security chain and
jams his fbi shield in the girls face as he grabs her
arm

                         pappas
          fbi gorgeous  now lets take a
          look around


int  house

bunkers eyes bug out as he sees pappas coming through the
door  he snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder
suddenly johnny is behind him  halfin the bathroom
window pistol gripped doublehanded like they taught him
in quantico

                         utah
          fbi  drop it

bunker whips around  squeezing off a wild burst  bbb
blam
it rips the plaster next to johnnys shoulder
shatters the shower door behind him  the blackhaired
girl screams
johnny flinches firing rapidly  wild
bunker drops hit
warchild lets go with the 12 gauge  kaboom
takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by
johnnys head
deafening in the confined space
johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe
tone just splits  down the hall like a greyhound

pappas is on one knee his piece drawn fast holding
fiberglass in a necklock with one massive arm
bunker wildeyed and bleeding is on his knees in the
bathroom doorway
he raises the steyr  mistake

angelo fires  30 years in the field tends to show
three rounds  chest  chest  head
bunker is off the planet

munoz kicks the backdoor in like they do in the movies
he and cole charge into the rancid kitchen  badass fbi
agents

johnny hotwired and hyperventilating pops out for a shot
around the doorframe  he gets a glimpse of warchilds
back disappearing into the hallway  fires  his shot is
wasted punching plaster

suddenly a pink freighttrain hits him
he forgot about the girl in the shower
naked except for her tattoos she bodyslams him facefirst
into the wall
as he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and
hammers his head into the medicinecabinet  crash 
shattering the mirror
then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the
wall into her
she drives her elbow into his back as he drops
freight train lands kneefirst on his gun hand and
viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot  it
skitters under the bed

shes cut up from flying glass  demoneyed and wired her
body lithe and muscular under white skin  she sprints
across the bedroom leaving utah slumped heaving for
breath

in the hallway tone is hidden behind a doorway
whiteknuckling the fortyfive  a wildeyed kid with a
big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it
he hears footsteps pounding behind him and spins
its warchild running with the shotgun

                         warchild
          move it man  lets get the fuck
          out of here

offguard tone is slammed by the door as munoz drives
into it with his shoulder
pounded between the door and wall tone is wired so tight
he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own
right foot
he screams and drops to the floor
munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on
warchild who dives into a doorway
cole drives past munoz who has tone pinned and pounds
down the corridor

cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on
warchild
freighttrain appears behind him from another door
she raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his
back up to the hilt
pulls them out going for another stab when
pappas spins her around and slams her facefirst into the
wall

utah in the bedroom sees warchild blur across his field
of vision
on pure instinct he kicks into overdrive  johnny leaps
the bed and goes ballistic  his flying tackle catches
warchild at the window


ext  house

the window explodes outward in a spray of sunlit glass
utah and warchild crash to the ground
the razorhead with 50 pounds on johnny rises like a
bull
bleeding from superficial lacerations warchild plows
through the hedge
johnny dives after him
the polyester neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed
figures careen toward him  he is knocked flying and the
roaring lawnmower is flipped onto its side

utah and warchild are locked together
the shotgun lies nearby out of play
warchild jerks a 6 inch knife free from its sheath
hanging from a thong around his neck  he trusts straight
at johnnys throat
johnny deflects the thrust  into the whirling lawnmower
kawhanggg  the knife is hammered out of warchilds
hand
whistles away spinning

warchild grabs johnny as they scramble and heaves him
bodily toward the spinning blade  utah catches the rim of
the mower with both hands stopping himself inches from
the rotor
warchild puts all his weight on johnny
pushing him facefirst toward the blades
johnny feels the wind on his face
the engine is roaring full throttle

pappas appears behind them
he aims the 38  fires twice
the little briggs  stratton dies young its casing
shattered
the rotor spins to a stop
warchild looks up into the black eye of pappas gun
two inched from his face

                         pappas
          speak into the microphone

the razorhead sags the fight going out of him
babbit kicks him off johnny face down onto the lawn
cuffs him


int  bathroom  bedroom  later

utah dry heaves over the sink  turns the faucet on full
blast and hoses his head  he lifts a dripping face wipes
water out of his eyes stops on the reflection in the
mirror  pappas is there

                         pappas
          its always been lasers and paper
          targets until today right

utah looks up at him and nods  he glances through the
doorway at bunker dead in a pool of blood  tone is
wailing as paramedics work on his foot  cole is being
taken out on a stretcher

                         pappas
          no difference utah  just a little
          more to clean up
                  squeezes the
                   rookies  shoulder
          its alright  you did good today

across the bedroom agent babbit rips the back off a big
speaker unit  behind it taped to the woofer are two
large packets of a white substance

                         pappas
          oh shit

thwaaaaap  the two taped packets slam the wall inches
from utahs right ear  johnny snaps his head around
stares into the face of dietz who looks like warchilds
meaner brother
and hes pissed as hell

int  bedroom  utahs apartment  dawn

the doorbell buzz shrieks through the room  it stops
starts again  a ghostly dawn finds utah and tyler
sleeping peacefully limbs entwined like vines
johnnys eyes snap open  spies the clock  400 am
tyler stirs beside him coming out of sleep
johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to
the door

bodhi stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin
behind him nathaniel roach and grommet hoot from the
pickup

                         bodhi
          cmon brah theres a righteous
          swell  lets go  lets go

tyler comes into the room wrapped in a sheet
utah sees her knowing smile

ext  beach  predawn

vampire morning  a misty predawn bled of all color
steel gray tones  the ocean vanishes in the fog a few
feet from shore
tyler and johnny carrying their boards walk toward the
water

                         tyler
          come on utah  everybodys out
          there catchin all the good rides

she realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her like a
great weight has dragged him to a halt

                         tyler
          whats wrong johnny
                  goes back to him
          youre like a different person

he stares at her  his expression dark wrestling with
something

                         utah
          i am a different person tyler

he lets out a long breath and looks away out to sea

johnnys pov the water receding into a backlit wall of
mist
figures appear faint silhouettes in the fog
shades of gray in the gray
in slow motion they weave hypnotically across the screen
their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each
other

stacked up by the extreme long lens bodhi roach grommet
and nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical
grace

in suspended time we see them hooting and grinning at each
other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other
dolphins playing
challenging each other in mock combat
so good their boards slash past each other with inches to
spare
there is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration
bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art
for the first time we see the core group of bodhis tribe
by themselves  it dawns on us
there are four of them
and at that moment nathaniel drops in front of bodhi
laughing at the near miss and drops his pants in a nasty
wigwagging moon

tracking slowly in on johnny staring mouth open
watching the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride toward
him

in slow motion bodhi grins as he slashes past nathaniels
shining white butt

on johnny as he reacts to the dawning certainty
he feels weak dizzy like the ground is moving under
him

                         tyler
          hey  you okay  you look like you
          saw a ghost

scene  eons ago  the sound of his voice ringing

                         pappas
          forget about it kid theyre
          ghosts

back to johnny as he backs away from tyler  still in
shock recoiling from the situation

                         utah

early evening  utah pulls into the driveway  when he
kills the engine we hear greek music from inside the
house

at the entrance johnny finds the door ajar  he pushes it
open a little to reveal


int  house

pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt
off holding a glass of ouzo  facing away from the door
the ample greek hears utahs tentative knock  without
breaking from his dance or turning he calls out

                         pappas
          hey babe  get on over here so the
          big dog can teach ya how to bark

          wait till tomorrow morning kid

him into the car  then reagan jumps behind the wheel
the back wheels light up smoking as the tbird launches

utah fires
blam  blam  blam
he puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into
junk jewelry  the tbird peels out into traffic clipping
a subaru which locks them up and spins

                         pappas
          come on kid get in the car
          jesus


int ext  sedan

pappas reaches across starting the engine as johnny jumps
in the drivers side  utah buries the throttle into the
firewall and charges aggressively through the medium
traffic
their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler
fishtailing  it straightens out  no tbird in sight

                         utah
          the hell are they

                         pappas
          they took a left at the next light

                         utah
          you sure

utah is totally wired  totally concentrated  the
adrenalin is kicking in flashing through his system  his
brain is on turbo boost reacting a thousand times a
second as they hit sixty through the traffic which seems
to be standing still

                         utah
          i got em  i see em  im on it
          im on it

highspeed slalom through cars and trucks
the world passes by in a hysterical blur

                         pappas
          you even watching the road

a car pulls out straight ahead
utah swerves wildly mostly gets around him  the guys
bumper and front grille are removed  utah does a smoking
skidrecovery  doesnt even slow down

the late model tbird is weaving manically  it makes a
sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the
fbi agents

utah cuts the wheel into a huge ralphs parking lot
pedestrians scatter  utah centerpunches a weeks supply
of groceries in a cart


int ext  tbird

the presidents hold on desperately as reagan white
knuckles it through civilian traffic  theyre looking all
around trying to see where utah went

                         lbj
          where are they man  i dont see
          em  we lose em

not exactly through the windshield we see an airborne
utah hurtling from a ralphs entrance  the sedan lands on
the street tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the
undercarriage
an instant later it hammers into the side of the tbird

the two cars spin out of control  utah cuts the wheel
slamming into them again  side by side demolition derby
wham  utah hits them again  the presidents lose
control jumping a curb losing the right front tire in
the process

utahs car starts to swap ends  hit the center island
broadside
the sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass
screech of steel on concrete as it comes to rest
hanging upside down pappas is mightily pissed off

                         pappas
          nice fuckin work hotshot
          christ

they can see the tbird still moving
it slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on
flapping rubber

johnny shimmies out of the wreckage sliding on his back
in broken glass  pappas is packed in upside down
wriggling to get out through the side window  a tight
fit


int ext  tbird

the presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing
tire

                         reagan
          emergency sanitization  here we go


ext  gas station

the tbird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a
smoking stop at one of the pump islands  the presidents
explode out of the car in a blur

reagan bodyslams a teenager putting gas in his mustang
he flips his big pistol to lbj as the other presidents
charge past him  nixon jumps behind the wheel of the
mustang  lbj and jfk pile in

reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car
he pulls out a zippo lighter
reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the
zippo below and slightly in front of it  he flicks the
flame
then pulls the trigger on the nozzle

like an impromptu flame thrower the nozzle spews a twenty
foot jet of fire which engulfs the tbird in an instant
any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated
customers are running screaming
nixon has the mustang fired up

                         nixon
          lets go  move it ronny

ronnys eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the
scene with the jet of fire  you can see it getting good
to him  in a second hes going to blow up the whole
block  but hes getting his rocks off  he sets two other
cars on fire

a figure blurs into frame
in a flying tackle utah catapults reagan off his pins
they roll skidding across the oily concrete
spraying wild the fire swirls around the pump island

out of the black smoke pappas charges like an angry bull
his snubnose held high  nixon sees him and floors it
the mustang smokes out of the gas station as pappas shots
blow out the back window

utah and reagan roll away from the blaze  johnnys pants
are burning  he gets to his knees in time for reagans
kick to take him square in the solar plexus  he folds in
half  drops to the cement
reagan kicks him again and takes off running
the president is burning
his suit jacket is ablaze  he shucks out of it as he
runs

gasping johnny rapidly slaps his jeans  puts himself
out  he comes up running pulling his beretta  sees the
back of reagans head disappearing into an alley behind
the gas station


ext  alley

a nondescript la alley commercial buildings on one
side walled suburb on the other  two men running all
out
a recent president and a wildeyed cop trailing smoke like
a crashing jet fighter

beyond the buildings behind them a fireball explodes
skyward  we hear sirens and shouting which recede as the
two pelt along the alley  it gets quieter  just the
machinegun slap of the shoes on pavement and the hard
breathing of the two men each in overdrive going all out
in long blurring strides

reagan looks back  sees the demon cop behind him
gaining
utah has become an engine a running machine juggernaut
mode

ahead of them a black and white swings into the alley
reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off
its hinges  utah whips through the gate a second later
diving into suburbia


int ext  neighborhood  footchase sequence

it becomes a blur  pure kinetic energy  two meteors
rocketing through a lowrent suburb  and god help anyone
who gets in the way

reagan crosses a cluttered backyard
broken field run through toys swing set stacks of god
knowswhat
he runs through a mr turtle pool in an explosion of
spray
crashes through a hedge
through the narrow gap between houses
utah powers into the tight space behind him
blurring along between stucco walls

they emerge into the front yard
a woman watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and
falls down
reagan and utah both hurdle her

ahead kids on bikes racing along the sidewalk
reagan dodges the first utah slams into the next two
he crashes rolling tangled up in bikes and squawking
teenagers
he comes out of a pileup somehow still in high gear

reagan flashes across the sunlit street
dodges in front of a garbage truck which locks up the
brakes
it stops so fast one of the guys falls off the back
the guy is getting up as utah whips around the back of the
truck
knocks him sprawling
utah doesnt stop  doesnt look back
like he doesnt see anything in the real world but the
figure running ahead of him  like its some kind of
hyperkinetic video game

everything is a blur  suburbia smeared into staccato
impressions
the house across the street is blocked by fence on both
sides
a man is picking up his mail
reagan pounds past him  right through the front door of
the house
utah follows

panting as he sprints down a dark hallway
a woman with a basket of washing screams as reagan blasts
past her knocking her flying
utah leaps over her sprawled legs
cats blur underfoot  utah crunches down on a tail  a cat
explosion  screeching merges with the womans shrill
shouts as utah slams the back screen door off its hinges

across the back yard  fence  over it  running on

reagan looks back
sees utah still behind him like in a bad dream
he enters the next house  sliding glass door
utah sees reagan pull it closed  locking it
without breaking stride johnny grabs a potted plant off a
patio wall
heaves it ahead of him

the glass burst into a wall of diamonds
utah blasts through a microsecond later
topples the kitchen table  furniture and crockery
crashing everywhere
he sprints down a hallway after reagan
a fierce woman in a housecoat shouting at them as they
pass holding a vacuum cleaner like its shotgun

                         woman
          get the fuck out of this house
          what the fuck do you think youre
          doing

around a corner  a vicious snarling sound
utah sees something flying at him  reflexively catches
it
reagan has thrown a pitbull
the fierce womans fierce dog

utahs pov  the snarling little demon right in his face
he dropkicks it like a goddamn fieldgoal right through a
doorway and runs on
another door  another explosion of sunlight  another
yard
sprinklers this time  reagan and utah running through
sunlit walls of rain  they crash through another hedge
emerging drenched

the ground drops away  slipping and sliding on iceplant
they skid down a steep slope  reagan reaches bottom
a ten foot retaining wall dropping off like a cliff to
pavement below
reagan falls landing on his feet
panting now feeling it he stumbles up and runs on

utah rips down through the iceplant like a human
lawnmower
slides over the edge  falls  lands hard

tight on his knee and slow motion
taking the impact
we hear something go
utah crashes to the pavement his face contorted with
pain
he grabs his tortured knee with both hands

                         utah
          not now  not now

reagan runs on  they are in an enclosed storage yard of
some kind  ten foot chainlink all around
utah struggles to get up and run
he sprawls forward biting back a howl of pain
we see the incredible will driving him on
he gets up and again hobbling  trying to run

reagan reaches the fence
he is heaving for breath  holding his side
utah stumbles gets up clutching his knee
hobbling forward  his eyes wild the veins in his neck
bulging

reagan starts to climb  utah collapses to his knees  he
cant go on
reagan reaches the top of the fence  he looks back

utah has the beretta pointed right at him
twenty feet away  the muzzle rocksteady  he cant miss
they both are frozen panting  locked into the moment

                         reagan
          you want me theres only one way

pappas reaches the top of the hill 200 feet away panting
like hes about to collapse  he sees the tableau

ecu  utahs finger on the trigger  tightening
rack to his eyes  blinking water running into them
god he wants to

ecu  reagans eyes through the mask  locked with
utahs

utah suddenly snaps his hand up and fires vertically
he howls with rage frustration and pain
fires again  and again
slumping back his shoulders slam down onto the concrete
straightarming the beretta he fires rapidly
bulleting the blue sky

high angle looking straight down on the tableau
reagan leaps off the fence and runs out of frame as utah
empties the magazine straight at us the shots merging
with his agonized howl echoing as we

                                            cut to

int  fbi building  bullpen  night

utah sits next to the dispatcher waiting for news like a
sailor in a storm  his leg is popped up on a chair with
jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around
his knee
his face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises
he drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen

pappas comes through the doors wiping the remains of
dinner off his mouth

                         pappas
          nothing

                         utah
          nothing

the dispatcher talks into his headset glances up at
pappas shakes his head

                         pappas
          go home kid  get the hell outta
          here  get some sleep  you look
          like shit  they get anything even
          resembles your guy im on your

he smiles warmly handing his younger partner a brown
paper sack

                         utah
          feta  my favorite

managing a weary smile  lifts his body out of the chair
turns to go
angelo ponders something

utah stops  looks back at the man

                         pappas
          all i wanna know is one thing why

antiseptic over his wounds  utah cringes

                         tyler

she laughs shifts her weight and keeps tending him

                         tyler
          so whatd the other guy look like

                         utah

          but you look like you been in a
          train wreck howd he just drive
          away

utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth
wont quite form the words  tyler dabs his face touches
a finger to his forehead

                         tyler
          johnny what is it with you  you
          have that look again its like
          youre about to tell me something
          and then you dont or you cant

johnny searches her eyes
she stares at him becoming fragile suddenly

                         tyler
          what  what do you want to tell me

utahs brow unfurls  the thought has passed  he slowly
cups his hand over hers  gently pulling her close

                         utah
          im glad you pulled me out of the
          water that day

he presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead
a kiss to each downcast eye  searching out her mouth with
his own as his hands glide down the small of her back
their reflection in the mirror as utah slowly lowers tyler
to the bathroom floor  she clings tightly in a breathless
kiss


ext  cliff  night

a buddha in the moonlight bodhi sits crosslegged upon the

utah asleep flopped in a spreadeagled x
we hear the bedroom door opening see a slash of light
fall across the bed
johnny doesnt stir
a shadow appears on the wall moving toward him
an outstretched arm holding a gun
utah snores softly sleeping like a baby
camera tracks in on his peaceful face
a single eyelid flutters  total silence until

kaboooommm  the pillow beside him explodes into a
blizzard of goosedown  johnny rears up eyes wide mouth
agape
tyler stands above him recovering from the kick of the
smoking 9mm beretta in her hand

                         tyler
          a lawyer  you lied to me

she throws his fbi gold star at his face

                         tyler
          look tyler i can

boom  tyler squeezes off another round
cascading goosefeathers falling like snow
utah flinches sideways

                         tyler

she waves the beretta in his face

                         utah
          no  they live in columbus ohio

tyler lowers the pistol slowly the strength leaving her
her face begins to flood with tears

          dont you have a soul  goddamn you
          to hell

she goes limp as the sobs rack her body  the gun flops
from her grip
utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot
he moves to gently comfort her
she bolts at his touch running from the bedroom
utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her  he
stumbles

from the living room we hear a rattling of keys the front
door opens and slams shut  he hobbles to the door
favoring his knee  opens it  we hear the porsche
screeching away

his hip pocket to conceal it

          anything to win  i respect that
          it elevates you a little above the
          drones who have learned compromise
          here hold it  check out the
          weight

he twirls the gun grabs the barrel and extends the handle
to utah
johnny takes it slowly  now its aimed at bodhi

                         bodhi
                  cheerfully
          whoa  careful  you got the muzzle
          pointing right at me brah

he casually pushes the barrel away looking back at the
highway
johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a round
into open desert  kabooom  the recoil blows johnnys
arm back over the top of the truck  practically breaks
his wrist
thunder rolls across the dark hills
from the back of the pickup nathaniel howls
grommet and roach high five

johnny turns to bodhi breaking slowly into a feral grin

                         utah
          nice

he hands the smoking weapon back to him
as if to say two can play this game
bodhi stands challenged
each snared in the others power
bodhi takes the weapon back casually  slips it under the
seat

                         bodhi
          its a special day johnny u  a
          very special day

utahs gaze travels beyond the windshield

wider reveals a big cessna twin  the pilot a weaselly
guy we havent seen before fires up the second engine
the plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light
a desert airstrip near palmdale  a couple of aluminum
siding hangers and no tower  a few other planes around
but no activity besides bodhis rocksteady crew

utah watches grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of
bodhis truck and starts tossing out parachute packs
roach tosses one to bodhi who chucks it to utah

                         bodhi

bodhi grabs his sleeve ushering him into the plane

                         utah
          oh well thats fine then  i feel
          so much better

int  cessna

utah sits wearing a dayglo jump suit hugging the chute
in his lap  next to him is the gaping door  beyond a
spectacular down sunburst at 10000 feet  roar of wind
and engines

utah watches bodhi nathaniel grommet and roach wriggling
into their colorful freefall suits  nathaniel pulls on a
pair of purple shorts over his suit  looks real dorky
grommet has on duck feet  bodhi apparently is going to
jump barefoot
nobody has their chutes on yet
johnny hefts his as if weighing it somehow judging the
contents  his brain is racing  bodhi shouts over the
roar

                         bodhi
          its a little ceremony we always
          have at the end of summer  one last

                         utah
          so who uh who packed my chute

                         bodhi

                         utah

                         bodhi
          then well earn it together  here
          take mine

bodhi swaps chutes with johnny
utah looks at the new chute uncertainly
is this a game  poker moves
did bodhi anticipate this step

                         roach
          hey you dont want bodhis man
          his packjobs suck they only open
          half the time  take grommets man

roachs grin is evil as he grabs grommets chute out of
his hands and switches it with johnnys  keeps that one
and gives his to grommet

                         grommet
          whoa unfair dude

grommet grabs his chute back and hands johnny the one he
had which was roachs  i think
johnny looks at the pack in his hands  then at the
grinning faces
russian surfer freefall roulette  shit
bodhi studying him  some kind of test
fuck it  utah starts putting the damn thing on

                         utah

ext  10000 feet  dawn

multicolored figures explode from the plane  leaping
into freefall  tumbling end over end
wearing headsets they hurtle downward

                         bodhi radio
          utah you copy bruddah

                         utah radio

                         bodhi
          ill take that as a yes

one by one they stabilize  falling face down knees bent
they angle their hands and feet minutely to move
laterally  utah flails the last to trim out  but hes
holding his own

grommet working his duckfeet pitches himself into a wild
spin rotating like a dervish in a head down dive  he
flares out and flies back to the others
rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to
paradoxically hang above the world almost unmoving on
a separate plane of existence
a hurricane of wind  wild hooting
despite his terror johnny has to grin at nathaniel
falling butt first like hes sitting on a big inner tube
in the pool

                         roach
          whip it out dudes  cheap sex with
          the cosmos

                         bodhi
          ten thousand feet  lets do it

the group stabilizes moving together
first bodhi and roach link arms trimming constantly
concentrating  nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and
maneuvers toward them  he grabs roachs arm
grommet works his way next to nathaniel  locks in
they need utah to complete the ring
four faces beckoning to him distorted by the hurricane
wind

                         bodhi
          come on johnny  get in here

johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily
toward them  bodhi and grommet grab him  hes in
a perfect fiveman star

                         bodhi

          great  great

johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought
screaming down through the dawn sky at 130
locked into the ring  part of something
connected to these guys far above the planet
less far every second bodhis chest altimeter reads
6000 feet

                         bodhi
          purtythirty and were meat waffles
          folks  see ya downtown

he releases roachs arm and the star disintegrates
drifting apart
bodhi stays with utah falling parallel to the horizon
facing each other holding hands  4000 feet  airspeed
140

grommet pulls his ripcord  he seems to be jerked upward
by a great force  suddenly he is far above a brightly
colored disc of fabric
utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him
nathaniel pulls then roach  they shoot upward
disappearing
bodhi and utah fall on alone

                         bodhi
          you gonna pull

                         utah
          after you alfonse  i insist

bodhi looks at utah  a slow grin  the meter on his chest
harness reads 2000 ft  150 mph  12 seconds to valhalla

                         bodhi
          dont screw around man pull it

                         utah

          you first

                         bodhi
          okay

bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls utahs ripcord
handle
he waves goodbye as johnnys canopy deploys  utah is
jerked upward  he feels his weight hanging brutally in
the harness
johnny looks down
impossibly close to the ground  bodhis canopy bursts
out an explosion of color  below him is the shimmering
mirror of a large reservoir  two seconds later the bright
yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack  an
explosion of white water marks bodhis impact

low angle at water level as utah hits
in slow motion a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts
skyward
molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn
utah surfaces sputtering and shucks out of the harness
he floats like a jellyfish gasping for breath

                         utah

ext  airfield  day

bodhi walks toward us dripping wet and grinning
he wraps his arm around utahs shoulders as the others
walk up
theyre all soaked and stoked

                         bodhi
          ya see i told you johnny u was
          gonna be just fine

roach and the others clap him on the back  a moment of
acceptance into the tribe  utah isnt sure what it means
yet

                         bodhi
          cmere  theres something you need
          to see

bodhi leads him toward a plain utility van parked nearby
it was there earlier but utah had no reason to notice it
bodhi opens the rear doors and motions johnny inside
utah puzzled and suddenly alert steps in  bodhi
follows


int  van  day

the interior is empty except for several canvas duffel
bags and a small portable vcr  it is one of the new sales
presentation models with deck and monitor together in one
tiny unit

          insurance policy  now this is going
          to sting a bit but its for your
          own growth brah  press play

utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny
screen

tight on screen  a night shot  rosie the biker has tyler
in a powerful grip  her hands are cuffed behind her and
her mouth is taped  he has his switchblade up to her
throat  her eyes are wild but with rage not fear
shes trying to struggle out of his grip kicking at him
viciously
he controls her efficiently
bodhi stops the tape

                         bodhi
          shes a wild one isnt she
          special agent utah

utah lunges pinning bodhi to the wall of the van an
elbow across his throat

                         utah
          youre a fucking dead man

                         bodhi

          whoa whoa  think it through  im
          the only one knows where they are
          just let me talk for a second

johnny pulls back  barely in control

utahs voice sounds kind of strangled

                         utah
          you call him right now and
          tell him to let her go

                         bodhi

          she was my woman once  we shared
          time in this world  but rosie hes
          kind of a mechanism  once you
          set him in motion he wont stop
          thats his gift a kind of
          blankness  noon comes straight up
          hell gut her like a pig and try not
          to get any on his shoes  nothing i
          can do unless i get there

                         bodhi
          so that makes us partners doesnt
          it  because now we both have the
          same goal to get me where i need
          to go  right

utahs expression turns suddenly cold as an executioners

bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others
gathered nearby  he addresses the pilot first

                         bodhi
          get the plane down to santa monica
          and top up the tanks

like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons he cant seem
to lift it from the holster  roachnixon slips up next to
him and helps him with it  the guy is visibly trembling

a young jock makes a move to run
our shotgun comes up like a reflex right in his face
roachnixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair

statuary of the customers and bank employees  our gaze
drifts across the floor manager a short guy in a brown
suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back

          whatta say mr duggan  wanna give
          her the keys or do i pick through
          the blood and chunks for them

duggan the bank manager is surprisingly calm as he takes
the keys from his pocket  holds them out to the terrified
woman

                         duggan
          do whatever they say terry

miss jennings hurries to comply
she unlocks the steel cage inside the big vault door
roachnixon and grommetlbj take her inside with them

a customer lying on the floor near the fat guard catches
his eye
the guard face jammed against the linoleum blanches as
he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal
the butt of a pistol  the customer mouths the words im
a cop
the guard is hyperventilating

at the front doors a woman comes in out of the bright
sunlight
jfk pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor  then
goes back to watching the street

johnny is next to bodhireagan

                         utah
          youre blowing it man  youre
          breaking your own rules pulling
          too much time

                         bodhireagan
          jfk how we doin

                         nathanieljfk
          all clear man

inside the vault grommet and roach are pillaging rapidly
their hands blur as nice fat stacks of 20s and 100s are
dumped into canvas sacks

on the main floor the off duty cop slips his hands slowly
around the butt of his pistol concealing the move with
his body
he signals with his eyes to the fat guard glancing at the
guards ankle

tight on the guards ankle where we can see a sliver of
backup gun a tiny 25 auto in an ankle holster
the guards eyes are pleading with the hardon cop
dont make me do this
the guy is sweating shaking  a yellow liquid spreads
across the tiles next to his quivering hips  hes
actually pissing himself hes so scared

tight on the offduty cop  watching like a ferret  he
cocks his 38
ecu guards eyes wide with terror

it happens like lightning  the cop pops to his knees
straightarming the 38  the guard goes for his ankle
holster
reagan spins
the cop fires  blam
reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the
impact
he crashes onto a desk on his back  slides off
scattering papers
a teller screams  the cop spins toward utah
johnny throws down the shotgun  shows his palms  hes
holding out his gold star

                         utah
          federal agent  undercover

the cop fires twice  two in the chest  utah is hurled
back  slams into the tellers counter

nathaniellbj lets go with the 12 gauge  boom
the cop spins hit by some 00 buck pellets
the guard capsoff like a maniac  blam blam blam
blam
all of them wild but serving to get nathaniel pinned down
behind a checkwriting island

roachnixon leaps the counter and lands behind the guard
the guards shoulder explodes as roachs 12 gauge
detonates  he pitches onto his face screaming and
holding the wreckage of his upper arm
grommetlbj is coming over the counter behind roach as the
offduty cop spins and fires  blam  blam  roach takes
it in the chest  staggers back firing into the floor
trips and drops his shotgun
grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his
fingers

in slow motion reagans face rises above the counter
the mask is askew  in order to see bodhi pulls it off
the casull comes up in a slow deliberate arc as

the cop turns terrified now whipping his gun around
nightmarishly slow as

bodhi cocks the casull in dreamtime and
kaboooom  the worlds most powerful handgun proves its
claim at 2000 feet per second

a gout of hamburger explodes out of the cops chest
he is lifted off his feet  hits and slides across the
floor leaving a twofoot wide red smear
echoes slap the walls  then all is still  plaintive
whimpering and moaning  the air is blue with smoke

johnny is trying to catch his breath  he rips his shirt
open to see two deep indentations in the second chance
vest  flattened 38 slugs caught in the kevlar mesh  but
no blood

bodhi drops over the counter near utah
the two men look at each other
bodhis eyes seem lost  he stares around at the carnage
he has wrought the bloody wreckage of his ego game
his expression changes to something new  truly crazed
now  we feel that the madness which has been held in
check so long has been let off its leash

                         bodhi
          dont anybody fucking move

roach clutching his side moves to grommet who is on his
knees
beneath lbjs stony countenance a river of blood flows
down grommets chest  roach pulls off the mask
revealing a terrified kid
grommet pulls his blooddrenched hand away from his
throat stares at it bugeyed

                         grommet
          oh no oh my god oh god its all
          comin out man gotta stop it
          its all gonna come out do
          something

hes trying to hold it in with his hands  this doesnt
work
a pastewhite frightened kid  eighteen years old
suddenly realizing that this is not some video game  that
death is real
he slumps back losing the battle for consciousness
we hear sirens approaching

                         roach
                  freaking to bodhi
          we gotta bug out man  were eatin
          it bad on this one  lets go

bodhi reaches down and picks up johnnys fbi shield off
the floor
he considers it for a long time  then looks up at johnny
his eyes seem to ask for forgiveness
a moment before he smashes the casull into johnnys skull

johnnys pov as he drops to his knees  everything going
dark as we see bodhis face distantly his mouth moving
slowly

                         bodhi
          goodbye johnny

the floor rushes up and smashes us in the face
a view of shoes running away from us leaving bloody
footprints  then total darkness

int ext  first security bank  later

ten minutes later the bank crime scene is in full swing
uniform cops are everywhere trying to get statements from
sobbing witnesses  harp munoz cole and pappas represent
the fbi contingent  cole has one arm strapped to his body
in a fairly elaborate sling and he moves slowly

harp is barking orders to everyone in sight  outside
visible beyond the doors its total pandemonium with
cops and ambulances and of course a huge crowd of
rubberneckers  a minicam crew shows up  harp starts
shouting at them

cole with evident pleasure cinches down a pair of
handcuffs on utahs wrists with his good hand  johnny
has a deep cut on his forehead and the blood is trickling
into his eyes but he seems not to notice  not to hear
munoz speaking monotonously

                         munoz
           if you so desire an attorney
          will be provided for you free of
          cost  do you understand these
          rights i have explained to you
          utah

pappas charges through the crowd pushing munoz aside

                         pappas
          he knows his goddamn rights
                  looks at utah
          jesus kid  i knew you were getting
          too close to these guys
                  turns to the other
                   agents
          gimme the goddamn key to these
          things cole  christ

he gestures to the cuffs still cutting into johnnys
wrists
cole hands him the key
harp storms toward them

                         harp
          dont take those off  just leave
          them on  your partners an
          accessory to murder  you realize
          that

harp spins johnny by the shoulder to look at
paramedics carrying the covered body of the offduty cop
beyond still on the floor is grommet his eyes staring
in death
he was right about not making thirty

                         harp
          three men dead  one of them a cop
          hows that sit in your gut utah

                         utah
                  cold and scary
          take your hand off my shoulder right
          now

harp pulls back instinctively  utahs eyes burn into him
looks like johnnys not in the fbi anymore

                         pappas
          look harp  dont turn him over to
          the uniforms like some punk  let me
          ride him in

                         harp
          yeah sure  why not  you two
          screwups deserve each other
          thats why i put you together in the
          first place  christ pappas youre
          as bad as he is talk about the
          blind leading the blind

pappas steps close to the supervising agent

                         pappas
          harp let me tell you something  i
          was an agent in this bureau when
          your mommy was still wiping your
          shinny pink ass and you know one
          thing i learned in all those years
          that you still havent

                         harp
          what that

angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his 280
pounds behind it
harps head snaps back and he flops in a heap

                         pappas
          respect your elders
                  he takes utah by
                   the arm
          lets go kid

harp struggles to sit up rubbing his jaw as pappas
stuffs utah into his car  harp is so shocked he doesnt
say a word

                                            cut to

int  pappas car

they drive for a couple of blocks in silence side by
side
utah in disgrace  contrite  stony  finally

                         utah
          i know where theyre going

                         pappas
          figured you did

angelo flips johnny the key
johnny lets himself out of the cuffs  he sits rubbing his
wrists

                         utah
          only problem is we cant arrest
          them or shoot them

on pappas what the fuck expression we

                                            cut to

ext  santa monica airport

long lens shot through a forest of small planes as pappas
sedan glides into frame  it moves sharklike among through
the cessna forest  slows to a stop
through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see pappas
get out of the car and start working his way among the
aircraft
utah slides behind the wheel and drives on

tight on turboprop engine roaring as it warms up
the same aircraft as before
bodhi and nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open
back door as the pilot completes his preflight checks
the expresidents suits have been removed along with the
body armor and no guns are in sight  just a couple of
guys getting ready for a charter flight  bodhi looks up
and stops his work as

the fbi sedan stops about 50 feet away
nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels
utah gets out  he holds his hands out from his body and
turns completely around  without his jacket on it is
evident that he is not carrying a gun
he walks forward

                         utah
          im not armed

                         bodhi
          but youre not alone

                         utah
          good guess  theres a gun on you
          right now

bodhi feigns casual interest  looks around  he cant
see

pappas nearby  moving catlike behind a row of service
vehicles  he gets his snubnose 38 propped on the bumper
of one with a clear shot at bodhi and nathaniel

                         utah
          wheres roach

                         bodhi

          kind of a hurry johnny u  what can

          you gotta tell me where she is

                         bodhi
          and let my policy expire  sorry

                         utah
          look bodhi man  people are dead
          the ride is over

                         bodhi
          i say when its over

                         utah
          the guy you killed was an off duty
          cop  if you get out of here theyll
          nail you wherever you land  they
          have a new thing called radar
          maybe youve heard of it

though he cant hear whats going on  the pilot has
clocked the tension between the two men  and the shotgun
in nathaniels hands  he blanches and starts to shut
down the planes power
by his reaction we see that hes obviously not in on it

roach comes out of the hangar building nearby  neither
utah nor pappas see him  but he sees pappas drawn down on
bodhi  he drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel
he was carrying

tight on duffel bag as it opens  the pistol grip of a 12
gauge riotgun sticks out of lots and lots of money
roachs hand slides the gun out slowly

utah is very close to bodhi

                         utah
          i know you man when they fall on
          you you wont back down  theyll
          have to burn your ass to the ground

          last person theyre ready to listen

                         utah

                         utah
          look you got a death wish you want
          to ride to glory fine  but dont
          take her with you man  im begging
          you tell me where she is  then i
          walk away  weve earned that much
          trust havent we

the pilot opens the door and is climbing out when
nathaniel wheels on him  the pilot goes crosseyed
staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge inches from his
face

                         bodhi
                  to the pilot
          back in the hotseat campadre
          now

behind the trucks pappas senses something
his head snaps around
roach is behind him with the 12 gauge  he fires
pappas hurls his weight sideways as the buckshot punches
into the truck fender  some of it catches pappas in the
hip  he hits the ground hard and whips up the 38 bam
bam  bam
roach flips onto his back
the shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck
pappas is on the ground totally exposed 20 feet from the
others

nathaniel fires once wild  terrified  his shot blows a
divot out of the asphalt next to pappas
he pumps the slide chambering another round
then pappas fourth and fifth rounds drill into him
he slams back against the cessnas fuselage
slides down  two red smears on the white aircraft
bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge
pappas takes aim  one round left
utah sprints between them

                         utah
          angelo  dont fire

                         pappas
          kid get outta the way

                         utah
          nooo

utah is blocking bodhi with his body
bodhis fingers are poised frozen a few inches from the
shotgun
standoff

                         pappas
          goddammit

he snaps the pistol up aimed at the sky
pappas stands panting  enraged and frustrated  pain
searing his leg  everything is tense and electrified
boom  pappas chest explodes with a spray of blood

behind him roach is lying on one elbow in a pool of
scarlet
he cocks another round into the chamber and fires again
boom

angelo drops to his knees holding his ruined body like
hes hugging himself  johnny lunges toward him his face
distorted with shock

                         utah
          nnnoooooo

angelos eyes meet his for a moment
in his dilated pupils is the great question
then he slumps forward and lies very still
the breath leaves his body and doesnt go back in

johnny moves toward his friend in a daze  drops to one
knee beside him
roach aims the shotgun at him coughing blood
utah doesnt notice  or is beyond caring
bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction
roachs finger relaxes on the trigger

utah puts his hand on angelos white crewcut hair
he hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as
bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge

roach is working himself to his knees  his breath is
sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the
customary breathing orifices  bodhi crosses to him and
helps him up  he covers utah with the shot gun as he
halfcarries roach to the plane  the pilot is white with
shock  hed run if he could remember how

                         pilot
          i aint flyin you guys to san
          phillipe man forget it  not now

                         bodhi
          thanks for telling the nice fbi
          agent where were going

roach works his way up into the plane  he waves the
shotgun at the pilot his face a vicious bloodflecked
mask

                         roach
          get in the fucking plane

bodhi stands behind johnny the shotgun aimed at his head
their expressions are lethally cold
we see that utah hates this man who was his friend his
teacher more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate

                         bodhi
          were gonna ride this out all the
          way johnny  you and me  lets go

johnny nods slowly as if accepting that this was all
somehow preordained and that they both knew the game
would take them this far and beyond  he stands and walks
to the plane

                                            cut to

ext  mexico  day

the screen explodes with a blur of motion
pov of the ground racing below us at 180 mph

reverse preceding the plane as it rockets through barren
canyons
as close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it
under the radar


int  plane

the aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and
banks wildly
bodhi has the casull aimed at the base of his skull from
the jump seat just behind him
roach holds the shotgun on utah seated across from him in
the rear seats
roach is a pale sweaty mask  he is propped against a
bulkhead seemingly collapsed in on himself like a
discarded coat
his entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood
but his gaze is steady and the shotgun is aimed into
utahs guts
no one talks or moves on this grim hellride


ext  arroyo

near noon  the sun blisters a landscape out of time
the white cessna rockets above the saguaros its shadow
pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some
manic alter ego below it  it wooshes over us raising
dust devils


int  plane

the pilot yells over his shoulder to bodhi

                         pilot
          look we been in mexico the last
          half hour can i quit mowing the
          lawn here or what  im getting more
          brush in the wheels than i usually

                         bodhi
          yeah get some height  take her up
          to eight thousand on this heading

the pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs
bodhi moves back next to roach whos fading

                         roach
          were gonna pop up on their screens

                         bodhi
          doesnt matter now  were almost
          there man  here let me help you
          get your gear on

bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to
roach and starts helping him into the harness  roach
keeps the shot gun pointed at johnny

                         roach
          im cold

                         bodhi

          johnny toss me that money bag will

utah hefts the duffel  weighs its contents and their
price

                         utah
          youre cold because all the blood is
          running out of your body roach
          youre going to be dead soon
                  he tosses the bag
          i hope it was worth it

roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a teddy
bear  glares at utah  he hooks the strap of the duffel
over one shoulder

                         bodhi
          hey johnnys just trying to psych
          you man forget it  just keep
          thinking about all those senoritas
          nursin you back to health  come
          on amigo lets get you set for the
          jump

bodhi props roach next to the open door and takes a
walkietalkie from the seat keying it

                         bodhi
          rosie rosie this is air force one
          do you copy over

a burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear
voice

                         rosie vo
          copy you air force one  we have a
          visual on you  lookin fine

          hook shes served her purpose  do
          it man you owe me that much  let
          me hear it before you check out

bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of
seconds then keys the walkie

                         bodhi
          rosie listen carefully  surgery

          copy you  surgery is canceled
          im lettin the bitch go

bodhi looks out the doorway  gauging distance airspeed
the geography below  he looks at utah aiming the casull
at him
johnny stares back at him like a pit viper

                         bodhi
          i know its hard for you johnny
          you want me so bad its like acid in
          your mouth  but not his time
                  he braces roach at
                   the door
          lets go

bodhi signals the pilot and utah feels the plane drop as
the engines are cut back to an idle  bodhi slaps roach on
the shoulder and roach slumps backward out of the plane
bodhi braces to jump looking at johnny for a last split
second

                         bodhi
          you lose campadre

he chucks the casull onto the seat beside the door and
bails
bodhi tumbles out into space  its over

utahs knuckles are white gripping the seat  theres a
dynamo spinning out of control in his head  he leaps up
in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a
bulkhead  looks around like a rabid animal  two seconds
three seconds  then

                         utah
          fuck it

utah grabs the casull off the seat and dives out of the
plane


ext  plane

utah without a parachute but carrying a very large gun
rockets downward  he presses his arms to his sides and
falls headdown building speed

three hundred feet below him is bodhi freefalling in a
spreadeagle position  utah moves his feet and hands
angling toward him
bodhi doesnt see him  falling flat he tops out at
terminal velocity for that position  130 mph

utah slashes downward at 160 mph  the gap between them
closes
utah is almost blinded by the windstream  his eyes burn
his lips are peeled back by the blasting air
bodhi is eighty feet below him 4000 feet to terra
firma
utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration
hes only going to have one shot at this
bodhi is right below him
utah is closing like a sam missile
he trims a little and
wham  slams into bodhi in a midair tackle

bodhis eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble
together
utah has made the grab and locked his arms around bodhi in
an iron grip
he pulls the casulls muzzle up to bodhis head and
screams in his face

                         utah
          pull the parachute

bodhi looks at the gun  looks at utah  grins wildly

                         bodhi
          pretty radical johnny  even for
          you  why dont you pull it

          now

                         bodhi
          naw you pull it

utah looks down  the earth is rushing at them  2500
feet

                         bodhi
          go on johnny  pull it  but you
          gotta drop the gun first  right

                         utah

          fucking head off and pull it myself

                         bodhi
          well thats the only way its gonna
          happen man  do it  come on you
          want to do it  youre gonna die
          johnny  five more seconds  four

1000 feet  the ground is close enough to see details
cactus sagebrush  they rocket past the bright yellow
canopy of roachs chute a hundred feet away

                         utah
          you fucking crazy  pull it

theyre right in each others faces  taking it way beyond
the edge
bodhis eyes are wild  a gleeful adrenalized madness
his pupils are the entrance to hell

                         bodhi
          three seconds two one

                         utah
          shit

utah flings the casull away and pulls the ripcord so hard
he almost loses his grip anyway  poom  the canopy cracks
out
full and round and bright red
the ground roars at us
whap  utah and bodhi hit  hard

they slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a
cloud of dust
rocks and debris clatter into silence

nearby roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll
he moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his
eyes stare without blinking right at the sun  next to him
the money satchels contents are spilled right into the
sand  roachs lifeless hands lie limp among the bills
that caper in the desert wind

utah and bodhi are both completely still as the dust
clears  finally they groan and stir  necks move hands
move legs move  bodhi rolls to his knees  he is cut and
scraped the blood running bright down his dustcovered
skin

utah looks around blinking
surreal that he should be plopped down here in the redhot
mexican desert
bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him

                         bodhi
          wild ride huh

                         utah
                  gasping
          jesus christ bodhi

utah tries to rise and  grabs his knee in agony  we see
by his mask of pain that its totaled inside

                         bodhi
          that pesky knee huh  too bad

he looks up at the sound of an engine

bodhis pov of his big fourby roaring toward us with a
meteor tail of dust  it slides to a stop next to them
rosie gets out of the drivers side and stands calmly with
a sawedoff over his shoulder

utah blinks through his sweat and pain at

tyler running toward him out of the dust  she kneels next
to him and puts her arms around him  bodhi limps to the
truck  through the swirling dust we see him look back

                         bodhi
          you had me worried there for a
          second johnny u

he swings up into the fourby and guns the engine  rosie
hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up
roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward
roachs billowing gravemarker

johnny touches tylers face tenderly leaving a smear of
blood
he gives her a wan version of the johnny utah grin

hold on the truck moving off in a heatshimmered cloud of
dust becoming a mirage then a memory as we

                                            dissolve to

an enormous wave which fills frame seeming to rise
endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray


ext  beach day  day

an unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a
storm sky
wind whips sand across the narrow beachroad throwing it
against the front doors of the lighthouse pub
title over one year later


int  lighthouse pub  day

dark  almost empty  a snarling crocodile head is mounted
above a tapper of guinness stout  a koala bear with
plastic eyes holds a fosters  a bartender with leathered
skin washes glasses
at the bar a single disheveled customer human
driftwood
gust of wind blows open a shuttered window
the bartender moves to close it

                         bartender
          gonna close early today mate fore
          the bloody storm hits

johnny utah swivels toward camera  his tanned face is
barely recognizable jaws hidden underneath a slight
beard long bleachout hair swept behind an ear  his
muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey
the man seems deadly focused

                         utah
          storms already here its
          bringing me the swell

johnny stares into his drink
another blast of cold as the front door opens
johnny turns at the sound
tyler takes a step inside  her hair is different more
bleached out frazzled from the sun  her eyes adjust to
the dark room

                         tyler
          john theyre here

utah downs the drink and slides off his stool  he has a
pronounced limps as he crosses to tyler at the door
they exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which
reads lighthouse pub  bells beach australia

                                            cut to

ext  lighthouse pub  day

utah and tyler walk out onto the roadway as several
australian police cars converge on them  a dozen
uniformed officers step out  the ranking officer a
fortyish lieutenant walks up to utah

                         lieutenant
          dyou see him mr utah

                         utah
          no  but hes here

                         lieutenant
          now look i know you used to be a
          federal agent up in the states and
          all that but youre a citizen now
          so just find him and well handle it
          from there

                         utah
          no problem  just give me a couple
          minutes with him first

johnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone

                                            cut to

ext  bells beach  australia  day

wall of solid water five stories high crashes straight
down in a holocaust of spray
rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky roll the
most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen  they
close out pummeling the ocean floor casting a shockwave
up the shore
surfers gather on the sand gaze out to sea

                         1st surfer
          jesus almighty the bloody sands
          shakin

the beach sounds like a mortar range
johnny passes among the brahs

                         2nd surfer
          totally closedout  its fuckin
          death on a stick

on bodhi sitting crosslegged in the sand arms folded
around his knees  he stares pensively out at the waves
his hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard
lying next to him

                         utah vo
          i knew you wouldnt miss the fifty
          year storm bodhi

bodhi smiles the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates
the cunning of his opponent  utah sits beside his prey
and stares at the ocean  bodhi stares with glittering
eyes at the heaving ocean before him face splitting into
that feral deaths head grin

                         bodhi
          and i always knew i could count on
          you agent utah

                         utah
          im not fbi anymore

                         bodhi
          you never were

                         utah
          i asked them to give me a couple
          minutes

utah calmly glances over his shoulder
bodhi follows johnnys gaze to the cops watching from the
road

                         bodhi
          it went bad brah  real bad
                  smiles inwardly
          i just felt it was time

a booming roar sounds from the ocean
bodhi just stares at the waves with awe and perhaps fear

                         bodhi
          time to dance with the universe
                  he turns to utah
          i could never handle a jail cell
          youll do this for me wont you
          johnny  havent i earned this
          much

utah doesnt move to stop him as he stands hefting the
longboard
he half smiles then turns toward the water and starts
walking
he stops  turns around

                         bodhi
          thanks brah

bodhi doesnt wait for a reply  he walks to the waters
edge and never looks back  he throws his board into the
foam and paddles the riptide pulling him out  the
monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the
trough of the holocaust

utah stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver
final justice  the cops are running clumsily across the
sand too late to stop bodhi  tyler steps up behind
johnny and puts her hands on his shoulders

bodhi is nothing more than a speck as he shoots across the
lip of the colossal wave carving the board downward  an
unthinkable forehand blast sends him into a 180 degree
slide straight down the enormous face eyes wild his
mouth opens in a soundless howl  bodhi and the outer
limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious
moment in perfect harmony perfect symmetry perfect
union there is no fear in his face only awe as the
mountain of water closes out burying the bodhisattva in a
whitewater grave pieces of broken surfboard explode
upward only to fall back into the raging whiteness and
vanish

utah remains pensive eyes fixed on the riderless surf
tyler lowers her head  a fragment of surfboard washes up
onto wet sand  the wind gathers force
johnny finally turns to his woman curls an arm around her
shoulder gathering her close  tears are streaming down
her face as she stares at the sea

                         utah
          he rode it all the way

camera pulls back and up rising high above their heads as
the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the
australian shore

fade to black
