fade in


ext outer space

the infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars as we slowly 
descend through the varied shades of blue of the earths atmosphere we 
hear the first strains of a haunting central american flute joined by 
a swelling background of jungle sounds we descend further through a 
lush jungle canopy backlit by a setting sun

dissolve to


ext jungle coastline  day magic hour

through a collage of shimmering heatwaves a dark otherworldly 
object drops into view backlit by the fiery orangered sphere of a 
setting tropical sun heading slowly towards us floating as if 
suspended by the rising heat of the jungle

continuing to approach the shimmering object resolves into a military 
assault helicopter its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight drawing 
closer the sound of powerful turbines throbbing in the heavy air 
becomes dominant overpowering

guided by colored smoke and landing lights the chopper looms hard into 
view pitching forward and settling to the ground kicking up a 
maelstrom of dust and vegetation


int command post  day magic hour

where a man wearing a military uniform watches through the large open 
windows the helicopter as it continues to approach before the skids 
have even touched down he sees the first of the men dressed in 
civilian clothes but carrying full combat gear alight gracefully from 
the chopper doubletiming in close order to one side the orders 
shouted by one man lost in the roar of the chopper

the man turns away from the window to a figure hidden in the shadows

man
hes here

he turns back lowering a bamboo shade obscuring the window


ext helicopter pad  night

on adjoining pads two other helicopters are visible in the bg can 
be seen several concrete and thatchwork buildings a secret command 
post disguised as a coastal fishing village

the post in a flurry of activity american advisors shouting directions 
to dozens of latin american soldiers who stand by to assist the landing 
helicopter and to load equipment into the other choppers

inside the chopper one man remains stretched out against the 
bulkhead as if asleep he stirs sits up lighting up a cigar with 
fatigue showing in his motion he leans forward descending to the 
ground 

a jeep pulls to stop the man swinging casually into the front seat 
tossing his gear into the rear with a lurch the jeep heads out towards 
the command post 

in the doorway two men solemnly watch as the jeep approaches reaching 
the command post the man alights from the jeep heading towards the two 
men

into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps major 
alan schaefer the team leader 38 an intelligent and intense man he 
informally salutes general hl philips 55 hardened closecropped 
graying hair his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of 
an elite commando unit in the us army he clasps schaefer warmly on 
the shoulder

philips
with affection
youre looking well dutch

schaefer
its been a long time general

they walk up the stairs entering the palapa leaving the other man on 
guard


int palapa  day

large two room concrete floor thatched walls and roof behind a 
partially drawn curtain in the kitchen a naked lightbulb hung from the 
rafters illuminates a bank of compact field radio equipment maps and 
aerial photographs otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in 
stark contrast to this hightech invasion

philips and schaefer enter the room

philips
growing serious
weve got a real problem here something right up your alley

they cross to the center of the room to a folding table covered with a 
large topographical map of the central american highland jungle 
philips leans over the table circling a set of coordinates and a mark 
on the open map

philips
eighteen hours ago i was informed that one of our choppers 
transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming 
little country was shot down 
point to the circled area
 the pilots radioed from the ground that they were all alive their 
position was fixed by the transponder beacon onboard the chopper
points
here

schaefer studies the map he looks up at philips

schaefer
thats over the border general

philips
dead serious
thats the problem apparently they strayed off course
pause
were certain theyve been captured by the guerrillas

schaefer looks up puffing lightly on the cigar

schaefer
quietly
what have you got in mind general

philips
we figure weve got less than twentyfour hours to catch up with them 
after that theres not much hope we want a rescue operation mounted 
tonight that doesnt give you much time

another puff on the cigar

schaefer 
what else it new when do we leave

philips looks at his watch

philips
you lift off in three hours
pause
theres one other thing

schaefer
whats that general

philips
someone else will be going in with you

schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray

schaefer
you know we dont work with outsiders general

voice os
who said anything about outsiders dutch

schaefer turns seeing the outline of a figure standing in the doorway 
of the communications room holding a sheaf of papers

wearing pressed fatigues dillon midthirties black walks into the 
room

although as rugged looking as the others his bearing and grooming 
indicate hes been away from the business of soldiering for sometime 
his quick intelligent eyes reveal his current profession

dillon
last time we danced it was lieutenant schaefer

a grin breaks out across schaefers face

schaefer
dillon you son of a bitch

the two men step forward and simultaneous swing from the hip as it to 
land a punch but their hands slap together in a gesture of 
friendship their forearms bulging testing each others strength

dillon
warmly
how you been dutch

they continue the contest schaefer has the edge forcing dillons arm 
slowly downward

schaefer
youve been pushing too many pencils dillon had enough

dillon
grinning
no way old buddy

schaefer
you never did know when to quit

they look into each others faces each remembering something from the 
past a moments hesitation and they quit the contest they laugh 
dillon slapping schaefer on the shoulder

dillon
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week 
was really something blew the entry points on three floors and 
neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat beautiful

schaefer
like the old days dillon

dillon
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya

schaefer looks at dillon quietly considering him

schaefer
wasnt my style were a rescue unit not assassins
smiles
this must be good big shot from the cia leaves his desk to come back 
to the bush whats so important

dillon 
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in 
this part of the world theyre about to get squeezed we cant let 
that happen i needed someone who could get the job done quick and 
quiet no screwups i needed the best the best so i pulled a few 
strings at the state department and here we are

schaefer
go on

dillon goes to the map

dillon
the setup is simple dutch one day job we pick up their trail at the 
chopper run em down grab the hostages and bounce back across the 
border before anyone knows we were there youve done it a hundred 
times nothing out of the ordinary

schaefer considers this

schaefer
and nothing we cant handle alone

philips breaks in

philips 
im afraid those are your orders major once you reach your objective 
dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge

schaefer looks from philips to dillon he still doesnt like it

dillon
not to worry dutch i havent lost my edge theyve got a head start 
on us in some real tough country otherwise believe me its a piece 
of cake

philips
gentlemen were losing time
to schaefer
youd better get your men ready
pause
good luck major


ext two assault helicopters  night

burst over the top of a ridge rising up in silhouette they perform a 
radical left bank turn and descend rapidly into an adjoining valley 
racing over the jungle at treetop level

as the helicopters perform dizzying highspeed maneuvers through the 
winding canyon the pilots voices can be heard coordinating their 
operations

pilot one vo
redbird two two bearing south three five zero one oclock on the 
saddle ridge over

pilot two vo
roger blue leader three five zero on your move over

the helicopters rise in perfect coordination over another ridge and 
bank sharply into the next valley leveling out as they go


int helicopter  night

illuminated by the eerie red glow of night lights are seven men 
dressed in jungle camouflage soft hats and camouflage facemakeup 
they wear no identity badges or insignias the man are checking their 
weapons making last minute adjustments to their gear

the compartment reverberates with the noise of the thumping rotors and 
the roar of air from the open doors

blain weapons and ordinance specialist a frightening bull of a man a 
240 pound killer removes from his shirtpocket a think plug of tobacco 
he looks across at

mac a huge bear of a man black holding am m60 machine gun blain 
holds out the tobacco to mac who refuses with a gentle shake of the 
head a knowing smile he knows whats coming

holding the plug between his teeth blain yanks free from his shoulder 
scabbard a wicked ten inch combat knife placing the razor sharp blade 
next to his lips he slices through the plug as if it were butter he 
chews thoughtfully

seated by the open doorway is ramirez a slight angular man an east 
la streetwise chicano

adding a final piece of camouflage tape to his pack harness he looks 
up and smiles faking a throw and the bulleting the tape to

hawkins the radioman and medic irish streettough reading a rolled
up magazine as if he were a rush hour commuter he snags the tape with 
an instinctual snap of the wrist continuing to read for a moment 
before looking up grinning at ramirez his boyish eager face belying 
the rugged professional beneath he turns his gaze to the man next to 
him

billy the kit carson scout an american indian proud stoic a man of 
quiet strength and simplicity carefully replacing the firing mechanism 
of his m203 working its action several times he looks up with a 
smile at hawkins

hawkins
shouting
hey billy how many marines does it take to eat a squirrel

billy looks back shaking his head uncomprehending

hawkins
two one to eat it and one to watch for cars

hawkins laughs heartily at his joke


ext jungle  night

clearing another ridge the helicopters plunge into a steep descent 
turning quickly into a deepwalled canyon the force of the turn 
accentuated by the changing pitch of the screaming turbines and the 
biting of rotors into the air


int helicopter  night

the men suspended in restraining harnesses from the bulkheads lean 
forward nearly upside down in response to the radical maneuver 
handling the situation with ease

blain holds out the tobacco to ramirez who swats at the offending 
object as if it were alive

ramirez
shouting
get that stinkin thing out of my face blain

grinning blain proffers the plug to each man each one refusing 
theyve done it a thousand times its an old gag but they obviously 
care for the man in a big way

blain
 bunch of slackjawed faggots around here 
holds up plug
 this stuff will put hair guaranteed 
chewing
 make you a goddamned sexual tyrantoesoreass just like me

this brings a chorus of hoots and shouts from the others

the helicopter makes another radical turn

schaefer and dillon seated near the cockpit communicate through 
headsets also linked to the pilot they consult a topographical map by 
red penlights

dillon
pointing to the map
our rendezvous points and radio freqs are indicated and fixed awacs 
contact on four hour intervals

schaefer
whos our backup on this

dillon
grinning
no such thing old buddy its a one way ticket once we cross that 
border were on our own

schaefer
this gets better by the minute


int cockpit  night 

the pilot and copilot are surrounded by an array of dimly lit gauges 
and switches before the copilot is a radar screen and an infrared 
display terminal on which the two helicopters appear as heat sources

pilot number one
 roger bird two two reconfirm insertion at tango charlie delta 
one zero niner on the grid at zero two two mark four by zero 
over

pilot number two vo

pilot number one

the pilot throws a switch on the panel before him


int helicopter  night

a blue light appears on the forward bulkhead schaefer is speaking over 
a radio telephone the copilot turns and hands him a clipboard 
schaefer reads notes his approval and hands it back


ext helicopter  night

flares up into position over the jungle and hovers as the support 
helicopter holds in a protective position above


int helicopter  night

dillon seems comfortable with the men showing ramirez a battered 
cigarette lighter from a famed commando unit from the past

but his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing mac who regards dillon 
with the cold suspicion reserved for an outsider mac looks up at 
blain his eyes narrowing

blains massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew he pauses eyes 
moving downward spotting his target

he hocks a thick vile stream of tobacco juice directly between 
dillons legs and onto the floor a gelatinous skein lacing across the 
toe of one boot dillon looks up his face goes cold and menacing

dillon
icy
man thats a real bad habit youve got

dillon turns back to ramirez ignoring mac and blain who continues to 
stare at him mac looks across at blain wide grins breaking across 
their huge faces cradled in blains arms as if it were a part of his 
body is a large canvascovered bundle blain looks down at his 
bundle almost affectionately

the pilots voice breaks in over schaefers headset

pilot number one vo
lz comin up in 30 seconds stand by the rappel lines

looking up schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest man who nods 
and in return passes the signal down the line

ramirez and blain pick up heavy metal conical devices attached to 
canvas bags filled with rope


ext helicopter  night

from the open doors the rappelling lines hurtle into space crashing 
through the double canopy of the trees and to the jungle floor below


int helicopter  night

the blue light changes to green schaefer nods rappelling devices snap 
into place gloved hands grab onto rope combat boots move into 
position

dillon
shouting to schaefer
you dont know how much i missed this dutch once you get this in 
your blood you never get it out

schaefer
you never were all that smart lets go

schaefer signals men leap from the chopper


ext jungle  night

the man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by the darkness 
below the helicopters depart thumping their way into the night

dissolve to


ext mountain ridge  day dawn

a light shower passes through the trees the sky clears revealing a 
lush and exotic foliage birds are beginning to sing but otherwise all 
is silent

the dense growth seems impenetrable but from a solid wall of 
undergrowth a hand appears and signals in a downward motion

as if by magic the assault team materializes quietly cautiously 
schaefer makes another gesture and the team moves forward in perfect 
harmony in pointlock step taking their cue from ramirez the 
pointman schaefer highly focused and alert to every sound and 
movement follows ramirez as if organically connected


ext jungle hillside  day

descending the steep mountain slope the team encounters an even denser 
growth of jungle at times moving by instinct as they are often 
visually separated at one point schaefer checks his compass flashing 
some hand signals to ramirez indicating a new direction ramirez nods 
and moves on schaefer signaling to the rest of the men


ext jungle clearing  day

blain in a defensive position sweeps the jungle slowly with his mp5 
he steps back and turns checking revealing in the background the 
wreckage of a us army uh1h helicopter hanging upside down twenty 
feet above the ground entangled in vines in the heavy capony badly 
damaged rotors bent its tail section blown away

a grappling hook is hurled from the ground clattering into the cargo 
hold hooking the edge of the airframe


int helicopter  day

ramirez moves cautiously searching for trip wires using his knife to 
check the edges of the seats and door frames grimly he glances at the 
two bodies slumped over the controls and then exits snapping into and 
rappelling down the rope to the ground

he joins schaefer standing in the fg they look up watching as dillon 
moves through the cockpit searching through pockets and compartments 
schaefer turns his back to the helicopter

ramirez
the pilots have each got one round in the head and whoever hit it 
stripped the shit out of it

schaefer studies the clearing eyes always moving wary he turns back 
looking at the chopper

schaefer
took em out with a heat seeker

ramirez 
theres something else major 

schaefer
mmmnnn

ramirez
i dont think that was any ordinary army taxi 

schaefer looks at him quizzically

ramirez
 looks more like a surveillance bird to me

dillon rappels down the line and approaches

dillon 
have you picked up their trail yet

schaefer taps ramirez on the shoulder and he moves away schaefer turns 
to dillon

schaefer
billys on it
indicates chopper
heat seeker pretty sophisticated for halfasses mountain boys

dillon
theyre getting better equipped every day

bill approaches from the background

billy
major looks like there were ten maybe twelve guerrillas looks like 
they took some prisoners from the chopper
points
then a different set of track over there

schaefer
puzzled
what do you mean

billy
six others us issue jungle boots they came in from the north then 
followed the guerrillas

schaefer turns to dillon

schaefer
mean anything to you

dillon
probably another rebel patrol they operate in here all the time

schaefer is obviously concerned about this he turns to billy

schaefer
get ahead see what you can find
to ramirez 
slow and easy
to dillon
we dont want any accidents

billy takes up the trail disappearing in to the jungle ramirez 
signals the team moves out


ext jungle  day

as billy reconnoiters ramirez looks back and gives a sign 

schaefer nods and rappels down cliff

as he joins ramirez there seem to be butterflies everywhere 

schaefer
whats he got

ramirez
same business guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper followed 
by men with american equipment 

ramirez seems concerned by this schaefer signals him to move on 
before he follows schaefer looks around theres something dodgy about 
this he goes over his head is a butterfly on a limb


ext jungle  overhead  day

as the assault team passes below a butterfly lands on what appears to 
be the bark of a tree it fans its wings and flies on

the impression of the butterfly remains in perfect relief as is 
imprinted on the bark the image fades revealing for an instant a 
gridwork of tiny scales on the bark

the bark moves changing colors like a chameleon revealing for an 
instant the form of something alive as it flows into the leaves once 
again becoming indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage

two eyes faintly flowing yellow appear in the foliage they blink 
disappearing and then become visible again


ext altered pov  day

seen through heatseeking vision studying the teams careful silent 
movements at they pass by

the sounds of the forest are also altered and enhanced with an 
electric staticlike quality

the observer scans over the men and then focuses on schaefer as he 
crouches down signaling forward and rear with a circular motion he 
refers to an object in his hand studying it carefully


ext schaefer  day

using a map in lining out a course on his compass the other team 
members appear silently clustering around him using hand signals 
schaefer indicates a course change


ext observers pov  day

watches closely as schaefer continues with his hand signals 
instructing his team


ext dense undergrowth  day

the hillside of a steep valley dark and foreboding billy passes by 
and halts removing his knife with his other hand he pulls down from 
overhead a thick vine severing it a thin stream of water emerges 
which he drinks

suddenly he stops letting the water drip to the ground he quietly 
releases the vine and brings his m203 shotgun to bear listening 
intently something seems wrong he brings his eyes upward and stares 
hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside

as his eyes strain to penetrate the dense intertwined canopy he is 
engulfed by the rising sounds of the jungle a cacophony of buzzing and 
clicking amplified in the sweltering heat of the day unable to locate 
a source to account for his anxiety he relaxes moving on resuming 
the track


billy minutes later

examines the ground as he moves growing confused and puzzled by what 
he sees before him he stops scrutinizing the jungle probing the 
world around him with his keen senses

hearing a faint rustling sound he looks up seeing a curtain of moss 
several feet away he takes a cautious step forward extending his 
weapon he reaches forward with his free hand touching the moss

behind the curtain a slight shifting of dark forms occurs he pauses 
and then with a sudden movement sweeps the moss aside 

a black explosion of fluttering wings as carrioneating birds rush past 
billys body

billys face seizes into a mask of horror his expression descending 
into a state of complete primitive shock his eyes staring transfixed 
inches away from the leering deathgrin of a human face upside down 
completely stripped of skin

reeling his body numbed by the sight before him he stumbles backwards 
and stops

vines threaded through their achilles tendons the bodies of three men 
skinned and gutted hang suspended in the think suffocating air 
buzzing with insects

billy turns away revulsed as ramirez moves quietly into view schaefer 
directly behind him ramirez stares at the bodies now seen to be in 
the first stages of deterioration strips of flesh torn away by the 
birds and other scavengers in an almost childlike manner he crosses 
himself

ramirez 
hoarse whisper 
holy mother 

schaefer moves into the clearing kneeling beside a bloody pile of 
clothing and entrails he examines the clothing and then rises holding 
a dog tag on a broken chain he reads the tag his face growing 
hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag recognizing the name

schaefer
to himself
js davis captain us army 

schaefers eyes move from the bloody dog tag to the bodies

schaefer 
coldly 
mac cut them down

mac moves forward withdrawing his combat knife the blade flashes 
cutting the vine as the first body thuds to the ground he bends over 
picking up other dog tags

schaefer turns to dillon

schaefer
i knew this man green berets out of fort bragg what the hell were 
they doing in here you got any answers for this dillon

dillon
stunned
jesus this is inhuman
to schaefer
uh i wasnt told of any operations in this area they shouldnt have 
been here

schaefer
angry
well somebody sent them

schaefer walks off mac steps out of the clearing sheathing his knife 
with a violent gesture passing ramirez

ramirez
seething
must have run into the guerrillas fucking animals

mac moves alongside blain

mac
spits
aint no way for a soldier to die
looks at blain
time to let ol painless out of the bag

grimly blain rips apart the velcro closures of the canvas bundle slung 
across his shoulder revealing a truly awesome weapon a sixbarreled 
minigun adapted for field combat


ext billy  day

kneels at the side of the original trail examining the ground he 
rises holding a spent cartridge schaefer approaches kneeling beside 
him

schaefer
what happened here billy

billy looks at him puzzled

billy
strange major there was a firefight shooting in all directions

schaefer
i cant believe jim hopper walked into an ambush

billy
i dont believe he did sir i couldnt find a single track just 
doesnt make sense

schaefer
what about the rest of hoppers men

billy shakes his head

billy
uncomfortably
no sign they never left here major
pause
its like they just disappeared

schaefer ponders a moment then to billy

schaefer
stick with the guerilla trail
to team
lets get it over with we move five meter spread no sound nothing

cut to


ext blain  day

blain feeds the magazine of beltedshells into the weapon cocking it 
he looks up at mac his eyes cold his face taut with anger

blain
payback time

blain hefts the minigun to his hip as mac draws back slightly on the 
breech bolt of the m60 letting it snap

they move on billy pausing to look at the jungle before disappearing 
into the foliage


ext altered pov  day

carefully watching this exchange from high in the treetop canopy the 
observer watches as schaefer turns and leaves the clearing cautiously 
moving into the jungle


ext jungle hillside  day

mac appears suddenly materializing out of the undergrowth pausing 
cautiously his senses alert intense almost nervous he moves on his 
huge body barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy 
undergrowth

dillon appears as he moves on he crosses over a fallen tree stepping 
down his foot breaks through a rotten portion a chuck of the log 
breaking free and rolling down the hill

dillon at once goes into a defensive position listening the jungle is 
silent he stands and starts to move forward suddenly mac appears 
within inches of dillons face macs face is menacing angry

mac
hissing barely audible
youre ghostin on me motherfokaaa i dont care who you are back 
in the world you give away our position again and ill bleed you 
quiet and leave your fuckin ass right here
hisses spits
got it

dillons eyes are wide and fixed staring back in cold hatred at mac 
controlling his rage he knows the rules

not waiting for a response mac turns and vanished into the jungle 
seething with anger dillon focuses on a still moving leaf and stem 
indicating macs exit point he moves on


ext blain  day

crouches under heavy foliage waiting he is joined by mac they glance 
briefly at each other scanning in opposite directions for movement and 
sounds they speak in whispers

blain
say bull whats goin down we got movement

mac
no shithead with his trenchcoat and deecodada ring was makin enough 
noise to get us all waxed i dont like that guy dont like him at my 
back i aint winding up like those bastards back there

mac sweating heavily wipes the moisture from his brow with his 
finger

blain pats the minigun affectionately

blain
i know what you mean bull but dont sweat it me and ol painless 
here are watchin the front door

mac
as always bro 

they do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other two men who 
have seen it all through a dozen nowin situations and have lived to 
tell about it

mac advances a few meters and signals slowly


ext knoll

the assault team moving up the hill barely visible in the heavy 
foliage the team moves cautiously into defensive positions holding a 
moment later they continue up the hill crawling

on their stomachs schaefer and ramirez clear the edge of the knoll 
seeing below a guerrilla village a huge spreading palapa covering 
implacements dug into a hillside descending to a winding stream bed 
below 30 men dressed in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian 
clothes armed with ak47 assault rifles move about the camp a heavy 
machine gun emplacement guards the entrance to the camp two men sit in 
the camouflaged emplacement


schaefer

sweeping the camp with binoculars sees a guard above the camp one of 
the man picks up a handheld rocket launcher placing it beside a 
bandolier of rockets and a radio set and consuls taken from the us 
surveillance helicopter as if preparing to take them away

schaefer puts down the glasses looking at ramirez who nods in 
acknowledgment a sudden muffled cry brings schaefers attention to one 
end of the camp where a heavily thatched door covers and opening to 
the palapa a guard stands at the door

the door flies open as a hostage shirtless hands tied behind his 
back staggers through the door as if kicked from behind

the man falls to the ground feebly trying to regain his footing 
although difficult to see from schaefers vantage point the mans 
battered face and weltcovered back indicate he has been severely 
tortured

emerging from the palapa a guerrilla leader moustached and wearing a 
sidearm approaches the beaten man kicking him viciously in the 
stomach rolling him to his side

kneeling beside the man he withdraws an automatic from his holster and 
cocks the hammer grabbing the man by the hair he jams the muzzle into 
the mans ear and with a violent twist pulls the trigger

the guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back to the palapa 
still holding the pistol closing the door behind him


schaefer

grimfaced at having witnesses the murder lowers him glasses a look 
of cold determination on his face quickly he and ramirez ease down the 
escarpment joining the other team members

schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb and the team members 
gather in close huddle formation

schaefer
whispering angry
just killed one of the prisoners no time for invitations we take 
them now


ext blain and mac  day

crawl silently through the underbrush with nearly imperceptible 
movements blain slips out of the cartridge pack ditching the mini
gun he withdraws his combat knife placing it between his teeth

they move through the underbrush in tandem like two bug cats 
stalking mac freezes the sweat pouring from his face holds up his 
hand as blain stops

using a blade of grass mac points out a metal trip wire following it 
to a hidden claymore mine blain grins making a switching gesture 
carefully mac detaches the lead wires directing the mine towards the 
camp he reattaches the wires nodding at blain


ext jungle  overhead  altered pov  day

seen through heatseeking vision focused on blain and mac lying in 
the grass below their bodies outlined in lumonous aureoles the 
observer sees the network of trip wires guarding the approaches to the 
machine gun nests the wires glow as if electrified standing out in 
hardedged relief in contrast to the jungle foliage he moves higher 
into the forest canopy


ext billy  day

on schaefers signal rises up pulling a sentry to him covering his 
mouth with his hand jerking him backwards and to the side knocking 
him off balance with a sweeping motion of his left leg killing him 
with his combat knife


ext schaefer  day

belly crawls silently through the tall grass just outside and above the 
main entrance to the camp he stops studying the ancient rusted 
skeleton of a truck parked on a level spot above the camp ist engine 
quietly idling the truck is jacked and blocked up one rear wheel 
attached to a beltdrive leading to a pump drawing water from a river 
nearby in the open cab of the truck a guard is on duty watching the 
high ground above the camp

schaefer moves out heading for the guard


ext machine gun emplacement  day

while one guerrilla attends to his equipment the other attentively 
watches the approaches to the camp he is momentarily distracted by a 
buzzing fly which he annoyingly swats at with his hand

he hears something to his side turning to investigate the huge 
hamhock fist of mack smashes into his throat

simultaneously blain rises up behind the other man grabs him by the 
hair pulling him down his combat knife driving downward


ext truck  day

a satchel charge is looped over the gearshift lever resting on the 
floorboard schaefer lying low across the seat of the truck turns and 
looks seeing the guard lying in a heap in the foliage


ext ramirez  day

moves into position to the side and above the camp he carefully checks 
the readiness of his sixshot grenade launcher also setting his mp5 
in front of him ready for action


ext schaefer

crouched to the side of the truck watches the camp seeing below 
through the dense undergrowth ramirez barely visible signaling

before him are two fragmentation grenades he looks at his watch and 
then up the hill to


dillon and hawkins

their weapons ready dillon picks up his binoculars focusing on the 
machine gun emplacement seeing a man his face covered by a hat the 
head rises revealing the face of blain who looks above the camp and 
slightly nods putting his glasses down motions to hawkins

dillon
to hawkins
ready kid

hawkins grins back together they slip through the grass downward 
towards the edge of the camp


ext schaefer

holds his huge commando machete on a diagonal pushing through the 
belt slicing it cleanly turning he crawls silently to the rear of the 
truck positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton truck

he squats and with an enormous concentrated effort deadlifts the 
rear of the truck its rusted springs and frame beginning to creak and 
groan slightly

with a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of its blocks and then 
pushes forward he rolls aside disappearing into the ground cover as 
the truck its tireless rims digging into the earth lops down the 
hill slowly picking up speed


ext guerrilla village  day

a guerrilla alerted by the sound of the approaching truck looks up at 
the hillside seeing the vehicle still moving down the hill at a 
moderate roll he calls out and several guerrilla leaves their posts 
moving out to prepare to stop the truck

the truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed heading towards the 
main palapa the men rush forward surrounding the truck trying to 
slow it down but the truck rolls smashing through the front wall of 
the palapa the men gather around truck and then look back up the hill


ext altered pov  day

watching as schaefer pulls the pin and launches the grenade into the 
air the observer following its arc as it spirals deadcenter into the 
camp bouncing twice before rolling into the fuel dump which a 
moment later explodes into an incredible fireball

the expanding fireball released from the explosion is to the observer 
like an erupting sun mentarily blinding him


ext guerrilla camp  day

the truck is blown up into the air by the explosion a moment later 
the satchel charge detonates with an earsplitting explosion tearing 
the truck apart

schaefer races down the hillside joined by dillon leaving hawkins to 
cover them bullets burst around their feet as they run low firing 
short bursts to his left and right

he fires the undermounted grenade launcher sending a round into a gun 
position in the trees still running he breaks open the breach 
slamming in another 40mm round from the cartridge pack at his waist

blain and mac fire the heavy machine guns laying down a withering 
curtain of lead shredding the camp taking out five guerrillas at 
once


ext guerrilla camp  day

a man almost completely on fire is hit by an onslaught of gunfire 
ripping him back into the jungle

ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the sixshooter seconds later the 
machine gun implacement erupts in a series of explosions blowing two 
guerrillas into the air

at the hillside hut two guerrillas move into position by the window 
drawing down on schaefer as he appears racing down the hill

as they are about to open fire dillon appears yelling out a warning

dillon

schaefer dives hitting the ground as dillon opens fire taking out the 
guerrillas schaefer rolls to his feet spins firing the 203 grenade 
launcher completely destroying the hut


ext altered pov  day

as the observer regains its vision an eerie surreal experience of 
sight and sound unfolds

bullets streak through the air leaving bloodred trails of heat like 
laser blasts as they impact into the guerillas we hear the enhanced 
slapping of bullets seeing tiny blossoms of heat mushroom out of their 
bodies

we hear the horrific deformed cries and screams of the dying men

another searing blinding explosion sends pieces of shrapnel ripping 
through the air some of them roaring past the observers position 
like tiny meteors


ext guerrilla village

at the entrance way to the main palapa a guerrilla stands in the 
doorway giving cover fire to his comrades as they fall back inside

jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa billy drops directly in 
front of the guerrilla

from the side unseen by billy another guerrilla thrusts out with a 
knife billy ducking backwards the tip of the knife slashing his face 
with a lightning move billy whips his arm up and around the guerrilla 
locking his elbow breaking the joint

still holding the man he fires blowing the other guerrilla off his 
feet with the shotgun portion of his weapon he looks at the guerrilla 
out of the corner of his eye he suddenly strikes breaking his neck 
dropping him in a heap

billy continues on racing down the stairs firing the m203

meanwhile blain is crouched next to a tree providing cover behind 
blain at the edge of the camp circling around from below two 
guerrillas appear and fire a grenade round which explodes behind blain 
fragments ripping into the tree next to which blain is standing bark 
and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest one piece tearing into 
his upper shoulder the hits have no effect on the huge man and with a 
savage growl he spins opening fire raking the two attackers with the 
minigun

nearby mac charges from the jungle on a dead run diving over a fallen 
tree as machine gun fire rakes the ground around him

blain spotting the sniper high in a tree opens fire with the mini
gun shredding the tree sending the guerrilla crashing down through 
the roof of the palapa


int palapa  day

the sniper crashes through the roof landing on the floor near hawkins 
and ramirez who do a quick double take before opening fire on a group 
of fleeing guerrillas taking out two giving chase to the others

schaefer and dillon appear at the top of the staircase schaefer 
freezing as he sees below a guerrilla raising an ak47 preparing to 
fire schaefer tackles dillon the two men hurling into the air a 
moment later bullets ripping into the crates behind where they were 
standing

dillon rises up kicking over a crate shooting the guerrilla who is 
trying to bring the gun around to fire at him

schaefer crouches covering the upper entrances to the palapa as 
ramirez rushes past joining schaefer from the corner of his eye 
schaefer catches a movement with a whipping backhanded throw he lets 
fly his commando machete 

the machete impales the attacking guerrilla driving him backwards 
pinning him to a post

schaefer
stick around

schaefer and ramirez run towards the lower levels side by side firing 
as they go

they reach a door schaefer taking out an attacking guerrilla ramirez 
grabs the side of the door shoots a look to schaefer and throws it 
open with schaefer covering him ramirez takes a quick peak inside and 
then rushes into the room


int room  day

at one end is a stairway leading to an escape door a guerrilla seen 
from the waist up scrambles down the stairs

at the base of the stairs a guerrilla holding an ak47 on his hip 
turns and starts to fire

schaefer and ramirez respond with full auto bursts which rip into the 
guerrilla spinning him around knocking over a crude wooden table 
scattering a briefcase with burning papers food cans and liquor 
bottles

as he spins he fires the weapon an arcing line of slugs slamming into 
the tin roof sending down a shower of rust and dirt he falls to the 
ground dead

ramirez charges through the dust and thick smoke to cover the fallen 
men schaefer following close behind jerking a new clip from his ammo 
belt

suddenly another guerrilla erupts from behind some ammunition crates 
drawing down on ramirez with a machine pistol

schaefer
shouting
down

as the guerrilla fires schaefer smashes the butt of his empty weapon 
into the guerrillas shoulder knocking the gun aside the slugs 
thudding into the wall harmlessly

he hits the guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to the head with the 
barrel of his weapon the guerrilla is hurled backward crashing into 
the wooden crates and to the floor

ramirez recovering quickly descends the stairs with catlike agility 
disappearing

schaefer crouches and spins jamming a new clip into the rifle 
scanning the palapa for any other movement he races to the main door 
of the room shouting into the palapa

he sees blain charging down the steps catching his attention he 
signals him on out the back to cover ramirez

schaefer
to hawkins

as blain runs down the stairs hawkins already has the radio off his 
back setting up the portable satellite dish antenna

hawkins

ext palapa  water area  day

ramirez blain and billy race down the back stairs of the palapa 
firing minigun automatic and grenade rounds at the escaping 
guerrillas as they flee the area splashing charging across the 
shallow river

the guerrillas are history in no uncertain terms


int palapa  day

for the first time schaefer studies the interior of the cavernous 
palapa seeing the enormous stockpile of weapons equipment and 
supplies stacked along the walls obviously a major military stronghold 
hidden deep within the mountains mac hustles up to schaefer a look of 
urgency on his face

schaefer

mac
nods

central american im a fuckin chinaman by the looks of em id say

are russians military advisors by the look of it something big was 
about to happen here

schaefer looks at mac a moment a flush of anger beginning to show

schaefer
good work mac clear the area no traces get the men ready to move

schaefer goes back into the room looking down at the unconscious 
guerrilla racking a round into the chamber reloading his weapon

he kneels staring into the face of a woman anna dark late twenties 
despite her blood and dirtsmeared face she is beautiful

schaefer
closes eyes
shit 

he checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her pistol 
ejecting the clip he stands beginning to shuffle through the papers 
scattered about the room staring at one he looks up the pieces 
falling together


ext jungle  day

ramirez at a crouch runs through the jungle following the obvious 
signs of the guerrillas retreat he emerges from the trees into an 
opening leading to a sheer rock cliff towering fifty feet above the 
ground scanning the wall he sees movement and quickly takes cover as 
automatic fire rips up the ground before him


ext rock wall  day

near the center of which a narrow cut two feet wide leads to the top 
of the cliff giving access to the adjoining ridge

two guerrillas scramble up through the chimney assisted by a rope 
which with withdraw as they reach the top ramirez takes out one man 
the other taking cover returning fire


ext base of rock wall  day

blain joins ramirez behind cover at the foot of the cliff as they 
take cover ramirez notices the wound on blains shoulder

ramirez
youre hit youre bleedin man

blain looks briefly at the wound

blain
spits
aint got time to bleed

on a signal they both clear cover and fire long bursts from their 
weapons up the cliff

the smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered by withering fire 
they duck down as a grenade explodes nearby ramirez quickly replaces 
the 40mm rounds into the sixshooter

blain
sonofabitchs dug in like a alabama tick 
spits
 jack us around all day

ramirez
hell dude we dont have all day

ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire blasting six rapid
fire shots on a higharc trajectory towards the rocks blain reacts

blain
shit pancho

blain dives against the protective cover of the rock wall covering his 
head ramirez casually hops across squatting next to blain they make 
eyecontact

ramirez
whats your problem dude

before blain can answer ramirez puts his fingers into his ears and 
grimaces just as 

the entire hillside explodes blowing the guerrillas into the air a 
torrent of vegetation and earth raining down the cliff obscuring blain 
and ramirez


int palapa room  day

schaefer is staring out the window his weapon slack in one arm still 
holding the paper dillon enters obviously excited about what he has 
found he sees the papers on the floor he reads through them quickly 
growing even more excited

her hands bound in front of her he turns back to the others

out to him

quietly

dillon

the shoulders crawling across the pack on dillons back is a huge 
scorpion

mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his blade holding it before 
the wincing dillon anna smirks nodding to the writhing stinging 
insect

anna
in spanish

dillon looks at mac

dillon
thanks

mac
coolly

mac flings the scorpion to the ground crushing it with his boot he 
looks up at dillon walks away dillon follows pulling anna behind 
him

billy guarding the rear glances furtively around the clearing he 
moves a step forward and stops freezing

slowly he turns back his eyes riveted upon the treeline above the 
camp his eyes strain his senses registering a fear he cannot name or 
see

something is out there in the trees waiting watching

billy turns and walks into the jungle pausing one last time to look 
behind him before he too disappears from sight

the jungle grows silent


ext observers altered pov  day

looking down from his vantage point to the treeline below terraces 
like stepping stones focusing on a tree fifty feet away

the observer utters a low trill and springs outward into space 
hurtling downward towards his landing point the canopy of the trees 
approaching in a staccato rush of green

the sounds of the forest are again altered and enhanced with an 
electric staticlike quality as the observer descends fluidly through 
the trees and to the ground

he enters the camp surveying the terrible destruction and carnage he 
sees the dead guerrillas the dissipating heat from their bodies 
leaving them pale and ghostlike as if fading light about to 
extinguish he sees their weapons the cold hard steel of the barrels 
registering ice blue in his vision


ext observers pov of his hand  day

as it appears pulsing in a pale magenta heat low to the ground 
holding his weapon he lays down the weapon picking up the scorpion 
turning it slowly in his fingers examining it it looks like an exotic 
flower its color fading from sight turning to black

a low sound is uttered something vaguely familiar about it a nearly 
human voice a distorted imitation of mac

hunter os
filtered
dillon over here

again the phrase is uttered improving closer to macs inflection and 
accent

hunter os
dillon over here

the hunter lowers the pitch

hunter os
dillon over here

the last effort is a chilling simulation of macs voice


ext observers hand  day

drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which changes instantly back 
to the observers skin tones


ext observers pov  day

he turns and focuses on the area where the team left camp

he crouches and springs to the lower branches of a tree grasping them 
with his clawed threefingered hands pulling himself up and through 
the branches with astounding speed and simianlike dexterity his 
spurred prehensile feet grasping and thrusting him to a vantage point 
fifty feet above the ground

as he moves on the jungle grows suddenly quiet as if aware sensing 
that the hunter is now stalking no longer observing


ext jungle valley  day

the twilight world of a prehistoric forest filled with gigantic plants 
and towering trees overgrown with vines and creepers

the team with billy at point walk alongside a wandering stream bed 
weirdly illuminated by shafts of light streaming through openings in 
the trees as if from spotlights a hundred feet above

it is midday hot and humid the air buzzing with the sounds of 
insects the crying of birds and monkeys the men are moving fast and 
quiet straining to see into the dense jungle aware of every sound 
sweating quietly slapping at biting insects


ext giant hardwood tree  day

lies across their path as the man climb over a rotten section mac 
stops to assist blain with his minigun

mac

small silver pocket flask he takes a nip passing the flask to blain 
who also takes a sip

blain

distancing them anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow she trips 
on a root falling to the ground she lies there motionless he quickly 
reaches down to haul her to her feet

dillon
urgently
shit come on 

like an uncoiled spring anna turns flinging a handful of dirt into 
his face momentarily blinding him she lunges for his rifle with her 
bound hands

suddenly the barrel of an mp5 is thrust into her face

looking up she sees ramirez calmly holding the weapon on her the look 
in his eyes indicating hed hove no trouble shooting her

ramirez
in spanish

she looks back at dillon wiping the dirt from his eyes she moves on 
ramirez gives him a cold look as dillon hurries past

ramirez
coolly
you should put her on a leash agent man if you cant handle her just 
say the word

dillon moves on ignoring ramirez who turns scanning the jungle 
behind him before moving on dillon catches up with anna turning her 
sharply by the chin

dillon
cold in spanish

she looks at him contemptuously undaunted she will try it again she 
breaks away from his grasp and moves on dillon watching her go he 
wont hesitate next time

as he travels directly overhead timing his movement with those of the 
team he moves lower closer to the slowly moving humans


ext river bed  day

the team moves cautiously through the winding stream bed now wearing 
their clothing in various stages of disarray for comfort sweat 
dripping from their bodies

billy in the lead picks his way along the riverbank his 
concentration rapt aboriginal his face a trancelike mask of 
expectation

blain cradling the heavy minigun as if it were a toy swings the 
weapon relentlessly across his field of view he pauses to adjust the 
hanging belted loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack 
magazine an insect lands on his face and is trapped in the grease 
paint near his lips he draws the hapless bug into his mouth with his 
tongue and quietly spits it out his concentration unbroken

mac follows holding the m60 high across his chest

schaefer bent cautious his feet moving aside the dry leaves on the 
ground heel to toe and on foot edges he glances around checking the 
teams position and progress

hawkins follows his mouth open breathing deeply exhausted the radio 
a 60 pound demon

anna struggling to climb a section of the stream bank slips on some 
loose dirt unable to assist herself with her hands tied she nearly 
falls dillon prods her with his rifle forcing her to her feet she 
scrambles up the bank dillon following


ext river bank  day

as billy enters a small clearing bordered on one side by the towering 
trees carpeting the mountainside high above in the thick 
impenetrable treeline brightly colored birds squawk loudly chasing 
each other from branch to branch

suddenly billy stops schaefer holds up his hand and the team freezes 
in position an eerie silence like a slowly falling curtain descends 
over the jungle until even the buzzing and clicking of insects have 
ceased


ext team members  day

sensing an ambush move quietly into the foliage dillon moves into the 
undergrowth dragging anna with him he slings his mp5 over his 
shoulder withdrawing his knife grasping anna by her shirt collar and 
pushing her to the ground he holds the weapon near her throat dillon 
signals to ramirez who approaches dillon hands ramirez the knife

dillon

before ramirez can respond dillon slips into the undergrowth ramirez 
holds the knife on anna cautiously scanning around him for movement

unseen by ramirez annas outstretched hands slowly tighten around a 
stout rootburl lying loose on the ground


ext billy  at the river bed  day

he remains frozen and transfixed staring into the treeline something 
is moving fluid silently and downward into the forest billy remains 
rooted to the spot lost in concentration

towards billy dillon appears looking to mac for an explanation mac 
ignores him concentrating on the jungle dillon looks forward at 

billy his eyes riveted to the capony above as he unconsciously 
reaches to his throat grasping a leather pouch secured to his neck by 
a thong he fingers the medicine bag talisman

experienced fighter swings the burl with all her might catching 
ramirez hard on the side of the head just above the eye opening a 
wicked gash spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin as

in the bushes her blood splattered face glazed with terror his eyes 
vacant he approaches angry wary but the girl is so stunned he sees 
the trail of blood and crushed grasses leading into the jungle he 
gives a low whistle and then moves on the rest of the team assuming 
defensive positions around the clearing

then a few yards later the radio ramirez cautiously parts the brush 
before him a look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes of his face

mutters incoherently in spanish still dazed shaking her head dillon 
listens closely to her response ramirez turns to schaefer he seems 
confused

ramirez
she says the jungle came alive and took him 

dillon
that isnt what she said she said 
pondering to ramirez
 she doesnt make sense

ramirez
growing angry
couple of sappers been trailing us all the way from the camp major 
billy heard them she set us up ran for it they were waiting i 
shouldve wasted the bitch when i had the chance

schaefer looking at hawkins bloodstained equipment lying at annas 
feet looks up

schaefer
quietly
why didnt they take the radio and his weapon
pause
why didnt she escape

ramirez and dillon look at the equipment and then to the girl still 
numb with shock

dillon
grimly remembering
they did the same thing to davis 

the two veteran commandos look at each other finding no explanation 
between them

schaefer
urgent to the others
i want him found sweep pattern and double back fifty meters

they move out schaefer moves into the jungle searching he crouches 
at the base of a huge mahogany tree covered with vines studying the 
jungle he moves away from the tree and into the forest looking for 
signs on the ground

where he was sitting a drop of blood falls another drop falls 
dripping from a leaf and above that from another leaf above that 
high in the top of the tree suspended from vines from his ankles is 
hawkins body his chest a gaping wound

he hands there as if he were an animal field dressed


ext blain  day

crouched in the undergrowth there is a movement in the brush before 
him he wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the 
minigun to fire

the sound is growing closer blain levels the weapon a smile crosses 
his face

blain
whispers
come on in you fuckers come on in ol painless is waitin 

the movement in the brush is growing louder blains finger moves 
closer to the trigger

suddenly a small tapir bursts through the leaves startling blain he 
relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight he 
stands 

something grazes his shoulder a gout of blood erupting he starts to 
turn the minigun held low ready to fire 

 from out of the jungle 75 feet away the hunters weapon streaks 
toward him like a missile he screams as it enters his back erupting 
from his chest in an explosion of blood


ext mac  day

has heard blains cry he moves fast through the brush he hears a 
rustling in the bushes a wet sucking sound mac charges into the 
clearing in the instant before the hunter disappears into the forest 
mac sees a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a 
hallucination

the hunters eyes flare momentarily from the green before they vanish

mac sees his friend lying on the ground his chest open the powerful 
man dead

mac
shouting
contact 30 right

he opens fire with his m203 belted shells slamming into the weapon 
from the magazine at his waist expending it in one long burst

 
ext the other team members  day

flying through the jungle weapons ready eyes searching for movement


ext mac  day

he throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage lunges forward 
grabbing the minigun as he stands the cartridge belt attached to 
blain strings out between them

he opens fire and the foliage before him explodes with the fury of the 
terrible weapon mac sweeps the minigun from left to right like a man 
possessed mowing down the jungle

the other team members race into sight and begin firing with mac

ramirez opens fire with the sixshooter grenade launcher explosions 
rock the jungle


ext hunter  day

moving a piece of shrapnel cuts his shoulder a splash of orange blood 
spatters across the leaves of a nearby tree bullet holes ripping 
through the surrounding foliage


back to scene  mac

more firing mac his weapon expended continues to thrust the minigun 
forward still squeezing the trigger

suddenly as quickly as it started the firing stops the men move 
catlike into the jungle reloading searching their nerves taut 
stretched to the limit ready to fire again at any second

mac is frozen eyes wide unblinking his breath coming in rapid gasps 
as he stares into the jungle still squeezing the trigger of the 
weapon its breech locked open gunsmoke wafting from the chamber and 
barrel

schaefer moves in front of mac still staring into the jungle dillon 
pushes anna into the clearing moving towards the body anna looks at 
the body and then up to mac schaefer sees a terrifying moment of 
recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at mac he 
turns to mac

mac
confused

at these words anna reacts in shock drawing a slight breath schaefer 
turns sees her staring at mac he turns back

schaefer

mac
still dazed
i saw it

schaefer turns back to see anna staring fixidly at mac watching his 
lips schaefer turns quickly to blains body and kneels alongside 
dillon


schaefer

is at blains side shocked at the sight of the mutilated body he is 
joined by dillon

schaefer
to himself
blain 
puzzled
 just like the others no powder burns no shrapnel

dillon
the wound all fused cauterized what the hell did this

schaefer stands looking at the body in the background anna drifts 
away from the group

schaefer
to mac
 mac

mac stares ahead dumbly not hearing he grabs mac by his shoulders 
shaking him violently back to awareness

schaefer
demanding angry
mac mac look at me

mac turn to face schaefer a shocked expression on his face

schaefer
urgent

mac is suddenly angry and frustrated he has no explanation

mac

ramirez runs from the jungle breathing hard shaking his head

ramirez
nothing the same thing not a fucking trace no bodies blood 
anything

mac stands instinctively the team has now grouped around schaefer 
their weapons pointing into the jungle ready their nerves on total 
edge schaefer looks upward at the darkening sky

schaefer
quietly

ridge mined with everything were got

mac

schaefer looks down at blains body he turns to ramirez and billy

schaefer
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back well bury him in 
the morning

mac

anna

as they leave approaches the brush her attention focused on something 
clinging to the leaves well off to the side of where mac saw the 
hunter she draws closer reaching out hesitant as if drawn 
magnetically to the leaves


ext detail  hunters blood  day

clinging to the leaves thick viscous paleorange almost like the 
sap of an exotic plant her fingers hover above it hesitantly and 
then touch it


anna

examines the blood transfixed dillon appears at her shoulder 
startling her he motions for her to return she turns wiping the 
blood onto her pants leg


ext encampment  dusk 

the team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of trees a solid 
wall to their backs the men are barely visible they blend in so well

nearby mac is stringing a trip wire low to the ground covering it 
with leaves and grass he moves into camp and reports to schaefer

mac
weve got most of the flares frags and two claymores just outside 
nothins comin close to here without trippin on somethin

schaefer
thank you sergeant

mac starts to go but schaefer places his hand on his shoulder

schaefer
im sorry bull its never easy he was a good soldier

mac
hardened
the best friend i ever had

mac turns and walks through the camp stopping beside a dark object on 
the ground he kneels beside the poncho pulling back the zipper 
revealing blains face looking peaceful in death as if lying in 
state

mac removes something from his pocket holding it in his hand studying 
it


detail of object in macs hand

the small whiskey flash the chrome rubbed away in places revealing the 
brass beneath and a medallion depicting the 101 1st airborne division


mac

takes a tiny sip from the flask he replaces the cap and lifts the flap 
of blains shirt pocket placing the flask inside he lingers on the 
face and then closes the zipper

mac
softly
goodbye bro


anna

is huddles into a foxhole her hands still tied in front of her she 
looks down at her pants leg the hunters bloodstain glows with a faint 
luminosity she places her fingers near the stain


int hunters ship  night

hawkins body impacts the floor with a thump


ext encampment  day dusk

a momentary hush falls over the symphony of night sounds anna and 
billy turn towards the trees with a growing look of wariness the 
others setting up the radio show no response


int hunters ship  day dusk

the hunters foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse the prehensile 
spur digging deep pinioning the body to the ground the hunters hand 
extends his fingers puncturing the skin at the base of the spine 
gripping the vertebrae

with otherworldly strength the arm pulls the entire spinal column 
ripping free from the body a sickly snapping and popping of cartilage 
separating from bone and tissue


ext encampment  day dusk

ramirez is tuning in the compact field radio equipped with a crypto
phone device dillon holds the handset

dillon
to phone

a crackle of static over the radio

tight circle ramirez and billy facing outward in defensive positions 
anna silent watching schaefer is look at him

schaefer

dillon glares back schaefer leaves lost in thought ramirez looks up 
at the impenetrable canopy

ramirez

dillon turns to mac

dillon
mac who hit us today

mac is still obviously feeling the anger and bitterness of the 
mystifying event

mac

remembering

dillon
abruptly pushing

mac
returning angry
those eyes disappeared but i know one thing major 
pause

dillon ponders this for a moment staring hard at mac mac gets up

mac

mac departs dillon watches mac as he creeps forward to the sentry 
position he turns to ramirez

dillon
ask her again what did she see what happened to hawkins

ramirez turns to anna they talk quietly in spanish dillon watching 
listening carefully ramirez turns back to dillon

ramirez
interpreting
she says the same thing it was the jungle 

ramirez looks up at billy who continues to stare into the jungle 
aware catlike reacting to every sound his nerves on edge as if 
ready to snap ramirez rises moves alongside his friend dillon 
watching closely

ramirez
whispering imploring
you know something billy what is it

billy turns his face a mask of primal fear he moves close to ramirez

billy
im scared

ramirez is frightened by this

ramirez
shaken
bullshit you aint afraid of no man

billy looks deep into his eyes chilling ramirez to the bone looking 
at his with eyes which have seen on an instinctual level what the 
others have so far only begun to sense

billy
theres something out there waiting for us it aint no man

billy turns away moving a short distance away taking up his position 
dillon looks after him and then into the blackness of the jungle 
canopy dillon speaks to ramirez

dillon
hes losing his cool theres nothing out there but a couple of men 
that were going to have to take down

despite his words there is an edge of doubt in his voice schaefer 
returns hes overheard this exchange hes holding the group of dog 
tags taken from davis men he holds them up for dillon to see

schaefer
you still dont get it do you dillon he took davis and now he 
wants us


int hunters ship  night

close on an oval chamber made of an otherworldly looking metal with a 
strange copperlike patina its interior bathed in intense blue light 
in the chamber is hawkins skull cap and spinal column still attached

the light field suddenly changes as all connective tissue flesh and 
blood and drawn away from the bony structures with incredible force 
disintegrating as they rush toward the sides of the chamber

the light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the hunters hands 
remove the glazed polished trophy from the chamber he turns 
carefully placing it upon a glowing surface he touches the trophy 
gently feeling its texture as a man might touch the hide of a big 
cat he pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque force field covers 
the trophies


ext mac  night later

hunched down in a foxhole the minigun on a tripod before him its 
nearly a full moon the jungle a montage of shadows and reflections 
mac stares into the night his eyes always moving

mac
distant whispering
its the same kinda jungle bro same moon everything
pause
 areal number ten night remember bro only you and me the only 
ones out of the whole fuckin platoon who made it out

his eyes probe the darkness remembering

mac
 we walked out on top of em not a scratch not a fuckin scratch

he ponders this a moment

mac
 i promise you this bro however he is i hope hes plannin to 
hit us again
pauses spits
 cause hes got my name on em


int hunters ship  night

a force field that permeates the jungle becoming one with the trees 
and foliage the hunter walks down a corridor of solid light leading 
to an opening to the jungle as the hunter reaches the doorway he 
changes from visible to invisible moving on into the night


ext encampment  night

the mist has thickened the night alive with a million jungle sounds 
the team members sleep uneasily if at all

mac although weary stares hard into the night waiting each small 
sound a potential enemy a lull spreads over the jungle animals and 
insects quieting mac tightens his grip on the minigun

billy awakens peering into the night nothing

suddenly a metallic click a pop the sound of a warning flare 
rocketing into the canopy a moment later a brilliant flash as the 
flare burns illuminating the camp

an echoing eerie scream fills the night as a dark shape in the mist 
rockets through the undergrowth towards mac

mac spins hauling the heavy gun around just as something crashes into 
his upper body driving the huge man into the foxhole

a desperate battle for life ensues illuminated with the strobing light 
of the descending flare macs enraged shouts and roars mingled with 
horrific screams fill the night

macs razoredged knife slashes in the light blood spatters his face 
as he attacks fiercely

schaefer and ramirez rush at a crouching run towards the foxhole their 
weapons ready

a tremendous climatic scream from the foxhole and then silence 
schaefer and ramirez approach cautiously mac stands his face and 
clothes drenched in blood some of it his his breath coming in rapid 
gasps he looks at schaefer whispering hoarsely

mac
got the motherfucker 

as the flare breaks through the canopy dying out in great flickering 
bursts the man stare down into the foxhole a huge jungle boar lies 
mutilated in a pool of blood still quivering in the final throes of 
death the flare dies out

mac shaking from adrenaline breathing heavily looks down at the 
dying animal

mac
incredulous
a pig just a fucking pig 

schaefer shines his teknalight onto the boar playing the light along 
its massive hulk its razor edges tusks gleaming in the light ramirez 
appears by his side looking down at the huge carcass

ramirez
holy shit mac

nearby unnoticed by the men anna stoops her hands still bound 
picking up an mp5 from the ground she turns looking for an avenue of 
escape running for the jungle

but the forest looks foreboding and sinister she stops staring at the 
jungle the moonlight reflected off leaves like a thousand eyes for a 
brief second she imagines she can see the hunters eyes crashing 
towards her the shifting patterns of light and dark making the jungle 
seem to strobe like it is about to rush in at her she freezes 
paralyzed by fear by her memories of the attack

she drops the mp5 to the ground

back at the foxhole schaefer and ramirez help the still shaken mac 
from the hole schaefer looks at mac at the huge gash across his 
chest

schaefer
get a field dressing on that right away

suddenly he remembers anna

schaefer
wheres the girl

they all turn ready to move and then stop coming forth from the 
shadows anna appears still frightened seeking the security of the 
soldiers

from the darkness nearby billys voice in a hoarse whisper

billy os
urgently
major over here

schaefer turns apprehensive something in billys voice 

he walks over to billy standing with a flashlight pointing to the 
ground they see blains body bag slashed open covered in blood 
ramirez appears

billy
the body its gone

ramirez
came in through the trip wires took it right out from under our 
noses 

anna appears between schaefer and ramirez staring down at the empty 
bloodsoaked body bag she looks up into schaefers eyes


ext encampment  day predawn 

a patchy ground fog covers the area anna in her foxhole awakens 
listening to the rising sounds of the jungle monkeys begin to forage 
their noisy chattering and screeching filling the air

a bird flutters back to its nest a chameleon emerges onto a leaf 
directly above annas head

anna carefully extends her arm allowing the lizard to crawl onto her 
watching fascinated as it changes colors she carefully places the 
chameleon back on the leaf which changes color again becoming nearly 
invisible

near the empty poncho schaefer billy and ramirez are examining the 
ground and the trip wire to the flare billy stands turns to schaefer

billy
boar set off the trip flare major no other tracks

schaefer kneels and examines the thin well hidden wire he stands 
looking around the camp

ramirez
how could anyone get through this carry blain out right under our 
noses without leavin a trace

schaefer
he knows our defenses 

ramirez
why didnt he try to kill one of us last night

schaefer looks at him

schaefer
he came back for the body
pause
hes killing us one at a time 

schaefer turns and looks at billy asking with his eyes for a viable 
explanation

billy
like a hunter

schaefer stares at him the words sinking in he looks up 
reconstructing in his mind the possible events of last night his eyes 
following the tree line tracing the path of the intruder as he might 
have traveled through the trees and down to the ground

he looks up at billy

schaefer
he uses the trees

billy and ramirez stare up at the trees a wave of fear passing through 
them from the trees schaefer turns moving to where dillon is 
guarding anna sitting on the ground reaching down schaefer pulls her 
firmly to her feet looking at her intensely

schaefer
yesterday what did you see

she stares back at him

dillon
youre wastin your time

schaefer
no more games

she looks at him a long moment and then answers in english

anna
i dont know what it was it 

dillon does a double take schaefer continues to look at anna he 
wasnt surprised he knew it yesterday 

schaefer
go on

anna
it changes colors like the chameleon it uses the jungle 

dillon
derisively
shit you trying to tell me blain and hawkins were killed by a fucking 
lizard dont listen to her itss a psychjob two maybe three of 
them thats all we keep our cool outthink them til were across 
the border

ignoring him schaefer takes her hands drawing his commando knife 
looking squarely into her eyes

schaefer
whats you name

she looks back into his eyes

anna
anna

schaefer

she nods with a sudden movement he slices through her bonds

dillon
what the hell do you think youre doing

schaefer

dillon
what are you talking about well be out of here in ten minutes

schaefer

dillon
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles at most were almost home 
but the chopper wont wait

schaefer turns to face him

schaefer
dillon this thing doesnt care who we are who she is we make a 
stand or there wont be anyone left to make that chopper

dillon stares back not wanting to hear what he already knows to be 
true

anna touches schaefers arm

anna
there is something else when the big man was killed you must have 
wounded it
pause
its blood was on the leaves

she touches her pant leg the stain is faded but still there schaefer 
turns to dillon

schaefer
if it bleeds we can kill it


ext encampment  morning later

anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with binoculars watching 
the tree line mac moves past her uncoiling a trip wire linking up 
four claymore mines hidden at various points with leaves and foliage 
in a tree at the edge of the clearing billy tosses an uncoiling roll 
of wire to ramirez who attaches it to a grenade wedged it the crouch 
of a tree

wires attached to grenades and claymore mines lead off through the 
underbrush and trees leaving a long unmined corridor leading from the 
camp and into the jungle

at the corridors end where the rocks merge with the jungle schaefer 
hauls down on a heavy vine straining with every ounce of strength his 
muscles bulging while dillon takes up the slack of the vine around the 
base of a tree the vine is attached to a forty foot sapling arcing 
closer to the ground in a gigantic bow with every pull creaking and 
groaning with tension with a last mighty heave schaefer draws the 
tree almost within reach gesturing to dillon to tie it off who does

dillon
straining
im tellin you this little boy scout stunt is a godamned waste of 
time
stands
weve got to get the hell out of here now while weve still got the 
chance

ignoring him schaefer rapidly drags into position a net crudely woven 
of differing sizes of vines their leaves still attached he carefully 
begins to cover the net with leaves and debris dillon watches him in 
growing frustration as schaefer moves quickly picking up a framework 
of sticks he has tied together a treadlespring trigger he holds up 
the framework hurriedly examining his work before placing it on the 
ground

schaefer
hell be looking for the trip wires if were lucky he wont see this

dillon
now what dutch you going to send your mystery guest an invitation

schaefer turns there is a touch of fear in dillons eyes

schaefer
youre catching on dillon

schaefer returns to his work on the net and trigger


ext encampment  day later

morning passes fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle insects 
swarm and are fed upon by birds and other predators

at the entranceway to the rock outcropping the net and trigger are 
hidden beneath the leaves the framework of the trigger bulging with 
tension from the straining vine attached to the bent tree

at the other end of the corridor several meters above the jungle 
floor schaefer and his team heavily camouflaged nearly invisible 
lie hidden waiting the team members as if hypnotized by the buzzing 
din stare into the jungle fixated alert


anna

while waiting at the net

anna
hushed
when i was little we find a man 
she struggles for the words
 like a butcher the old ones in the village cross themselves and 
whisper crazy things demonio cazador de trofoes only the hottest 
times of the hottest years crazy things this year is grows hot 
and we begin finding our men we find them sometimes without their 
skin sometimes much much worse cazador de trofoes means the 
demon who takes trophies


slow rack to

 schaefers face ashen hold suddenly an eerie silence moves over 
the jungle

he whips his face forward the silence is shattered by a bird flapping 
from the brush

schaefer sits back and scratches his head frustrated and a little 
chagrined

dillon os
whatll you try next  cheese

schaefer glares at him turns to go 

he stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the waiting 
snare

behind him sighting down their wellhidden gun barrels the others 
scan the jungle alert for the slightest sound or movement covering 
him

schaefer reaches the trap carefully skirting the trigger hidden 
beneath the leaves he reaches the end of the corridor moving out into 
the jungle he moves further away from the others the silence crushing 
down on him he stops and waits sweat pouring down his face his 
finger tightening on the trigger of his m203 eyes scanning the 
jungle

he turns his back on the jungle waiting nothing he moves back 
towards the corridor reaching the net again waiting listening 
sensing nothing he turns around looking at the jungle one last time 
his face measuring defeat and then with carefully measured strides 
he walks back to the camp

schaefer looks at billy who shakes his head in puzzlement nearby 
dillon starts to rise

dillon
low whispered
satisfied now lets get the hell out 

suddenly behind schaefer at the end of the corridor with a resounding 
swish and snap the net explodes off the floor of the jungle in a hail 
of leaves and sticks rocketing upward into the treetops

schaefer spins the others leaping to their feet as they see the net as 
it tears into the treetops a large struggling bulge trapped within as 
a long unearthly trilling scream echoes through the jungle

schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards the jungle and 
the bobbing net their weapons ready anna remains behind watching 
terrified from the rocks

they arrive under the net raising their weapons to fire but before 
they can fire the entire net explodes into a flurry of leaves twigs 
vines dirt and a flash of pulsating crimson


ext hunters hand and arm  day

as the hunter leaps from the net his weapon activates his arm slashing 
out severing a thick limb of the spreading tree capony entangled in 
vines


ext the team  day

the limb crashes down from the trees schaefer dillon billy and mac 
diving for safety but ramirez following the hunters leap sees too 
late the pendular movement of the severed limb and is struck a thudding 
blow in the ribs which lifts him off his feet hurling him backwards 
like a rag doll his shirt torn open exposing a bloody wound

as anna runs to ramirezs side the others still stunned look upward 
frozen in shock seeing the hunter clinging to a side of a tree 
flushed bright crimson

dillis is dumbfounded like the others rooted to the ground staring 
upward

dillon
what is gods name

the hunter utters an unearthly snarl and hiss from his open mouth as an 
instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight a 
rapid furtive movement through the trees

mac opens fire with the m60 the others joining in shredding the 
foliage but they know the creature is gone

with a shout mac races into the jungle in pursuit of the hunter

schaefer
mac

schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the m203 slamming in a 
new one he shouts an order to billy

schaefer
to billy
get ramirez on his feet take the girl and get the hell out of here

he turns to run after mac dillon steps in front of him putting his 
hand on schaefers chest

dillon

here

schaefer

dillon

dillon stares at him

dillon

dillon turns and begins to move out

schaefer

dillon turns picking up the spare mp5 schaefer tosses the weapon to 
dillon who grabs it with one hand they share a look knowing this is 
farewell

schaefer
ill see you there

dillon
right behind you

hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after mac 
schaefer watches him leave he breaks and goes to ramirez attended by 
anna and billy who is now sitting up holding his ribs and gasping for 
breath

billy

ramirez
gasping

schaefer lifts him to his feet supporting him

schaefer

ext mac  day

creeping low to the ground his eyes searching through the trees

mac
whispered
come on you motherfucker


ext dillon  day

moving through the underbrush hears a slight rustling in the foliage 
mac he strains to locate the source of the movement

he hears a sound too faint at first it identify he listens silence 
he hears is again the sound of a voice barely audible a very quiet 
whisper

voice os
dillon over here

dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it

voice os
barely audible
dillon over here

dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth he carefully parts the 
thick leaves and vines and enters a tiny opening he looks around 
seeing nothing

dillon
whispering
mac

suddenly a hand appears and covers dillons mouth dillon gasps as mac 
pulls him down to where he is hiding

mac
whispering close
out there past the rocks can you see it

something seems to move in the direction mac is pointing

dillon
whispering
i see it
pause
were gonna take this thing

dillon points to an outcropping of rocks covered with vines

dillon
take a position over there ill work around towards you when i flush 
him you nail him 

mac
a mean look
 right i got a score to settle for the bro 

dillon
we both got scores to settle

dillon silently disappears into the jungle mac watching him go

mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping working his way between 
the rocks and the vines he takes up a position and scans the jungle 
before him


dillon

moving quietly his face intense determined he stops and listens


mac  rock outcropping

straining to hear vague sounds coming from the jungle he reaches out 
and grabs a vine and carefully pulls himself forward into a better 
position


back to scene  dillon

moving searching he goes into a crouch


mac  rock outcropping

there is movement in the undergrowth he begins to sweat he moves the 
safety to fire reaches out and grabs another vine to pull himself 
forward mac reacts in shock

the vine is alive before he can move the hunters hand appears from 
the vines grabbing mac by the wrist

in the moment before he is killed mac turns and sees the hunters 
glowing eyes

a flash as the hunters other hand moves with blinding speed macs 
face contorting in pain as the hunters razorsharp spur rips deep into 
his throat he falls forward into the leaves


dillon

he hears the faint disturbance in the leaves he pauses turning in 
macs direction listening hearing no further sound he relaxes moving 
on

 
ext narrow river gorge  day

anna in the lead followed by schaefer carrying ramirez on his back 
billy carrying the radio is covering them from above as they skitter 
and slide down the goose gravel of a rocky slope leading to a river 
crossing


ext dillon

he stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines and moss leading 
to the rock outcropping on the other side his face alert showing no 
signs of fear his weapon ready


ext vines and moss  detail  day

through the thick tangle of undergrowth there is movement a slight 
undulating distortion drifting through the hanging vegetation as if 
cast by a passing shadow


dillon

as he stops and crouches slightly listing behind him did he hear 
something he moves on


ext hunters pov  day

behind dillon and to the side of the corridor the hunter syncopates 
him movements precisely with those of dillon

dillon stops the hunter freezes in position


back to scene  dillon

he does sense something behind him he crouches and spins leveling the 
weapon the corridor behind him is empty quiet and undisturbed he 
studies the trail intently


ext hunters pov  day

peering out through the vines dillon is looking directly at him 
dillon turns moves on as the hunter resumes his stalk timing his 
movements perfectly with those of dillon


back to scene  dillon

as he approaches the rock outcropping he signals receiving no 
response he moves closer turning cautiously to right and left

dillon
whispering
mac mac

he moves closer to the rocks eyes probing through a gap in the rocks 
he sees macs face staring up at him eyes frozen wide in death

dillon spins hard he stares at the solid wall of undergrowth he looks 
from one side of the corridor to the other something it out there 
where

something in the vines has caught his attention he stares hard at a 
section of moss


ext moss  detail  day

suddenly the right combination of light and shadow prevail and dillon 
sees in an instant the hunters eyes materialize and then disappear


back to scene  dillon

with a growl and exhalation of breath charges bringing the weapon to 
bear a short burst of gunfire erupts from the barrel


ext the hunter  day 

in an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his weapon


dillon

screams his arm instantly severed halfway between his shoulder and 
elbow the weapon drops to the ground the forearm still attached 
still firing

with his left hand he fires the second weapon shouting insanely as 
swings it towards the blurred image of his unseen attacker hitting 
nothing

the hunter reloads his weapon which turns invisible again dillon 
continues to fire the hunters weapon appears from below cutting into 
dillons unprotected abdomen which as if hit by a samurai sword 
bursts open dillon cries out as the huge man hits the ground


ext log crossing  day

spanning the narrow gorge schaefer and anna with ramirez between them 
move onto the log preparing to cross they stop hearing dillons 
gunfire


ext hunters pov  day

moving through the jungle with incredible speed leaping tearing from 
tree to tree the jungle a rush of heat trails as he charges on


ext log crossing  day

the jungle is still deathly silent schaefer anna and ramirez cross 
the log moving onto the other side billy still at the foot of the 
log providing cover turns to face the jungle

he lifts his head towards the trees feeling the onrushing presence of 
the hunter he shrugs off the radio letting it fall smashing into the 
rocks below

he casts away his weapon staring forward he reaches into his cargo 
pocket withdrawing a small greasepaint tin covering his finger in 
black paint he applies dark slashes under his eyes and again 
vertically down his cheeks taking another dap of paint he makes a 
symbol on his bare skin over his heart

he drops the tin withdrawing his combat knife holding the knife he 
grasps the medicine bag around his neck yanking it free with a quick 
snap he wraps the leather thong around his hand and knife binding the 
weapon and bag together

staring outward as if in a trance he begins a low chant

on the other side schaefer carrying ramirez on his back laboring up 
the steep slope nearing the top turns and sees billy standing 
waiting at the foot of the bridge

schaefer
screaming
billy

but billy stands at the foot of the bridge knife raised waiting 
accepting his oncoming destiny

schaefer
billy

in frustration schaefer hikes ramirez higher onto his back digs in 
and sprints to the top of the hill anna waiting at the top


ext billy  day

crouches low knife extended in a fighting position


ext ridgetop  day

over the top in a low depression schaefer props ramirez against some 
rocks reaching for his weapon they hear billys echoing scream 
instantly their weapons are raised cocked and ready

schaefer
get back into the rocks

schaefer sweeps anna behind him as ramirez struggles to his feet 
together they back up covering the ridgeline over which theyve just 
come

suddenly from one side near ramirez the hunter bursts from the 
jungle ramirez seeing the hunter spins raising his weapons to 
fire 

ramirez sees the hunters onrushing face still in camouflage a 
montage of organic textures and colors his yellow eyes burning

whipping the mp5 is the direction of the hunter he is hurled backwards 
from the impact of the hunters weapon his neck gushing blood the mp
5 flying through the air landing in front of anna she moves for the 
weapon 

the hunter with unearthly speed turns towards anna as schaefer 
starts to spin seeing the hunter about to strike as anna dives for the 
weapon schaefer lunges kicking the mp5 out of annas reach

schaefer
to anna
run get to the chopper

schaefer spins and fires bullets thudding into the ground the barrel 
arcing towards the hunter as anna stumbles to her feet running into the 
jungle

in a blur the hunter spins back hurling his weapon at schaefer which 
slices through the wooden stock of the rifle sparks flying as it 
severs the trigger guard and steel breech

the m203 flies out of schaefers hands as the hunters weapon cuts 
deeply into his left shoulder laying open the flesh

the m203 hits the ground where it lies broken in half useless

schaefer hits the ground and is rolling up and running for his life 
the hunter charging after him


schaefer

crashes headlong through the jungle he leaps a fallen log stumbles 
struggles to his feet running on pure adrenalin his shoulder pulsing 
blood his eyes filled with terror

behind him he can hear the hunter in pursuit closing

schaefer spins to look behind him a wild desperate look on his face 
he turns back ducks an overhanging limb and lunges on


ext hunters pov of schaefer  day

closing rapidly another few yard


back to scene  schaefer

runs like a madman the sound of the hunters footsteps close behind 
hes losing ground he knows hes going to die

schaefer shouts suddenly the ground before him collapses and he 
disappears from sight


ext canyon wall  day

in a shower of leaves flailing arms and legs schaefer crashes through 
the trees at the canyons edge free falling into space

with a sickening impact he hits the branches of the first trees lining 
the canyon and falls a hundred feet through one canopy after another 
desperately grabbing for limbs and branched to break his fall

he hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees impacting 
crosschest on a large branch knocking his wind out

semiconscious he hangs momentarily before he slides off fingers 
digging into the bark falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving 
river


ext river  day 

weighted down by his boots and clothing schaefer struggles to stay 
afloat gasping for air he ducks underwater untying one of his boots 
he surfaces fills his lungs and dives again releasing the other boot 
he surfaces strips off his shirt and pants and begins to swim towards 
shore stroking with one arm


ext hunters pov  day

as he nears the edge of the precipice from which schaefer has fallen 
the hunter in close pursuit does not hesitate but launches himself off 
the cliff in a spectacular leap streaking downward towards the tops of 
the trees that grow out from the canyon wall

the hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree the branches and 
leaves rushing past in a kaleidoscopic blur

the hunter bounds off of one branch after another moving through the 
trees as an expert skier might negotiate a series of downhill gates

the hunter leaps free of one tree bounds across twenty feet of open 
space to a large branch of a huge tree affording a good view of the 
river below from his vantage point looking down at the windening 
slowing expanse of river schaefer is nowhere to be seen


ext schaefer  day

he is swept into a still faster current and is carried helplessly 
downstream boiling whitewater appears

out of control he is swept through a series of rapids pulling his 
further and further downstream until he is finally ducked into the 
undertow and hurled over the top of a six foot falls driven deep 
underwater by the pounding force of the water


ext pool at base of falls  day

there is no sign of schaefer precious seconds pass slowly looking 
like a drowned rat he surfaces taking a feeble breath he is nearly 
finished his energy sapped but the water is calm and a few strokes 
are enough to carry him near the shore his feet hit bottom

he tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick mud slurry at 
the river bank with his last ounce of strength he crawls panting and 
gasping into a sheltered mud overhang collapsing beside the exposed 
rootsystem of a dead tree his body completely covered in thick gray 
mud

nearly unconscious he raises his head and looks to the opposite side 
of the river scanning the bank there is no sign of the hunter he 
collapses in relief hes escaped

suddenly the hunter impacts the water throwing up a huge splash he 
stands up in the waist deep water as the water streams off of his 
body the chameleon effect rapidly changes struggling to match the 
shifting color patterns of the shimmering water

his glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where schaefer lies 
helplessly trapped

the hunter surges forward relentlessly closing in on this prey


schaefer

is frozen in terror paralyzed with fear his eyes locked on to the 
incredible creature that is about to kill him


ext hunter  day

closing rapidly another ten feet he leaves the water and walks 
through the mud stopping towering over schaefer


ext schaefers pov  day

as the hunters feet surge though the mud and stop three feet away


ext schaefer  day

realizing his life is about to end closes his eyes awaiting the 
hunters killing blow


ext hunters eyes  day

the fierce yellow orbs look downward


ext hunters pov  day

hes looking directly at schaefer except he cant see him

he can clearly see the exposed rootsystem but because of the heavy 
mud blocking schaefers body heat schaefer registers in the hunters 
vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay unrecognizable to the 
hunter as a human being

he scans the bank searching looking for heat sources detecting none 
he moves on sounding a questioning trill several times


back to scene  schaefer

disbelieving that hes still alive opens one eye seeing the hunters 
feet move away his prehensile spurs dragging in the mud he rounds a 
bend and disappears heading for the undergrowth

astonished he tries to raise up on his hands but a sudden jabbing pain 
in his shoulder causes him to collapse falling onto his side 
unconscious in the mud


ext river  day

as a huey attack helicopter breaks over the top of the ridge diving 
forward moving down the canyon the chopper flares up into a holding 
pattern

in the open doorway a soldier searches the top of the canyon with 
binoculars seeing no sign of life the chopper flies on disappearing 
down the canyon rim


back to scene  schaefer

lies unconscious in the mud the distant sound of the helicopter 
thrumping into the distance


ext anna  day

she runs into a clearing stopping momentarily gasping for breath she 
is startled by a sudden movement behind her she spins looking there 
is nothing there she runs on


ext the canyon  day dusk 

schaefer gasps as his eyes bolt open in fear as if the hunter were 
still attacking schaefer rolls to his feet and runs slogging through 
the thick mud stumbling lunging forward gasping for breath

schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow pool scuttling 
crablike into the chest deep water schaefer backs into the moss
covered wall by the waterfall looking for movement regaining his 
senses

as the water settles he looks down seeing the image of himself 
reflected in the pool his hair and face covered in thick clay he 
stares mesmerized at the image

he lifts his arm from the water his fingers wiping the mud from his 
face exposing a patch of skin he studies the mud in his hand and then 
looks at the image of himself in the water seeing the exposed skin he 
stares at it a wave of realization rushing through his mind he places 
the mud back on his face again looking at his image

schaefer
you couldnt see me

he looks up out into the failing light at the treeline of the 
deepening forest realizing that fate has given him a fighting chance 
slowly a look of vengeance and hatred crosses over his face


ext clay bank  night

using his machete he carves magnesium shavings from a fire block into a 
pile of kindling he removes a match from the hollow handle of the 
machete also containing a coil of piano wire green tape and medical 
supplies he lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white 
light schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf until the flame 
dies down he feeds the fire with more kindling fanning it with a 
leaf


schaefer  bow and arrow montage  night later 

holding a three foot section of firehardened sapling between his feet 
and shoulder he scrapes the char from the seasoned wood with his 
machete

he bends the bow and attaches a long piece of piano wire to one end 
carefully wrapping it for strength using strips of green tape to cover 
the sides of the wire where the nock of the arrow will fit

he attaches split quilled feathers with fishing line to an arrow its 
tip fashioned into a series of barbs rubbing them to a polished 
hardness against a smooth stone when finished he places the arrow on 
the ground next to three other identical arrows

schaefer
one chance thats all


ext clay bank  night 

schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones he pauses to 
drool saliva into the pulpy mass he scrapes the milky substance onto a 
banana leaf mixing it with a sticky sap holding it over the coals 
until the mixture steams

schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison holding them over 
the coals until the sap bubbles and smokes he spins the arrows in his 
hands blowing on the tips to cool and harden the mixture

using the tip of his machete he pries open the casing of one of the 
40mm grenades discarding the warhead he dumps the propellant powder 
from the shell onto a leaf mixing that with a mound of magnesium 
shavings

he opens the narrow tight roll of gauze taken from the first aid kit 
of the machete handle fluffing it into a large loose bundle the size 
of a baseball he pours the powdermixture into the gauze mixing it 
into the fabric

he transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a pliable dry leaf 
closing it into a bundle binding it at the top with a long strand of 
junglegrass

he twists the remaining gauze around a match leaving the head exposed 
forming a selfstriking fuse

he coats the fuse with sap and then thickly covers it with more powder 
from the 40mm grenade he pokes the fuse down into the leaf taking a 
long strand of jungle grass he makes a large loop tying it onto the 
grenade slipping the loop and grenade over his head

finally using several sections of bamboo of differing diameters he 
fashions a crude antipersonnel spearbomb a bangstick like weapon 
using the sharpened tongue from his belt buckle for a firing pin and a 
40mm grenade from his belt pouch as an explosive charge


ext rivers edge  night

schaefer appears he has covered him entire body with a variety of 
clays and ochers creating a mottled earthen camouflage pattern

holding his weapons in one hand he moves up the canyon ascending into 
a rising boulder field


ext boulder field  night

where the river flows into a series of falls and pools surrounded by 
massive boulders and table top rocks their crevices jammed with large 
amounts of driftwood swept down at high water from the forests above

on a flattened section of rock schaefer drags a large section of 
branches into view adding it to a growing mound of firewood he 
kneels tending to a pile of dries grass leaves and other tinder 
using the last of his precious matches he sets fire to the tinder 
gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consuming fire flames 
starting to lick upward through the dry wood

he stands staring into the rapidly growing blaze he turns facing the 
canyon rim raising his weapons in one hand from the depths of his 
soul a sound emerges primitive and visceral as if from an animal in 
pain

he throws back his head and shouts


ext canyon rim  night

a hundred feet below schaefer stands in the boulder field his mud 
coated body bathed in red firelight looking like a fierce primitive 
warrior a timeless prehistoric sight his long and wailing cry 
echoing endlessly through the canyon


ext hunters ship  night

backlit by the light of the open door the hunters head in three
quarter profile his eyes gleaming rears into view looking up at the 
sky hearing schaefers cry

responding with a low hiss he turns back raising in one hand his 
weapon in the other a ushaped sharpening device as he passes the 
weapon through the device it flashes into life a deep harmonic hum 
emitted as the blade grows with energy growing hotter hotter and 
hotter with each stroke he draws the blade now whitehot through the 
device for the last stroke he lifts it testing its balance the 
whitehot blade illuminating his alien face


ext hunters pov  jungle  night

emerging from his camp the hunter swings into the nearby tree line 
moving to the uppermost branches the hunter travels silently from tree 
to tree arriving at the canyon rim where far below he sees in the 
canyon the bonfire a leaping shifting multicolored collage of heat 
waves and flares luring him onward


schaefer

hidden back within the deep notch of several large logs and broken 
trees in the river canyon below him on the rock plateau is the 
bonfire illuminating in shifting patterns of light the awaiting arena 
of destiny

his eyes shift trancelike moving from side to side watching the 
approaches to the fire below his senses are alert his nerves on a 
wire edge


ext hunter  night

his shadowform descending through the canyon a rippling movement of 
grays and blacks passing through the shifting light patterns on the 
rocks cast by the growing bonfire below


ext hunters pov  night

his eyes probe the canyon drawn to the swirling patterns of heat given 
off by the gaseous combustion of the bonfire


ext hunter  night

continues on moving silently down through the canyon


schaefer

sits motionless nearly invisible in his mud camouflage amid the 
darkness of the logs

suddenly over the crackling of the fire the buzzing clicking of 
insects and the croaking of frogs suddenly ceases

slowly painfully he draws the bow to full arch his wounded shoulder 
trembling the blood beginning to seep through the bandage

the bow straining at full draw schaefer stares intently 
concentrating searching for the hunters form in the dancing light 
below


ext the hunter  night

like a giant insect drops from above fifteen feet above schaefer his 
steellike spurs digging deep into the log


ext schaefer  night

he freezes at the sound of the hunter dropping his eyes wide with 
fear the slightest movement will bring an instant attack from the 
hunter behind him but to wait his back exposed


ext the hunter  night

jumps from the log above and to schaefers left onto a boulder 
gaining a better vantage point of the arena and fire below he raises 
his weapon his eyes glistening in the dim light searching a quiet 
hiss emerges from his mouth


ext schaefer  night

spins and fires at the movement of the hunter


ext arrow  night

flies into the night lodging into a branch of an exposed tree just 
missing the hunters head

in a blur the hunters arm streaks downward a dull flash of light 
leaving his fingers as he fires the weapon the projectile streaking 
downward exploding into the log inches from schaefer sending a 
shower of wood chips and bark flying in every direction


schaefer

in a flash is up and running clutching his weapons leaping from 
boulder to boulder he jumps down into the lighted area below landing 
hard rolling into the protective shadows of the rocks putting the 
loping fire between he and the hunters position on the rocks above

he moves forward darting to look backwards before leaping off the lip 
of the table rock into the boulder field below a flat plane littered 
by weirdly shaped watererroded rocks forming a giant stone 
ampitheater shadows leap and dance across the boulders cast by the 
bonfire from the plateau above

schaefer crouches between two large boulders quietly breathing through 
clenched teeth feeling the pain of his now freely bleeding shoulder 
wound


ext hunter  night

a nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the rim of the 
plateau above


ext schaefer  night

over the sounds of the fire and the softly flowing river distinguishes 
a new sound one that brings fear and a savage determination to his 
heart the rhythmical clickscrape clickscrape of the hunters feet 
moving over the rocks somewhere above him

drawing back on the bow schaefer moves around the boulder to his left 
heading towards the sound of the hunter


int hunter somewhere in the boulders  night

revealed in flashes of strobing light pauses at the juncture of 
several towering rocks

he stands erect tilting his head slowly turning it from side to 
side his ears trying to orientate to the diversity of sounds 
reflecting off the circular walls enclosing the boulder field


int hunters pov  night

his vision accustomed to another spectrum has little available heat 
to register vivid images of the inert lifeless forms of the stones he 
sees instead a world of soft illdefined shapes in a pale magenta 
field of flickering heat


int schaefer  night 

creeping forward carefully placing one foot in front of the other 
suddenly stops hearing the clickscrape clickscrape now on his 
right

starting to move in this new direction he stops again hearing the 
sound now directly across from him listening he hears the sound again 
from yet another direction the sound echoing in the natural 
amphitheater of rock

schaefer uncertain of where to turn waits suddenly he crouches and 
freezes hearing the unbelievable sound of a human voice softly 
echoing through the amphitheater

annas voice os
filtered in spanish
look out behind you

schaefer spins his breath catching at the sound of annas voice wide
eyed straining he waits hearing only the muted flowing of water the 
hissing and popping of the dying fire above the shadows growing 
longer darker with each minute

and then again annas voice

annas voice os
in spanish
 look out behind you

schaefer
to himself
anna

trancelike he moves towards the sound


the hunter

his head canted throat distended utters another mimicry


schaefer

moving towards the space between two boulders from which the voice 
seems to emanate

schaefer
louder
anna


the hunter

his ears now directed towards the sound of schaefers voice his slowly 
approaching footsteps raises his weapon


schaefer

pauses before the opening of the passageway all is silent he 
hesitates to enter listening he starts to move and then hears a new 
voice

hunter os
macs voice
dillon over here 

schaefer horrified at the sound of the dead mans voice backs quickly 
into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the 
amphitheater


int hunter  somewhere in the boulders  night

his feet moving quietly over the rock the shadowlight deepening with 
the dying fire above closing in


ext schaefer  night

bow drawn trapped against the rock hearing the sound of the hunter 
approaching from the left now the right is helpless not knowing 
where to fire the hunters deadly strike only an instant away

still holding the bangstick in his bow hand he carefully releases the 
draw on the string reaching to his neck for the flashgrenade with 
painstaking care he removes the grenade from his neck

focusing on the rocks before him and the still approaching sound he 
reaches down with the grenade gripping with his fingertips the 
matchhead fuse placing it against the rocks at his side

with a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws the grenade 
snatching up the bangstick with his good hand

the matchhead sputters as the grenade flies through the air an instant 
later a blinding white flash of light illuminates the amphitheater 

in that instant schaefer sees above him and to his left the hunter 
poised on top of a rock his weapon raised about to strike 
momentarily blinded by the flash of light the hunters head recoils to 
the side

darkness swallows the image of the hunter but in that second schaefer 
seizes his advantage hurling the bangstick spear


int the spear  night

it smashes into the boulder at the hunters feet the hunter leaps as 
the grenade detonates shrapnel tearing into his body

with a terrifying scream of pain and anger the hunter clutches 
frantically at the wounds in his neck and chest another bloodcurdling 
scream of rage and the hunter is gone


int waterfall  night

cascades over the rocks fed by a small stream running through the 
ravine a pile of boulders breaks the falls filling the area with an 
ever constant mist

schaefer appears holding the bow and arrow following the luminous 
blood trail of the hunter over the rock

moving behind the falls schaefers body is briefly soaked by the 
water the hardened and camouflage beginning to dissolve running off 
his body he continues on slowly cautiously following the blood 
trail


int table top boulder  night 

next to the flowing stream surrounded by an open area of rock

schaefer smeared with blood and sweat his clay and ochre camouflage 
partially washed away climbs up a log onto the boulder oblivious to 
the searing pain in his shoulder he breathes in hot powerful 
exchanges his eyes wide and glowing with vengeance

schaefer
bleed you bastard

his bow down schaefer follows the blood trail across the rock edging 
alongside a huge vertical boulder the blood trail stops

he takes another step forward past a darkened alcove 

schaefer spins seeing in the alcove the surprised hunter whirl and 
spring towards him 

schaefer in a bound closes the distance savagely kicking the hunters 
arm the weapon flies from the hunters hand clattering to the rock

before he can recover schaefer follows with a karate kick to the 
chest hurling the hunter to the ground his back exposed

in a flash schaefer is standing over the hunter the bow drawn 
poised the blood from his open wound dripping onto the hunters back

the hunter slowly rolls onto his back revealing his face his eyes 
bleached white in shock from the loss of blood the hunters body 
rippled out of control trying desperately to orientate itself to the 
environment

schaefer
incredulous
who the hell are you


ext hunters pov of schaefer  night

schaefers body looms over him mottled and streaked from his exposed 
skin blood oozing from the shoulder wound his eyes like black sockets 
in his almost skulllike face seen from this perspective schaefer is 
a frightening horrible visage


the hunter

shudders gasping hungrily for air struggling to speak from his 
throat schaefer hears the feeble distorted efforts of the hunter at 
first garbled incomprehensible and then slowly chillingly taking on 
the timbre and quality of his own voice

hunter
electronic filtered
who 
improving
 the hell 
nearly perfect
 are 
perfect
 you

the hunters strength seems to fade even more 

then suddenly with the last of his diminishing strength he lashes 
out with one arm activating the lethal razor sharp spurs on his 
wrists

the hunters coiled leg kicks upward with incredible force his 
terrible spur ripping into schaefers thigh hurling schaefer into the 
air flipping him over sending him crashing to his back into the 
shallow pool of water momentarily losing his bow he flounders 
desperately in the water searching for the bow he finds it just as 

the hunter rises slowly to his feet gasping desperately for breath he 
inhales deeply hungrily gaining strength with each breath

schaefer looks from the pool to see the hunter raising his weapon to 
throw

in one totally instinctual movement schaefer draws back on the arrow 
to its very tip and fires

the arrow with a deadly thud penetrates deeply into the hunters 
neck another bloodcurdling scream of rage as the hunter clutches his 
throat dropping his weapon an instant later and the hunter is gone


ext log bridge  night predawn 

emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the canyon schaefer 
holding the hunters weapon pauses several times finding more traces 
of the hunters blood the deep wound in his thigh flowing heavily he 
continues across the log and climbs the bank following the traces into 
the jungle

 
ext jungle  predawn 

moving along the rim of the coulee schaefer follows the thick orange 
blobs hanging on leaves and spent on the forest floor

too weak to move through the trees the hunter has left a swath of 
trampled grasses broken twigs and branches in his headlong retreat 
from schaefer the hunter turned hunted


ext two attack helicopters  day predawn

powering upward from the canyon the waterfall in the background clear 
the rim racing along at treetop height heading towards the island 
promontory


ext hunters pov  camp  predawn

staggering into the clearing bleeding severely the hunter is rapidly 
losing his camouflage ability his skin turning a pale green flexing 
and pulsing in shock the glow of light from the energy field 
reflecting off the spreading apron of blood flowing from his wound

with trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks it pulling the 
shaft from his neck he screams in pain


ext glen  predawn

schaefer follows the blood trail deeper into the incredibly dense 
vegetation ripping aside the heavy growth plunging onward

before him covering a narrow passageway is a huge spider web 
intricate four feet across schaefer starts to sweep aside the web 
with a sharp intake of breath he halts inches from the wed something 
is wrong

examining the web closer he sees not silken threads but a hard and 
shiny network of hairfine wire a trap

he backs up picking up a hefty branch from the ground he swings the 
branch with a mighty heave clenching his teeth in pain the branch 
sails end over end into the web impacting the strands a metallic snap 
is heard a highpitches whine and the log is violently severed the 
pieces flying in opposite directions with great speed

schaefer runs on again picking up the blood traces of the fleeing 
hunter


ext hunters camp

at the edge of the site he sees the hunter staggering through the 
foliage

schaefer starts after him but then stops dumbfounded by the incredible 
images that crash in on him translucent human skins stretched over 
frames the hair of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind 
skinned bodies some lying on the ground others hung from the trees 
like hopper and his men were

he turns back seeing the hunter as he passes through the shimmering 
distortion of a forcefield enveloping the forest within the force 
field he sees the vague nearly transparent outline of the hunters 
ship

he approaches it wideeyed his senses reeling with astonishment and 
rage

from within the force field a passage way of blue light appears the 
hunters form backlit as he ascends the ramp to his spacecraft


the hunter

as he passes his hand through a light beam the ship instantly 
responds as a low turbinelike howl is heard building slowly in 
volume and pitch


schaefer

in his weakened condition staggers forward looking up seeing the 
passage way of light diminish as the door begins to close

as rising heat waves begin to envelope the ship the hunter stares out 
at schaefer the heat waves increasing as the keening whine of the 
ships drive builds he enters the force field the door now inches 
from closing

on the ground nearly obscured by the grass and leaves schaefer sees 
the hunters weapon lying where he dropped it in his desperate flight 
to escape

schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it how the hell does it 
work he squeezes the handle of the weapon feeling it resist 
nothing happens

with the last ounce of his strength and with a bellow of rage his arm 
muscles bulging he crushes down on the handle 

in a flash of bluewhite light the weapon becomes activated

schaefer raises the weapon sensing its power and function

in the final seconds before the door closes schaefer with a 
triumphant scream fires the weapon 

the weapon flaring with deadly energy drops and turns sideways 
accelerating through the door and into the spacecraft


int spacecraft  day 

the weapon impacts the hunter his head exploding in a fountain of 
orange blood and pale green tissue

the weapon continues on burying itself into the energy field bolts of 
plasmaenergy begin arcing from the force field

schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees staring at the 
hunters ship the sound of the hyperdrive continues to increase as 
the ship begins to tremble


ext helicopter cockpit  day

as suddenly the instrument panel goes wild gauges spinning digital 
readouts racing out of control the sound of the turbine faltering 
changing pitch the pilot lurches forward with the stick fighting for 
control


ext hunters camp  day

the multi harmonic whine of the hunters ship is still building as the 
ground begins to shake

schaefer realizing that the ship is going to explode and ignoring the 
pain of his shoulder and leg runs desperately searching for cover he 
sprints for the edge of the clearing diving over the embankment just 
as

a blinding purple flash blows the ship to pieces


ext helicopter  cockpit  day

enveloped in the flash of intense light cries of surprise fill the 
ship as the shockwave hits the chopper heeling it hard over to one 
side

below the concentric waves of energy race outward from the center of 
the blast an unearthly sight like the miniature birth of a star

the helicopter suddenly regains control its power restored

the helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking devastated site 
of the blast

the jungle has been completely transformed no longer lush and verdant 
the area is clearcut two feet above the ground covered in fine 
white smoldering ash amongst the shattered stumps debris from the 
ship bright as magnesium flares burns with exotic colors

if the foreground schaefer a living deadman streaked with the alien 
ash rises up from a shallow depression staring dumbstruck at the 
site

breaking in low over the treetops the helicopters flare up into 
position one preparing to land

as the chopper descends the crew standing in the door way stare 
transfixed at the devastation their eyes trying to penetrate the dense 
white smoke

as the helicopter slowly descends its propwash creating a raging 
storm schaefer materializes from the swirling smoke and ash his 
features taking form as he approaches his naked body covered in mud 
blood and ash


ext schaefers pov  landing helicopter  day 

as the chopper emerging from the vortex settles towards the ground 
where the spacecraft once stood through the distorted veil the 
helicopter bristling with  visored and helmeted men now covered 
with white ash looks like a landing spacecraft


ext helicopter  day 

the door gunner swings the m60 into firing position pointing it at 
schaefer he racks the bolt loading a round

the crewmen look tense frightened

anna standing next to the door gunner stares at the strange creature 
before her narrowing her eyes uncertain is there something familiar 
about the figure


schaefer

stands in the clearing staring at the helicopter and the array of 
weapons pointed at him he looks dazed like a man making contact with 
members of an alien race for the first time


the helicopter

hovers low to the ground the tension inside building as schaefer 
approaches

more weapons swing into position fingers tighten on triggers suddenly 
anna recognizes the figure realizing the danger she holds up her 
hands shouting

anna
noooooo


ext helicopters  jungle  day

flash overhead heading across the trackless jungle their rotors 
thumping like heavy machine gun fire


int helicopter  day 

schaefer a blanket over his shoulders still in the remains of his mud 
camouflage his body laced with deep cuts his chest and shoulder caked 
with dried blood is seated on a bench in the cargo hold

near the cockpit are general philips an army medic two machine 
gunners they look at schaefer in awe

the medic holding an open field kit a syringe and bandages turns to 
philips

medic
shaking his head
looks like hes been through hell cant believe hes still alive 
what the hell went on down there

philips
if it hadnt been for her hed be dead now that story she told us 
i still cant believe it

he looks at anna her eyes meeting his as if asking for an 
explanation she looks at him a moment before turning back to schaefer 
staring at him as if he were risen from the dead

she looks into schaefers face schaefer returning her look 
recognition passing between them anna extends her hand schaefer 
slowly reaches out touching her fingers then clasping her hand

schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door beyond the passing 
jungle below out to the heavens he turns back looking at anna a 
faint smile crossing his face they made it


ext two helicopters  jungle  day

pull away and head towards the distant green horizon

fade out
