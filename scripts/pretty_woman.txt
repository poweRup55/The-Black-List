	edward enters and looks around the lobby  no vivian  annoyed
	edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up  hes about
	to dial when

	edward looks at him blankly

			    mr thomas
		barnard thomas manager of the

	edwards eyes narrow  he hangs up the phone

			    edward
		i think we both know shes not

	mr thomas looks uncomfortable

			    edward contd

			    mr thomas
		mr harris a guest of yours is
		a guest of ours and shall be
		treated accordingly  the young
		lady asked me to tell you that

		lounge

			    edward
		thank you

	he starts towards the lounge

			    mr thomas
		very intriguing young woman miss
		vivian

	his tone stops edward in his tracks

			    mr thomas contd
		have a good evening sir

	and off he goes leaving edward to wonder what the hell
	transpired during the afternoon

	int hotel lounge  night

	edward enters the lounge  he looks around not seeing vivian
	and suddenly his eyes go back to the beautiful girl with the
	beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress
	at the piano bar  edward tries to hide his surprise as vivian
	rises moves elegantly towards him  she smiles

			    vivian
		youre late

	such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so without
	thinking

			    edward
		im sorry

			    vivian
		youre forgiven

	she waits expectantly  he holds out an arm  she takes it

	int rex restaurant  night

	vivian comes out of the ladies room  she walks forward past
	the maitreds station  she stops  she takes a breath and
	then walks forward

	int rex  another angle  looking down

	vivian moves down a marble starircase through the elegant
	restaurant toward a far table  her beauty and natural grace
	draw approving stares  she is like a queen moving through a
	ballroom

	at a secluded table edward sits in conversation with two men
	james kross in his early 70s a bulky selfmade millionaire
	industrialist  sitting next to him is his son and second in
	command david kross a handsome man in his early thirties
	all of them rise as vivian comes to the table  david kross
	holds out vivians chair for her  surprised she nods her
	thanks  in front of her is an enormous placesetting  she
	smiles down at the utensils filled with confidence

	waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of
	them  vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork  but then she
	sees that kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and
	is digging into his salad with that

	vivian looks to see what edward will do  he doesnt seem
	interested in eating yet  neither does david kross  feeling
	a sudden panic vivian puts her fork down

			    kross
		so young man i understand you
		are trying to take over my
		company

	a moment  the abruptness of the question takes edward back for
	a moment  but then he almost smiles

			    edward
		please dont patronize me mr
		kross  our ages mean nothing
		here

	kross and david look at each other

			    david
		mr harris we know youve
		purchased at least twenty percent
		of our stock  we also know you
		plan to file a formal bid for a
		majority share

			    edward
		twentyfive percent

			    kross
		mr harris i built kross
		enterprises myself  i know every
		man who ever worked there by his
		first name  i know their wives
		and their children  if your
		intention is to take over my
		company and turn it into a
		glorified real estate deal think
		again

	edward thankfully now reaches for his salad fork and begins
	to eat  relieved vivian picks up hers  they all eat for a
	moment

			    edward
		what do you suggest mr kross

	waiters approach some to clear the salad plates some to put
	down the next course  vivian thinking shes got to finish
	quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad  she is
	reluctant to let the waiter take her fork

			    kross
		what would it take to buy our
		stock back  name your price

			    edward
		to get me in a mood to sell 
		double what i paid  but your
		company doesnt have enough
		capital right now to buy anything

			    david
		were on the verge of closing
		a large navy contract  double
		is ridiculous but we can assure
		you a healthy profit on your
		shares  we would give you a
		promissory note

			    edward
		youre not getting any navy
		contracts

	vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this
	news

			    david
		theres no way you could know
		that

			    edward
		but i do know  i also know your
		lines of credit are overextended
		if i dont buy your company
		someone else will
			looking up
		ah the escargot

	escargot are put down in front of everyone  vivian stares at
	them dubiously  she picks up what she assumes is the next
	right fork  she picks up a snail  the two do not fit
	flustered she doesnt know what to do  no one else seems to
	be eating  and now a waiter comes and places escargot forks
	at each place  vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief

			    vivian
			softly to the waiter
		scume me what are these things

			    waiter
			bending to whisper
		escargot mademoiselle

			    edward
			leaning close to
			 whisper
		snails

	vivian stares at them horrified  she like james and david
	kross no longer seem interested in eating  edward eats with
	pleasure

			    edward
		mr kross im not here to sell
		you my stock  on the contrary
		im here to buy yours

			    kross
			angry
		youve got a lot of nerve

			    edward
		no  what i have is a lot of
		money

			    kross
		i know all about you mr harris
		when you buy companies they have
		a way of disappearing  even the
		pension funds are stripped clean
		the last three companies you took
		over were cut up in so many
		pieces widows were left without
		their retirement checks

			    edward
			calmly
		what i did with those companies
		was perfectly legal

			    kross
		i dont question the legality
		of what you do  its your
		morality that makes me sick  i
		will not allow my company to be
		raped by a man like you

			    edward
			angry now
		it isnotyour company  its a
		public company  and iamgoing
		to acquire it  either i buy from
		the other stock holders or i buy
		from you

	vivian struggles with her escargot

			    edward contd
		i would suggest that you and your
		board cooperate with me rather
		than fight a battle you dont have
		the ammunition to win

	vivian suddenly zings her snail across the table  everyone
	looks to her

			    vivian
		slippery little suckers

	kross rises

			    kross
		if youll excuse me young lady
		mr harris
			turns to david
		deal with this david you know
		where we stand  i need to go
		someplace and puke

	he rises  he exits

			    david
			to edward and vivian
		men like my father built this
		country  he was no saint  he
		screwed people  but for every
		guy he stepped on he gave a 
		hundred a good job

	edward is silent

			    vivian
		he seems like a nice man

	david looks at vivian as if seeing her for the first time

			    edward
		we can reach an understanding on
		this

			    david
		i dont think so  you should
		know were going to fight you with
		every resource we have

			    edward
		do what you have to do  i dont
		take it personally

			    david
		i do  i take it all very
		personally
			to vivian
		very nice meeting you vivian

	david kross gets up and leaves  vivian and edward sit in
	silence

			    edward
			a beat
		and thats the way the game is
		played

			    vivian
		some game  screwin some poor
		slob out of his retirement

	edward says nothing  but vivian can see shes hit a nerve

			    vivian
		snails for dinner  no wonder
		everybody is in such a bad mood

	a waiter appears at the table

			    waiter
		are we ready for the next course
		sir

			    edward
		no  bring a check please

	int penthouse living room  night

	edwards face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of 
	the glass window down at the city lights  he quickly drains 
	his champagne glass  vivian moves to stand next to him  
	she refills his glass from the bottle

			    edward
		thank you

	he drinks  silence

			    vivian
		youre upset huh

			    edward
		upset  no  i never get upset
		about business

			    vivian
		you liked the guy though

			    edward
		whether i liked him or not is
		irrelevant  its business
		theres no emotion involved in
		business if you want to
		survive

			    vivian
			excited
		were the exactly the same  kit
		keeps telling me dont get
		emotional when you turn tricks
		 thats why no kissing  its
		too personal
		the key is like youre saying
		stay numb dont get involved 
		when im with a guy im a robot
		i just do it
			realizing what shes
			 saying and quickly
			 recovers
		except with you  at your price
		i give my all

	edward laughs

			    vivian contd
		lets not talks about this heavy
		stuff  come on relax

	vivian comes up behind him  she begins to rub his shoulders

			    edward
		that is very good

	a moment  edward is silent  turns him unknots his tie
	unbuttons his collar

	another for a moment  he releases her  she smiles  she 
	starts to undress him

	int penthouse bedroom  morning

	vivian is asleep  she turns over slowly waking  her hand 
	goes out to touch edward and encounters nothing but empty bed
	vivian comes awake with a sudden start  she look around
	momentarily frightened not sure where she is  sighing with
	relief she lies back down  she sees edwards american express
	card on the pillow next to her

			    edward os
		wake up vivian  time to shop

	edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed
	he is tying his tie  vivian sits up and ties it for him  he
	smiles at her

	the music ebbs and swells  the sets and costumes change  the
	story continues

	edward again leans close to vivian

			    edward
		and now she asks rudolpho if he
		still thinks her beautiful 

	vivian raises a hand and gently covers edwards mouth  her eyes
	are fixed on the stage  she doesnt need his help

	the emotions building inside vivian swell as the music is
	reaching its tragic climax  her lips tremble  her eyes fill
	with tears  edward glances at her  he studies her a long
	moment watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face
	strangely moved he takes vivians hand

	as the opera ends they are both swept away by it

	int sf opera house box  night

	as the lights come up vivian wipes off her tearruined
	mascara  she sighs happy  the women in the next box smile
	at her

			    older woman
		did you enjoy the opera dear

			    vivian
			tearfully
		it was so beautiful i just about
		pissed my pants

	edward smiles at the now shocked looking older woman and he
	and the still misty vivian exit

	int corporate jet  night  later

	edward and vivian sit side by side

			    edward

	vivian looks at him a moment  and then leaning slowly forward
	she kisses him gently on the mouth  he looks at her surprise
	he puts his arms around her and kisses her back  it is the
	first time theyve kissed and they make it very special

	ext corporate jet  night

	the plane flies in the night  back to la

	int regent beverly wilshire penthouse bedroom  night

	it marveling at the fingers the tiny hairs on the back  she
	gently kisses the palm

	she clutches edwards hand tightly to her breast  she closes
	her eyes ready to sleep now

	int penthouse bedroom  angle on edward  night

	his eyes open  vivians whispered endearment has filled with

	int penthouse bedroom  morning

	vivian is still asleep  she is face down on the bed the
	sheets just covering her to her waist  edward stares down at
	her  he gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line
	of her spine  vivian murmurs contentedly

	int penthouse bedroom  day

	vivian is wearing her yellow dress  she stares at herself in

	edward comes out of the bathroom  he crosses to the closet
	for a tie

			    vivian

	she comes over starts to tie his tie for him  he is very
	aware of the closeness of her  she smiles at him  he smiles
	puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment  looking up
	she sees that he is serious now no more jokes  he releases
	her hand

			    edward

			 his tie
		when i was a little girl my
		mother locked me in the attic when
		i was bad which was pretty often
		id stare out the window up there
		and make believe i was a princess
		trapped in the tower by the wicked
		queen  then suddenly a knight
		on a white horse with his bright
		colors flying would ride up
		rescue me from the tower and then
		wed ride off but never ever
		in all the times i had that dream

	the doorbell suddenly rings in the living room

	int penthouse living room  day

	edward enters the living room  vivian slowly enters behind 
	him  edward opens the front door  mr kross slowly enters
	he looks very old and tired so much so that edward has to mask
	his surprise

			    kross
		mr harris

			    edward
		how are you mr kross

			    kross
		not bad for a man who hasnt

	an angry reluctant looking david kross is behind his father
	stuckey brings up the rear  edward and david give one another
	perfunctory nod  stuckey smugly winks at edward  edward closes
	the door and leads them all down the stairs

	vivian is very troubled at krosss appearance  he gently nods
	at vivian

			    kross

	stuckey glances triumphantly at edward  he is surprised to
	see that there doesnt seem to be any victory in edwards face
	edward is silent  kross interprets his silence as second
	thoughts

			    kross
		ill see you on one condition

	vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man

	nods

	vivian nods  her face is filled with confusion

	int brokerage house  conference room  day

	edward stands at the window looking out  there is something
	about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look weve just
	seen on vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of
	the story

	jake enters a pile of papers under his arm  he begins laying
	them out on the conference table

			    jake
		congratulations sir

			    edward

	edward says nothing

	he turns as stuckey james and david kross and vance enter
	the room  they surround a conference table  kross sits the
	papers laid out in front of him  stuckey hands kross a pen
	a secretary lays out finger food  they wait for her to leave
	before they speak

			    stuckey
		if we can get these letters of
		intent out of the way now mr
		harris and i would like to ask
		you some questions about your
		company

			    david
		dad excuse me but thats
		inappropriate  youre under no
		obligation to answer any questions
		at all

			    kross
		could we at least wait till after
		the filing period

	stuckey glances to edward for help  edward is silent indeed
	its as if something is twisting inside of him  stuckey plunges
	ahead

			    stuckey
		mr harris is preparing a bid
		based on our speculation of the
		corporations net worth  the
		price he ultimately pays for your
		fathers stock will be based on
		that bid  the more we know the
		higher our bid can be

			    kross
		its in my best interest to
		cooperate david

			    david
		if he throws himself on your
		sword you promise to take care
		of him and his family huh

	david stares at him

			    stuckey
		thats unfair

			    david
		you bed it is
			to edward
		youre everything he said you
		were
			to his father
		do what you have to do dad
		just dont expect me to watch it

	he exits  a moment  kross looks at edward with a resigned
	smile

			    kross
		hes young  he hasnt learned
		how to lose gracefully yet  ill
		sign your papers  and ill answer
		your questions  whatever you
		want

	he sighs  he picks up the pen  hes about to sign

			    edward
		stop  for just a moment
			a moment
		mr kross id like to ask you
		a few questionsbeforeyou sign
		you realize that youre a target
		if you werent mine youd be
		someone elses correct

			    kross
		yes

			    edward
		if you had a reprieve what
		would do

			    stuckey
			quickly
		i dont think theres any sense
		in 

			    edward
		let him answer

			    kross
		i i would take advantage of
		it

			    edward
		how

	kross looks uncertain  he gropes for an answer

			    kross
		i i dont know  there
		there wasnt time

			    edward
		i suppose youd find out soon
		enough that you have assets you
		presently dont seem aware of
		wouldnt you  the waste
		processing licenses at that
		abandoned shipyard of yours youd
		certainly find out about that

	surprise suddenly flares in stuckeys eyes

			    stuckey
		oh my god edward no

			    edward
		i suppose youd use them as
		collateral on new loans wouldnt
		you

			    stuckey
		have you lost your mind

			    kross
			to stuckey
		quiet
			to edward
		would i get the loans

			    edward
		this time i imagine you would
		yes
			as if thinking about
			 it
		hmm
			a moment
		with all this in mind mr kross
		i cant logically make a formal
		bid on your company can i

			    kross
			a small smile
		youd be initiating a financial
		battle youd ultimately lose mr
		harris

			    edward
		youre very right  i think the
		best thing we could all do is go
		home

			    stuckey
		what

			    edward
		have a good day gentlemen

	goes to the door opens it and exits closing it behind her
	silence  vivian suddenly comes back in  she puts down her
	bags  she crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee
	canpiggy bank from the shelf  she puts some more bills into
	it places it back where kit will find it

	boheme  faint  seemingly coming from nowhere  she dismisses
	it  shes hearing things  she opens the door  stops  the
	music is louder and getting louder now  its not her
	imagination  she hurries over to the window

	vivian comes out onto the fire escape  she stares in wonder

	a snow white limo comes up the street  a necktie has been tied
	to the antennae like a knights token  the music from la boheme
	is blaring from the cars stereo  edward is standing on the
	cars seat his head and body up through the open sunroof  the
	wind blows at his hair  he is smiling

	everywhere on the street people are staring the bums the
	pushers the passerbys the tourists

	vivian doesnt know whether to laugh or cry

	the car comes to a stop in front of the vivians building
	vivians landlord comes out the front door  his eyes go wide 
	in disbelief

	edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the
	sunroof  he leaps nimbly to the ground  he crosses to the entrance 
	of the alleyway looking up at vivian on the fire escape

			    vivian
		you are really lost this time

	edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her

	with a sudden cry of joy vivian comes down the fire escape
	she stops at the bottom stair  edward comes forward and sweeps
	her into his arms  they kiss

	he carries her to the limo as if shes weightless  her feet
	never touch the ground

	the car door closes behind them  the limo drives away

	the people of the street watch it go
