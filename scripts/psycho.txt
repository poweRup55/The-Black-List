               fade in

               ext phoenix arizona  day  helicopter shot

               above midtown section of the city it is early afternoon a 
               hot midsummer day the city is sunsunblanched white and 
               its driftedup noises are muted in blanched their own echoes 
               we fly low heading in a downtown direction passing over 
               trafficclogged streets parking lots white business 
               buildings neatly patterned residential districts as we 
               approach downtown section the character of the city begins 
               to change it is darker and shabby with age and industry we 
               see railroad tracks smokestacks wholesale fruitand
               vegetable markets old municipal buildings empty lots  
               vegetable the very geography seems to give us a climate of 
               nefariousness of backdoorness dark and shadowy and secret

               we fly lower and faster now as if seeking out a specific 
               location a skinny high old hotel comes into view on its 
               exposed brick side great painted letters advertise transients
               low weekly ratesradio in every room we pause long enough 
               to establish the shoddy character of this hotel its open 
               curtainless windows its silent resigned look so 
               characteristic of such holeandcorner hotels we move forward 
               with purposefulness andtoward a certain window the sash is 
               raised as high as it can go but the shade is pulled down to 
               three or four inches of the inside sill as if the occupants 
               of the room within wanted privacy but needed air we are 
               close now so that only the lower half of the window frame 
               is in shot no sounds come from within the room

               suddenly we tip downward go to the narrow space between 
               shade and sill peep into the room

               a young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed she wears 
               a full slip stockings no shoes she lies in and attitude 
               of physical relaxation but her face seen in the dimness of 
               the room betrays a certain innertension worrisome 
               conflicts she is mary crane an tension attractive girl 
               nearing the end of her twenties and her rope

               a man stands beside the bed only the lower half of his figure 
               visible we hold on this tableau for a long moment then 
               start forward as we pass under the window shade

                                                                    cut to

               int the hotel room  day

               a small room a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow 
               bed a card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the 
               bureau an unopened suitcase and a womans large straw open
               top handbag are on the bureau

               on the table beside the bed there are a container of coco
               cola and an unwrapped untouched eggsalad sandwich there 
               is no radio

               the man standing by the bed wearing only trousers tshirt 
               and sox is sam loomis a goodlooking sensual shirt man 
               with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile he is blotting 
               his neck and face with a thin towel and is staring down at 
               mary a small sweet smile playing about his mouth mary keeps 
               her face turned away from him

               after a moment sam drops the towel sits on the bed leans 
               over and takes mary into his arms kisses her long and warmly 
               holds her with a firm possessiveness the kiss is disturbed 
               and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an 
               inconsiderate fly sam smiles pulls away enough to allow 
               mary to relax again against the pillow he studies her frowns 
               at her unresponsiveness then speaks in a low intimate 
               playful voice

                                     sam
                         never did eat your lunch did you

               mary looks at his smile has to respond pulls him to her 
               kisses him then and without breaking the kiss she swings 
               her legs over the side of the bed toesearches around finds 
               her shoes slips her feet into searches them and finally 
               pulls away and sits up

                                     mary
                         i better get back to the office  
                         these extended lunch hours give my 
                         boss excess acid

               she rises goes to the bureau takes a pair of small earrings 
               out of her bag begins putting them on not bothering or 
               perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror sam 
               watches her concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery 
               humorous good mood throughout remainder of this scene they 
               occupy themselves with dressing haircombing etc

                                     sam

               the camera shoots across mary enters the scene clad only 
               in her slip perhaps she is about to get into bed behind 
               her is an open closet but too dark inside for us to see any 
               contents as mary turns to the closet the camera lowers to 
               show a close view of the 40000 in the envelope on our side 
               of the bed

               mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on 
               as the camera retreats to reveal a packed but not yet closed 
               suitcase also on the bed mary zips up her dress and then 
               brings some final garments from the closet

               she comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top 
               mary works with haste and in tension as if acting on an 
               impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came

               the suitcase filled now she checks around the room then 
               takes her handbag to the bed puts in the moneyfilled 
               envelope and then slams the suitcase shut then filled she 
               looks at her small bedroom desk goes to it removes a small 
               fileenvelope from one of the drawers it is one of those 
               brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and 
               policies and certificates she checks its contents briefly 
               puts it on the bed opens another desk drawer takes out her 
               bank book tosses it on the bed then she packs both the 
               fileenvelope and the bank book into her handbag takes one 
               quick last look around the room picks up the handbag and 
               the suitcase and goes out of the room

               put the suitcase in changes her mind places the suitcase 
               and her handbag on the front seat gets in starts the car

               guilty face she seems to be driving with that excess care 
               of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic 
               irregularity she stops for a red light at a main 
               intersection

               from marys viewpoint  day

               we see lowery and cassidy crossing the street passing right

               on her face

               now we look closely at lowery as he reaches the curb a 
               small confusion brightens his face he remembers that mary 
               intended to spend the weekend in bed he considers 
               curiously turns looks back at her a slight frown on his 
               face

               mary sees the pause and the look

               ext main street in midtown phoenix  day

               for a moment it even looks as if lowery might be meaning to 
               cross back to the car

               marys tension is unbearable and at that moment we hear the 
               shrill shriek of the traffic cops whistle

               mary zooms the car away

               checks the fuel gauge frowns looks along highway for a gas 
               station

               we see marys car drive in come to a stop there are no 
               other cars about this being a gas station off the main 
               highway and the attendant is obviously in the shack mary 
               looks worried about having to make this stop keeps her face 
               turned away from the shack not wishing it to be seen

               no one comes and for a moment mary considers driving on as 
               if the emptiness of the station were a warning an omen that 
               she should listen to but the gas registers almost empty 
               she has to blow her horn

               a young man comes out of the shack starts toward her car

               at that moment we hear the ringing of the telephone in the 
               shack the attendant walks a few steps further toward marys 
               car then decides to go back and answer the phone the phones 
               insistent ringing unnerves mary

               she starts her car zooms off

               we see the attendant phone in hand in the doorway of shack 
               he looks after the departing car with little or no expression

               involuntarily snap open again she stretches than wide as

               shoulder of the road looking somehow sad and pathetic like 
               a childs thrownaway toy and from this angle it would appear 
               that the car is empty

               after a moment during which there are no other vehicles 
               passing we see coming from the far distance a highway 
               patrolman in a patrol car he passes marys car notes its

               by the sight of the patrolman and as if by automatic reflex 
               turns the ignition and presses down on the starter

               as she drives out of lot we see the mechanic the car dealer 
               and the patrolman all looking after her

                                                               dissolve to

               mary is driving tensely she checks the rearview mirror is 
               more shocked than pleased when she sees

               marys rearview mirror

               no sign of the patrolman

               mary in new car on route

               she turns her face looks out at the highway

               it is heavy with traffic

               mary in new car on route

               again she checks the mirror and although

               marys rearview mirror

               there is still no sign of the patrolman

               mary in new car on route

               she cannot relax or feel safe cannot convince herself that 
               nothing will come of the mans watching and suspicions

               camera is close on marys face now recording her anxiety 
               her fears her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a 
               person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this 
               realistic a situation suddenly we hear the sound of the 
               used car dealers laugh hear it as clearly as mary hears it 
               in her imagination the imagined voice we hear is actually 
               the voice of the car dealer

                                     car dealers voice
                         heck officer that was the first

                         chasing her

                         acted like one

               mary blinks shakes her head as if trying to shake away 
               these voices of her imagination she checks the rearview 
               mirror

               marys rearview mirror

               still no sight of the patrolman

               mary in new car

               she tries to force herself to relax almost succeeds when 
               she is sprung to tension again by

               ext highway

               the sight of a police car as she drives past we hear the 
               squeaky unintelligible voice coming over the car radio 
               mary zooms down on the gas whizzes ahead

                                                       dissolve through to

               ext highway 99  long shot

               marys car dashing along

                                                               dissolve to

               mary in new car

               mary looks weary tired with strain and with hard driving 
               her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought

               out the windshield

               we can see that it is much later in the day almost dusk

               mary in new car

               we hear the sound of an agitated buzz of an intercom system 
               a sound emanating from marys imagination

               after the second buzz we hear the voice of caroline

                                     carolines voice
                         yes mr lowery

                              a worried tone
                         caroline mary still isnt in

                                     carolines voice

                         always a bit late on monday mornings

                         buzz me the minute she comes in

               again mary shakes her head forces herself to stop hearing 
               these invented scenes of her imagination

               ext highway

               now we cut to the view of the road from marys viewpoint 
               darkness of evening is coming in the dim twilight we see 
               the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations 
               beginning to blaze on

               int marys new car

               back on marys face and after a moment the imagined voices 
               again

                                     lowerys voice
                         call her sister if no ones answering 
                         at the house

                         know where mary is any more than we 
                         do

                                     lowerys voice
                         you better run out to the house  
                         she may be unable to answer the 
                         phone

                                     carolines voice
                         her sisters going to do that  shes 
                         as worried as we are

               a flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in marys face 
               she closes her eyes for one tight swift moment

               ext highway

               we cut again to the highway the first oncoming headlights 
               slash at the windshield

               int marys new car

               cutting back to mary we can sense by the tense muscles of 
               her face that she is driving faster the oncoming headlights 
               blurt at her

               suddenly we hear lowerys voice loud now and frightened as 
               if the anxiety in the mans voice was strong enough to break 
               through marys effort to keep her mind silent and her 
               imagination blank

                                     lowerys voice

                         hour or so later driving

                              solemn fear

               a look of revulsion makes mary close her eyes

               she presses down forces the car to move on through the 
               flooded road

               ext the road

               as we move closer we see the neon sign more clearly and can

               mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration goes 
               back out onto the porch she looks off in another direction 
               slightly behind the office and sees

               marys viewpoint  a large old house  night

               a path from the motel office leads directly up to this house 
               there is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms a woman 
               passes the window pauses peers out

               the window

               ext porch of bates motel  night

               mary having seen the woman expects now that she will get 
               some attention she stands a few moments waiting

               out into the rain to her car gets in opens the side window 
               begins to honk the horn after a moment a young man open 
               the front door of the house pauses starts down the path 
               after a few steps he turns and runs back into the house 
               mary leaves her car starts a dash for the shelter of the 
               porch as she runs we see that the young man has gone back 
               only to get an umbrella seeing that mary is on her way to 
               the porch he runs quickly the umbrella unopened in his 
               hand he gets to the porch a moment after mary has reached 
               it

               he stops short looks at her then at the umbrella hanging 
               useless in his hand then back to her

               there is something sadly touching in his manner in his look 
               marys impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him 
               almost smile he gestures her into the office standing back 
               to indicate that he will go after her she goes into the

                              starts out
                         with my trusty umbrella
                              he laughs a small 
                              laugh runs off

               mary closes the door goes to suitcase opens it starts to 
               take out a dress her handbag is next to the suitcase she 
               glances down into it pauses drops the dress reaches into 
               the handbag takes out the moneyfilled envelope stares at 
               it almost with regret filled contemplates hiding it decides 
               to starts looking for a reasonable hiding place she looks 
               about at the closet the drawers etc realizes all such 
               places are obvious catching sight of the newspaper in her 
               bag she hits on a solution she opens the newspaper places 
               the envelope within it lockfolds the paper again and then 
               places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later 
               reading she considers this for a moment accepts it goes 
               to her suitcase to start unpacking

               suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill ugly sound of 
               a womans voice raised in anger

                                     womans voice
                         no i tell you no

               mary walks slowly to the window realizing that the terrible 
               voice is coming from the house behind the cabins camera 
               follows her to window and once there we see the light is 
               still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming 
               from that room the rain has stopped and the moon is out

                                     womans voice
                         i wont have you bringing strange 
                         young girls in for supper
                              an ugly sneering 
                              note creeps into the 
                              voice
                         by candlelight i suppose in the 
                         cheap erotic fashion of young men

                                     normans voice

                                     womans voice
                         and then what after supper music 
                         whispers

                                     normans voice
                         mother shes just a stranger  
                         hungry and the weathers bad

                                     womans voice
                              mimicking cruelly
                         mother shes just a stranger
                              hard cruel again
                         as if men dont desire strangers as 
                         if oh i refuse to speak of 
                         disgusting things because they disgust

                                     womans voice
                              pause
                         go on go tell her shell not be 
                         appeasing her ugly appetite with my

                         tell her cause you dont have the 
                         guts huh boy you have the guts 
                         boy

                                     normans voice
                              blurted cut fury and 
                              shame
                         shut up shut up

               there is the sound of a door closing in that room up there 
               mary has stood by the window listening with mounting distress 
               and concern and sympathy she turns her face away now gazes 
               sadly at the little empty room

               in a moment there is the sound of the houses front door 
               slamming shut mary turns looks out the window

               from marys viewpoint  night

               we see norman coming down the path carrying a napkincovered 
               tray

               int cabin one  night

               mary looks at him for a moment then turns quickly goes to 
               the door opens it and goes out onto the porch

               ext the motel porch  night

               mary pauses outside the door is about to start forward when 
               norman comes round the building and walks along the porch 
               past the office stopping only when he is close to her he 
               stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her 
               eye

                                     mary
                         ive caused you some trouble

                                     norman
                         mother
                              a hollow little laugh 
                              an attempt at sardonic 
                              humor
                         what is the phrase she isnt 
                         herself today i think thats it

                                     mary
                              looking at the tray
                         you shouldnt have bothered i really 
                         dont have that much of an appetite

               norman flinches realizing she has heard his mothers 
               reference to marys appetite

                                     norman
                         im sorry i wish people could 
                         apologize for other people

                                     mary
                         dont worry about it
                              a warm smile
                         but as long as youve made us supper 
                         we may as well eat it huh

               she begins to back into her room norman starts to follow 
               hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young 
               woman and a motel room bringing down the tray of food in 
               defiance of his mothers orders is about the limit of his 
               defiance for one day he cannot go into marys room

                                     norman
                         it might be nicer warmer in the 
                         office

               without waiting for approval or disapproval he turns hurries 
               to the office mary looks after him her face showing amused 
               sympathy then follows

               int the motel office  night

               norman looks about tray in hand sees there is no reasonable 
               place to spread out a supper he turns sees mary standing 
               in the doorway

                                     norman
                         eating in an office
                              a rueful smile
                         to officious even for me i have 
                         the parlor behind this if youd 
                         like

               mary nods norman walks on behind the counter and into the 
               darkened parlor mary follows

               int normans parlor night

               in the darkened room lit only by the light from the office 
               spilling in we see norman placing the tray on a table mary 
               comes to the doorway pauses norman straightens up goes to 
               lamp turns on the light

               mary is startled by the room even in the dimness of one 
               lamp the strange extraordinary nature of the room rushes 
               up at one it is a room of birds stuffed birds all over 
               the room on every available surface one even clinging to 
               the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp the birds are 
               of many varieties beautiful grand horrible preying mary 
               stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror

               close up  the various birds two shot  mary and norman

                                     norman
                         please sit down on the sofa

               as norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and 
               pouring the milk we follow mary across the room she studies 
               the birds as she walks briefly examines a bookcase stacked 
               with books on the subject of taxidermy

               close up  the books on taxidermy med close shot  mary

               she notices too the paintings on the wall nudes primarily 
               and many with a vaguely religious overtone

               finally mary reaches the sofa sits down looks at the spread

                                     mary
                         youre very kind

                                     norman
                         its all for you im not hungry  
                         please go ahead

               mary begins to eat her attitude a bit tense she takes up a 
               small slice of ham bites off a tiny bite nibbles at it in 
               the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied

               norman gazes at her at the tiny bite she has taken smiles 
               and then laughs

                                     norman
                         you eat like a bird

                                     mary
                         youd know of course

                                     norman
                         not really i hear that expression 
                         that one eats like a bird is really 
                         a falsie i mean a falsity because 
                         birds eat a tremendous lot
                              a pause then 
                              explaining
                         oh i dont know anything about birds 
                         my hobby is stuffing things 
                         taxidermy and i guess id just rather 
                         stuff birds because  well i hate 
                         the look of beasts when theyre 
                         stuffed foxes and chimps and all 
                         some people even stuff dogs and 
                         cats but i cant i think only 
                         birds look well stuffed because 
                         theyre rather  passive to begin 
                         with most of them

               he trails off his exuberance failing in the rushing return 
               of his natural hesitancy and discomfort mary looks at him 
               with some compression smiles

                              a pause

                              turning suddenly
                         you know what i think i think were 
                         all in our private traps clamped in 
                         them and none of us can ever climb 
                         out we scratch and claw but only 
                         at the air only at each other and 
                         for all of it we never budge an

                              staring at him 
                              shaking her head 
                              softly
                         if anyone ever spoke to me the way 
                         i heard the way she spoke to you

                              controlled resentment

                         leave her forever
                              a rueful smile
                         or at least defy her
                              a pause a hopeless 
                              shrug
                         but i couldnt shes ill

                         i mean ill
                              a pause
                         she had to raise me all by herself 
                         after my dad died i was only 
                         five and it must have been a 
                         strain oh she didnt have to go 
                         out to work or anything dad left us 
                         with a little something anyway a 
                         few years ago mother met a man 
                         he talked her into building this 
                         motel we could have talked her 
                         into anything and when  well 
                         it was just too much for her when he 
                         died too and the way he died 
                         oh its nothing to talk about when 
                         youre eating
                              pauses smiles
                         anyway it was too much of a loss 
                         for my mother she had nothing 
                         left

                         up there the fire would go out

                         you love someone you dont do that

                         in someplace

               she hesitates norman turns slowly looking at her with a 
               striking coldness

                              the coldness turning

                         shes as harmless as one of these 
                         stuffed birds

                         mean well they cluck their thick 
                         tongues and shake their heads and 
                         suggest so very delicately that

               the fury suddenly dies abruptly and completely and he sinks 
               back into his chair there is a brief silence

               mary watches the troubled man is almost physically pained 
               by his anguish

                         needs me and it isnt

                              childlike pleading 
                              in his eyes

                              he frowns as if 
                              bothered by not being 
                              able to match the 
                              name to the memory 
                              of the name in the

                         good night

               she goes out of the parlor we see her from normans 
               viewpoint as she crosses the small office goes out into 
               the night norman turns and looks at the table and we see 
               his face now it is bright with that drunkenlike look of 
               determination and encouragement and like resolve he starts 
               to clean up the table pauses as he hears the closing of 
               marys door in the cabin next door

               he holds still listens he goes into the office and looks 
               at the book

               cu  the name samuels

               ms  norman

               he goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression 
               the sound of mary moving about her room come over soft 
               sounds somehow intimate in the night quiet norman turns 
               his ear from the direction of the sounds seems to be fighting 
               an impulse to listen or more than listen

               but slowly he is forced to surrender to the impulse and 
               resisting himself he goes to the wall presses the side of 
               his head against it the sounds come louder as if we too 
               had our ear pressed against the wall now norman looks at a 
               picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning 
               against slowly he starts toward it

               he reaches it touches it reluctantly lifts the small frame 
               off the wall

               a tiny circle of light hits normans face coming from the 
               hole in the wall behind the picture this end of the room is 
               very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light 
               striking normans face

               we move close to norman extremely close until his profile 
               fills the screen the tiny spot of light hits his eye see 
               the small hole through which the light comes norman peeps 
               through

               normans viewpoint

               through the hole we look into marys cabin see mary 
               undressing she is in her bra and halfslip she stoops over 
               a bit places her hands behind her upper back begins to 
               unhook her bra

               norman  ecu

               he watches as mary removes her bra we see his eye run up 
               and down the unseen figure of mary

               normans viewpoint

               mary just slipping into a robe covering her complete nudity

               norman

               he turns from the hole faces us for a moment continues 
               turning until he can look out the small parlor window

               we see as he sees

               the house in the background

               norman

               he turns his face away quickly resentfully in his face we 
               see anger and anguish and then resolve

               quickly precisely he rehangs the picture over the hole in 
               the wall turns starts out of the parlor we see him go 
               through the office and out onto the porch not even bothering 
               to close the door behind him

                                                                    cut to

               ext the motel office porch  night

               norman walking along the porch in the direction of the big 
               house once on the path he pauses looks up at the light in 
               the bedroom window then pulls himself up squares his 
               shoulders strides manfully up the path

               camera follows behind him he opens the door of the house 
               enters we see him pause at the foot of the stairway look 
               up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair he 
               holds for a moment and then his resolve and courage 
               evaporates his shoulders slump sadly mournfully he by
               passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen 
               at the far end of the hall he enters the kitchen drops 
               wearily into a chair after a moment he stretches out a leg 
               and gently pushes the kitchen door closed

                                                                    cut to

               int marys motel room  night

               mary is seated at the small desk engrossed in figuring in a 
               small notebook we see from these figures a calculation which 
               indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money 
               she has used of the forty thousand dollars we see too her 
               bankbook the paper reads thus top figure 40000 directly 
               beneath it 500 the amount used for the new car total after 
               subtraction 39500 in another spot we see a figure which 
               matches the balance in her bankbook 62400

               beneath this is the figure 500 and the amount after 
               subtraction 12400 she studies the figures sighs not 
               wearily but with a certain satisfaction with the pleasure 
               that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to 
               continue doing the right thing after a moment she tears the 
               page out of the notebook and rising begins to rip it into 
               small pieces she goes into the bathroom drops the pieces 
               into the toilet bowl flushes the toilet then she drops her 
               robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on

               int mary in shower

               over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain we can see 
               the bathroom door not entirely closed for a moment we watch 
               mary as she washes and soaps herself

               there is still a small worry in her eyes but generally she 
               looks somewhat relieved

               now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open

               the noise of the shower drowns out any sound the door is 
               then slowly and carefully closed

               and we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower 
               curtain marys back is turned to the curtain the white 
               brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding

               suddenly we see the hand reach up grasp the shower curtain 
               rip it aside

                                                                    cut to

               mary  ecu

               as she turns in response to the feel and sound of the shower 
               curtain being torn aside a look of pure horror erupts in 
               her face a low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her 
               throat a hand comes into the shot the hand holds an enormous 
               bread knife the flint of the blade shatters the screen to 
               an almost total silver blankness

               the slashing

               an impression of a knife slashing as if tearing at the very 
               screen ripping the film over it the brief gulps of 
               screaming and then silence and then the dreadful thump as 
               marys body falls in the tub

               reverse angle

               the blank whiteness the blur of the shower water the hand 
               pulling the shower curtain back we catch one flicker of a 
               glimpse of the murderer a woman her face contorted with 
               madness her head wild with hair as if she were wearing a 
               frightwig  and then we see only the curtain closed across 
               the tub and hear the rush of the shower water above the 
               showerbar we see the bathroom door open again and after a 
               moment we hear the sound of the front door slamming

                                                                    cut to

               the dead body

               lying half in half out of the tub the head tumbled over 
               touching the floor the hair wet one eye wide open as if 
               popped one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor  
               coming down the side of the tub running thick and dark along 
               the porcelain we see many small threads of blood camera 
               follows away from the body travels slowly across the 
               bathroom past the toilet out into the bedroom as camera 
               approaches the bed we see the folded newspaper as mary placed 
               it on the bedside table

               close up  the newspaper

               beside the bed the camera now moves away over to the window 
               and looks up to the house and as it gets there we hear 
               coming from within the house the sound of normans fearful 
               shocked voice

                                     normans voice
                         mother oh god what blood 
                         blood mother

               we cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations

               after a moment or two of silence norman emerges from the 
               front door dashes down the path toward the motel

                                                              quick cut to

               ext the path  night

               norman is coming at camera running headon he dashes into 
               an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in 
               his face camera pans as norman races past holds as norman 
               runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to marys 
               room

               int marys cabin  night

               norman pauses a moment in the doorway glances about the 
               room hears the shower going sees the bathroom door is open 
               he goes to the bathroom looks in sees the body

               slowly almost carefully he raises his hands to his face 
               covers his eyes turns his face away then he crosses to the 
               window looks out at the house shot is so angled that we 
               see the bedside table with the newspaper on it

               after a moment norman moves from the window sinks onto the 
               edge of the bed

               fresh angle  behind norman

               norman sitting on bed the bathroom in bg of shot we can 
               see only the hand of the dead girl lying along the tile 
               floor norman presses his eyes fights to find a way out of 
               his dilemma slowly a kind of settling comes upon him the 
               peace that comes with decision

               norman rises goes to the window looks out and then with 
               resolution closes the window and draws the curtain across 
               it then he crosses to the front window facing the porch 
               and draws those curtains closed then he switches off the 
               bedroom light leaving the room lit only by the spill from 
               the bathroom he opens the front door goes out

               ext the hotel porch  night

               norman comes out of marys cabin closes the door carefully 
               behind him goes along the porch to his office goes in we 
               stay outside immediately the vacancy sign goes off and 
               then the motel sign goes off as camera goes closer to the 
               office the lights within go off and we hear a closet door 
               opening and then the sound of a pail being picked up norman 
               comes out of office closes door looks cautiously about 
               goes along porch carrying pail with mop in it goes into 
               marys cabin closing the door after him

               with the paper in the foreground norman enters we can see 
               him in the dim spill of light he pauses by the door then 
               gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom we hear him 
               set the pail on the tiled floor and then we hear the shower 
               being turned off and there is total silence camera moves 
               forward so that we can see into bathroom

               camera is angled that we see norman only from the waist up 
               quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain emerges 
               with it into the bedroom camera pans down and we see him 
               spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor just outside 
               the bathroom door he spreads the curtain so that one end of 
               it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over 
               and onto the tile floor again he goes into the bathroom and 
               camera tilts up so that we see only the upper half of norman 
               he works carefully with his arms extended away from his 
               body slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub drags it 
               across the tile floor and onto the spreadout shower curtain

               diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water

               norman

               we see norman shake his hands free of the water then turn 
               to the job of cleaning the bathroom

               he places the pail in the tub runs water into it dips the 
               mop in swabs the tile floor with a towel he wipes off the 
               wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and 
               even the shower curtain rod then he takes a second towel 
               and goes over the cleaned areas carefully drying them  
               finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop empties the pail 
               cleans out the tub and goes out into the bedroom

               int marys bedroom

               norman steps carefully around the unseen body crosses to 
               the desk starts going through marys handbag in search of 
               her car keys he suddenly notices them lying on the desk

               the keys crosses the room goes out

               ext the porch

               we see norman pauses at the door check cautiously then 
               hurry across the porch and into marys car he circleturns 
               the car so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch 
               directly opposite marys door as close as it can go

               and leaving the trunk lid raised goes back into the cabin

               int marys room

               from a raised angle we see norman bend down and begin to 
               wrap the shower curtain around the body we see the edges of 
               the curtain as they are raised and laid down again then he 
               picks up the wrapped body crosses to the door uses his 
               foot to pull the door open and leaving the door open behind

               he comes back into the cabin closes the door completely 
               flicks on the light

               again the newspaper is in the foreground for a moment he 
               pauses closes his eyes against the realization of what he 
               is doing then quickly pushes all thoughts away continues 
               with his work with the room lighted he now proceeds to 
               gather up all marys articles and toss them into the suitcase 
               he checks all drawers and the closet gets down and checks

               off the light with his shoulder pulls open the door starts 
               out

               ext the porch

               as norman stands in the doorway he is suddenly and blindingly 
               lit by the bright headlights of a passing car the flash of 
               the lights and the sound of the speeding car are over in a 
               flicker of a moment but it takes a few seconds for norman 
               to regain his former tense composure then he goes to the 
               car trunk raises it with his foot throws the suitcase and 
               the pail into it slams it shut he pauses a moment then 
               realizes he has left the bathroom light on in marys cabin

               newspaper on the bedside table he goes to it takes the 
               newspaper and looks once again into the bathroom his glance

               we hold on the trunk follow it for a while then

                                                               dissolve to

               ext the swamp  night

               the car pulls away from a close angle on the trunk and as 
               camera holds we see that we are now in a swamp area

               it is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects 
               norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp turns 
               off the lights gets out leaving door open he looks at the 
               swamp seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car 
               realizes he has no choice he leans into the car releases 
               the emergency brake starts to push the front of the car 
               begins to roll into the swamp suddenly there is the low 
               throbbing sound of a motor norman freezes listens

               the sound grows louder and norman realizes it is an airplane 
               flying overhead the car is rolling quickly now norman jumps 
               away slams the door shut stands tense the sound of the 
               plane overhead grows louder

               norman looks up

               normans viewpoint  the black sky

               we see no plane the sound of the motor is beginning to 
               diminish

                                                               cut back to

               norman

               we see the relief in his face he looks at the car

               more than twothirds of it have already sunk into the swamp 
               the trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime 
               as if refusing to go the rest of the way norman begins to 
               panic he steps dangerously close pushes with his foot and 
               slowly the car sinks until finally it is gone and we hear 
               only the gentle plop of the swamps final gulp and see only 
               the small afterbubble like a visual burp

               norman waits a moment then begins stamping out the tire 
               marks so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp

               he stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we

                                                               dissolve to

               close up norman

               standing on the porch of the motel leaning against a post 
               he is staring out into the night a look of guarded casual 
               innocence on his face as if he were taking one last moment 
               of peaceful night air before retiring then he glances down 
               and camera follows his gaze a hose is lying on the ground 
               outside marys cabin its stream of water obliterating the 
               tire marks

               after a moment normans hand comes into shot picks up hose 
               places it in a new position as camera pulls back we see 
               that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the 
               road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a 
               car had been parked here

               after a short wait norman goes to the hosefaucet turns it 
               off unscrews the hose as he rolls the hose he walks away 
               from the spot past the office heading for the path that 
               leads to the house he goes up the path pauses at the steps 
               of the house tosses the curled hose onto the lawn goes up 
               the steps and into the house camera follows him in pauses 
               as he pauses at the foot of the stairs norman goes up the 
               stairs

               on the landing he stops the door to his mothers room is 
               closed lying in a heap outside the door are a bloodstained 
               dress and a pair of elderlywomans shoes from an extremely 
               high angle we look down on norman as he bends to pick up 
               the stained dress and shoes

               he rolls the shoes into the dress tucks the small neat 
               bundle under his arm and starts down the stairs heading 
               for the basement

               ext a long shot of the old house  night

               it stands silhouetted against the sky there is a long wait 
               then slowly a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney

                                                                  fade out

                                                                    fade in

               int back room of sams hardware store in fairvale  day

               sam is seated at his desk writing a letter sequence

               begins with camera in close over sams shoulder and we can 
               read as mush as he has written of the letter the letterhead 
               reads sam loomis  hardware and the letter reads dearest 
               rightasalways mary im sitting in this tiny back room 
               which isnt big enough for both of us and suddenly it looks 
               big enough for both of us so what if were poor and cramped 
               and miserable at least well be happy if you havent come 
               to your senses and still want to

               camera begins pulling away as sam turns the sheet of paper 
               over continues backing away out of the small back room and 
               heads backwards down the corridor we see a young clerk 
               bob summerfield sams assistant standing behind the counter 
               a look of handsome patience on his face he is waiting on a 
               meticulous elderly woman customer who is holding and 
               examining a large can of insecticide as camera passes

                                     woman customer
                         they tell you what its ingredients 
                         are and how its guaranteed to 
                         exterminate any insect in the world 
                         but they do not tell you whether or 
                         not its painless and i say insect 
                         or man death should always be 
                         painless

               camera by this has reached the front door of the hardware 
               store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door 
               she is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner a 
               look of purposefulness she carries a handbag and a small 
               overnight case she is marys sister lila crane

               bob summerfield has noticed lila smiles brightly at her 
               gives her an illbewithyouinamoment nod

               lila starts to walk toward the counter never taking her 
               eyes off bob as she approaches she asks quietly

                                     lila

                              yelling toward back

               lila looks to the back room the woman customer goes on 
               worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can 
               sam comes to the door of his room pauses looks at lila a 
               moment starts toward her his expression indicating that he 
               does not know her lila studies him with a quiet worried 
               expression

                              a bit mystified
                         sure

               lila glances at the customer and the clerk turns starts 
               toward the front of the store sam holds a moment then 
               follows as he reaches her she turns her eyes studying him 
               intently as she says

               sam is mystified and is also aware of the worried hostile 
               expression on lilas face he studies her for a quiet moment 
               behind them is a display of various size carving knives

               after a quiet moment

                         it was her boss idea not to report 
                         it to the police

                         hard to believe she did because its 
                         hard to see why she would unless

               ext the bates house and motel  twilight

               we now see norman he has brought out an old rocking chair 
               and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched 
               in it and he is darning one of his own socks camera holds 
               beyond the porch and norman we see the old house and can 
               barely make out in the twilight dimness the figure of his 
               mother seated at the window here too there is that quality 
               of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding

               now norman looks up at the sound of the approaching car

               and continues looking as the car comes to a stop and arbogast 
               gets out arbogast gives the place a quick onceover gazes 
               at norman starts forward in his steps and manner there is 
               that bored routinelogged quality of a man who has seen too 
               many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers 
               over too short a period of time

               norman rises as arbogast comes forward

                         we have reason to believe she came 
                         this way might have stopped in 
                         this area

                                     norman
                         committing myself to what you sure 
                         talk like a policeman

                                     arbogast

               cases off the shelf holds them close almost protectively

                         no at least i dont recall

                                     arbogast
                         she might have used an alias mary 
                         cranes the real name but she 
                         mightve registered

                                     norman
                              interrupting

                         registering any more i mean little 
                         by little you drop the formalities
                              more relaxed because 
                              arbogast is listening 
                              with a pleasant smile
                         i shouldnt even bother to change 
                         the linen i guess habits die hard 
                         which reminds me

               he goes to the wall flips a light switch

                                     norman
                         the vacancy sign just in case

               we had a couple the other night said if the sign hasnt 
               been on theyd have thought this was an old deserted mining 
               town or something

                                     arbogast
                         now theres a couple even remarking 
                         about your sign and see how easily 
                         you forgot them

                                     norman
                         what

                                     arbogast

                         in weeks now try to remember if

                                     arbogast
                              a pause a study
                         maybe she even signed the register 
                         because habits die hard lets check 
                         it huh

               norman says nothing arbogast goes to the desk pulls the 
               registry book around flips back a page or two

               norman simply stares at the man arbogast hums faintly 
               pleasantly as he examines the pages then

                                     arbogast
                         yes sir marie samuels  interesting 
                         alias

               he takes a slip of paper out of his pocket lays it beside 
               the signature in the registry book all the while nodding 
               and smiling nicely as if this discovery will make norman as 
               happy as it is making him

                                     arbogast

                              smile gone
                         was she in disguise or do you want 
                         to check the picture again

               cu  arbogast

               comes to a decision he goes off

               hall arbogast goes to the living room window looks in 
               sees only darkness then he goes to the door listens for 
               along moment hears nothing

               very slowly almost painfully he turns the knob of the door 
               and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder the door begins 
               to open he allows it to open just enough for him to slip 
               through and into the foyer

                                                                    cut to

               one the door at the head of the stairs is closed arbogast 
               listens holds his breath hears what could be human sounds 
               coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the 
               sounds of an old house after sunset after a careful wait 
               he crosses to the stairs starts up slowly guardedly 
               placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks 
               or groans before placing his full weight on it camera 
               follows remaining on floor level but travelling along the

               we see arbogast coming up the stairs and now we see too 
               the door of the mothers room opening carefully and slowly

               as arbogast reaches the landing the door opens and the mother 
               steps out her hand raises high the blade of an enormous 
               knife flashing

               cu  a big head of an astonished arbogast

               the knife slashes across his cheek and neck blood spurts 
               the sudden attack throws him off balance he stumbles back 
               and staggers down the whole of the staircase he frantically 
               gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the 
               stairs the camera follows him all the way a wicked knife 
               keeps thrusting itself into the foreground as he collapses 
               at the bottom the black head and shoulders of mrs bates 
               plunges into the foreground as the camera moves in to contain 
               the raising and descending murder weapon

                                                                   fade out

                                                                    fade in

               int back room of hardware store  night

               lila is sitting close by the phone and looks as if she hasnt 
               moved from it in the last hour sam is pacing occasionally 
               stopping at the window glancing out pacing again the ash 
               tray close to lila is filled

               there is a thick atmosphere of smoke tension and weariness 
               in the small otherwise cozy room

                                     sam

                              a warm smile
                         contemplate your panic button

               he hurries down to the street door and out camera holds on 
               lila as she stares after sam as she stands alone in the 
               darkened store all the hardware seems to take on sinister 
               shapes

               cu

               among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls 
               onto the floor

               medium shot

               lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in 
               its place she turns and again looks to the deserted street 
               with a touch of anxiety she gives a slight unconscious 
               shiver

                                                               dissolve to

               ext the swamp  night

               tall and lonely still against the moonlight the figure of 
               norman silhouetted he doesnt move merely stands there at 
               the edge of the swamp staring down at the now calm and quiet 
               face of it

                                                                    cut to

               ext the motel and house  night

               all light are out except the light in normans mothers 
               room and her figure can be seen sitting in the window 
               relaxed in a highback chair her face turned into the room  
               after a second we hear the sound of a motor and then sams 
               small pickup truck swings into the driveway

               sam stops the motor automatically switches off headlights 
               pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area 
               then he hops out of the cab goes quickly to the office 
               knocks on the door as he waits for a response he looks 
               down the long porch studies the darkened cabins knocks 
               again louder looks in the other direction and sees the 
               house and the figure at the one lit window he stares a moment 
               then calls loudly

                                     sam
                         arbogast

               ext the swamp

               the silhouette of norman he is still over shot very dimly 
               comes the sound of sams voice calling again for arbogast

               norman turns slowly until in silhouette we see his profile 
               his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in 
               the direction of the house there is silence for a moment 
               and then again the sound of sam pounding at the door

                                                               dissolve to

               int hardware store  night

               the store is in darkness only the glow from the back room 
               spilling in

               ls

               with camera placed with its back to the street door we can 
               see the distant tiny figure of lila seated and waiting in 
               the back room beyond there is a sound of a car pulling up 
               the tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back 
               room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head 
               we see lilas desperate anxious look

               medium shot

               from her viewpoint we see sam alighting from his truck and 
               coming toward the door of the store he enters he and lila 
               exchange quiet glances

                                     sam
                         he didnt come back here

                         old lady at home
                              frowning
                         a sick old lady unable to answer the 
                         door or unwilling

                         maybe he got some definite lead
                         maybe he went right on

                                     lila
                         without calling me

               lila goes quiet sam starts toward the back room pauses at 
               the doorway turns lila has remained by the door looking 
               out at the street she feels his pause turns and for a

               sam presses the bell button both he and lila are almost 
               knocked over by the shocking clanging earsplitting blast 
               of the bell within the house a ring which sounds more like 
               a fire alarm than a doorbell

               he tries to smile fails lila doesnt even try the 
               downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is 
               unhesitatingly opened by mrs chambers a small lively stick 
               of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of 
               hospitality

                                     sheriff
                         this detective was out there and 
                         norman told him about the girl and 
                         the detective thanked him and went 
                         away

                                     lila
                         and he didnt go back didnt see 
                         the mother

               the sheriff looks long at lila shakes his head 
               sympathetically

                                     sheriff
                         you shouldve called in the police 
                         the second you found your sister has 
                         skipped you go starting private 
                         investigations using people you 
                         dont even know

                                     lila
                         what difference does that

                                     sheriff
                         your detective told you a nakedfaced 
                         lie

                                     mrs chambers
                         barefaced

                                     sheriff
                         he told you he wasnt coming right 
                         back cause he wanted to question 
                         norman bates mother right

                                     sheriff
                              a pause then calmly
                         norman bates mother has been dead 
                         and buried in greenlawn cemetery for 
                         the last ten years

               there is a long silence sam and lila stare at the sheriff

                                     mrs chambers
                         i helped norman pick out the dress

                         norman found them dead together  in 
                         bed

                                     sheriff
                         now wait a minute sam you sure you 
                         saw an old woman

                         i pounded and called but she just 
                         ignored me

                                     sheriff
                         and you want to tell me you saw norman 
                         bates mother

                         too and he said the young man 
                         wouldnt let him see her because she 
                         was ill

               the sheriff stares at both of them and when he finally speaks 
               there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice

                                     sheriff
                         well if the woman up there is mrs
                         bates whos that woman buried out 
                         at greenlawn cemetery

                                                              quick cut to

               int normans parlor behind office  night

               norman sits in the dim onelamp light the phone next to 
               him his hand still near it as if he had not been able to 
               move his hand after hanging up he is staring at the shrike
               like bird which is perched on the lamp shade decision and 
               resolution are beginning to show in his face suddenly he 
               rises starts quickly out of the room tries to switch off 
               the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking 
               the bird off the shade

               he watches it fall does not try to catch it it hits the 
               floor with a thud and sawdust spills out he stares sadly at 
               it for a moment then tends down scoops up the sawdust 
               tries to press it into the split seam picks up the bird 
               puts it in a drawer then he puts out the lamp goes out 
               crosses the darkened office and goes outside

                                                                    cut to

               ext motel and house  night

               norman comes off the porch walks to the path and directly 
               up to the house opens the door and goes in

                                                                    cut to

               int downstairs hallway and stairway  night

               shooting up the stairs

               norman goes up pauses one moment outside his mothers door 
               then opens it and goes in leaving the door open

               for a moment we hear only normans low quiet voice his 
               words indistinguishable then we hear the cold shot of his 
               mothers derisive laughter

                                     mothers voice
                         i am sorry boy but you do manage 
                         to look ludicrous when you give me 
                         orders

                                     normans voice

                                     mothers voice

                                     mothers voice
                              mimicking
                         just for a few days

                              a pause then

               during all this the camera has been slowly creeping up the 
               stairs it does not stop at the top however but continues 
               on the same high angle that we had in scene 57

               she starts to laugh a terrible sound like an obscene melody

                                     normans voice
                         ill carry you mother

               norman comes out of the room his mother held in his arms 
               her head leaning against his shoulder he carries her down 
               the stairs along the lower landing to the cellar stairs 
               and then down those stairs to the basement

                                                               dissolve to

               ext fairvale presbyterian church  morning

               an overcast morning but a sunnyfaced crowd the service is 
               just over there is contentment and peace and just a little 
               iwenttochurchsmugness in the faces of the churchgoers as 
               they come out of the chapel and spread their separate ways 
               away

               amongst the crowd waiting and searching the faces are sam 
               and lila in their expressions there is no peace no 
               contentment camera moves in close they are not speaking 
               lila looks as if she has had no sleep

               suddenly sam becomes alert takes lilas arm starts toward 
               the church

               camera moves with them stops as they approach sheriff and 
               mrs chambers the sheriff stares rather sympathetically at 
               lila mrs chambers smiles nicely

                                     sam

               curb

               ext the bates motel and house  day

               the place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep 
               gray of the cloudy sky we see sams truck turning into the 
               driveway and pulling to a stop after a moment sam and lila 
               get out of the truck

               fresh angle

               close on sam and lila as they meet on the porch side of the 
               truck the motel office and the house beyond can be seen in 
               bg of shot sam and lila merely stare for a moment then 
               turn and gaze up at the house there is no figure in the 
               window and the shade is drawn same goes to the office door 
               peers in knocks opens door enters lila remains on the 
               driveway beside the truck

                                                                    cut to

               int the mothers room  day

               close angle on norman standing by the window he has pulled 
               the curtains very slightly apart is staring out and down at 
               the motel his eyes studying the lone figure of lila who is 
               standing by the truck and looking up at the house  norman 
               studies her and as her eyes look up at this very window he 
               closes the curtains turns away

               we see the suspicion and fear in his face the surge of panic 
               and his struggle to contain it then he goes away camera 
               remains on window shooting out and down and through the 
               frail curtains we can see sam as he comes out of the motel 
               office and joins lila

               ext motel office  close on sam and lila

                                     sam
                              unconsciously 
                              whispering

                         hermiting

                         come on

               he starts with her toward the path which leads to the old 
               house camera pans with them and as they turn around the 
               office corner they see norman coming down the path toward 
               them they pause and norman pauses he does not smile nor 
               speak his usual grin and soft friendliness are gone 
               containment and impassivity lie in their place

                                     sam

                         day coming doesnt it

               norman walks past sam giving him the sort of quick 
               disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying 
               goes onto the porch and into the office sam and lila follow

               pocket

               the door it opens she closes it quickly as she hears sam 
               and norman coming out of the motel office continues on down 
               the porch

                                     sam

               the office door looking after sam and lila his face alert 
               and no longer impassive he waits a moment after they have 
               closed their cabin door then crosses to the pickup truck

               through the drivers window twists the registration card 
               around reads it

               it gives the correct name and address of sam loomis

               norman comes back out of the window glances once more toward 
               cabin twelve then at the old house his suspicions are 
               confirmed and now there is the relaxation of relief in his 
               face he takes on a purposeful air turns strides up the 
               path up onto the porch of the house opens the door goes 
               in

               for a glimpse of the old house which cannot be seen from 
               the window of this cabin

               she turns frustrated anxious sam is standing at the foot 
               of the bed staring at the smooth coverlet his brow creased 
               in a sadness

                         like this motel one you probably 
                         couldnt even sell  what would 
                         you need to get away to start a new 
                         business somewhere else
                              as sam studies her
                         forty thousand dollars

                                     sam
                         how could we prove
                              an almost hopeless 
                              laugh
                         well if he opens a new motel on the 
                         new highway say a year from now

                                     lila
                         there must be some proof that exists 
                         right now something that proves he 
                         got that money away from mary 
                         some way

                                     sam
                         what makes you sound so certain

                                     lila
                         arbogast sam he liked me or 
                         felt sorry for me and he was 
                         starting to feel the same about you 
                         i heard it when he called in his 
                         voice a caring he wouldnt have 
                         gone anywhere or done anything without 
                         telling us  unless he was stopped 
                         and he was stopped so he must have 
                         found out something

               sam considers a moment nods agreement rises

                                     sam
                         well start with cabin one

               he goes to the door opens it slightly looks out then 
               back to lila

                                     sam
                         if he sees us were just taking 
                         the air

               lila goes to the door he holds it open and she goes out

               ext the motel  day

               sam closes the door joins lila takes her hand

               together they walk along the porch in the direction of cabin 
               one camera follows they pause before the door of cabin 
               one sam motions lila to wait to hold still then goes on 
               to the office opens the door calls in

                                     sam
                         bates

               he waits there is no response he goes in and in a moment 
               comes back out closes the door goes to lila

               she has already opened the door of cabin one and has started 
               to enter

               int cabin one  day

               the blinds are closed and the room is almost nightdark

               sam comes in after lila closes the door behind him

               for a moment they just gaze at the room as if willing it to 
               tell them some satisfactory story

               neither speaks then in dark silence they begin to search 
               going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers the 
               closet the desk searching under the bed and in dark corners 
               not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to 
               find some thing lila opens the bathroom door looks in the 
               windowless room is very dark she switches on the light 
               goes in sam moves toward the bathroom is about to follow 
               her in when he notices which room it is and automatically 
               catches himself up backs out

                                     sam
                         sorry

                                     lila

                                     sam

                                     lila
                         the bathroom look at how clean it 
                         is the one in our cabin is clean 
                         but this is clean

               sam goes in glances around nods lila goes through the 
               medicine cabinet finds nothing but a glass and two tiny 
               tabs of soap sam leans against the doorjamb looks at the 
               tub the shower pipe above it he continues to stare more 
               interested suddenly as if bothered by some offkey evidence 
               he cant put his finger on then he looks at the shower 
               curtain rod

               and realizes there is no shower curtain he frowns is about 
               to say something when lila who has been momentarily out of 
               shot interrupts

               sam turns camera turns and we see lila is standing above 
               the toilet bowl a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip 
               of her right index finger

                                     sam
                         what is it

                                     lila
                         it didnt get washed down its 
                         figuring the kind you tear up and 
                         get rid of
                              extending her finger 
                              toward sam
                         some figure has been added to or 
                         subtracted from forty thousand

               sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger studies it 
               takes out his wallet presses the wet scrap to his drivers 
               license shield puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet 
               away

                                     lila
                         thats proof mary was here  it would 
                         be too wild a coincidence for somebody 
                         else to

                                     sam
                              reminding
                         bates never denied mary was here

                                     lila
                              reminded
                         yes
                              a thought
                         but maybe this proves that bates 
                         found out about the money

                                     sam
                         do we simply ask him where hes hidden 
                         it

                                     lila

                         i think she told arbogast something 
                         and i want her to tell us the same 
                         thing

               she starts out of the bathroom sam takes hold of her arm 
               stops her

                                     sam
                         you cant go up there

                                     sam
                         bates

               camera starts to pan away from them moves slowly over the 
               room very slowly

                                     lilas voice os
                         lets find him one of us can keep

                         dont like you going into that house 
                         alone lila

               camera has panned clear across to the opposite wall now and 
               is moving up closer and closer to the tinyflowered wall 
               paper finally closing in on one small rosebud

                                     lilas voice os
                         i can handle a sick old woman

               now we see that the rosebud has been cut out that this is 
               the reverse side of the hole norman peeped through to watch 
               mary and we see the pupil of normans eye now

                                     sams voice os
                         all right ill find bates and keep 
                         him occupied

               the eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before 
               the hole is covered on the other side by the wallhung 
               painting

               fresh angle  lila and sam

               they are about to start out sam stops her again

                                     sam
                         wait a minute if you get anything 
                         out of the mother
                              a thought
                         can you find your way back to town
                              as lila nods yes
                         if you do get anything dont stop 
                         to tell me

               lila nods quickly hurries to the door sam gets to it first 
               opens it a slight crack looks out then opens it wide enough 
               for lila and himself to pass through

               ext the motel  day

               the open door

                                     norman
                         looking for me

                         satisfied with your cabin

               camera angles to include lila and her point of view

               she watches sam disappear into the office waits until she 
               hears the door close then looks about for another way to 
               reach the house she sees the small alley at the end of this

               lila closes the door remains by it for a moment quiet 
               listening her eyes scan the layout the closed door which 
               leads off the hallway to the dining room on the right and 
               the parlor on the left down at the end of the hall is the 
               kitchen the door wide open the room beyond dim and silent 
               she notices the stairs leading down to the basement stares 
               at them then back to the stairs leading to the second floor 
               she starts forward and seems about to investigate the parlor 
               and dining room

               int the motel office  day

               norman is behind the counter standing staring at sam who 
               is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa norman has the look of 
               one who is protecting himself as if the counter were a 
               protective wall against the threatening world across it

                                     sam
                              cheerfully as if 
                              after a selfconscious 
                              pause
                         ive been doing all the talking so 
                         far havent i

                                     norman
                         yes

                                     sam
                         i always thought it was the people 
                         who are alone so much who do all the 
                         talking when they get the chance 
                         yet there you are doing all the 
                         listening
                              a pause
                         you are alone here arent you
                              as norman does not 
                              reply
                         it would drive me crazy

                                     norman
                         that would be a rather extreme 
                         reaction wouldnt it

                                     sam
                              lightly
                         just an expression
                              more seriously
                         what i meant was id do just about 
                         anything to get away  wouldnt 
                         you

               int downstairs hallway and stairs of old house  day

               lila is halfway up the stairs as she climbs she is startled 
               by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps she 
               steps more carefully camera remains at foot of stair tilting 
               up as lila climbs she pauses at the head of the stair the 
               door on her right which opens into the mothers room is 
               closed to her left is another door halfopen directly 
               before her is a third door closed she holds a long moment 
               trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on 
               the front of the house decides chooses the correct door 
               the one on her right she goes to it knocks lightly

               int the mothers room day  close angle on door

               we hear lilas second knock then faintly her soft call

                         mrs bates

               there is quiet for a moment then the door begins to open 
               and we see lila she stands on the threshold looking in at 
               the room instantly disturbed by it almost chilled her 
               expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go 
               away from this room forever

               after a moment she enters leaving the door open behind 
               her camera pulls back and away and we now see the room as 
               lila sees it

               it is ornate damaskandmahogany thick and warm and ripe

               with ashes

               and there is in the room an unmistakably live quality as if 
               even though it is presently unoccupied it has not been long 
               vacated by some musty presence

               lila glances at the bed the damask coverlet is thrown over 
               it but it is not neat there is the imprint of a body on 
               it a body which obviously has slept in a curledup womb
               like position lila stares at it for a moment up then goes 
               to the dressing table its top is scattered with boxes and 
               jars of cosmetics and creams traces of fresh powder an 
               opened bottle or perfume a comb and a brush with traces of 
               hair in its bristles lila moves on catches a glimpse of

               again over the whole room starts out

               lila comes out of the mothers room closes the door behind 
               her looks down the stairs then starts across the hall to 
               the room whose door is halfopen the room within is dark 
               the shades drawn full

               lila pauses on the threshold reaches in feels the wall

                                     norman
                              angrily

                         and now that your mothers dead

               norman snaps a sharp fast ugly look at him

                                     norman
                         my mother is not dead

                              softly
                         i didnt think so

               int normans room in the old house  day

               lila is standing in the doorway staring at the room in sick 
               dismay the room is grotesque a horrible ludicrous fantasy 
               of childhood held beyond the point of decency

               it is a small room the walls are fancied with romping 
               silhouettes of teddybears and sailboats and carousels and 
               fat cows jumping over aghast moons the bed is small far 
               too short for a man of normans height and yet the rumpled 
               covers indicate that it is in this bed that norman sleeps  
               next to the bed is an oldfashioned toy chest on its top 
               there are a birdinacage lamp a plainbound book and an 
               ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs a grown mans 
               shirt hangs on a childs clothes tree

               against one wall there is a narrow high bookcase filled 
               with thick unchildishlooking books on the small white 
               chest of drawers there is an old childs victrola the record 
               on the turntable is discovered on close inspection to be 
               beethovens eroica symphony

               lila studies the room fascinated and repelled she glances 
               at the bookcase comes into the room goes to the bookcase 
               and pulls out a thick large plainbound book she opens 
               it her eyes go wide in shock and then there is disgust 
               she slams the book closed drops it

               int the motel office  day

               norman behind the counter has moved back against the wall 
               sam is still on the other side of the counter but is leaning 
               forward his eyes hard on normans face

               normans face is no longer expressionless it has the stark 
               high sheen of a cornered animal

                                     sam
                              pressing

                         mother

                                     norman
                         shut up

                         that bates or do you already 
                         have it socked away a lot of

                                     norman
                         leave me alone

                                     sam

                                     norman
                         leave me alone

               he is close to panic now he turns swiftly dashes back 
               into his private parlor sam goes quickly around the counter 
               follows

               int normans private parlor  day

               norman hears sam following wants to run to never be reached 
               by this man he crosses the small room drawn to the rear 
               window as if he might fly through it sam enters pauses  
               norman turns back against the window as unable to fly away 
               as are the many still stuffed birds sam registers a brief 
               flicker of reaction when he sees the birds but continues to 
               gaze at norman hard

                                     sam
                         i bet your mother knows where the 
                         money is and what you did to get 
                         it and i think shell tell us

               something selfassured and confident in sams tone gives 
               norman a new more terrified alarm he turns his head glances 
               out the window at the old house he looks back at sam and 
               there is terror in his voice

                                     norman
                         wheres that girl the girl you came 
                         with where is she

               sam does not respond smiles a halfsmile turns to examine 
               a stuffed owl norman looks back at the house

                                     norman
                              a horrible groan
                         oh god

               int upstairs hall of the old house  day

               lila shaken and disturbed almost sickened is coming out 
               of normans room she has left the light on she pauses in 
               the middle of the landing looks at the closed door opposite 
               the stairs goes to it opens it sees that it is the 
               bathroom pulls the door to turns starts toward the stairs

               int normans private parlor  day

               sam is lying on the floor face downward unmoving a 
               candlestick is on the floor close by his head still rocking 
               as if just dropped over shot comes the sound of normans 
               footsteps and camera turns in time to catch a brief glimpse 
               of him going out into the office almost at a run

               int stairway of the old house  day

               lila is on the top step looking down toward camera

               she is listening hoping to hear some human sound some sound 
               she might follow pursue she hears nothing she starts down 
               the stairs just below the halfway step she looks at the 
               front door sees out through the door window

               lilas viewpoint  day

               norman coming

               int stairway of the old house  day

               for a moment lila panics then she hurries down the steps 
               cannot go in the direction of the front door remembers the 
               stairway behind her turns and runs in that direction the 
               sound of norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard 
               lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the 
               basement going down far enough to conceal herself crouching 
               there

               norman enters the hallway closes the door softly listens 
               he glances once in the direction of the basement stairs he 
               seems about to smile when suddenly all expression vanishes 
               from his face and he appears to enter a noplace notime 
               state he crosses to the stairway goes up

               lila remains crouched on the basement stairs listening to 
               the sounds of norman his footsteps on the stairs followed 
               by the fast noises of doors opening of fast moving about an 
               upstairs room convinced that he is searching the upstairs 
               for her she decides to chance an escape she starts up the 
               steps is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is 
               caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement she pauses 
               looks down sees the crack of light coming from behind the 
               not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar the swift moving 
               sounds of norman continue to come from upstairs

               lila is torn knows she should get out of the house while 
               she has the chance is unable to resist the impulse to check 
               that hiddenlooking room down below a room in which she 
               desperately believes there must lie some answer to what 
               happened to mary she turns and goes softly and quickly down 
               the stairs

               int the basement of the old house  day

               lila reaches the bottom stops listens hears the stairboards 
               creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them she 
               turns pulls open the fruit cellar door looks in the woman 
               is sitting in a comfortable chair the back of the chair 
               and the woman turned to the door lila calls a harsh 
               frightened whisper

                                     lila
                         mrs bates

               lila goes into the room

               int the fruit cellar

               lila goes to the chair touches it the touch disturbs the 
               figure it starts to turn slowly stiffly a clockwise 
               movement lila looks at it in horror it is the body of a 
               woman long dead the skin is dry and pulled away from the 
               mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeletons smile  
               the eyes are gone from their sockets the bridge of the nose 
               has collapsed the hair is dry and wild the cheeks are 
               sunken the leatherybrown skin is powdered and rouged and 
               flaky the body is dressed in a highneck clean wellpressed 
               dress obviously recently laundered and handironed

               the movement of this stuffed illpreserved cadaver turning 
               as if in response to lilas call and touch is actually 
               graceful balletlike and the effect is terrible and obscene

               lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment then begins 
               to scream a high piercing dreadful scream

               and lilas scream is joined by another scream a more 
               dreadful horrifying scream which comes from the door behind 
               her

                                     normans voice os

               womans hair he is dressed in a highneck dress which is 
               similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother his hand 
               is raised high poised to strike at lila there is a long 
               breadknife in it

               from the doorway behind grabs normans wrist sam comes 
               through the door still holding tight to the wrist pulling

               screams of norman

                                                               dissolve to

                              then
                         did he confess to

                              interrupting
                         as i said the mother
                              pauses goes on afresh
                         to understand it as i understood it 
                         hearing it from the mother  that 
                         is from the motherhalf of normans 
                         mind you have to go back ten years 
                         to the time when norman murdered his 
                         mother and her lover
                              a pause then as no 
                              one interrupts
                         he was already dangerously disturbed 
                         had been ever since his father died 
                         his mother was a clinging demanding 
                         woman and for years the two of 
                         them lived as if there was no one 
                         else in the world then she met a 
                         man and it seemed to norman she threw 
                         him over for this man that pushed 
                         him over the thin line and he 
                         killed them both matricide is 
                         probably the most unbearable crime 
                         of all and most unbearable to the 
                         son who commit it so he had to erase 
                         the crime at least in his own mind
                              a pause
                         he stole her corpse and a weighted 
                         coffin was buried he hid the body 
                         in the fruit cellar even treated 
                         it to keep it as well as it would 
                         keep and that still wasnt enough 
                         she was there but she was a corpse  
                         so he began to think and speak for 
                         her gave her half his life so to 
                         speak at times he could be both 
                         personalities carry on 
                         conversations at other times the 
                         motherhalf took over completely he 
                         was never all norman but he was 
                         often only mother and because he 
                         was so pathologically jealous of 
                         her he assumed she was as jealous 
                         of him therefore if he felt a strong 
                         attraction to any other woman the 
                         mother side of him would go wild
                              to lila
                         when norman met your sister he was 
                         touched by her and aroused by 
                         her he wanted her and this set off 
                         his jealous mother and  mother 
                         killed the girl after the murder 
                         norman returned as if from a deep 
                         sleep and like a dutiful son 
                         covered up all traces of the crime 
                         he was convinced his mother had 
                         committed

                                     sam
                         why was he dressed like that

                                     district attorney
                         hes a transvestite

                                     simon
                         not exactly a man who dresses in 
                         womans clothing in order to achieve 
                         a sexual change or satisfaction 
                         is a transvestite  but in normans 
                         case he was simply doing everything 
                         possible to keep alive the illusion 
                         of his mother being alive and 
                         whenever reality came too close 
                         when danger or desire threatened 
                         that illusion hed dress up even 
                         to a cheap wig he brought and hed 
                         walk about the house sit in her 
                         chair speak in her voice he tried 
                         to be his mother
                              a sad smile
                         and now he is
                              a pause
                         thats what i meant when i said i 
                         got the story from the mother she 
                         thinks norman has been taken away 
                         because of his crimes  she insists 
                         she did nothing that norman committed 
                         all the murders just to keep her 
                         from being discovered she even smiled 
                         a bit coquettishly as she said that 
                         of course she feels badly about 
                         it but also somewhat relieved to 
                         be as she put it free of norman 
                         at last
                              a pause
                         when the mind houses two 
                         personalities there is always a 
                         battle in normans case the battle 
                         is over and the dominant 
                         personality has won

               lila begins to weep softly for mary for arbogast for 
               norman for all the destroyed human beings of this world 
               sam bends beside her puts his arm about her comforts her

                         passion not profit

               a police guard puts his head in the door speaks in a near
               whisper to the chief of police the guard is carrying a 
               folded blanket over his arm

                                     police guard
                         he feels a little chill can i 
                         bring him this blanket

               the chief of police nods the guard goes away and camera 
               follows him out of the room and out into the hallway guard 
               moves through the waiting men heading down the corridor

                                                                    cut to

               glass a guard in uniform is posted by the door looking 
               reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance 
               into the room

               the police guard carrying the blanket comes down this 
               corridor goes to the door camera moves close the uniformed 
               guard opens the door allows the man to go in

               shot is raked so that we can not see into the room

               after a moment the guard comes out and the uniformed guard 
               closes and locks the door and we

                                                                    cut to

               the walls are white and plain there is no window

               there is no furniture except the straightback chair in which 
               norman sits in the center of the room the room has a quality 
               of nowhereness of calm separation from the world

               the police guard has placed the blanket on normans knees 
               norman as we come upon him is lifting the blanket unfolding 
               it his face although without makeup and without the 
               surrounding softness of the wig has a certain femininity 
               about it a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch 
               womanliness about the brows

               calmly norman places the blanket about his shoulders as if 
               it were a cashmere shawl camera remains in a position so 
               that our view of norman is a full one when the shawl is in 
               position and norman is settled we hear over shot the 
               voice of his mother coming from the calm of his thoughts

                                     mothers voice os
                         its sad when a mother has to 
                         speak the words that condemn her own 
                         son but i couldnt allow them to 
                         believe that i would commit murder
                              a pause
                         theyll put him away now as i 
                         should have years ago he was 
                         always bad and in the end he 
                         intended to tell them i killed those 
                         girls and that man as if i could 
                         do anything except just sit and 
                         stare like one of his stuffed 
                         birds
                              a pause
                         well they know i cant even move a 
                         finger and i wont ill just sit 
                         here and be quiet just in case they 
                         do suspect me

               a fly buzzes close and then continues buzzing and flying 
               about normans face

                                     mothers voice vo
                         theyre probably watching me  well 
                         let them let them see what kind of 
                         a person i am
                              a pause as the fly 
                              lights on normans 
                              hand
                         im not going to swat that fly i 
                         hope they are watching theyll see 
                         theyll see and theyll know 
                         and theyll say why she wouldnt 
                         even harm a fly

               norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing

                                        scene begins to dissolve slowly to

               the swamp

               as end titles fade in we see the swamp the chain of a tow
               truck the chain is attached to marys car the car is coming 
               out of the swamp

                                                                   fade out

                                         the end
