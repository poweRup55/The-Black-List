                                            cut to

int warehouse  early morning

camera steadicam holds on a man in a suit sitting behind
a desk on the phone barry egan adam sandler

                         barry
            yes im still on hold

                         operator
            and what was this

                         barry
            im looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway

                         operator
            this is fly with us

                         barry
            its hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but i cant
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because theres actually
            nothing to add it too

                         operator
            i think thats a typeo then that
            would be a mistake

                         barry
            so just to clarify im sorry ten
            purchases of any of your healthy
            choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles 

                         operator
            thats it

                         barry
            do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases

                         operator
            i dont knowi mean i dont know

oc distant sound of a car skidding to a stop some vague
distant screaming is heardthen silence barry hears this
gets distracted then back to the phone call

                         barry
            can i call you back if i have any
            further questions can i get
            your extension

                         operator
            its extension 215 if you want to
            try me back

                         barry

for a momentthen it drives offthen

a speeding small toyota comes into view at the mouth of the
alley screeching to a halt the passenger side door opens
and a small wooden harmonium like a portable organ is
placed on the ground the toyota speeds away

a moment or two later another nondescript car flies
past very fast

beat barry squints looks at the small harmonium sitting
alone in the middle of the street

he hesitates looks around holds then walks back inside

                         barry
            thats nice its nice
                   beat
            ive been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways
            cross promotional work by some
            companies do you remember all that
            pudding

                         lena
            yeah

                         barry
            so that pudding was bought i
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion thats
            sponsored by healthy choice and
            american airlines its designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying healthy choice products
            they make frozen meals deli meats
            pasta sauce breads soups and ice
            creams this sort of thing

                         lena
            yeah

                         barry
            im sorryi lost my
            thoughts what i was saying

                         lena
            you were talking about the
            promotion 

                         barry
             the promotion says buy any 10
            healthy choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon so in the supermarket you
            notice their products first you
            notice they have a teriyaki chicken
            dinner at 179  thats a pretty
            good dealbut then i noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            canand you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            its a really amazing deal because
            i stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label
            thats those little bar codes you
            know the universal product codes

                         lena
            yeah

                         barry
