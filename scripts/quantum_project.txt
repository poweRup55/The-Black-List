            and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve  passing the
            eye socket they speed toward a silky curvilinear membrane the
            retina on which we see an image projected

            an upside down computer screen

            neurons ping into the membrane the picture suddenly flips right side
            up and we follow the light flashing in a blur through the iris and
            cornea until exiting the eye we reverse pov and

            pentcho slogs down the wharf  running from it  looking for it 
            past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows  he snaps
            his head back over his shoulder sees an old woman playing  the
            accordian  she stops  her eyes bore in on his own 

                                old woman

            a pink neon heart

            blinking above a tatto parlor  his eyes lock on see the heart 

            glowing bigger and bigger 

            its electric pulse mimicing the beating of a real organ  

            closer still  on pentcho

            running from it  looking for it  he stops dead in his tracks tries
            one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality

            he snaps his head back over his shoulder

            and we see him making the same move from four different camera
            angles from his left his right from the top of his head and
            looking up from ground zero as 

            he finally wins the draw

            only the flood is laughter that starts deep in his belly as a
            giggle then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous
            guffaws  the sound rocks the house  pentchos smile is a mile wide 
            his eyes sparkle then tear up as the

            and train its phosphorescent glow on

            mia  extreme close up

            the point of light reflecting out of her pupils  pentchos voice
            speaks from nowhere sonorous and packed with reverb

                                pentchos voice
                      what do you want

            mia blinks again  the beam is gone  she looks over at will
            oblivious checking his watch 

            back on mia

            the understanding flooding her eyes as 

            she snaps her head back just like pentcho the gunfighter

            and we see her making her move from four different camera angles
            from her left right up above and from the back seat of the car as
            the rumble of a megaearthquake whooshes by

            pov mia the bridge the cars the bay

            all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but         

            the void  nothingness  nada   crash

     60     int  the durango slamming into the car ahead  night 60

            triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fishtailing across the
            bridge  in quick succession come a stream of images

            the pearls colliding

            mia and will exchanging a look

            traffic halting on the bridge

            will getting scorched by the man they plowed into

            mia exiting her side looking back behind her

            pentcho ditching his beetle ten car lengths south

            he runs forward straight down the path of a tunnellike headlight
            beam  

            mia picks up speed churning from the other direction  

            pull back from the bridge

            as the two of them move toward the same point  suddenly tiny sparks
            of light glow and jump from portions of the bridge cable

            slow motion pentcho and mia

            gliding still closer  a voice sounds

                                voice
                      impact

            their bodies connect arms intertwine lips touch lips

            pull back  higher

            its like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape

            lighting the entire electromagnetic spectrum

            every cell line radio wave satellite feed fiberoptic cable all
            stretching in every possible direction 

            from bridge to sea to sky

            pulsing outward into a spidery network of

            glowing interconnectedness 

                                     the end
