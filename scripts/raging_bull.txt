               shadows at 42 hes overweight and out of shape but the 
               balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on 
               canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short bursts 
               of light he is rehearsing a nightclub monologue

                                     jake

               staggers forward  like a bull the bell sounds

               battered jake slumps on the stool in his corner

               its september 1941 europe and asia are already at war  
               young soldiers freshly recruited dot the hostile audience  
               each screaming at the fighters in the ring

               suddenly words are exchanged a girl screams and a soldier 
               and a civilian stand and start swinging

               and in the ring jake lamotta takes a swig of water and spits 
               blood into the bucket his younger brother joey holds for 
               him tony his trainer works the cuts

                                     joey

               the bell sounds for the tenth jake pulls himself up and 
               charges at reeves

               reeves slides away jabbing punching piling up points

               in jakes corner joey stands and yells at jake

                                     joey

                         on this jake a fucking grand

               jake suddenly corners reeves and unleashes a desperate wild 
               alleyfighting attack one ferocious punch after another

               the spectators go wild everyones up for the kill

               the gamblers call out new odds ten to one for reeves the 
               underdog joey excited sees that time is running out and 
               steps in front of the bell he swings his arms pretending 
               not to realize he literally holds back the timers arm for a 
               few seconds this gives jake more time for a knockout  but 
               not enough joey is pushed back and the bell rings at the 
               count of nine ending the match

               boos and cheers the bettors scramble back to the bookie to 
               get their money

               jake dances around the ring kissing his gloves and thrusting 
               them toward the crowd joey rushes out and hugs him

               lift him off the canvas  still out cold two attendants 
               bring in a stretcher

               fans go crazy cheering ripping chairs out fighting with 
               the cops throwing bottles and junk into the ring people go

               bruises and bandages he combs his hair

               we hear the beginning of an early frank sinatra song this 
               song carries over onto the following montage

               montage

               this montage covers the period between 1943 and early 1947  
               it shows jake hard at work fighting all the tough guys he 
               can each of the fights will be introduced by the 
               corresponding title card from the big fights film showing 
               a boxing glove with the fighters names and the places of 
               the fights superimposed on it the actual fight images will 
               be black and white newspaper photos jump cut together to 
               simulate real action for example in still 1 jake is about 
               to land a punch on an opponent

                                                                    cut to

               still 2 and the punch lands distorting the opponents 
               face sweat spraying out everywhere live sound effects 
               accompany these stills

               the fight stills are intercut with 16mm black and white home

               int madison square garden  night nov 14 1947

               the old garden is packed the exchamps the press the 
               officials the mob guys the fans  theyre all here

               the fighters are announced billy fox and jake touch gloves 
               and return to their corners

               fox is taller and has a longer reach than jake

               the bell sounds and the fighters come out fox goes to the 
               head jake goes to the body

               fox lands a solid blow to jakes jaw but lamotta is unfazed  
               fox is surprised in the past his opponents have gone down 
               when he connected

               in the audience como salvy and some other boys watch with 
               interest

               jake moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows

               all of a sudden fox is wobbly jake goes for the head then 
               cuts his punch short fox is about to go down

               jake throws his arms around fox to make sure he doesnt fall

                                     jake
                              to fox
                         stand up what the fuck are you doin

               the referee breaks them apart and fox remounts his attack

               jake bicycles into a corner and lets fox work him over

               fox connects once twice three times jake barely defends 
               himself  but he doesnt go down either

               the crowd starts to smell a fix there are calls from the 
               audience

                                     crowd
                         got your swimming trunks on jake i

               jakes corner jake is acting stunned tony not aware of 
               whats going on is slapping jake

                                     tony

               the sign reads round four jake is in the center of the 
               ring taking a relentless pasting from fox jakes arms hang 
               at waist level fox lands one blow after another the stink 
               of a fix permeates the arena

               jake is furious that fox cant deck him he curses through 
               his mouthpiece as he absorbs blow after blow

                                     jake
                         hit me hit me whats the matter 
                         with you you motherfucker hit me

               boos and catcalls echo through the garden this is not even 
               a fight the referee realizing this steps in between fox 
               and lamotta waves his arms and signals that fox is the winner 
               by a technical knockout

               as he does jake spits his mouthpiece in disgust at fox and 
               struts back to his corner

               jake joey and tony are already on their way out of the 
               arena as the referee declares fox the winner

               como and the others satisfied get up to leave

               int jakes dressing room  madison square garden  night

               as a reporter and a photographer come through the door we 
               see and hear a commotion in the hall behind them they rush 
               in look and stop by the door there is silence  except 
               for jakes uncontrollable sobbing the atmosphere is like 
               that of funeral

               jake is seated behind the rubbing table he is still in his 
               leopardskin robe his head hangs low as he sobs

               the photographer snaps a picture the handler motions to him 
               to stop and then goes and sits near the door the reporter 
               still stands near the doorway seeming quite stunned by the 
               scene he is witnessing but nevertheless continuing to 
               scribble away on his pad

               joey standing near jake has his back to everyone his 
               shoulders are shaking his lips are tightly drawn he cries 
               soundlessly tony is pacing nearby

                                     tony
                         dont fight anymore

                              between sobs
                         why did they have to stop it why 
                         did they have to stop it

               the reporter leans over to the handler and whispers

                                     reporter
                         what happened

                                     handler
                              quietly
                         he mustve been really hurt in the 
                         2nd he didnt answer me when i tried 
                         to tell him something in the corner

                         both these stones are worth about 
                         fifteen hundred dollars but the 
                         belt of a champion is a very rare 
                         item the belt with the stones 
                         untouched would have been worth near

               his breath comes in quick gasps his feet pop up and down 
               like they were on canvas his tiny fists jerk forward with 
               short bursts of light

               still alive still a contender a 42yearold man fighting 
               for his shot

               the camera dollies into a full shot of his fists as they hit 
               the empty air  in and out of the frame

               this quote appears music in

               verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again 
               he can not enter into the kingdom of heaven

                john 33

               the camera goes into darkness

               the end credits roll up

                                         the end
