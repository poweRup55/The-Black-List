helen crunch moose goon chick cookie mil all
       searching for recognition in the only way available
       to them all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at
       home all creating an outside world of chaos in order
       to bear the chaos they feel inside  they are
       soldiers in search of an enemy

fade in

a deep night sky  matte shot  camera searches slowly
upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is
heard sounding the strokes of midnight

on the final note of the bell camera is full on the milky
way and there it rests just long enough for a burst of
easter singing to arise  the hymn is sung by the crude
unmatched voices of children  camera pans down to include

spire of a church  camera continues its downward pan as the
singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the
source of the singing  camera pans off window to show

long shot  city  night  suddenly revealedcrisp and
sparkling with lights  camera pans down and over

a lonely street full of parked cars  the singing diminishes
but a thread of it remains  a car has just parked  the
headlights snap off  a man emerges whistling the same
melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat  he slams
the door and starts down the street in the direction of a
house with bright windows  he must pass an empty lot full
of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two
street lights

as the man walks by the lot still whistling a group of
figures rises silently from the grass figures who have been
lying in concealment until now  they step noiselessly onto
the pavement and follow the man  at the sound of their
boots the whistling stops

the man glances behind him and sees the figures walking
after him filling the pavement  a street light shows them
to be boys and girls and all quite young  the man moves on
more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases  he
begins to run toward the lighted house and the following
steps run too  suddenly he stops under the next street
light and turns to face the figures  they are upon him and
around him quickly  nobody speaks for a moment then one of
the boys grins  his name is buzz  he is big and filled
with an awareness of his own masculinity

                         buzz
                   friendly cool
            that was pretty what you were
            whistling  whistle some more

the man whistles a nervous phrase trying to make a joke of
the situation which he doesnt understand

                         buzz
                   continuing suddenly
            you got a cigarette

                         man
            oh i think so

the man fumbles in his pocket finds a pack and drops it in
his nervousness  the figures wait until he picks it up  he
offers one to buzz

                         man
                   continuing
            filter tips

                         buzz
                   smiling encouraging
            you smoke it  smoke it dad

smiling uncertainly the man puts the cigarette in his mouth
buzz still smiling takes out a packet of wooden matches

                         buzz
                   continuing
            ill light it for you dad

buzz ignites a match and holds it near the mans face for a
second searching it  then he ignites the whole box under
his nose  the man shrieks and his packages fall  buzz
slaps him sharply his smile gone

the camera pans away as the figures enclose him and holds
on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its
wrappings  it begins to dance madly on the pavement then
runs down

the feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey
then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared
there is a moment of awful stillness then we see a boy
coming down the street alone  he is quite drunk and he
slips once  this is jim a goodlooking kid of seventeen
with a crewcut and wearing a good suit  the spilled
packages on the pavement stop him  he bends down to see
what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the
wreckage  he smiles and winds it up  he sets it on the
sidewalk and sits down  he watches it dance for a moment
happily  a siren is heard distantly growing louder  jim
pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and
releases it for its dance

superimpose title rebel without a cause starring  as
siren rises piercingly close and jim looks up we

                                            dissolve to

close shot  throbbing light of police car  night  the
siren screaming wildly then dying  the sound of brakes
camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the
entrance of a precinct station  two officers dismount
bearing between them the struggling jim  they bear him up
the steps and in through the double doors

inside precinct station reception area  a large open space
onto which several corridors converge  in the middle is a
sergeants desk really a quadrangular counter in the center
of which the sergeant stands  there are a few glasswalked
interviewing rooms which open off the area and several
benches lining the walls  the scene is one of confusion
activity and waiting  phones ring  the arrested pass in
custody of officers  present among others at jims entrance
are judy who is blonde and sixteen  she sits on a crowded
bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness  on a
bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty
little mexican children without shoes or socks  the oldest
is a boy of four who is protecting his little sister who in
turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her
standing at a corner of the desk is a docile undersized boy
of fifteen named john plato crawford  he is shivering
with him is a large negro woman his maid  jim comes
through the doors and is led to the desk  one of the
officers presents a brief report to the sergeant who
examines it

            mixed up in that beating on twelfth

            young squirt  all rightyou want
            to lean him against something
            stand him over there

the officer leads jim to judys bench and stands him against
the wall beside it

jim is frisked a look of prayer on his upturned face  the
officer finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take
it but when jim asks to keep it the officer hands it back
and moves away  another officer enters and leads the
prisoner who is sitting next to judy into another room  jim
sits beside her  he smiles at her but receives only a
chilling look  he winds the monkey up and sets it dancing
on the floor but she is not amused  camera pans to show
others reacting to the monkey with pleasure  we see plato
look up and smile a little  camera stops on the mexican
children who are smiling too  a bald juvenile officer named
gene squats before them smiling

                         gene

the little boy shakes his head

gene laughs as another juvenile officer enters and pauses to
look at the children  his name is ray

other office  jim his parents grandma and ray are
gathered in the small room  jim is humming the ride of the
valkryies to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in
what is happening around him  ray suspects this is
something more than mere disinterest so lets the humming go
on in order to discover its real purpose  grandma watches
everything like a tennis match reacting with soft little
sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy  no one pays
any attention to her  for a moment no one talks  ray
watches jim as he hums  then the father shakes his head and
looks up

                         father

            taking a little drink

                         ray

jim grins at ray who nods  they all leave  ray looking
after them shakes his head and lights a cigarette  we see
jim and his family pass through the main door  waiting to
enter in the custody of some uniformed police are buzz and
the kids we saw at the opening sullen and truculent  as
they march into the lobby and jim grows smaller in the
distance the music comes up and out

                                            fade out

fade in

low angle  alley  morning  a rabbit comes running down
the alley followed by a group of young kids screaming with
pleasure

as camera pans with the group the littlest a boy of five
stops near us looking after the disappearing group  the
shouts of the children wane

judy rushes out from a backyard beyond him  she is carrying
school books and a bag lunch  she wears a polo coat against
the winter wind

                         judy
                   yelling
            beau

the boy who is her brother beau looks up but doesnt move
judy stops at her gate  a car careens down the alley past
him

long shot  judy and beau seen through a window in jims
house  jim is in fg looking out through the curtains  he
smiles

                         judy
                   yelling
            what are you trying to do get
            yourself killed

                         beau

father  he is neatly dressed in his business suit but wears
a mary petty apron

                         father

jim leans against the wall shaking his head and trying not
to laugh  the father laughs unhappily trying to make it
all seem a joke

jim touches his fathers elbow bringing him to his feet
they look at each other a moment then jim goes to his
bedroom  the father goes back to mopping up the mess

inside jims room as he comes in shuts the door and throws
himself miserably on his bed  he writhes as if the pain he
feels were physical  outside radios are heard in the
nighttuned to different stations  he feels under his
jacket and holds up his hand to the moonlight  there is
blood on it  he reaches up and takes his alarm clock and is
setting it as camera glides to his window and holds over the
rooftops

full shot  judys backyard  moonlight  judy stands near
camera looking up at the moon  the radios seem louder out
here  one breaks through

appealing about him

                         judys father
                   singing lightly
            man in the moon how came you

is adoring

                         judy
                   astonished
            how did you know that

                         judys father
            we used to sing it in school

                         judy
            good evening

                         judys father
            hi

he turns away and goes into the house  she hesitates and
then follows  something in the moods has changed  he has
neglected to hold the door for her

dining room  judys house as the father comes to the head
of the table and takes his seat  three places are set
judy follows  she stands above his chair looking down at
him as he drinks his tomato juice

                         judy
                   quietly afraid
            didnt you forget something

                         judys father
            what

judy doesnt answer but leans down and kisses him quickly
on the lips

                         judys father
                   continuing shocked
            whats the matter with you

judy freezes frightened  he collects himself a little

                         judys father
                   continuing
            youre too old for that kind of
            stuff kiddo  i thought you
            stopped doing that long ago

                         judy
                   very hurt
            i didnt want to stop

the mother enters briskly from another part of the housean
attractive brittle woman of thirtyfive

                         judys mother
            didnt want to stop what

                         judys father
            nothing

                         judy

                         judys father
            i didnt kiss her so its a big thing

                         judys mother
                   calling to kitchen
            bertha  you can serve the souffle
                   to father

                   to judy
            you dont have to stand there
            darling  drink your tomato juice

judy slides into her chair reluctantly and unfolds her napkin

                         judy
            i guess i just dont understand
            anything

                         judys father
            im tired judy  id like to

                         judy

            an explanation

                         judy
                   very low
            girls dont love their father
            since when  since i got to be
            sixteen

she halfrises to kiss him again

                         judys father
            stop it now  sit down

suddenly the father slaps her  even as he does it he is as
stunned as judy  the mother stops eating  she has never
seen such a display and is shocked  he tries to control
himself by buttering a piece of bread  there is a terrible
silence into which beau enters in his pajamas  he runs to
his fathers chair then haltslooking from face to face
the father puts an arm around him hugs him almost savagely

                         judys father
                   thickly
            hi rascal

                         beau
                   hushed

judy rises weeping

                         judy
            may i please be excused

she starts out  the father rises and follows after her

                         judys father
                   softly
            hey hey glamorpuss  im sorry

she leaves the room interrupting the joke he was going to
make  he turns back to the table and sits down  the mother
rises and comes to him

                         judys father
                   continuing
            i dont know what to do  all of a
            sudden shes a problem

the mother stands behind his chair  she tips his head back
against her body and kneads his neck and shoulders

                         judys mother
            shell outgrow it dear  its just
            the age

                         beau
                   in a sudden burst
            the atomic age

the door slams

                         judys mother
                   kissing her
                   husbands hair
            its the age when nothing fits

inside jims room  we see him lying on his bed as before
his eyes are open  the alarm clock goes off  jim starts as
if shot then stops the wild ringing  the time is seven
fortyfive  he makes no move to leave the bed  there is a
light tap on the door then it opens and the father is
there seen in light from the hall and still wearing the apron

                         father

            a man

the plateau  moonlight  wind shrieks over the exposed
plateau which is several hundred yards long  it cuts into
the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air
a dozen cars are scattered about defining a sort of runway
in the center  there are twenty kids present but very
little talk  most of them belong to buzzs group but there
are a few whom we have not met before  they stand in small
clots murmuring and smoking  the atmosphere is strung
tightly like the moments before a dawn attack  in bg
near the cliffs edge are two cars of similar make and
model  they face away from camera toward the edge of the
plateau  there are no headlights anywhereblackout
conditions

stands guard between the cars his back to us  his hands
are on his hips  his legs are spread  some girls drift in

reading glasses looks up at the slam  then she looks over
at her husband shrugs when she catches his gaze and goes
back to her magazine

inside jims living room  the television is on but only a
hum comes from it and the screen is a flickering gray  the
father sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace still
dressed but with his collar open  the sound of jims step
in the dining room makes him open his eyes  fear of facing
his son makes him shut them again  the boy comes in a
bottle of milk in his hand  seeing his father there he
stops shorthis impulse is to flee  instead he comes in
and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids fluttering
in the fathers masquerade of sleep make him seem to be
having a dream  jim is torn between his desire to leave and
his need to speak  he turns off the television quietly
then lies down on the couch across the way  he mumbles the
things he would say to his father and the answers he feels
he would get  the old man opens his eyes once sees the boy
there head banging upside down from the couch  then he
shuts them again

upside down long shot  room jims viewpoint  suddenly
inverted in his vision the mother appears at the head of
the stairs in bathrobe and nightgown  she pauses a moment
then runs down crying

split screen montage  it begins with a telephone ringing
alone in the corner of the screen  as camera moves back we
see that the phone is in an office at juvenile hall  ray is
standing by trying to make sense out of the incoming reports

the other part of the screen lights up and becomes

bedroom of platos mother where the negro woman is speaking
hysterically into the phone

bedroom of judys parents  the father is on the phone
beau has awakened and is crying  his mother tries to divert
him

jims bedroom  jims father sits disconsolately on the bed
the phone in his hand  he is talking earnestly

during this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased
to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a
deep rising riot of sirens whose wail mounts higher and
higher until

                                            dissolve to

full shot  planetarium  moonlight  a lone siren wails in
distance  aside from this all is very still  camera pans
past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on
a hill nearby  stone balustrades drop down to sunken
gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless
fountain

large domed solarium which is connected to the main building
by a low enclosed arcade  a crash and the falling of
splintered glass is heard

two figures seen in the distance are disappearing through
a window  camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a
broken window through which jim is just disappearing  when

which has been spread on the sill to protect them from
splinters shakes it out and puts it on  running footsteps

plato leads them away from us down the arcade the candelabra
casting wild shadows on the walls  they are laughing as
they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their
laughter echoes stonily

                                            dissolve to

inside glass solarium  a swimming pool lies at the center
there is no water in it  framing the pool is a flagstone
walk with marble benches spotted here and there  the great
glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical
foliage

but now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead
with lack of care  at the edge of the pool near the deep
end a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon
it  in its mysterious light our three kids are revealed
jim bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board
judy on the blanket nearby plato on the pools bottom  all
three are laughing hysterically when suddenly jim starts to
lose his balance

            quick  fill the pool

                   gargling

plato follows

                         plato

            splitting

                         jim

hair and smiles at him  plato looks away

                         jim
            no  seriously  whats your trouble

plato hesitates a moment then leans back cuddling between
the two of them

jims lips with a finger  he snaps at it  then he kisses
her hand looks at her palm  they whisper

she looks at plato  jim shrugstests to see if the boy is
awake but there is no reaction

carefully they crawl to their feet  jim supporting platos
head with his hands as they do so  jim takes the other
blanket and covers plato with it  judy kneels on the other
side and tucks it in  they look at each other across him
and smile  then suddenly judy bends down and kisses platos
cheek very softly  judy and jim rise
jim takes a candle from the candelabra and leads judy along
the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond  silence
except for their footfalls on the flagstone  in the
distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through
when they close again a sob comes from plato

high angle closeup  plato lying as they left him but his
eyes are open and he is crying  camera booms up as plato
throws off the blanket and looks after them  camera booms
higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure
sitting by himself  the pool echoes his weeping

                                            dissolve to

inside library  mansion  night  the door opens slowly and
jim appears with the candle  judy lingers at the door  the
flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room paneled in
oak  there is a tapestry couch empty bookcases some dim
portraits a leather table and several chairs around a great
stone fireplace

sticks the candle on it  his hand shakes  judy sits on the
couch

they make to scare him  suddenly plato sees an opening and

            i think i know my son

the father moves behind the crowd camera trucking with him
until he reaches the bushes at the edge of the parking lot
and stops gathering himself  meanwhile rays voice
continues over

                         ray os

            come outside  nobody will hurt you
            if you do as i say

the father starts forward along the bushes as if stalking
game  each step is carefully placed and quiet but his
heart tugs him along like a kite dragging an anchor

                         chief
            officers  another boy and girl
            just ran into the planetarium  we
            do not know if they are armed
            hold your positions until further
            instruction

inside planetarium as jim comes dashing in spins around
staring  judy follows  a siren is heard outside growing
shrill

theater  judy hangs back  another siren is heard
approaching  more floodlights strike the door

                         jim

from the door where jim stands in silhouette  he lets the
door close  blackness

another siren is heard outside  jim has reached the
lecturers desk and just as the match goes out he throws a
switch  the stars appear on the dome and the projector
starts its slow revolution

jim approaches slowly
