                         dont do it rudy

               the bus engine starts up in the seat beside rudy an excon 
               makes out with his wife while his bratty kid punches his 
               leg

               out the window the young woman is scanning the bus windows

               the young woman watches the bus pull away down the snowy 
               road but it doesnt get fifty feet before it suddenly stops

               the door opens and rudy steps out

               the bus revs up again and groans off into the winter

               the young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes we 
               get a look at her face for the first time skin pale lips 
               turning blue but its the girl from the pictures its

               obscuring him until hes right in front of her both of them 
               shivering both of them standing there

               little white guy with a snarl they go crashing onto the 
               bed grappling for leverage and then to the floor 

                where rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries 
               and bashes it backwards shattering it over pugs head

               pug lets go as rudy scrambles up and merlins got him again 
               in a bear hug rudys struggling whirling with him crashing 
               into one wall then another yelling for help

                         heyyy in here heyyy

                until he hears the pumpload snap of a shotgun

               rudy stops still a lamp clicks on

               standing in silhouette a figure in a leather duster holds a 
               sawedoff on him

               behind merlin stands a fourth intruder a stonefaced indian

                         the problem with prison is that

                         through punishment a society cant 
                         hope to create a changed man by 
                         surrounding him with the worst in 
                         his fellow man what it 
                         rehabilitates is solely a conviction 
                         that if he can survive the inhumanity 
                         of prison what then can he not 
                         withstand he has seen mans darkest 
                         soul and kept his sight what is 
                         left for such a man what faith 
                         what fear

                         stimulate growth and prosperity for

                         taking the fifty percent model a 
                         christmas two would grow this

               floors the gas racing right for rudy

               rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside a steep wooded 
               slope cradling a meadow and frozen river 

                                     ashley

                as the nova just misses rudy who dives off the road 
               hits the slope and tumbles headoverheels toward its bottom 
               a hundred feet down kicking up geysers of snow

               at the slopes bottom

               rudy pops to his feet a dazed snowball

               back up at the road

               gabriel grabs a rifle from the nova steps to the slopetop 
               edge and takes aim

               sending the both of them tumbling down the slope sliding 
               and tangled the rifle flying from gabriels grasp 

               to the bottom

                where they come to a tangled snowy halt gabriel struggles 
               to clear the ice from his face 

                as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw

                                     rudy

               the two of them scramble away from the woods rudy with the 
               rifle toward the meadow and its frozen pond

               more gunshots ring as merlin jumpy and pug slide their way

               he grips her hand tighter as shots crash into the ice at 
               their feet suddenly the ground splinters and gives way 

                and ashley goes plummeting through to the river she 
               vanishes from sight in an instant

               rudy scrambles back onto sturdy ice he stares stunned at 
               the ripples in the freezing water

               ashleys not coming up

               rudy

               but he cant run cursing himself he grips the rifle tightly 
               and leaps into the icehole 

               ext river beneath the ice

                plummeting underwater the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles he writhes spinning around

               the ice above her strength giving out

               panicked clawing at the ice both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening

               with ashley safely in hand rudy raises his riflearm 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them 

                and fires a hole blasts a shaft of light into the gray
               blue rudy fires again another hole caves in ashley reaches 
               for a sheath of ice splashing

               behind them gabriel and jumpy file into the biergarten 
               leading rudy and ashley to the booth meeting commenced

               rudy battered and freezerburnt gets shoved in first 
               gabriel throws down the casino map

                                     gabriel

               for the first time hes giving the orders

                                     rudy
                         what you gotta worry about first is 
                         the guards place doesnt look much 
                         richer than when i worked there so 
                         lets figure youre gonna have to 
                         deal with ten of em therell be 
                         two on the floor walking the room 
                         that leaves eight up above eyes in 
                         the sky they see something up 
                         theyre the ones wholl hit the silent 
                         alarm and youre fucked

                                     merlin
                         how do we take them out

                                     rudy
                         you gotta get someone upstairs

                                     merlin
                         how do we do that

               rudy takes the map points to the gaming tables area

                                     rudy
                         across from blackjack theres a 
                         security doorway keypad access

                                     gabriel
                         whats the code

                                     rudy
                         uh they change it every month i 
                         wouldnt know
                              beat
                         if theres trouble on the floor 
                         youll get security coming through 
                         what you gotta do is get inside 
                         that doorway once they do you gotta 
                         draw em out

                                     pug
                         without having them hit the alarms

                                     rudy
                         i got an idea on that one once youre 
                         up there you gotta hold those guards 
                         down till some backup can get there 
                         theres a security camera room that 
                         videotapes everything youve gotta 
                         destroy every last one of those tapes

                                     merlin
                         what about the money

                                     rudy

                         behind the cage you hit the count

                         another code cashiersll know it 
                         theyll have alarms

                                     jumpy
                         what about the powwow safe

                                     rudy

                         remember that after all this is

               she searches his eyes not quite understanding but smiles 
               rudy smiles back nods toward the door ashley slips out

               when shes gone rudy stands and turns to the window outside 
               the blazer with the ice fishermen do it all year long bumper 
               sticker still sits parked

               rudy reaches for his jeans pocket and pulls outone of the 
               game room darts flecked with blood

               he gives it a solemn stare

               int rudys room  moments lter  night

               rudy lies on his back under the bed frame dart in hand he 
               tears off the plastic feathering to get at the crossshaped 
               end furthestfrom the tip four protruding metal edges

               he finds the phillips screws on the bedframe and tries to 
               work the dartend into the grooves it scrapes and jags but 
               with pressure hes able to do a quarterturn at a time

               the screw starts spiraling out

               angle on bedframe

               as two metal pieces split apart and rudy wriggles his ankle 
               handcuff off the frame

               angle on closet

               as rudys hand grabs a papercovered wire hanger and rips 
               the paper off untwisting the wire

               angle on rooms window

               as rudy slides it open and climbs outside

               ext knights inn parking lot  night

               light snow falling rudy drops from the second floor window 
               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space he 
               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermens blazer

               at the fishermens blazer

               rudy peers in the windows spotting fishing rods tackle and 
               gear boxes in the back seat

               he takes his wire coat hanger now stretched straight and 
               slips it between the drivers window and moulding jamming 
               it around until it trips the door lock

               the lock pops up rudy pops in 

               int blazer

                and raids the gear box bait reels fishing wire boning 
               knives a compass a first aid kit a switchblade

                         be keeping a gun

               pork rinds another gear box nothing

               some headlights sweep past the blazer rudy ducks down 
               pockets the switchblade munches some pork rinds

               ext parking lot

               rudy scrambles out heads to try another car a pickup truck 
               and then suddenly drops to the ground seeing

               merlin and jumpy

               stride outside talking casually kicking snow on their way 
               toward the nova voices too low to hear

               on scene

               rudy crouches behind the pickup slips around the other side  
               merlin and jumpy walk right by him

               rudy crisscrosses through the parking lot hidden by cars 
               heading away from his rooms window his window rudy glances 
               back to see if the truckers notice that but they dont seem 
               to they stand at the nova talking

               rudy shivers waiting theyre not leaving when their backs 
               turn rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building 
               he slips around the corner out of sight

               around the side of the hotel

               rudy hops through snowdrifts pressed to the wall moving 
               toward a side entry 

                when he stops hearing a womans laughter

               above his head are a row of windows reflections of rippling 
               water on the ceiling inside its the hotel pool behind this 
               wall

               sounds of splashes murmured voices

               rudy stands absolutely still his breaths stop frosting 
               because his breathing has stopped

               int halllway to indoor pool  night

               rudy creeps down the darkened hall past a sign that reads 
               pool closed open 9 am to 9 pm no lifeguard on duty

               rudy steps closer back to a wall standing in shadow the 
               small pool becomes visible flickering blue water from an 
               unseen end a figure splashes backwards into view 

               its ashley hair wet naked beneath the surface smiling 
               and splashing someone offscreen 

                                     ashley

                         all

               she splashes again taunting 

                                     ashley

               int first floor hallway  night

               rudy strides a corridor eyes dead ahead passing a stairwell 
               on his way toward the exit sign posted above a door hes 
               almost there marching fast 

                                     rudy

               merlin trudges upward while rudy steps from hiding one flight 
               down

               checks the hall for jumpy then races out 

               ext parking lot  night

               rudy slams out the side door scrambling straight for the 
               same blazer he jimmies the lock again leaps in tears free 
               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro  
               stripping the plastic trying to spark contact 

                                     rudy
                         catch dammit catch like riding a

               int stairwell

               merlin reaches the second floor steps into the hall

               ext parking lot

               rudy jumps from the blazer looks at the lot the highway 
               the woods his own footprints in the dusting snow

                                     rudy
                         how far you gonna get rudy

               realizing the answer rudy looks to his rooms window forced 
               to race back he tries clambering the wall standing an 
               shrubbery but he cant reach he whirls desperate

               and his eyes find the blazer

               int second floor hall

               merlin ambles the corridor approaching rudys room

               ext parking lot

               rudy flings open the blazer door slams the emergency brake 
               down forces the gearshift into reverse

               int second floor hall

               merlin reaches rudys door searches his pockets for the 
               key

               ext parking lot

               rudy darts to the front of the blazer slipping and sliding 
               on asphalt ice he drops to his knees pushing on the front 
               bumper

               the wheels start to move

               int second floor hall

               merlin finds a room key puts it in the lock turns the handle 
               but the door wont open merlin checks the key

                                     merlin
                         my room

               ext parking lot

               the blazer starts to roll backwards toward the snowy shrubs 
               ringing the building headed for the empty parking space 
               below rudys window rudy keeps pushing the blazer picks up 
               speed rolling on its own

               int second floor hall

               merlin searches his pockets again finds the right key

               ext parking lot

               the blazer rolls toward the building rudy scrambles to his 
               feet runs after it leaps his left foot onto the bumper 
               the right foot onto the hood then onto the roof 

                getting two roofsteps worth of running start 

                as the blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs 

                and rudy dives into the air torpedoing himself right 
               through the window to his room 

               int rudys room

                where he crashes headlong to the floor turning a 
               somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet

               int second floor hall

               the key in the lock merlin hears the crash 

               int rudys room

                and as merlin opens the door he finds rudy sitting calmly 
               on the floor anklecuff locked once again to the bedframe 
               spreading a deck of cards out before him

               starting a game of solitaire he looks up

                                     rudy
                         hey

               merlin frowns takes a suspicious look around the room the 
               windows open rudy continues his card game

               merlin watches him for a long time then pulls the door shut

               once hes gone rudy collapses to the floor breathing hard 
               heart pounding the cards go flying

               int rudys room  moments later

               one just as merlin kicks out leaping up 

                and freezes seeing rudys got a pistol on him

               before merlin can make a move rudy fires 

                and a thin stream of water shoots out leaving a stain on 
               his shirt its the water pistol rudy stares blankly

               as merlin swiftly snatches the second gun a real gun off

               the fire down his neck and chest merlin howls wildly 

                and staggers back blind and helpless pinwheeling himself 

               out the parking lot window

                and crashing down on the hood of a pontiac head through 
               the windshield boots on the bumper dead flames flickering

                         sweetness lets light up the tree

               ashley steps toward the ramp taking out a matchbook nick 
               steps further into the trailer to the back of the nova

               in the car

               rudy immediately wriggles his hands trying to touch his 
               wrists together trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his santa suit trying to get the right pressure point 

                as a blade suddenly springs out of the cuff the 
               switchblade hed stolen from the blazer  its lashed to 
               his right wrist

               rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth cutting through 
               the santa belt 

                his hands at the bottom of the wheel too low for either 
               ashley or nick to see 

               in the trailer

               ashley is at the hood of the car lighting her match nick 
               is at the back bumper ready to push it down the ramp 

                                     nick
                         goodbye rudy nice spending time 
                         with you

               in the car

               the belt breaks rudy snaps his hands free but instead of 
               trying to escape he reaches under the steering column 
               ripping its panel away and pulling wires free

               as ashley tosses her match onto the hood and fire races 
               over the body of the car tongues racing inside over the 
               dash over the seats lapping at rudy 

                who ducks his head beneath the wheel frantic to locate 
               the right leads 

               in the trailer

               ashley jumps out of the way to the snow nick pushes the 
               flaming car to the trailers edge 

                starting on down the ramp the ravine ahead 

                and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire 

               in the car

               rudy sparks two wires together flames eating at him 

                                     rudy
                         like riding a bike like riding a 
                         bike like riding a biiiiike

                and the engine ignites

               rudy slams the gearshift into reverse grabs the wheel and 
               looks over his shoulder at shocked nick behind him 

                                     rudy

                         the wheel

                and slams the accelerator

               on full scene

               as the burning nova races backwards up the ramp and back 
               into the trailer 

               terrified nick turns to run but theres nowhere to go 

                and the car slams into the trailers back crushing nicks 
               legs between metal and metal

                                     ashley

               ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp vengeance and rage 
               she grabs her handgun opens fire 

                and rudy slams the gas again shooting down the ramp 

                as he flings open the car door dives and rolls 

                while the burning nova collides with ashley throwing her 
               onto the hood and sending the tandem inferno speeding off 
               the ridgetop 

                arcing slowly as it plummets into the ravine a smoking 
               blazing shooting star with a womans figure hanging on

               the shooting star hits earth and explodes

               rudy listens to its tumbling sounds all the way to the bottom 
               he then looks up the road one way then the other

               and notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow

               he stares at them

               a long time

               roads and highways and passing a roadsign that reads sidnaw  
               35 miles

               he passes rural roads and driveways and every time he comes 
               across a mailbox he puts a stack of cash inside on the 
               soundtrack the strings and rumpumpumpums of the little 
               drummer boy start to rise 

               with snow falling he passes a new sign sidnaw  27 miles

               with the sun rising a pair of children huddle at a window 
               seeing the man in the santa suit at the end of their driveway 
               giving them something from his sack and ambling on

                and we follow rudys march stuffing presents into

               wine

               the relatives stop still the room goes silent

               without a word he stares at the food before him and takes 
               a plate he stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings 
               and sets it in front of him

               and digs in stuffing his face in silence
