               door swings open and mr white carries the bloody body of 
               mr orange inside

               mr orange still is moaning loudly from his bullet hit

               mr white lays him down upon a mattress on the floor

                         minute theyre there i didnt hear 
                         any sirens the alarm went off okay 
                         okay when an alarm goes off you 
                         got an average of four minutes 
                         response time unless a patrol car 
                         is cruising that street at that 
                         particular moment you got four 
                         minutes before they can realistically 
                         respond in one minute there were 
                         seventeen blue boys out there all 
                         loaded for bear all knowing exactly 
                         what the fuck they were doing and 
                         they were all just there remember 
                         that second wave that showed up in 
                         the cars those were the ones 
                         responding to the alarm but those 
                         other motherfuckers were already 
                         there they were waiting for us

                         being here even if joe is on the up 
                         and up hes probably not gonna be

               out mr white sees this immediately lets go of mr pink 
               and goes for his own weapon

               the two men are on the floor on their knees with their 
               guns outstretched aiming at one another

               mr white shoots joe twice in the face joe brings his hands 
               up to his face screaming and falls to the ground

               eddie fires at mr white hitting him three times in the 
               chest

               mr white brings his gun around on eddie and shoots him

               the two men fall to their knees firing at each other

               eddie collapses dead

               joes dead

               mr orange lies perfectly still except for his chest heaving 
               the only sound we hear is his loud breathing

               mr white is shot full of holes but still on his knees not 
               moving

               mr pink is standing motionless finally he grabs the satchel 
               of diamonds and runs out the door

               we now hear sirens the sounds of more cars driving up men 
               running to the warehouse

               while all this noise is going on mr white tries to stand 
               but falls down he somehow makes it to where mr orange lies

               he lifts mr oranges head cradling it in his lap and 
               stroking his brow

                                     mr white
                              with much effort
                         sorry kid looks like were gonna 
                         do a little time

               mr orange looks up at him and with even more of an effort

                                     mr orange
                         im a cop

               mr white doesnt say anything he keeps stroking oranges 
               brow

                                     mr orange
                         im sorry im so sorry

               mr white lifts his 45 and places the barrel between mr 
               oranges eyes

               the camera moves into an extreme closeup of mr white

               the sounds of outside storm inside we dont see anything 
               but we hear a bunch of shotguns cocking

                                     police force os
                         freeze motherfucker drop your 
                         fucking gun

               mr white looks up at them smiles pulls the trigger

               bang

               we hear a burst of shotgun fire

               mr white is blown out of frame leaving it empty

                                                                  fade out
