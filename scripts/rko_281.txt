	intlarge dark roomnight
	
	in the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges 
	moldings and cornices the phantoms of decaying victorian wealth 
	floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness
	
	it is may 6 1924 the harsh flare of a match being struck
	
	a shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday 
	cake beyond the cake we can see a bed
	
	on the bed lies a woman in her early forties she is ashen and sickly 
	dying
	
	the shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles blows out the 
	match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness
	
	                         woman 
	          come into the light come into the light
	
	a nineyearold boy steps into the light
	
	she pulls him close and whispers
	                         woman 
	
	never stand in the shadows 
	
	                         boy 
	          mother
	
	                         woman 
	          you are made for the light orson now you must blow 
	          out your candles but you must always remember the 
	          cake itself is nothing the flame the lights that 
	          is where your future lies you must have a dream a 
	          great dream worthy of you
	
	the boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles a 
	moment of darkness he turns back to the bed the woman and the bed are 
	gone faded into darkness
	
	the solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness
	
	and then magically the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge 
	dark eyes
	
	newsreel the flickering images of an old newsreel circa 1940
	
	under the mgm logo we see the title boy wonder wows hollywood
	
	the first image after the title is the imposing figure of orson welles 

	climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet
	
	welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome welles seems rather 
	uncomfortable in his own body as if it could not possibly contain his 
	vast passions and appetites
	
	orson welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary 
	energy he is at once inspiring and ferocious visionary and coldly 
	ambitious he is part artist part fraud and all showman
	
	a sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel the voice is always grand 
	occasionally sardonic
	
	                         newsreel voice 
	          he came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing 
	          star blazing through the firmament of illusion and 
	          he promised to devour the world in a single gulp he 
	          was 24 years old and his name was george orson 
	          welles sound the trumpets unfurl the banners 
	          hollywood the boy wonder has arrived
	
	images of welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen welles 
	in a crib as a pampered schoolboy at dance class drama club dressed 
	up for a magic show as we hear
	
	                         newsreel voice 
	          he made his debut on the world stage in kenosha 
	          wisconsin on the 6th of may 1915 and on the 7th 
	          of may he spoke his first words and unlike other 
	          children who say commonplace things like momma and 
	          poppa he proclaimed i am a genius
	
	at three the genius was reciting shakespeare and at eight he had taken 
	up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the  knee of the 
	great houdini
	
	images of welles early theatrical career the young man playing 
	impossibly old parts vaudeville magic shows various regional 
	theaters endless tawdry rehearsal rooms
	
	then images of welles and john houseman in new york the great 
	bustling city welles at work with john houseman on a script welles 
	directing a play as we hear
	
	                         newsreel voice 
	          so how could the magic of the stage not call to 
	          this adventurous lad unstoppable and resolute the 
	          boy wonder journeyed into the world of the legit 
	          theater after a peripatetic beginning he found 
	          himself at last in new york where he joined forces 
	          with theatrical producer john houseman under the 
	          august auspices of the wpa federal theater
	
	a rehearsal room interview with john houseman who is in his 30s 
	thinlipped and prim
	
	                         houseman 
	          orson barreled in and took over orsons a real 
	          barreler
	
	images of welles directing his famous fascist julius caesar and 
	voodoo macbeth productions auditions rehearsals perfecting a 
	swordfight rejecting classical costume sketches for julius caesar 
	supervising set construction performing brutus in the albert speer
	like nuremberg rally lighting of julius caesar as we hear
	
	                         newsreel voice 
	          like hannibal over the alps the boy genius invaded 
	          the great white way he stunned the sedate elite of 
	          new york theatre with production after production 
	          from macbeth with an entirely colored cast to a 
	          mussoliniinspired julius caesar
	
	more images of new york welles houseman and radio welles directing a 
	radio play with sweeping energy supervising the elaborate sound 
	effects editing the script at odds with houseman as we hear
	
	                         newsreel voice 
	          though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars 
	          the ticket sales left something to be desired so 
	          after founding the mercury players with houseman 
	          young mr welles quickly set his sights on the 
	          airwaves he quickly became the sonorous  voice of 
	          the shadow 
	
	newsreel footage of welles at a standing radio microphone
	
	                         welles 
	          who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men the 
	          shadow knows

	radio and the dynamic welles performing and directing as we hear

	          wonder filled the night with his resounding tones 
	          and on october 30th of 1938 he became what he felt

	radio show in the history of the galaxy

	avuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titans 
	outrageous barbarism

	considerably older he is short and squat and bitter a compulsive 
	gambler and drinker mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally 
	wicked and corrosive he is incomplete without the stub of a cigar 
	clenched in his teeth
	
	mank also dressed in a tuxedo is looking at himself in the bathroom 
	mirror as he struggles with his bow tie he occasionally glances in the 
	mirror to welles

	coin an astounding bit of slight of hand

	welles and mank walk through an impressive upstairs hallway of san 
	simeon quick glimpses of the astounding grandeur everywhere around 
	them as

	they disappear down a long stairway 
	
	intsan simeon dining hallevening 
	
	an explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound

	
	we are in the grand refectory  the mammoth dining room  at san 
	simeon five long tables are placed end to end there are about fifty 
	sumptuously dressed guests
	
	william randolph hearst and marion davies preside side by side 
at the 
	center table
	
	hearst is 76 years old he is a fully commanding figure towering in 
	both height six foot two and personality he is shaped rather like a 
	pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless 
	man although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the 
	press barons animus hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully 
	softspoken
	
	marion is 43 years old a shimmering and lively presence in a word 
	that might have been coined for her she has moxie while the ravages 
	of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes 
	of her face she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless 
	grace
	
	around hearsts feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds
	
	on the other side of the main table and down a bit sit welles and 
	mank
	
	we sweep around the table hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and 
	finally settle on marion and hearst
	
	marion is charming carole lombard and clark gable who sit beside 
her 
	she tenderly rests one hand on hearsts arm as she speaks marion 
	speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter
	
	                         marion 
	          and we would hear them scuttling around at night 
	          with their little red eyes and little yellow tt
	          teeth and im just imagining plague lice jumpin all 
	          over the damn place so we set tttraps everywhere 
	          and every morning we would find the tttraps sprung 
	          but no mice

	laughter as welles speaks the whole table gradually stops eating and 
	listens to his tale
	
	                         welles 
	          my father and i made a tour of the grand boulevards 
	          of antique europe and when we were in iberia i had 
	          the chance to face the bulls at the knee of the 
	          great manolete i took up the cape and sword  
	             he uses his napkin and knife to 
	             demonstrate
	            across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to 
	          have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise so 
	           with manolete shouting encouragement i flourished 
	             i flourished again    and the bull charged 
	          across the golden dust it came thundering like the 
	          great minotaur of legend closer ever closer its 
	          calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt shaking 
	          the earth as i held the crimson eye of the bull with 
	          my own defying it  it was almost upon me and i 
	          flourished one last time  the monster swept past 
	           
	             he spins his napkin in the air and his 
	             knife is now gone a magic trick
	            and my sword was gone  buried in the bloody 
	          eye of the beast
	
	applause and laughter from around the table then
	
	                         hearst 
	             quietly
	           you are evidently a man who knows a great deal 
	          about bull

	                         welles

	          a fighting end

	welles again dressed in a tuxedo lies on his bed
	
	through the open balcony doors he can hear the eerie sound of lions 
	roaring and elephants trumpeting in the night
	
	he stand and wanders to the balcony below him he can see bits and 
	pieces of hearsts private zoo in the moonlight a lion pacing 
	relentlessly back and forth an alligator slipping into the water a 
	monkey slamming into the bars of its cage
	
	the disquieting sounds of the menagerie float through the midnight air
	
	welles leaves his suite 
	
	intsan simeon hallwaysfollowing
	
	welles roams the seemingly endless hallways of san simeon in the half
	light they begin to resemble his own cinematic dreampalace xanadu
	
	he hears the ghostly echo of a song where or when
	
	he curiously follows the sound taking in the fabulous castle 
	everywhere around him
	
	he passes by the door to the assembly room inside shafts of light 
	illuminate portions of huge uncompleted jigsaw puzzles

	where or when is now clear
	
	welles stands in the shadows of a balcony overlooking the great 
	ballroom
	
	below him a phonograph record spins lazily on a turntable standing of 
	the floor of the deserted ballroom
	
	and hearst and marion are enjoying a quiet dance together her head 
	nestled on his shoulder
	
	welles stares and stares at them and slowly smiles we linger on hearst 
	and marion as they dance

	to welles
	
	                         mank 
	          go
	
	and we leap into montage  welles and mank brainstorm
	
	a rush of jazzy gene krupa percussion as welles and mank develop their 
	story
	
	we see images of feverish creativity welles raging pleading arguing 
	pushing mank responding laughing drinking writing
	
	it is a passionate dance of creation welles tennis court mank and 
	welles are on the tennis court but hard at work
	
	mank waits for welles to serve welles bounces the tennis ball but is

	          so when was our man innocent was there a moment 
	          early on  of innocence and bliss there must have

	thought
	
	a beat
	
	                         mank 
	             probing
	          something you lost maybe
	
	                         mank 
	          something you can never get back
	
	mank watches as welles lets the tennis ball drop it bounces and rolls 
	 for a fleeting moment in welles mind  it seems to become the rolling 
	snow globe from kane  we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a childs 
	happy voice  in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and 
	pelting his father with snowballs  
	
	then more images mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn in the 
	kitchen in a car around the pool in a bar
	
	welles and mank act out scenes and argue they leap from character to 
	character fearlessly emoting and laughing and writing we see the twin 
	joy and terror of walking the tightrope of sheer creation
	
	we see them having a ferocious argument they scream back and forth 
	angrily and then mank storms out and slams the door welles stands 
	alone in his living room he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in 
	a mirror and we hear
	
	                         manks voice 
	          men like hearst dont love
	
	welles living room welles is slowly advancing on mank
	
	mank sits watching welles approach the living room is now filthy 
	papers and sketches and gin bottles are discarded everywhere around 
	them a thick cloud of cigar smoke it is very late at night and the 
	room is in semidarkness
	
	                         welles 
	          all men love but men like hearst  they dont 
	          bother with convention because

	                         welles 
	          he loves in his own way on his conditions because 
	          those are the only conditions he has ever known
	
	welles is now standing over mank a dark figure in silhouette mank 
	soaks in this somewhat ominous image
	
	more music and images eating and working swimming and working 
	playing and working simultaneously
	
	then beach
	
	sunset we see them walking along a deserted beach welles is walking in 
	the surf his trousers rolled
	
	                         welles 
	             quietly
	          hearst looks down at the world at his feet 
	          everything has always been beneath him
	
	                         mank 
	          and what does he see
	
	                         welles 
	          the people when they pay him homage he adores 
	          them but when they have the  audacity to 
	          question him to doubt him to embarrass him then 
	          he despises them
	
	                         mank 
	          and when he looks up what does he dream about
	
	31
	
	welles stops and looks up a thousand stars twinkle above him they are 
	reflected in his eyes
	
	a long pause as he does not answer mank then
	
	                         mank

	int  sound stage rko lot  day
	
	welles is standing in the middle of an enormous sound stage empty but 
	for a table with some elaborate set models he is slowly walking 
	around the models studying them imagining his movie
	
	the sound stage door opens and a man enters carrying a small black 
	bag he is cinematographer gregg toland
	
	toland is a quiet efficient and slim man of 36 he is brilliant and 
	fearless
	
	toland walks to welles and without a word pulls an oscar statue out 
	of the bag and sets it down in the middle of one of the set models he 
	looks up at welles as we hear
	
	                         welles voice 
	          and gregg toland plunks down his oscar for 
	          wuthering heights and says mr welles i want to 
	          shoot your picture

	the chic brown derby restaurant is the unquestioned palace of hollywood 
	celebrities the smug bigwigs and desperate hangerson circulate and 
	score points in the great game of movie gossip
	
	in one corner booth sits hedda hopper phoning in the latest salacious 
	gossip to her newspaper in the other corner booth louella parsons does 
	the same they occasionally glance back and forth at each other like 
	ravenous hyenas eyeing the last bit of carrion
	
	welles circulates between them in a scene reminiscent of the famous 
	citizen kane breakfast table scene with kane and emily we shoot back 
	and forth as welles applies his considerable charm to both women
	
	welles is dressed differently with each of them breakfast with hedda 
	and dinner with louella
	
	with hedda morning
	
	                         welles cont
	            and i said mr toland you are the finest 
	          cinematographer in hollywood why would you desire 
	          to work with a stumbling neophyte
	
	with louella night
	
	                         welles 
	          and he replied mr welles the only way to learn 
	          anything new is to work with someone who doesnt 
	          know a damn thing

	                         welles 
	          hedda this movie is going to look like no other

	with louella night
	
	                         welles 
	          tome its a question of truth and illusion dont 
	          you get tired of the errant falsity in motion 
	          pictures
	
	                         louella
	          huh
	
	                         welles 
	          what we are going to do is shoot life  in all 
	          its joyous complexity
	
	he takes out a coin and begins a magic trick
	
	                         welles 
	          consider this quarter my dear you can touch it 
	          and feel it and were you to lean forward you could 
	          even smell it why is it that in the movies a simple 
	          bit of reality  a quarter a room a man
	
	with hedda morning
	
	                         welles 
	          becomes nothing but a lie a trick an illusion
	
	he makes the quarter completely disappear hedda is charmed
	
	                         welles 
	          i will show the reality behind the trick
	
	he makes the quarter appear again and shows the guts of the trick
	
	                         welles 
	          i will use the illusions of hollywood to show    
	          the truth
	
	                         hedda 
	          what does truth have to do with movies
	
	with louella night
	
	                         louella 
	             confused
	          so what it went into your other hand
	
	with hedda morning
	
	                         welles 
	          and so the dreamer awakens into the realms of 
	          reality he has been given a rendition of the truth 
	          he has been treated with respect
	
	                         hedda

	mank and houseman watch nervously as welles reads the last page of 
	their massive screenplay
	
	the script almost half a foot high is piled on a table next to 
	welles
	
	he sets down the last page and looks at mank a beat
	
	                         welles 
	          its 350 pages long
	
	                         mank

	                         welles 
	          it is 350 pages of  absolute inspiration
	
	he leaps up and embraces mank

	          short enough but this is a grand start and i think 
	          we need to change the name
	
	                         mank
	          the title
	
	                         welles

	          upturned faces  which has a nice grand ring to it 
	           and i thought of john citizen usa but that 
	          strikes me as a bit warner brothers or god forbid

	a beat welles finally looks up at schaefer
	
	                         welles 
	          its your decision george if you look into my 
	          eyes right now and say go make war of the worlds i 
	          will ill make it and yes itll make you money
	
	and i honestly cant think of a reason in the world why you should let 
	me do kane other than that you should
	
	a long pause as schaefer studies welles then
	
	                         schaefer 
	          if itll get you the hell out of my office go 
	          ahead and make the picture
	
	welles drops his head too moved to speak
	
	then he nods to schaefer and begins to leave
	
	                         schaefer 
	          say thank you orson
	
	welles glances at him 
	
	                         schaefer
	          for the title
	
	                         welles 
	             smiles
	          ah its a grand title
	
	he sweeps out schaefer smiles and shakes his head
	
	                         schaefer 
	          like it would kill him to say thank you
	
	extsound stage rko lotdawn
	
	the sun is just rising on the rko lot we note a sign on the wall by 
	the sound stage door
	
	citizen kane rko production 281 director orson welles 
absolutely no 
	admittance
	
	intrko sound stagefollowing 
	
	absolute silence
	
	welles stands in the mammoth sound stage and looks around it is as if 
	he has entered a great cathedral a few lights illuminate portions of 
	the stage and giant lighting rigs and scaffolding soar to the unseen 
	ceiling miles away
	
	the xanadu great hall set awaits
	
	welles slowly walks to the set and stands surveying his domain 
	savoring the moment
	
	title july 30 1940
	
	he clears his throat and speaks rehearsing his first day speech to the 
	cast and crew his voice echoes
	
	                         welles 
	          today we  
	
	he stops surprised by the echo
	
	                         welles 
	          today we are going to break every rule in motion 
	          picture history
	
	no   we are going to shatter every rule in
	
	today we are going to shatter the hallowed busts of griffith and 
	demille and ford we are going to show the world a new way of seeing 
	together we will blaze a trail
	
	as welles continues to rehearse we slowly ascend the scaffolding and 
	lighting rigs
	
	                         welles voice 
	          together we will throw away all the maps and we 
	          will become joyously lost in the wilderness and 
	          the future cartographers of hollywood will forever 
	          chart our course following our lead
	
	we continue to ascend and finally discover two electricians on the 
	upper catwalk staring down in amusement much like the two stagehands 
	at the opera in kane
	
	                         welles voice 
	          and do you know why were going to do this
	
	again to welles on the stage floor a beat welles slowly smiles
	
	                         welles 
	          were going to do this because its going to be 
	          fun
	
	above one of the electricians throws the switch on a huge spotlight
	
	welles is captured in the vibrant white light and benny goodmans 
	immortal sing sing sing immediately explodes and we are into
	
	the making of citizen kane
	
	a camera crane sweeps dramatically to the ceiling of the sound stage 
	and brilliant white lights flash on
	
	a film clapper snaps citizen kane rko production 281 director 
orson 
	welles
	
	and we see welles racing heroically into making his first movie
	
	in varying kane makeups he tears through scenes and actors laughing 
	with agnes moorehead on the cabin set charming ruth warrick on 
the 

	breakfast table set berating dorothy commingore on the great hall 
	set
	
	he speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera 
	in the campaign headquarters set never happy with the shot  
	
	gregg toland watches bemused as welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the 
	set  
	
	welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces like an obsessed 
	artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once we see him 
	rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and 
	trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions 
	looking for the perfect camera angle
	
	it is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building 
	 building  building  on welles
	
	sing sing sing continues on the xanadu stairway set welles behind 
	the camera filming actor paul stewart
	
	                         paul stewart

	          again
	
	sing sing sing continues
	
	in a corner of the sound stage
	
	welles in full kane makeup studies a miniature model of the kane 
	campaign headquarters set through a tiny periscope with cinematographer 
	gregg toland
	
	                         welles 
	          it needs a ceiling gregg real rooms have real 
	          ceilings

	          again
	
	paul stewart screams and collapses sing sing sing continues on 
	the atlantic city nightclub set
	
	welles watches as the camera crane attempts the dizzying and difficult 
	maneuver from the skylight at the top of the set
	
	down to dorothy commingore as susan alexander below the camera crane 
	goes out of control and crashes through some light fixtures and swings 
	crazily down toward dorothy commingore she yelps and leaps away as the 
	camera barrels through the table and smashes to the floor
	
	welles stands next to toland a beat
	
	                         welles 
	          well that didnt really work
	
	sing sing sing continues back on the xanadu stairway set
	
	paul stewart dazed and shattered is listening intently welles stands 
	with his arms around stewart embracing him whispering into his ear
	
	                         welles 
	          it is the most important line of the picture you 
	          will weave the magic of rosebud in a single word 
	           you will say the word in such a way as to impart 
	          to us the mystery of it it is a divine and sinister 
	          mystery worthy only of your talent in this one word 
	          the movie soars or falls once more i beg you
	
	stewart nods the film clapper take 178
	
	the cameraman leans into the viewfinder we see his black andwhite 
	view of the shot through the lens then
	
	in a cramped editing room we see welles watching the scene on an old 
	editing moviola
	
	on the moviola we see paul stewart taking a deep breath and then 
	magnificently
	
	                         paul stewart 
	             on moviola
	          rosebud ill tell you about rosebud
	
	                         welles voice 
	             on moviola
	          print 
	
	on the moviola we see stewart laugh hysterically and dance away
	
	in the editing room welles shakes his head
	
	                         welles 
	          actors
	
	sing sing sing continues on the campaign headquarters set
	
	welles and toland lie on the floor of the campaign headquarters set and 
	gaze up through viewfinders they squirm about on the floor and laugh 
	to one another about their newest outlandish idea
	
	then toland notices something in the catwalks high above the set a 
	redheaded electrician
	
	                         toland orson you see that electrician up there the redhead 
he was 
	on grapes of wrath hes a free lance studio spy probably reports 
	right back to the rko boys in new york
	
	welles slowly stands and thunders
	
	                         welles 
	          stop everybody stop
	
	all the flurried activity on the sound stage immediately stops
	
	every eye turns terrified to welles welles glares up at the 
	redheaded electrician
	
	                         welles 
	          you come down here
	
	the electrician slowly climbs down from the rafters welles rivets him 
	every step of the way
	
	the electrician stops before welles
	
	                         electrician 
	          mr welles
	
	a tense beat and then welles fiercely and purposefully spits in the 
	electricians face
	
	the electrician recoils stunned
	
	                         welles 
	          get out
	
	welles returns to toland as the electrician slinks off sing sing 
	sing continues as
	
	we see the magnificent film emerging welles watching scenes in a 
	screening room his feet up exhausted almost asleep a cigar dangling 
	from his lips
	
	we see rushes of welles going through scenes with dorothy commingore as 
	susan alexander he is relentless with her off camera driving her to 
	the harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot
	
	we see the crew observing with great amusement welles stumbling 
	attempts to learn the charlie kane dance
	
	we see toland shifting lights to achieve deepfocus crossfades welles 
	rages as the difficult process eats up time
	
	we see welles growing increasingly manic the long hours and the 
	pressure are clearly taking a toll
	
	we return to the screening room welles is now fully asleep his cigar 
	falls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit
	
	sing sing sing fades at on a xanadu set
	
	filming a scene welles in oldkane makeup is sitting with dorothy 
	commingore as susan alexander he is curiously distracted she is 
	pouring tea in the scene
	
	                         dorothy commingore 
	          charlie you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things  
	
	welles does not respond he breaks character
	
	                         welles 
	          no  no  ill pour the tea sorry i should pour 
	          the tea lets try that again
	
	toland stands behind the camera and watches welles there is obviously 
	something wrong
	
	                         welles 
	          okay here we go set action
	
	welles pops into character and pours the tea in the scene as
	
	                         dorothy commingore 
	          charlie you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things  
	
	welles stops breaks character again
	
	                         welles 
	          no  thats not right
	
	he clears his throat and glances at the enormous crew all staring back 
	at him expectantly
	
	                         welles 
	          urn   ah    yes  you should definitely pour 
	          the tea okay again sorry set action
	
	they start the scene again she pours the tea
	
	                         dorothy commingore 
	          charlie you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things  
	
	a pause as she waits for his reply in the scene he sits frozen
	
	                         toland 
	          orson you wanna take five
	
	                         welles 
	          five yes no were done today
	
	he slowly walks off the set as he nervously pulls at his tie tearing 
	it off
	
	toland watches him go 
	
	intbrown derbyday
	
	louella is at her usual corner booth on the phone to one of her many 
	spies she is devouring a cobb salad as she hears
	
	                         phone voice 
	          i dont know if this means anything but i just 
	          talked to a guy in the rko art department theyve

	she hangs up intrigued
	
	intwelles house
	
	welles is standing absolutely lost in the middle of his living room 
	he is still in his oldkane makeup which is just beginning to peel off 
	his face
	
	we hear a low insistent drum beat a gene krupa riff
	
	we hear the sound of an ice pick chipping into a block of ice welles 
	glances around we are no longer in welles living room but at  
	
	intmanks house santa monicaday
	
	a turntable spins in a corner playing a gene krupa record ashtrays 
	overflow with cigar butts and messy piles of pages are littered around 

	a typewriter
	
	manks beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid
	
	welles still in his peeling oldkane makeup is standing in the middle 
	of the living room and mank is in the small kitchenette chipping ice 
	for drinks
	
	a long pause
	
	                         welles 
	          and im looking at them  and theyre all looking 
	          at me and i dont know who should pour the tea

	                         welles 
	          i just cant   see it anymore
	
	mank returns to the living room and thrusts a drink in welles hand
	
	                         welles 
	          i want you back
	
	                         mank

	                         mank
	          i dont care
	
	welles hands mank a folded script from his jacket mank looks at it as
	
	                         welles 
	          this is the shooting script weve been using every 
	          day
	
	sure enough the title page of the script reads citizen kane by herman 
	j mankiewicz and orson welles
	
	                         welles 
	          its just like we always said it would be
	
	mank hands it back
	
	                         mank 
	          too late kid
	
	welles sits
	
	                         welles 
	          did i ever tell you about my father
	
	                         mank

	                         welles 
	          he was a drunk and he was my father and i was 
	          ashamed of him
	
	a beat welles proceeds quietly and with difficulty
	
	                         welles 
	          he showed me the world he took me with him 
	          everywhere  europe china  and he was so proud 
	          of me but he would drink and he would get 
	          embarrassing and i began to resent him because i 
	          was so  sparkling you see
	
	so i cut him dead i turned my back and i walked away because i didnt 
	need him he was getting in the way of my genius and he would write 
	me letters and i never answered them and he would call me and i 
	never took his calls and he showed up at school and i wouldnt see 
	him
	
	tears are beginning to inch down welles face
	
	                         welles 
	          when i finally saw him again he was in a coffin i 
	          was fifteen and all of a sudden he wasnt that 
	          embarrassing drunk anymore  he was the man who 
	          showed me the world
	
	welles looks up at mank tears now streaming down his face
	
	                         welles 
	          just like you mank
	
	a long beat mank despite himself is moved

	
	to cover his emotion mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen 
	his drink we remain tight on welles as we hear manks voice
	
	                         manks voice 
	          so youve lost it dont know who should pour the 
	          tea
	
	                         welles
	          yeah
	
	a beat
	
	                         manks voice 
	          orson  just cut the goddamn tea
	
	                         welles
	          okay
	
	a beat welles reaches for a cigar tears still wet on his face
	
	                         manks voice 
	          i been thinking about the beach scene you done 
	          that yet
	
	                         welles
	
	no
	
	                         manks voice 
	          good  cause i was thinking that were starting 
	          the scene too late
	
	welles quickly bites off the end of his cigar  his expression one of 
	gotcha  even as his cheeks are still wet with tears
	
	                         manks voice cont 
	          cause if we dont show susan watching kane more 
	          then were not building the right tension into the 
	          scene see shes gotta know that
	
	welles slowly smiles as the record of gene krupas percussion segues 
	into the unmistakable rhythms of sing sing sing and eclipses manks 
	voice
	
	and we see welles everywhere more energized than ever perilous on a 
	high crane stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera doing magic 
	tricks for the cast sleeping as makeup is applied to his face
	
	mank is always at welles side supporting challenging amusing 
	inspiring  
	
	we see welles strutting raging boasting dancing and again towering
	
	sing sing sing finally ends at
	
	through the blackandwhite viewfinder we see welles in full costume 
	and makeup carefully walking across the massive kane campaign 
	headquarters set toward us we see the low angle blackandwhite 
	cameras perspective
	
	                         tolands voice

	joseph cotton also in full costume and makeup steps into the shot and 
	takes welles position as welles scurries out of the frame  
	
	intsound stage rkonight following
	
	welles marches across the set and squirms into position at the camera 
	which is right on the floor and peers up through the viewfinder
	
	toland lies next to him mank stands to one side and watches
	
	                         welles 
	          its just not low enough this is the scene we 
	          have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring 
	          to the sky as towering virtues in combat
	
	                         toland 
	          spare me the aria i know what you want

	                         welles 
	          take apart the fucking camera rig  we could get a 
	          few more inches down and then tilt up
	
	                         toland 
	          orson  we cant get the fucking camera any 
	          fucking lower so find another fucking shot
	
	welles thinks for a moment and then bolts up toland watches 
	mystified as welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a 
	fire axe welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high toland 
	quickly rolls away and welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of 
	the set he continues to hack at the floor
	
	                         welles 
	          come on gregg well tear out this floor
	
	welles and toland and various grips hack at the floor
	
	mank watches bemused and checks his watch
	
	welles and toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor 
	they stare down defeated under the wood is solid concrete
	
	welles and toland stand and stare at the concrete
	
	                         toland 
	          its midnight why dont we pick it up tomorrow
	
	welles does not answer he continues to eye the concrete then
	
	                         welles 
	          get me a jackhammer
	
	we see a grip pounding away at the concrete with a jackhammer as 
	welles always in motion sweeps past mank and joseph cotton
	
	                         mank 
	             wryly to cotton
	          there but for the grace of god goes god
	
	welles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out 
	an arm the physician injects him with a dose of b12
	
	welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off
	
	welles supervises as toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole 
	in the middle of the sound stage mank checks his watch 330 am
	
	welles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup
	
	again we see the view through the blackandwhite viewfinder joseph 
	cotton stands at a distance at the far wall of the set
	
	                         welles voice 
	          okay joe    come closer    closer
	
	we see cotton approaching he finally stops inches away from the 
	camera his shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus 
	it is a breathtaking vertiginous shot
	
	then we see welles and joseph cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and 
	filming and filming the scene endlessly
	
	finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie
	
	                         welles 
	          well if you got drunk to talk to me about miss

	                         welles 
	             to the camera operator
	          keep filming

	                         welles
	          cut print
	
	we jump out of the blackandwhite viewfinder and into the scene as 
	welles turns to an assistant
	
	                         welles 
	          how bout a real drink

	          yeah 
	
	the crew members exhale and practically collapse
	
	welles stands and looks around in satisfaction he takes in the empty 
	corners of the sound stage the sets the cameras savoring the moment
	
	                         welles 
	             quietly
	          its finished
	
	he walks to the massive doors of the sound stage and pulls them open
	
	sunlight floods in
	
	outside it is a blazing morning and the dazzling sunlight silhouettes 
	welles
	
	welles squints and steps into the glorious sunlight mank and toland 
	follow they stand and watch as rko extras and crews bustle about on 
	their way to work the assistant brings a tray of martinis
	
	they each take a glass the rko workers stare at them oddly as they 
	pass
	
	welles toasts them
	
	                         welles

	          martinis and you pray
	
	silence from inside the screening room the movie is over an agonizing 
	silent pause
	
	then the doors swing open and the guests stream out totally neutral 
	expressions
	
	the bejeweled valkyrie hedda herself finally emerges she stops 
	before welles

	she reaches up and pinches his cheek a bit too hard and then she

	          right hearst was throwing a birthday party for 
	          thomas ince the old movie producer they were all 
	          on the old mans yacht taking a nice jaunt from 
	          pedro down to san diego real foggy night it was 
	          this was hearst marion ince charlie chaplin 
	          louella the usual gorillas so hearst notices 
	          marion slip off with chaplin  she was screwing 
	          everyone then  and the old man goes nuts grabs 
	          his revolver and starts shooting just like tom mix 
	          standing there blasting away through the fog boom 
	           boom  boom  and thomas ince takes a bullet 
	          through the head so now theres this dead guy lying 
	          on the deck youll see how this could be quite an 
	          embarrassment so the empire goes into action nice 
	          and quiet and ince was cremated licketysplit no 
	          inquest and no police it was right after this that 
	          hearst gives louella her lifetime contract just to 
	          keep her all hushhush

	intsan simeon screening roomnight
	
	hearst and marion are sitting in the plush san simeon screening room 
	surrounded by a passel of dachshunds five or six friends are also 
	spread around the room joe willicombe is also present
	
	we watch their faces as they watch citizen kane
	
	during this sequence we hear bits and pieces of kane as we watch hearst 
	and marion react
	
	we see marions initial amusement give way to a forced neutrality
	
	we see hearst becoming increasingly uncomfortable reacting physically 
	almost writhing as his soul is laid bare then his face grows cold 
	drained
	
	we see joe willicombe offended
	
	we see the other guests horrified and afraid to even so much as glance 
	at hearst
	
	finally we hear the ending of the movie
	
	                         raymond
	          throw that junk in too
	
	we hear bernard hermanns closing music begin to play out
	
	hearst abruptly stands the final images of the film washing over his 
	face
	
	                         hearst 
	          switch it off switch it off
	
	the film suddenly stops and lights come up around the screening room

	             quietly
	          would everyone please leave

	          some cheap sideshow  a freak show  a dying 
	          impotent old freak in his castle
	
	he smashes a collection of figurines and sends them sailing across the 
	room hearsts rage gives way to a darker passion
	
	                         hearst 
	             intensely

	          and the railroads  and we have risen above  we 
	          have risen above and if that dog welles thinks he 
	          can strike at me now  when he thinks im weak when 
	          he thinks im vulnerable  then he does not fully 
	          comprehend the man is facing

	          dare to imagine he could comprehend my life and my 
	          world when he crawls with the other insects in the 
	          sewer  in the dung  when we control every moment 
	          of his life from the instant he is born to the 
	          instant we decide that he will die does he have no 
	          idea of the power that controls him

	          the gold ring and just grabbed on and he was going 
	          to make me a star

	          and he did

	schaefer turns and stomps away welles stands lost for a moment in the

	in a bit of a daze welles slowly begins walking through the backlot a 
	bustle of loud activity in a corner of the lot draws his attention
	
	a bulldozer and a dozen workmen are busy tearing down the facade of a 
	large white mansion they strip the wood off and toss it into an 
	incinerator
	
	welles sees schaefer standing before all this activity deep in 
	thought
	
	welles goes to him and they stand together in silence for a moment as 
	they watch the house being razed

	          out one after another without thinking most of the 
	          time just like making toasters or packards or

	          there are no jokes there are people making a 
	          living there is food on the table

	a cigar he tries to laugh but cannot

	mayer goes schaefer sits smelling defeat
	
	we linger on schaefer as a haunting echo of i cant get started is 
	heard  
	
	intextsan simeonnight
	
	we float through the estate as we hear the ghostly strains of bunny 
	berigans recording of i cant get started
	
	it is a sad journey
	
	by this time many of the ornate antiquities have been removed from the 
	castle and it resembles welles stark and dreary xanadu all the more
	
	                         bunny berigan 
	          ive flown around the world in a plane ive 
	          settled revolutions in spain and the north pole i

	we float past the private zoo now empty the cages hanging open we 
	move past the tennis courts empty

	          has asked me to star ive got a house a show 
	          place still i cant get no place with you
	
	we float into the castle itself and through the stripped down 
	screening room and the assembly room and the great dining hall
	
	all are mere shadows of their past glory
	
	                         bunny berigan 
	          cause youre so supreme lyrics i write of you i 
	          dream dream day and night of you and i scheme just 
	          for the sight of you baby what good does it do
	
	we finally float into the ballroom
	
	a record of i cant get started spins forlornly on a turntable
	
	and marion and hearst are having a quiet poignant dance together in 
	the middle of the empty ballroom
	
	                         bunny berigan 
	          ive been consulted by franklin d greta garbo has 
	          had me to tea still im broken hearted cause i 
	          cant get started with you
	
	they finally stop dancing and stand swaying gently then they stop 
	swaying
	
	                         hearst 
	             gently

	          welles looks at schaefer
	
	welles suddenly flings his plate of food in schaefers direction as he 
	roars
	
	                         welles

	           its all citizen kane
	
	and in a screaming bellowing fury welles tears apart the room
	
	in a scene sharply reminiscent of kane destroying susans bedroom 
	welles rampages around the room upsetting tables and smashing 
	everything in reach
	
	welles finally grabs a flaming can of sterno and flings it at schaefer 
	schaefer knocks it away
	
	then welles stands in spent exhaustion panting one of his hands is 
	bleeding
	
	he looks at schaefer a pause then
	
	                         welles

	he aimlessly shuffles through the cards and plucks one out
	
	                         welles

	          six of spades
	
	he looks at the card it is the two of clubs
	
	his attention is now fully on the cards he shuffles them dramatically 
	and snatches out a card he looks at it and then tosses it away he 
	shuffles again working the trick again it fails he tosses another 
	card away he continues  more quickly to attempt the trick it 
	fails again and  again
	
	with a frightened moan welles flings the entire deck away from him and 
	bolts out of the room
	
	exthotel rooftopnight 
	
	welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel
	
	he marches to the edge of the roof and leans against a railing gasping 
	for air
	
	everywhere below him the shimmering lights of manhattan twinkle and 
	flash cabs and neon and noise the night sky above him is filled with 
	stars
	
	he looks away from the city and up to the stars  they captivate him 
	fully he stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful 
	lights
	
	a long moment as welles gazes at the stars the city below and the 
	noise seem to disappear and welles stands safe and at peace under the 
	silent dome of stars
	
	the stars are reflected in his huge dark eyes
	
	magically the stars in his eyes give way to the vague shapes of men 
	sitting around a table
	
	welles looks at the men
	
	                         welles 
	          today
	
	we pull back to see we are at 
	
	intrko board room new yorkday 
	
	welles stands at the head of a long conference table title april 6 
	1941
	
	around the table are gathered a group of stern businessmen schaefer is 
	also present
	
	welles looks at the men and he speaks for once his usual 
	overwrought theatrical tones are gone
	
	he speaks simply
	
	                         welles 
	          today a man from germany invaded greece he has 
	          already swallowed poland and denmark and norway and 
	          belgium he is bombing london as i speak everywhere 
	          this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of 
	          his subjects he sews yellow stars onto their 
	          lapels he takes their voices
	
	in this country we still have our voices and we can sing with them 
	and we can argue with them and we can be heard because we are    
	for the moment    free no one can tell us what to say or how to say 
	it can they we have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives do 
	we no one can take our voices can they because we are free
	
	i am one voice and that is all my picture is one voice men are dying 
	in europe now  and americans soon will be  so that we can surmount 
	the tyrants and the dictators will you send a message across this 
	country that one man can take away our voices
	
	so  who is mr hearst and who is mr welles mr hearst built a 
	palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled 
	high i built a palace of illusion my castle xanadu is a matte 
	painting and camera trick its nothing but    a dream
	
	today you have a chance to let the dream triumph for once
	
	he gazes at them and then slowly walks out of the room 
	
	intlong hallway new yorkday
	
	welles sits quietly on a bench in a long hallway in a tall building
	
	schaefer emerges from an office and goes to him he sits next to him
	
	                         schaefer 
	          we open on may 1st
	
	welles slowly nods
	
	                         schaefer 
	          orson what you said in there did you mean it
	
	welles looks at him
	
	                         welles 
	          does it matter they believed it
	
	he stands and begins walking away
	
	                         schaefer 
	          orson
	
	welles stops not turning
	
	                         schaefer 
	          yes it matters
	
	welles continues down the hall 
	
	inthotel new yorknight 
	
	title april 30 1941 welles is rushing to catch an elevator as the 
	doors close
	
	he nips in at the last minute and punches his button he turns
	
	the elevator is deserted but for one other person william randolph 
	hearst
	
	welles and hearst recognize each other instantly as the elevator 
	ascends the two men look at each other
	
	a very long pause as we watch their faces  the young man and the old 
	man  both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning 
	inspiration  both men of incalculable achievement and measureless 
	poignancy
	
	finally
	
	                         welles 
	          mr hearst weve met once before my name is orson 
	          welles and ive got a movie opening tomorrow night 
	          at the palace i would be pleased to get you 
	          tickets
	
	a pause as hearst regards welles
	
	then hearst carefully reaches over and presses the stop button on the 
	elevator the elevator stops
	
	an exceedingly quiet exchange
	
	a beat
	
	a pause
	
	                         hearst 
	          i wonder do you have any idea what you have done
	
	                         welles
	          do you
	
	                         hearst 
	          intimately for every sin you have placed on my 
	          head i could give you a hundred others i have been 
	          swimming in blood my entire life but i retain a 
	          belief perhaps you will think it old fashioned 
	          undoubtedly you will but i believe that private 
	          lives should not be public property
	
	                         welles 
	          elegant words sir when you have made your name 
	          and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip 
	          in your papers you taught the world how to look 
	          under every rock i learned at the knee of the 
	          master
	
	                         hearst 
	          so where does that leave us mr welles what kind 
	          of sad future are we two making a future where men 
	          will do anything to sell their newspapers and their 
	          movies a future where no price is too high for fame 
	          and power when we will all scratch each other to 
	          pieces just to be heard
	
	can you truly envision such  horror
	
	hearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move
	
	the doors opens on hearsts floor and he leaves the elevator
	
	the doors are about to shut on welles when he leans forward and roars 
	
	
	                         welles 
	          charles foster kane would have accepted i
	
	the doors shut on welles and we remain with hearst as he slowly walks 
	down the long hotel hallway
	
	he walks with dignity

	it is the premiere of citizen kane at last

	we swirl with the throng of patrons in the lobby as they file into the 
	theater and finally find welles and schaefer huddled together nervously 
	in a corner of the lobby
	
	they are studiously ignored and snubbed by all the movie people 
	filtering past
	

	                         schaefer

	             quietly
	          kid you know how it ends too it ends sadly
	
	he pulls welles away from the theater and down the street 
	
	int palace theater  night
	
	we watch the faces
	
	in the flickering blue light we watch the audience as we hear bernard 
	hermanns evocative and haunting opening music to citizen kane
	
	we slowly move across a sea of faces as the music plays for everyone 
	especially the movie people what they are seeing is a revelation and a 
	revolution it is a whole new way of seeing the world
	
	we see their amazement as they are mesmerized  and their confusion as 
	they are challenged
	
	and we see george schaefer quietly proud
	
	bernard hermanns opening music continues to play until we finally 
	hear
	
	                         kane 
	          rosebud
	
	and the world of movies is forever changed 
	
	int   deserted bar new york  night 
	
	welles and mank are sitting in a rundown deserted bar

	          will burn burn up burn out  but oh what a flame
