               int blue door fight club  night

               superimpose over action november 12 1975  philadelphia

               the club itself resembles a large unemptied trashcan 
               the boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle

               the lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is 
               fighting

               in the ring are two heavyweights one white the other black 
               the white fighter is rocky balboa he is thirty years old

               his face is scarred and thick around the nose his black 
               hair shines and hangs in his eyes rocky fights in a plodding 
               machinelike style the black fighter dances and bangs 
               combinations into rockys face with great accuracy

               but the punches do not even cause rocky to blink he grins 
               at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead

               the people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for 
               blood they lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters

               in the thick smoke they resemble specters everyone is 
               hustling bets the action is even heavier in the balcony

               a housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet

               the bell rings and the fighters return to their corner

               somebody heaves a beer can into the ring

               the black fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers 
               across the ring at rocky

                                     black fighter
                              to cornerman
                         im gonna bust his head wide open

               in rockys corner he is being assisted by a shriveled balding 
               cornerman who is an employee of the club he works on 
               rocky without any enthusiasm

                                     cornerman
                              lackluster
                         ya waltzin  give the suckers 
                         some action

                                     rocky
                         hey 

                                     cornerman

                         just gimme the water

               a fight fan rushes up to rocky he is sixtyfive with 
               yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses

                                     fan

                         distance  ya feel strong

                                     rocky
                         absolutely

                                     cornerman
                         ya want some good advice

                                     rocky
                         i just want the mouthpiece

               the bell rings rocky makes the sign of the cross the 
               fighters engage in battle the other fighter grabs rocky in 
               a clinch and purposely butts him the butt opens a bleeding 
               cut on the corner of rockys eye

               rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into 
               the mans body rocky slams the man on the jaw and the 
               fighter is out for the night the fans throw rubbish into 
               the ring rocky ignores it

               the fans loudly go about collecting bets the referee does 
               not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under 
               the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher two new fighters 
               enter the ring rocky slips on a tattered robe embroidered 
               clumsily on the back is the italian stallion

                                     announcer
                         winner rocky balboa  next a six 
                         rounder between local lightweights

               without pomp rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette 
               from a spectator the fighter on the stretcher passes behind 
               him he watches for a moment and continues up the aisle 
               before he even reaches the rear of the club the bell rings 
               and the next fight has already begun rocky fades into the 
               darkness of the rear of the club

               the title credits end

               int dressing room  night

               rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his 
               locker for his hat also in the dingy room are ten other 
               fighters two taped fighters talk shop in the corner

               another paces nervously two other fighters shadowbox and 
               spit nervously on the floor

               a young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable radio 
               that is blasting music

               the fighter that rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer 
               and joking with three other fighters some of the fighters 
               are smoking the room is cloudy

               a short man of fifty enters he is dressed in a sweater 
               buttoned over a tshirt

                                     promoter
                         balboa

               rocky raises his head the promoter steps over

                                     promoter
                              continuing

                         house owes ya sixtyone dollars

               the man peels off the money and departs rocky closes his 
               locker nods to the defeated fighter and leaves

               int trolley  night

               rocky is on the trolley heading to south philly the trolley 
               is empty except for a thin old black woman the black woman 
               studies rockys bruised face rocky becomes selfconscious

                                     rocky
                              almost apologetic
                         im a fighter

                                     woman

                         yo iz an accident

               ext street  night

               rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block he waves 
               at a pair of highheeled hookers and they wave back

               rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty 
               bookstore rocky drags the man into a protective passageway

               further down the street rocky pauses in front of the animal 
               town pet shop he peers into the dark store and sees a 
               sad huge dog sitting in the window he mumbles to the dog 
               and continues to the corner

               ext rockys apartment  night

               a short while later rocky approaches his apartment located 
               in the most deprived section of south philly he kicks away 
               the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and 
               enters

               int rockys hallway  night

               the narrow hallway is painted olive brown a single light 
               bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor

               int rockys apartment  night

               rocky enters the oneroom apartment is drab with a curling 
               boxing poster of rocky marciano tacked on the wall nailed 
               against the far wall is a mattress the mattress is used as 
               a punching bag stuffing spills out of the center

               rocky drops his coat on the floor he puts on a pair of 
               glasses he crosses to a small turtle bowl he lifts the 
               creatures

                                     rocky
                         look whos home

               rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate then 
               places an old 45 rpm record on a battered phonograph the 
               record is a tune all in the game

               as the crackling music begins rocky picks up his 
               hairbrush using it like a microphone he mimes to the record 
               he assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to 
               thousands of adoring fans he then switches into a bullish 
               fighting stance and throws several punches

               the water boils rocky soaks his badlyswollen hands

               ext sunrise of philadelphia skyline  dawn

               we see the jagged skyline highlighted by the towering figure 
               of william penn that rises above the dawn haze as it sits 
               majestically above city hall

               ext docks  early morning

               rocky is walking along the waterfront he has a bandaid 
               over one eye he looks at the rugged stevedores going about 
               their business he stuffs his hands in his cheap wool jacket 
               and approaches a ship being unloaded

               rocky passes two thick mafia types leaning against a parked 
               car these men look like blood drinkers

                                     mafia 1
                         yo rock  hows your boss

               rocky shrugs and moves away he nears a heavy man working 
               the crane the heavy man looks frightened he stops the 
               crane and hurries into the ships hole rocky dashes up the 
               gangplank

               int ship  day

               the man enters the ships hole and runs past tons of stacked 
               crates and coffee beans

               rocky sprints after him he lunges and flings the man by 
               the neck against the wall of stacked cargo

                                     fats

               rockys determined expression strikes home the fat man 
               quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small 
               wad of bills

                                     rocky

               rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat mans flushed

               beat of skip ropes and throbbing speed bags makes the room 
               come alive like it was a mindless piece of machinery over 
               the loudspeaker music by the isley brothers blares out 
               the music adds a background to the clang of the automatic 
               timers snorting sparring partners and the thudding of heavy 
               bags

               the room is divided  fifty percent black  thirtyfive 
               percent latin  ten percent white  five percent other

               still it does not open he shakes the lock forcefully no 
               luck rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the

               bench and smashes open the lock opening the door rocky is 
               taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes

                         natural southpaw an most pugs wont 
                         fight a southpaw cause we mess up 
                         their timin an look awkward  
                         southpaw means lefthanded but i 
                         guess in the long run things probably

                                     adrian

               adrian nods and is very nervous the cleaner moves carefully 
               across the ice

                                     rocky

               the cleaner walks over as rocky and adrian get off the ice

               rocky and adrian start to leave rocky pauses at the door 
               and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars

                                     rocky
                              continuing

               ext street  night

                                     rocky
                         some people are very shy by nature

                                     adrian
                         i suppose

                         i suppose

                                     rocky
                         some people think bein shy is a 
                         disease but it dont bother me

                                     adrian
                         it doesnt bother me either

                                     rocky

                         it is just hard for me to 
                         understand why anybody wants to be a 
                         fighter

                                     rocky

                                     adrian
                         morning after

                                     rocky

                         a large wound sometimes i feel like

                                     adrian
                         why do you do it if it hurts so bad

                                     rocky
                         guess

                                     adrian
                              pause

               the woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing  
               rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body

                                     rocky

               rocky softly kisses the woman her arms hang limp he puts 
               more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond

               her hand glides like smoke up his back

               she embraces his neck the dam of passion erupts she gives 
               herself freely for the first time in thirty years

               rocky smiles and gazzo gets into his car rocky follows him 
               across the street

                                     rocky

               rocky walks away

               int rockys apartment  night

               rocky returns home and enters his apartment after turning 
               on the light he flips on his record player he now feeds 
               the turtles

                                     rocky
                         look whos home

               rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold he 
               approaches them with a sense of awe he opens and reads one 
               settling on the bed he reads the other

               a knock is heard rocky opens the door mickey goldmill the 
               gym owner stands framed in the doorway

                                     mickey
                              stiffly

                         was home

                                     rocky

                         here sit down

               rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair

                                     rocky
                              continuing
                         best seat in the house  hey mick

               by the manner in which goldmill listens it is obvious 
               something important is preying on his mind

               rocky is slightly uncomfortable almost embarrassed at having 
               outsiders see how he lives

                                     mickey

                         freak luck is a strange thing

                         was  your shot is my last shot

               rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the 
               door

               mickey struggles to his feet and like a beaten man leaves

               several moments later rocky steps out and lowers himself 
               into bed springing up a second later he runs outside

               ext street of rockys apartment  night

               rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form 
               of mickey way in the distance we see rocky stop the old 
               man beneath a street lamp he places an arm around his 
               shoulder

               int rockys apartment  predawn

               the following morning rockys alarm clock goes off at exactly 
               four am not accustomed to rising this early with great 
               difficulty rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the 
               bathroom he turns the light on and roaches scatter

               at the top of the mirror hang the telegrams rocky fills the 
               basin and submerges his face in cold water

               rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs he cracks 
               five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill his 
               body quivers

               ext street of rockys apartment  predawn

               rocky steps outside he is dressed in a wellworn sweat suit 
               with a hood gloves and sneakers it is pitch dark and his 
               steaming breath attests to the cold

               he begins running down the center of the deserted street he 
               can only be clearly seen as his form passes beneath the street 
               lamps

               two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass

               ext art museum stairs  dawn

               rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight 
               of stairs he stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear 
               into the morning gray taking a deep breath he starts up

               from the start he looks out of shape and halfway up his 
               legs give way standing he brushes off and descends the 
               stairs

               ext city hall  dawn

               rocky passes city hall and veers to the river he pauses 
               heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths he throws several 
               lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his aching 
               sides men delivering the morning papers observe with 
               amusement

               rocky forces himself to begin running again

               ext elevated train station  dawn

               heading along spring garden street rocky passes beneath an 
               elevated train station the roaring train overhead seems to 
               blend perfectly with his muscular running style

               ext docks  dawn

               the sky is beginning to lighten the fighter now runs along 
               the piers and past anchored freighters

               ext eastern packing company  dawn

               it is fivethirty and rocky approaches the loading platform 
               belonging to eastern packing company alongside the loading 
               platform come several boxcars

               rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door it soon 
               opens and paulie guides him inside paulie is drunk

               rocky notices two puerto ricans lounging alongside the 
               shipping office

               rocky smiles and paulie leads him out of the office and to 
               the large metal door of a walkin refrigerator

               int freezer  day

               they enter the freezer resembles a modern torture chamber 
               row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the 
               darkness to the far end of the refrigerator the blower 
               overhead causes the men to speak loudly

               paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat he 
               swills whiskey from a pint bottle

               from across the room rocky looks him hard in the eyes

               paulie reddens he steps forward and slams his fists in a 
               hanging beef

               the punching of the beef is a muted challenge and rocky 
               responds

               rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs

               the grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging 
               corpse rocky moves to the next one and hooks

               rockys face reveals a never before seen concentration as 
               though he were locked in total battle

                                     paulie

               rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of 
               beef paulies eyes widen and his face grimaces with every 
               punch like he were receiving it rocky moves into the dark 
               recess of the refrigerator only the dull sounds of his 
               pounding fists can be heard

               rocky works his way to paulie again every hanging beef swings 
               and appears surrealistically alive

                                     paulie

                         us to jail for murder

               rocky looks at his hands they are drenched in red up to the 
               elbows with beef blood

               paulie hands him a package of beef

                                     rocky
                         dont talk dirty bout ya sister

               rocky takes the package and runs out paulies bleary eyes 
               reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment

                         accidentally hurt 

               dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps rocky very hard across 
               the side of the head the gym becomes stone cold dipper 
               is in total command and enjoying every moment of it

               mickey looks nervously around and knows its only seconds 
               before the blood will run rocky stands motionless

                                     mickey
                              softly

               rocky swallows his pride he still has the string around his 
               ankles he starts to shuffle away with mickey dipper steps 
               forward and viciously slaps rocky again

               mike jumps forward

                                     mike

               dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks mike flat the room 
               reeks of fear apollos eyes flick back and forth between 
               rocky and dipper apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin 
               to ease away

                                     dipper
                         now boy kiss my feet

               rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor he shuffles forward 
               and stands before dipper

                              continuing almost 
                              in a whisper
                         kiss em

               rocky looks at mickey then lowers his eyes to dippers 
               feet dipper smiles rocky starts to bend towards the shoes 
               without warning he explodes with a pair of combinations 
               into dippers exposed ribs a crack is heard and dipper sinks 
               to the floor writhing in pain the room is silent except 
               for dippers moaning

               apollo is stunned by the scene the gym has become a very 
               gloomy place he eyes rocky with admiration and a hint of 
               apprehension he leaves

               mickey is the first one to shake off the chill he shakes 
               his fists at the reporters and puts his arm around rocky

                                     mickey

               the crowd disperses leaving dipper a pathetic and broken 
               figure lying on a dirty gym floor

               his eye rocky stops the projector as apollo is delivering a 
               knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent

               rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it 
               was a priceless painting he backs off and begins writing 
               on a note pad

                                                               dissolve to

               the first light of dawn streams through mickeys filthy 
               windows rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he 
               has lost interest in watching the movies

               the film has completed its run through the projector and 
               lazily flops around on the top reel listlessly rocky rubs 
               his reddened eyes

               the door opens and mickey flips on the light the two men 
               stare at each other for a long moment mickey studies rockys 
               despondent expression and knows what is on the fighters 
               mind

                                     mickey

                         do is try ya best

               rocky stands and with his dog inches past mickey and exits 
               the room mickey walks over and turns off the projector he 
               idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it slides 
               off the desk and crashes to the floor

               ext street  dawn

               after leaving mickeys gym rocky and his dog listlessly 
               move down the street and head for home

               prayer he stands and looks at himself in the mirror

               suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that 
               in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge 
               of his life

                         it undoubtedly means champion apollo 
                         creed is heading towards the ring 

                                     commentator 1

                         1976 off

               series of shots

               in the next ten rounds apollo cuts and slashes rocky to 
               ribbons but pays dearly both his eyes and lips are cut

               welts across his midsection attest to rockys bodybattering

               stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor

               the mounting cheers make her speed up she opens the door at 
               the end of the corridor and is hit by a thunderous wave of 
               sound the guard at the door inspects her and goes back to

               int arena  night

               adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the battle

               the men are fighting with appalling tenacity rocky rips and 
               tears into the body apollo counters with a ceaseless stream 
               of rapierlike lefts the challenger is seriously 
               outclassed

                                     apollo
                         cmon  lemme cut yo

               rocky wades in and creed employs incredible footwork he 
               sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross 
               to rockys already broken nose blood sprays from the wound 
               and red droplets drip from his chin

               rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a torrent 
               of combinations rockys eyes are closed but creed cannot 
               drop him the bell rings

                         punishing brawl i have ever seen  
                         the ringside audience is spotted 
                         with blood this fight should have 
                         been stopped rounds ago but rocky

                         not only has he refused to fall but 
                         he has beaten the champions body 
                         without mercy and the bout has become 
                         a vicious slugfest

               mickey nods to benny he secretly places a small ring knife 
               between his index and middle finger in one smooth movement 
               he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers 
               the draining wounds with gauze it is done so quickly no 
               one is ever aware of the operation

               at the rear of the arena adrian looks transfixed at the ring  
               she is caught up in the heat of the battle

               another angle

               the bell rings for round fourteen rocky bores in close but 
               apollo still has spring in his legs he seems determined to 
               end it this round apollo catches rocky flush on the jaw 
               rocky is staggered like a wolf apollo cuts loose with pure 
               savagery rocky is driven against the ropes and receives a 
               devastating beating from the champion rocky is dropped

               rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring everything 
               is a distortion he looks for familiar faces as though to 
               ask for help mickey and mike scream frantically for him 
               to stay down

                                     referee
                         six  seven  eight 

               rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy he is 
               like a wounded wild animal the tide suddenly turns

               rocky drops low and catches apollo with a pair of terrific 
               body punches that seem to drive apollos diaphragm up to his 
               throat a crack is heard a glaze of pain covers apollos 
               eyes it is only a supreme effort that keeps the champion 
               upright apollo is badly hurt he is bent over

               rocky moves towards apollo apollo flicks dread jabs into 
               rockys eyes the italian wades in with punches that seem 
               to bulge out apollos back creed takes the punishment like 
               a stoic

               blood is running from apollos mouth in the clinch he leans 
               over rocky and it drips down the italians neck and shoulders  
               apollo shields his wound from the ringside judges and 
               continues to fight

               another angle

               the bell rings apollos men rush out and guide him to his 
               corner

                         ribs broke 

               blood trickles from the corner of apollos mouth the trainer

                         rockys right the spectrum is 
                         nearly silent  neither fighter has

                         apollo spits blood on the canvas it

                         side his ribs were probably injured

               apollo feints and rocky falls for it the champion unleashes

               written on every punch rocky counters the assault blow for 
               blow

               the fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit 
               of strength from their souls and beat each other without 
               mercy they look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far

               as though reacting to some unspoken command they both step 
               towards each other and embrace apollo whispers in rockys

               control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing 
               clamor the fans shove the guards aside and hoist rocky to

               another angle

               she is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions 
               but she keeps her feet she sees him in the distance 
               rocky floats into view and adrian flattens against the wall 
               and waits for the procession to pass

               the procession approaches and she clearly sees rockys 
               unbelievably battered but smiling face he appears to be 
               king of the world

               the procession approaches and passes adrian she jumps on 
               her toes and waves frantically but is not seen she screams 
               rockys name somehow the delicate voice knifes through 
               the racket and reaches rocky

               rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages 
               to see adrian jumping up and down waving the crowd is 
               carrying him away  he attempts to lower himself but the 
               crowd wont permit it

               rocky instead turns and begins climbing across peoples heads 
               and shoulders he resembles a man trying to go up a down 
               escalator people are jammed so tightly together rocky manages 
               to crawl across them to adrian

               still suspended in air rocky leans down and adrian jumps up 
               and they lock in an embrace

                                     adrian
                         i love you  i love you  i love 
                         you

               the two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can 
               remember
