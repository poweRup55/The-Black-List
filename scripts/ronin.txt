     a blood red screen  a japanese drum starts to play softly
     but tinged with a desperate edge growing louder joined by
     other drums as a black legend scrolls up in feudal japan
     the warrior class of samurai were sworn to protect their
     liege lords with their lives  those samurai whose liege was
     killed suffered a great shame and they were forced to wander
     the land looking for work as hired swords or bandits  these
     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as samurai
     they were known by another name such men were called ronin
     the words hang on the screen and we hold for a beat and then
     the drums are cut off by  a silenced gun shot thwpfft

     fade in on

     int a medieval cathedral  night

     its dark and so it takes us a minute to realize were
     moving up stone spiraling stairs up up up in what we now see
     is a medieval cathedral  and as we continue moving up
     something trickles down into frame  blood  running thin
     then thicker as we continue to move up the stairs and find 
     a body sprawled awkwardly across the stones arms and legs
     akimbo not so much christlike as victimlike  in one hand
     the body holds a gun he never had a chance to use  in the
     other  a dark shape we cant quite tell what it is
     footsteps sound from above and  the killer walks into frame
     silenced pistol dangling at his side  we dont know him and
     its going to be a while before we see him again but mark
     his face because well see him again  the killer now picks
     up the dark shape in the bodys hand and we see its  a
     briefcase  the killer cuffs the briefcase to his wrist and
     turns to  two men standing behind him subordinates  the
     killer shows them the briefcase

                          killer
               god loves me

     the body suddenly twitches  this guy is not quite dead
     the killer raises his silenced pistol

                          killer
                   to his victim
               but i dont think hes too fond of you

     slam cut to

     ext a back street  paris  night

     a phone rings replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
     we expected to hear

     rainslicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
     streetlight

     ext a phone booth at the end of the street

     the source of the ringing  we start to push slowly in one the
     phone booth and as we do we hear the voice of an ugly
     american

                          ugly american vo
               what is this

     cut to

     int a drive bar in paris  night

     a soccer match is in progress on a tv which sits above the
     bar in this smokey dim dive

                          ugly american os
               this is not football

     and now were pulling back down the length of the bar  we
     see three men sitting seperately at the bar paying no
     attention to each other  one of these men watches the game
     with real interest  the ugly american talks on from off
     screen

                          ugly american os
                   continuing
               football is three hundred pound guys
               they run way too fucking fast they got
               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
               the quarterback into the next life

     slam cut to

     ext the street outside

     the phone is still ringing louder now and were moving
     towards it while looking through an unseen pair of eyes and
     even as we drink this in were back in 

     int the bar

     at the end of the bar  larry the ugly american  hes got
     an obvious attitude all of it bad  but theres something
     about the guy  hes not all bluster and he has the look of
     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble
     hes big and yeah hes got a gut but the rest of him looks
     solid

                          larry
                   talking to the air
               you wanna know what football is  its
               hitting the other guy dirty and then
               spitting in his face when hes down
               football is all things american and
               american is anumberone the absolute
               fucking best there is  thats what
               football is
                   he points to the tv
               and thats not football

     the one man at the bar whos been watching the gam turns
     slowly and gives larry a long look  this is vincent french
     hard boiled and solid  charming when he wants to be which
     isnt all that often  he gives larry a long look and then
     speaks 

                          vincent
                   to larry in perfect english
               football  american football  is a
               game for faggots

     a beat  the other two men at the bar who seem like tough
     customers themselves pretend not to watch too closely but
     theyre interested whats larry going to say  for a moment
     it seems as if hes pissed but then suddenly a smile breaks
     out on his face and he laughs heartily at vincents remark
     vincent joins in as do the others  in particular  the
     bartender looks relieved  hes tough enough to toss a bar
     drunk but these guys are in a different league  the
     bartender laughs with the others happy to have avoided a
     confrontation as we go back to 

     ext the street outside

     were almost on top of the phone booth the phone is still
     ringing as a hand reaches into frame and snatches the phone
     from its cradle

                          a womans voice vo
                   a touch irish accent
               yes

     another angle  and we see a woman named deirdre on the
     phone striking darkhaired irish  she carries herself
     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar
     deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end
     and before she speaks she sense something  a silhouette
     stands in the shadows of the bar watching deirdre  she
     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking her
     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat

                          deirdre
               can i help you

     the silhouette steps into a pool of light  this is sam
     tough lean enigmatic  somebody you might trust but whom
     youd never cross  sam returns her look before he speaks

                          sam
               no

     sam moves towards the bar and deirdre returns to her phone
     conversation

                          deirdre
               im here
                   a beat responding to a
                    question
               no it was nothing

     int the bar  a minute later

     sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
     at the bar talking casually recognizing theyre somehow all
     here for a reason  with larry and vincent we see  gregor a
     man from eastern europe  his accent is hard to pin down
     but he most definitely has one  gregor has the air of an ex
     spook and thats exactly what he is  lastly we see swede 
     blonde muscular and somehow blank in the face  no hes
     not stupid  hes a sociopath  now  sam looks at the
     group which grows quiet as he enters  finally sam speaks

                          sam
               sorry im late

                          vincent
                   a challenge
               what makes you think were here to meet
               you

                          sam
                   meeting vincents gaze
               who else would you be

     vincent turns towards the others including them in an
     expansive gesture

                          vincent
               perhaps the police

                          sam
               i know cops  and youre no cop

     vincent smiles at sams answer satisfied and makes room for
     sam to join them  vincent takes a pack of cigarettes shakes
     them so that one sticks out and offers it to sam

                          vincent
               cigarette

                          sam
               no thanks

     vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go 

     ext back outside  same time

     the pay phone makes a sharp noise as its cracked back into
     the cradle  deirdre stands at the phone booth lost in
     thought  then without warning  deirdre spins around
     pulling two guns from inside her coat  the move is fast
     performed with the grace of a professional killer as deridre
     scans the horizon but nobody seems to be watching  deirdre
     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street
     the better to watch 

     the bar  and as deirdre watches the bar we watch her
     pulling back from deirdre up into the air and then moving
     through to 

     int a cheap apartment  same time

     looking through a window donw onto the street below  barely
     visible we can see deirdre  and staring at deirdre  the
     watcher  somebody were going to see periodically through
     the movie  right now hes only a silhouette with a well
     defined pair of hands  and in those hands  a knife  as the
     watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife
     methodically perfectly  and he watches  first deirdre and
     then turning his attention to the bar  hes especially
     interested in the bar

     a time cut to

     int the bar  later

     the bartender is wiping out a last glass  when this is
     finished he looks up at 

     a table in the back 

     where our five guys have relocated  now the bartender and
     vincent exchange a look and then the bartender takes out a
     set of keys and tosses them  through the air and they smwack
     into vincents hand  the bartender and vincent speak in
     rapidfire french and then the bartender is gone  sam turns
     to vincent

                          sam
               he trusts you to lock up

                          vincent
               lets just say he knows who i am

     vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
     around the table  again nobody takes on  vincent seems
     really disappointed by this

                          larry
               anybody wanna tell me what were waiting
               for

                          vincent
                   lighting his cigarette
               the question isnt what were waiting
               for its who

                          larry
               and who the fuck is that

                          gregor
               whoever hired us

                          sam
               i got this gig through a contractor
               and he most definitely didnt know who
               was doing the hiring only that they
               were paying a lot of money

     theres a kind of general look around the table  a nod or
     grunt of acknowledgement indicating that all of these men
     were hired the same way

                          sam
                   continuing his thought
               so none of us knows whos paying the
               freight this is just some anonymous job
               for all we know were working for
               different people

                          gregor
               now that is an interesting proposition

                          swede
               how so

                          gregor
               because if theres more than one party
               involved if we really are working for
               different people then perhaps some of us
               are on different sides
                   with great meaning
               your orders might be different from mine

                          larry
               whatre you talking about man  i dont
               understand

                          swede
                   quietly but loud enough to be
                    heard
               what a surprise

                          larry
               i got a surprise for you blondie

                          gregor
                   sharply as if hes used to
                    giving orders
               why dont both of you shut up

                          larry  swede
                   to gregor at the same time
               fuck you

                          sam
               knock it off

     there is a beat  gregor swede and larry look at sam who
     glares them all down  lastly sam turns and looks at
     vincent  the two men nod at one another acknowledging a
     kind of mutual respect

                          sam
               the point remains we could be working
               for different people  theres a chance
               for one of us
                   looks around the table
               maybe more than one of us  has been
               paid to cross the others  i dont know
               about you guys but i like to know who
               im working for  it can help prevent a
               great deal of
                   finding the right word
               unpleasantness

                          larry
                   patting the gun inside his
                    cheap suit
               anybody tries to unpleasant me ill put
               two between his eyes  one to do the job
               and the other to make sure it takes

     from off screen we hear a new sound laughter  another angle 

     deirdre has entered the bar and shes amused by this last
     exchange

                          deirdre
               its good to see youve all got such
               faith in our little undertaking

                          larry
               who the fuck are you

                          deirdre
                   staring at larry
               the name is deirdre and im running this
               show

                          gregor
               who are you  ira

                          deirdre
                   with a brittle laugh
               not likely  once yeah i was  but
               there wasnt an inch of profit in it and
               im a cash oriented girl if you take my
               meaning  im a hired gun same as the
               rest of you and thats all any of us
               needs to know about the other

     deirdre hands out several thick envelopes  larry and swede
     open theirs and stare at the wads of franc notes stuffed
     inside  even gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
     money  but neither vincent nor sam takes a look

                          deirdre
               from here on in you want something you
               pay cash for it no credit cards no bank
               accounts are in place ten percent up
               front the rest when the job is done
                   a quick beat then she looks
                    at gregor
               you  what do you do and what should we
               call you

                          gregor
               these days they they call me gregor  and
               im a tech  i do electronic work
               surveillance computer runs

     deirdre turns to sam

                          sam
               sam  im a weapons guy

                          deirdre
               you were a soldier were you

                          sam
               once

     deirdre gives sam a look  and he returns it  finally
     deirdre turns to larry

                          larry
               i drive  and my name is larry  larry
               from the states

                          deirdre
                   she turns to vincent
               and who are you

                          vincent
               im vincent  and i coordinate

                          sam
                   sharply
               coordinate what

                          vincent
               things  this is my country you know

     the two men exchange another look  a pecking order is
     developing among the group vincent and sam are both natural
     leaders and now theyre feeling one another out

                          deirdre
                   to vincent
               coordinate all you want but make sure
               whatever you do gets cleared through me
                   vincent doesnt respond for a
                    moment
               are we in sync on this vincent

                          vincent
               of course

     deirdre waits a beat letting vincent know what she isnt any
     more intimidated by him than he is by her  finally she
     turns to swede

                          swede
               they call me swede

                          larry

     cut to

     int a warehouse  day

     a paper target in the shape of a human being dances in
     place as it is riddles with gunshots each shot hitting the
     target in the belly each shot fired by  larry whose been
     shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which hes just
     discharged an entire clip  the gun is empty larry turns to
     sam who stands next in line

                          sam
                   looking at the target
               you shoot alright

                          larry
               gets the job done

                          sam
               all in the stomach though  your man
               might live

                          larry
               not for long

                          sam
               long enough to shoot back

                          larry
               is that right

                          sam
               its been known to happen

                          larry
                   a challenge
               why dont you go do better then

     without a word sam pops a new clip into the gun and shoots
     the lights out of several other human targets hitting each
     target in a different place  one he clips between the eyes
     the next in the heart one in the groin and then the last
     target  he splits down the middle firing shot after shot
     from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
     half  larry is impressed in spite of himself

                          larry
               yeah well  my way works too

                          sam
               my way is better

     in a corner of the warehouse 

     gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
     electronic whizmos  right now gregor is holding a
     particularly hightech type cell phone in his hands looking
     at it almost lovingly

                          deirdre os
               is it alright

     another angle  deirdre sits nearby looking at the cell
     phone

                          gregor
               its quite satifactory

                          deirdre
               good because it cost enough  theres
               cheaper phones by far than that one man
               you better fucking use it

                          gregor
                   almost caressing the phone
               i intend to  this phone is wired like no
               other its got an encryption chip and
               instant satalink recognition it can
               talk to any computer in any language and
               make it understand  with my custom
               hardware and this phone i can trace the
               targets cell phone signature and follow
               him anywhere he goes

                          deirdre
               you sure about this

                          gregor
               id stake my reputation

                          deirdre
               but would you stake your life thats the
               question

                          gregor
               in this business your life and your
               reputation are more often than not one
               and the same

     from off screen we hear munching  its  larry inhaling a
     sandwich  a malicious look comes over swedes face whos
     cleaning a pistol and sitting near larry

                          swede
               you should watch what you eat

                          larry
               who the fuck died and appointed you food
               czar

                          swede
               im just worried about your health
               larry  you could stand to shed a few
               pounds

                          larry
                   sensitive about his weight
               and you could stand to get a little
               smarter aint that right you dumb blonde
               fuck

                          swede
                   sensitive about the dumb
                    blonde thing
               who you calling dumb dickless

     both men eyeball one another and then suddenly larry reaches
     for his piece and as soon as he does this swede does the
     same thing but before they can do anything  deirdres gun
     swings into frame smashing swede in the face and dropping
     him to the floor  larrys mouth drops open in surprise but
     its too late deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
     rabbit punches him in the back of the neck driving him to
     the ground

                          deirdre
                   standing above them
               next one of you fuckers plays this game
               im going to do for you myself  i wont
               say it again we dont have time for this
               shit  theres a clock running on this
               job gentlemen and i mean to be on
               schedule

     a tense moment as deirdre stares down at these tough guys 
     letting them know whos in charge  a sound from off screen
     interrupts this moment a door opening as we see  vincent
     who stands in the door wearing his coat and hat

     hes been out somewhere and he looks first at the squabbling
     men and then at  deirdre  she gives vincent a little nod 
     a silent command that makes vincent turn to sam

                          vincent
               lets go for a ride

     vincent and sam start off moving towards the door while swede
     and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground

                          sam
               where to

                          vincent
               to see a man about a thing

                          sam
               i can do that

     ext the warehouse  sunset

     a desolate urban landscape  sam and vincent walking away
     from the warehouse which is housed in what looks to be the
     toughest neighborhood in the city filled with cheap concrete
     public housing and industrial buildings

     the setting sun throws a red glow on the street giving the
     raw concrete buildings a bloodcolored tint as sam and
     vincent approach a fiat a car neither too old nor too new
     before they can reach the car the two men are intercepted by
     four toughs young guys in their early twenties  the leader
     of the toughs apporaches vincent

                          leader
                   subtitled french
               who gave you permission to park here

                          sam
                   to vincent
               whats he saying

                          vincent
               pretty much what youd expect

                          sam
                   with a sigh
               thats what i thought

                          leader
                   in french
               theres a charge for parking on our
               block

     the other toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks in french
     of course

                          vincent
                   to sam
               he says this is their block

                          sam
               as in they own it

                          vincent
               something like that

                          sam
               and i suppose hes saying that we oughta
               give them something for using it huh

                          vincent
               i didnt know that you spoke french

                          sam
               i dont  but the language hes speaking
               is universal

     angle on the leader  whos smirking at vincent and sam
     sams words make a great deal of sense the leader is
     speaking the universal language of give me some money or
     ill kick your ass

                          sam os
               i guess we oughta give them something

     cut back to vincent and sam

                          vincent
               if you think we should

     vincent backfists the leader in the nose  hitting him so
     hard that the leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
     sits down on his ass  this blow hurt but the real damage is
     to the leaders pride  now  one of the toughs rushes at
     sam only to have sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
     which savagely jerks the tough off his feet and flattens him

                          sam
                   as if it were an accident
               oh man i am sorry about that
                   he sticks his hand out
               let me give you a hand

     sam reaches down as if to help the tough who ignores the
     hand and totters to his feet  as soon as hes up he turns
     and runs away followed by the other toughs  now only the
     leader is left behind  he looks for a second at vincent and
     sam and then turns and runs after his friends  vincent
     calls after him in french but whatever he says isnt
     translated  vincent turns to unlock the car

                          sam
               whatd you say to him

                          vincent
               i asked if we could give him anything
               else

     by now the two men are in the car which starts up and drives
     off as it does we 

     cut to

     int the fiat  same time

                          vincent
               that was a nice move you did on our young
               friend  judo

                          sam
               jujitsu

                          vincent
               same thing isnt it

                          sam
               not at all  similar but not the same

                          vincent
               whats the difference

                          sam
               ones a lot more painful than the other

     vincent laughs and sam looks out the window at the city of
     paris as we move through to the outside world of 

     ext paris driving montage  twilight

     a series of quick cuts of the car driving through paris at
     night  we dont see familiar sights like the eiffel tower or
     the arc de triomph but instead  we travel through the left
     bank down a series of mazy alleys which twist and turn
     filled with bistros bars and falafel joints  neon signs
     line the streets for as far as the eye can see  near the end
     of this trip we hear the sound of a match flaring followed
     by 

                          sam vo
               could i get one of those

     int the car  still driving  same time

     vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette  he tosses his
     pack to sam but he seems a little surprised at sams
     request

                          vincent
               help yourself
                   quick beat
               since when do you smoke

                          sam
                   lighting up
               i have i dont know maybe a cigarette a
               week

                          vincent
               a cigarette  as in one
                   exasperated almost to
                    himself
               one cigarette a week who smokes like
               that

                          sam
               i do

                          vincent
               christ i smoke a packandahalf a day
               and i tell myself i could be worse
                   takes a satisfying drag
               its just so damned pleasurable

                          sam
                   blowing a smoke ring with
                    great skill
               it has its moments
                   stubs out cigarette
               course you get cancer and die thats
               the down side

                          vincent
                   with a sigh
               there is that

     vincent stamps his cigarette out looking vaguely unhappy
     that sam has spoiled his smoke

                          sam
               so vincent why bring me along for the
               ride  job like this calls for a warm
               body somebody who can stand around and
               look threatening  a tough guy

                          vincent
               like larry or swede

                          sam
               exactly  why not bring them

                          vincent
               lets just say i thought the
               conversational possibilities were
               limited  of course i might have brought
               gregor but he didnt seem like the right
               candidate  for this

                          sam
               watch that one hes an exspook for
               sure maybe stasi maybe kgb  hes
               smart gregor is

                          vincent
               so is the woman

                          sam
               deirdre  smart yeah and seriously
               goddamned dangerous

                          vincent
               i wonder if she truly left the ira

                          sam
               ive wondered that myself  none of this
               answers my question though
                   suddenly direct
               why bring me

                          vincent
               i wanted to see who you were

                          sam
               who am i

     vincent driving all the while gives sam a sideways glance
     before speaking

                          vincent
               you were once some kind of special
               forces  airborne ranger maybe a navy
               seal  after that you rode shotgun for
               the cia in some place like el salvador or
               afghanistan a real mercenary
                   beat
               only now  now youre like the rest of
               us its a very competitive market since
               the end of the cold war  theres a lot
               of hired guns out here and not nearly
               enough work to go around

                          sam
               thats right theres not hardly enough
               work these days nothing that pays the
               big money anyhow  then along comes this
               job paying so much goddamned money i
               couldnt afford not to take it  somebodys
               paying through the nose for this

                          vincent
               they certainly are  whatever it is were
               going to steal it must be quite
               something

                          sam
               whatever it is it must be goddamned
               priceless

     and on that thought we 

     cut to

     ext a side street  night

     the fiat pulls up to the curb and vincent and sam get out
     vincent leads sam around a corner and they come to 

     an exquisite park a small perfectly manicured place  a
     kind of miniluxembourg gardens in the middle of nowhere
     when sam sees the park he draws an involuntary breath

                          vincent
               lovely isnt it

                          sam
               theyd have to keep something like this
               under lock and key in new york and it
               would still get fucked up

     the two men enter the park which is indeed open to the
     public  inside sitting on a bench in the back almost
     invisible from the street we see  francois a stubblefaced
     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth  vincent and sam
     draw near  this next conversation between francois and
     vincent is in french with english subtitles

                          francois
               thats good right where you are vincent

     vincent signals for sam to stop  both vincent and sam are
     still several feet away from francois

                          vincent
               do you have it

                          francois
               not so fast
                   nods slightly to sam
               whos that

                          vincent
               hes company

                          francois
                   as if he recognizes sam
               bad company

                          vincent
               what do you mean

                          francois
               hes a cop vincent hes french and hes
               a cop and you better shoot him in the
               fucking head right now

     sam hasnt said a word  he doesnt seem to understand
     whats been said but he has noted the urgency with which
     francois spoke  now  we hold for a beat  neither vincent
     nor francois pulls out a piece to shoot sam  instead they
     wait to see if sam will respond in any way to what francois
     said  the conversation now switches to english which it
     turns out francois speaks fairly well

                          sam
                   to vincent
               whats going on

                          vincent
               i just wanted to see something

                          sam
                   that edge creeping into his
                    voice
               see what

     vincent isnt going to answer but the overbearing francois
     chimes in

                          francois
               he wanted to see how you reacted when i
               said that you were a cop

                          sam
                   he cant believe this
               you told him i was a cop

                          francois
               he asked me to say it

                          sam
                   looking at vincent truly
                    pissed
               he asked you to

                          vincent
               i needed to know

                          sam
               you need to know a lot of shit vincent

                          francois
                   to vincent in subtitled
                    french
               are you ready

     francoiss french words give sam pause  hes wondering
     whats being said as  vincent moves towards francois
     leaving sam several steps away  the conversation is again in
     subtitled french

                          vincent
                   taking out an envelope
               heres yours

                          francois
               theres been a slight problem

                          vincent
                   immediately tensing
               whats that

     francois gives the slightest of nods indicating that vincent
     should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away 
     a copse of trees where we see a sniper pointed a telescopic
     rifle at vincent

                          francois
                   still in subtitled french
               if you say a word in english vincent my
               friend with the high powered sporting
               rifle will shoot you in the throat
               sorry to screw you over like this but
               the information you want might get me
               killed if i give it to you and thats a
               price im not willing to pay

                          vincent
                   in french
               i take it you still want the money

                          francois
                   in english with a grin
               of course

     sams pov looking at vincent and francois

     the men are talking and from here we cant really hear them
     speak  all sam can see is an earnest vincent listening to
     francois talk almost as if francois is giving vincent
     instructions  now  vincent reaches into his pocket
     reaching for the envelope of cash hes carrying  as he hands
     the money to francois vincent uses his free hand to pull out
     his gun while  sam already has his gun out  somehow he
     figured out what was going on  and now francois looks on in
     stunned disbelief as 

     sam fires a single shot hitting francois in the shoulder
     driving him away from  vincent who now squeezes off several
     rapid fire shots at the sniper while  francois bleeding
     but still very much alive now has his piece free just as 
     the sniper his gun firing wildly into the air falls to the
     ground shot dead by vincent and now  francois is drawing a
     bead on vincent when  sam hits francois with a fusillade of
     bullets in the chest and now  a single spent bulled casing
     flies through the air in slow motion and lands on the ground
     spinning around until it comes to a halt and  a heavy
     silence falls as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
     dies  vincent and sam look at one another see that theyre
     still alive and then look back at  the two men theyve
     shot  francois isnt quite dead  blood bubbles from his
     lips as vincent leans over him  again they speak in
     subtitled french

                          vincent
               wheres my information

                          francois
                   with a grim smile pointing to
                    his head
               in here

                          vincent
               then you better find it in your heart to
               tell me francois because while your
               death is inevitable it still isnt
               decided how painful its going to be

     a long angle  vincent whispers in francoiss ear whose grin
     blanches as he realizes vincent means to hurt him  francois
     whispers something back and then  bang  vincent shoots
     francois in the head killing him instantly  then vincent
     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which francois
     had tucked inside his shirt  as vincent does this sam comes
     up from behind

                          sam
               now would be a good time to get the fuck
               out of here

     int the fiat  laternight

     the two men drive in silence for a moment  vincent lights a
     cigarette and offers one to sam who refuses  finally sam
     speaks

                          sam
               you know what you pulled back there
               that was bullshit

                          vincent
               i needed to see if you were a cop
                   defensively
               im a popular man with the police sam
               and whenever they try to catch me they
               always do it with an inside guy  some
               man on some job who seems more
               trustworthy than all the others put
               together  and thats the guy you have to
               watch out for
                   beat
               i hate cops

                          sam
                   insulted that vincent would
                    even consider it
               well i aint a cop

     a beat the two men driving in silence

                          vincent
               how did you know

                          sam
               know what

                          vincent
               that there was a gun pointed at me

                          sam
               i saw you look off when francois nodded
               his head  i figured he wasnt pointing
               out a particularly rare shrub and the
               rest was easy

                          vincent
               but how did you know i would have the
               presence of mind to pull my weapon
               when i did

                          sam
                   as if its obvious
               because thats what i would have done

     cut to

     ext an apartment house  a little laternight

     vincents fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
     apartment house  vincent and sam exit the car and move
     towards the house  a silence hanging between them  right
     before they go into the house vincent takes out the envelope
     full of cash that was supposed to have been for francois  he
     thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to sam

                          vincent
               you saved my life back there in the park
               i know this doesnt begin to make it
               right between us

     vincents voice trails off  he doesnt know what to say
     sam takes the money out of the envelope  half he keeps for
     himself the other he gives to vincent

                          sam
               what i did back in the park i did because
               were working together  were on the
               same team
                   holding up the money
               this is business  this is work  we did
               it together we share the spoils even
               split

     sam opens the door to the house but vincent has one last
     thing to say to him

                          vincent
               i owe you a heavy debt

     sam almost smiles cynically at this debts of honor dont
     seem to be something he believes in

                          sam
               whatever you say

     they enter the house and the door closes behind them  a
     second later we hear 

                          deirdre vo
               whatd you do with the money

     int the house  a little later

     vincent and sam sit with deirdre in a room alone  theyve
     told her about the park and she seems a little pissed about
     all of this

                          vincent
               we kept it

                          deirdre
                   a little annoyed
               is that right

                          sam
               hazard pay

                          deirdre
                   with an exhalation of disgust
               the two of you were supposed to go to a
               simple meet and come back with a simple
               piece of information and instead you
               went to fucking war

                          sam
               we werent real thrilled about it
               either

     deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises  we follow her
     into 

     an adjoining room 

     where larry swede and gregor are waiting  they look up
     expectantly at deirdre who crosses through the room without
     stopping  shes really pissed about this turn of events

                          larry
               so whats the deal

                          deirdre
                   barely stopping very
                    snappish
               the deal  the deal is we leave for nice
               at first light

     and she exits leaving these three men behind along with sam
     and vincent who have entered from the other room  larry
     looks at the two of them

                          larry
               whatd you guys do

     ext outside the house  later that night

     a car sits cloaked in shadows  inside sits our friend the
     watcher  once again we see the watchers knife  once again
     he manicures his nails with it almost delicately as he
     watches the house  its dark  a single light glows behind
     a window on the third floor  sams room

     int sams room  same time

     sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
     do a martial arts form  right now hes frozen one leg
     extended in a kick balancing on the other leg  now  a
     knock at his door  seconds later it opens  deirdre stands
     there watching as sam holds his position for a beat more
     and then retracts his leg

                          deirdre
               i feel as if ive wandered onto the set
               of enter the dragon  could you teach me
               to do that

                          sam
               i didnt think to see you again tonight
               you were pretty pissed

                          deirdre
               i still am

                          sam
               is that right

                          deirdre
               thats right

     deirdre spings at sam throwing martial arts combinations at
     him punch followed by kick elbow strike followed by palm
     thrust  sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
     floor until hes got his back to the wall  their movements
     are controlled but powerful and theres something almost
     flirtatious about the whole thing  now 

     deirdre throws one last punch which sam ducks  he slips
     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest  the
     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
     exercise but now  they spar for real  they never hit one
     another but they come awfully close hands and feet whizzing
     through the air throwing rapidfire combinations and
     techniques  theyre not angry but theyre not kidding
     either  finally  deirdre feints a punch that distracts
     sams attention from  the kick she throws right behind her
     punch and she smiles as  whump  sam wasnt distracted at
     all  he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
     and now  shes trapped beneath him  the two of them are
     breathing hard from the exertion their faces close to one
     another shining with sweat and excitement and  weve gone
     from flirting to an almost primal seduction and with their
     faces only inches apart deirdre leans in to kiss sam and
     hes about to meet her half way when he pulls back

                          sam
               part of me says i should just look at
               this as a perk  you know a bonus  but
               then i remember youre you  deirdre
               who used to belong to the ira  and it
               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
               come very naturally to you

                          deirdre
                   kissing him very lightly
               nobodys saying they dont

                          sam
                   returning the kiss just as
                    lightly
               and when i consider that i have to
               wonder if you dont have some ulterior
               motive for being here with me right
               now

                          deirdre
               i probably do
                   pulling him close
               but for the time being im willing to
               forget about it

     they finally kiss slowly and then building in intensity and
     as they start to make love the

     camera moves up  through the building floor by floor until
     weve reached 

     ext a rooftop garden  meanwhile

     deirdre and sam are not the only ones indulging in
     extracurricular activities  up here in this rooftop garden
     we find swede and gregor talking in hushed tones

                          gregor
               i would imagine that the great
               satisfaction in all of this will be
               killing the american

                          swede
                   we know this isnt true
               i hadnt thought about it  understand
               me gregor  i take no pleasure in
               killing  it doesnt bother me one bit
               but i dont get off on it

                          gregor
               a means to an end is that it

                          swede
               thats it

                          gregor
                   he rises to leave
               then i guess were set

                          swede
               there is one other thing

                          gregor
               whats that

     suddenly swede pulls gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
     thud  within seconds he has his gun pressed to gregors
     head

                          gregor
               what are you doing

                          swede
               dont cross me

                          gregor
               nobodys going to do that

                          swede
               really

                          gregor
                   truly frightened
               i need you swede i cant do this
               without you

                          swede
                   beat then he puts his gun
                    away
               i just wanted to make sure you knew who
               you were dealing with

                          gregor
               i do i do

     swede is now on his feet walking away back into the
     apartment house

                          swede
                   this is almost to himself
               just remember it then

     and hes gone  and as soon as he is we notice something
     strange about gregor hes not the least bit scared  he
     laughs a little low laugh as we  

     dissolve to

     ext the house  dawn

     gray light seeps in from the horizon while inside in 

     int sams room  same time

     deirdre is pulling her dress over her head  sam seems to be
     sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
     when 

     sams hand reaches out gently yet firmly and takes her by
     the arm

                          sam os
               no goodbye

     another angle  sam is somehow sitting up wide awake 
     looking at deirdre with a penetrating glance

                          deirdre
               look sam dont take it the wrong way
               when i tell you we wont be doing this
               again

                          sam
               you dont have to explain yourself to me
               deirdre

                          deirdre
                   almost surprised by this
               i know i dont have to sam its just
               that for once i want to  when i was a 
                   almost with a sneer
               patriot it was a given id sleep with
               any man it was deemed necessary for me to
               sleep with  you know any man who needed
               setting up  sometimes so we might
               blackmail him sometimes so he could be
               killed
                   a quick beat
               sometimes so i could kill him myself
               ira isnt exactly an enlightened feminist
               organization sam  to most of the men i
               with i was always the girl  send the girl
               to do it  tell the girl to take care of
               it  have the girl fuck him
                   a quick beat
               but i look at you and i get this feeling
               you take me for what i am no more no
               less

                          sam
               youre a hired gun deirdre  just like
               me

                          deirdre
               exactly  and last night i wanted to be
               with someone who was just like me

     somewhere in all of this deirdre has sat back down on the
     bed and somehow now shes only inches away from sam
     theyre lips brush and 

     a muted phone rings in a nearby room breaking the moment  a
     quick beat then 

                          deirdre
               i better be getting that

                          sam
               duty calls

                          deirdre
                   with a trace of a sigh
               just business

     deirdre gives sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
     his door  the muted phone is a little louder now  deirdre
     closes sams door as she exits but  sam reaches out a hand
     and catches the door right before it snaps shut  he watches
     through the door crack as  deirdre cross the hall and
     opens the door to her room and now the phone rings loudly
     until the door shuts muting the sound once again shutting
     sam out  the phone stops ringing as deirdre answers and as
     this happens sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
     to  black  just for a second  and then  blinding sun hits
     us in the eyes as we find ourselves above 

     ext nice  day

     a dazzling overhead moving shot establishing that weve
     changed locales moved to a place filled with sun and blue
     water and reflective surfaces the cote dazure  we start to
     move down towards 

     ext a private beach  nice  meanwhile

     a topless grandma reclines on a beach chair soaking up rays
     sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a waiter
     nearby 

     at a round table 

     a nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in we
     find our group deirdre sam vincent gregor swede and
     larry  food and drink surround them  larry is of couse
     still eating

                          deirdre
               now then lets run through it one more
               time shall we
                   to gregor
               whats your job

                          gregor
               i use my cell phone to get computer
               access to the telecommunications
               satellite used by our target  i trace
               his cell phone signature and use it to
               pin point his location as he moves
               through nice relaying that information
               to you

                          deirdre
                   to larry
               next

                          larry
                   a sigh hes done this too
                    many times
               you call me with the targets route i
               follow along until weve reached the
               attack point and then i run his squag ass
               off the road

                          deirdre
                   to swede
               which leads us to

                          swede
               i ride with fatboy

                          larry
                   under his breath
               eat shit and die slowly

                          swede
               after we stop the target car i get out
               and use the heavy artillery to kill the
               driver and his bodyguard

                          larry
               i blast the lead car into oblivion

                          vincent
                   picking up
               while sam and i take out the back two
               cars

                          deirdre
               leaving

                          swede
                   picking it up
               leaving me to step in drop the target
               in the back seat and get the package

                          deirdre
                   with a quick look at sam
               while

                          sam
                   returning her look
               while i back him up making sure to
               get the package if something goes wrong
               and somebody takes swede down

     nobody else seems to notice this look between them but we
     should  if only to note that theres something about the
     way deirdre queries sam about his role and something about
     the way sam answers her without overly reacting  theyre
     not flirting but theres a kind of acknowledgment of the
     history they now have between them  but  nobody else
     notices and swedes line follows sams without breaking the
     flow of the dialogue

                          swede
               nobodys taking me anywhere

                          deirdre
               and then

                          larry
               then swede and i split with the package
               and meet you back at the rendezvous

                          deirdre
               and then

                          vincent
               and then sam you and i clean up
               whatevers left to be cleaned

                          deirdre
               very good  now all we have to do is live
               long enough to get paid

     ext a posh hotel  later  night

     a row of rooms each one with a light behind a shade  even
     as we watch the light in each room goes off one two three
     four five six lights  one for each member of the team  the
     night before the big event nobody breaks curfew

     across the street 

     a bar 

     through the bar window we see the watchers silhouette  a
     match flares as the watcher lights a cigarette revealing his
     face for the first time weathered sharp treacherous  the
     match goes out and the watchers face fades to black and so
     do we

     fade in on

     ext the hills of nice  morning

     a private estate in the hills 

     a caravan of black armor plated cars all idling ready to
     pull out filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
     their jackets all of them waiting for  the target  except
     weve seem him before and he wasnt called the target he was
     the killer from the first scene of the film the gunman in
     the cathedral who made off with   the briefcase  which the
     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side  now the target
     gets into his car a black mercedes and as soon as hes in
     the caravan pulls out and  the target takes out his cell
     phone punches in a number and starts to talk and as he does
     we  pull back into the air leaving the caravan behind as
     we move towards the water and 

     the promenade des anglais the long roadway that runs the
     length of the town adjacent to the beach  its a special
     place a huge road for cars along with a promenade for
     tourists  here we come upon 

     an outdoor cafe 

     where we find deirdre a laptop in front of her wearing a
     headset  and lest we think she looks out of place we get
     a look at 

     the rest of the cafe 

     where many of the other patrons are typing away on laptops
     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone  she types a
     sentence on her keyboard and as she types she says it out
     loud

                          deirdre
               alright gregor im

     cut to

     int a cramped comptuer control room  same time

                          gregor
                   finishing her sentence
               ready when you are

     gregor is sitting behind a console looking at deirdres
     message which we can read on his laptop  gregor also has a
     much bigger computer with him as well and on this screen we
     see  a computer graphic map of nice  this is a map of
     incredible detail a hightech graphic rendering of nice
     now  the map starts to shift randomly moving about the city
     as it searches for the proper signal  the computer isolates
     an entire district of the city enlarges a part of the
     district and then locates and enlarges a single street  now
      on screen a flashing cursor appears on the map the target
     the cursor starts to move down one of the streets of nice and
     as we follow the curson it turns into  the target car
     driving home the point that gregor is now locked onto the
     target  the japanese drums we heard in the opening sequence
     start to play again  softly ominously and were on 

     ext a side street

     where vincents fiat is parked at a curb sam and vincent
     sitting inside

     int the fiat

     vincent sits behind the wheel while sam sits next to him
     loading a small arsenal of weapons

     the drums grow a little louder now a little more urgent

     ext another street

     a volvo idles waiting for something larry behind the wheel
     of this car and sitting next to him swede  the drums
     continue to play and their volume is still low but theyre
     jarring setting our nerves on edge

     int the volvo

                          larry
               where is this broad

                          swede
               you should learn a little patience

                          larry
               is that right

                          swede
               its consider a virtue in some corners
               of the world

                          larry
               not in mine

     the car phone rings and swede pushes a button  deirdres
     voice is heard on the speaker phone

                          deirdre vo
               hello gentlemen are we ready

     ext the cafe

     deirdre looks at her laptop and relays gregors instructions
     she speaks over her headset as if shes conducting ordinary
     business  as if shes giving someone traffic directs
     over the phone  the japanese drums continue quiet and yet
     intense

                          deirdre
               you want to take a left then so that
               youre going west

     during this next sequence the drums will continue to play
     building with the action as we do 

     the chase montage a series of cuts as 

     the volvo takes a flying left turn 

     gregor watches the target on his computer as it moves towards
     the promenade des anglais typing the results on his
     keyboard as  the volvo careens down a steep hill hits a
     bump and flies through the air a good fifteen feet even as 
     the fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump does
     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud 

     the caravan of cars 

     the target car 

     the target still talking away on his cell phone  the
     computer map tracking the targets movements as the map
     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target and now 

     the promenade des anglais is right ahead and the drums build
     to a crescendo as 

     the volvo smashes into the target car and they grind
     together as 

     cars 3  4 in the caravan are cut off by vincents fiat
     which forces them to slam to a halt as 

     larry runs the target car to a halt and the japanese drums
     stop

     larry and swede hop out of the volvo and swede brandishes a
     monster of a machine gun with which he opens fire a blast
     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire smashing
     against the windshield of the target car which is bullet
     proof  the windshield doesnt break right away  but the
     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle

     sam and vincent are now out of the fiat guns drawn blazing
     away at bodyguards and christ theres an army of them
     pouring out of cars 3  4  these guys are armed and returning
     fire as 

     larry gets out of the drivers seat of the volvo and hes
     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself a rocket launcher
     which he points and fires  and now we track the missle as
     it scorches the air traveling towards 

     the lead car of the caravan which has only now realized
     whats going on behind it and as frantic bodyguards drive
     back towards the carnage  the missle impacts blowing the
     car sideways

     meanwhile  sam and vincent are taking out the other
     bodyguards and these guys are warriors  they moves as a
     team each man with a gun in both hands using a weapon until
     its out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
     one

     and even as this is going on  deirdre has joined the fray
     firing both of her pistols taking sams place at vincents
     side so that sam can run towards 

     the target car where the target is seated in the backseat
     pulling out his own piece ready to fight to the death
     himself as 

     swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
     monster gun and now  the windshield has started to crack
     and splinter and abruptly it shatters instantly bursting a
     bright red as swedes bullets tear up the body of the driver

     now sam has reaches the target car just as the target who
     is armed and as we know not exactly helpless steps out of
     the car and sights in on swede and  zing  sam fires
     winging the target knocking the gun out of his hand and
     still the target wont give up without a struggle he hits
     swede with the briefcase

                          the target
               fuck you

                          swede
               not today

     bang  swede puts one shot between the targets eyes ending
     his life  now  swede takes out a daisho the smaller of the
     two traditional japanese samurai swords  with one slashing
     blow he hacks off the targets hand at the wrist and grabs
     the briefcase  the severed hand is still caught in the
     handcuffs so that it is carried along for the ride  now 
     distant sirens sound from off screen as swede moves back
     towards larry and the volvo and as he goes he raises the
     briefcase with its severed hand in a kind of mock salute to
     sam who starts to move back towards deirdre and vincent who
     have taken care of the remaining bodyguards and now the
     sirens are growing closer as we  start to move in slow
     motion as swede approaches the volvo and  deirdre and vincent
     are already at vincents fiat waiting for sam and so they
     dont notice that  a van has been parked nearby this entire
     time and now the vans side door slides open and unseen by
     any of the others  gregor steps out of the van a gun at his
     side and a predatory look on his face as  swede reaches larry
     and the volvo just as  sam has reaches the fiat and now he looks
     back and sees  gregor crossing the street and now  sam
     screams a warning to larry but its way too late because 
     swede shoots larry in the neck hitting him above the
     protective covering of his bullet proof vest  now were
     moving in real time as  larry manages to get his backup
     piece drawn a snubnosed 38 and he fires all six shots
     into  swede hitting him in the stomach  its the same way
     larry shot the target in the warehouse  swede is sent flying
     backwards where he crashes to the pavement  for a second we
     think hes dead but then he gets up in pain but alive just
     as sam predicted  swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
     too wears a bullet proof vest  by now  larry has rolled out
     of the volvo crawling away but too weak to go far and now 
     swede has larry in his sights hes going to kill him

                          swede
               i dont particularly like killing tubby
               but i want you to know that this one im
               going to enjoy

                          larry
                   sees something over swedes
                    shoulder
               i dont think so

     swede turns to follow larrys gaze and as he does  gregor
     walks into frame and puts his gun right beneath swedes chin
     before swede can even compute this gregor pulls the trigger
     firing straight up into swedes brain  then without even
     looking at larry who is lying helpless on the ground 
     gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the volvo driving
     off just as  sam arrives kneeling down by larry  the sirens
     get louder

                          larry
                   in shock
               he justi dont believe that sonof
               a

     vincents fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them
     vincent and deirdre inside it as sam manages to get larry
     into the back seat  sam doesnt get in the car yet as larry
     says 

                          larry
                   still having trouble believing
                    it
               weve been crossed

     the sirens reach a crescendo as a group of gendarmes arrive
     charging with automatic weapons drawn  between the french
     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the target car
     and now  sam takes out a grenade pulls the pin and rolls
     it across the ground beneath the mercedes which the cops
     have just reached  seconds later  the car explodes cutting
     off the cops and as this happens vincents puts the pedal to
     the floor and gets the fuck out of dodge  we start to slowly
     pull back on the remains of this battle the dead bodies the
     shot up cars the broken glass and that flaming smoking
     hulk of a mercedes in the middle of the street

     dissolve to

     ext the old citynice  sunset

     the fireball of the car turns into a blood red sun as it sets
     in the western sky tinting the stone buildings of the old
     city a coppery red

     were moving through the old city through the twists and
     turns of what an american would call back alleys but that
     pass for streets in this place  it is quiet almost deserted
     then  a testosterone crazed playboy whips his sports car
     through one of these streets engine whining as we  move
     down yet another side street and this sucker really is a
     back alley you couldnt get a car down here if you tried
     finally we come to  a rat trap of an old building and we
     push tight on this building as we hear 

                          larry vo
               what is this

     int a back apartment  same time

     a syringe is plunged into larrys arm  sam is tending to
     larrys wound  sam seems to know what hes doing as larry
     is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make
     shift stand

                          sam
                   answering larrys question
               its a cocktail  mostly demerol cut
               with a little crank because we might need
               you awake in the real near future

                          larry
               fine with fucking me we got work to do
               i dont care what it takes we are
               getting our property back and putting it
               into the hands of the people who are
               gonna pay us a great deal of money when
               we do  i dont know about the rest of you
               guys but im not the kind of guy
               to just sit back and take it in the ass
                   a quick beat
               i dont mean that in like a literal
               way

                          deirdre
               of course

                          vincent
               finding this package is a thing easier
               said than done  we dont even know what
               it is
                   he looks at deirdre and
                    suddenly hes deadly earnest
               what did we steal

                          deirdre
                   suddenly defensive
               i dont know

                          vincent
               when this whole thing started you made it
               clear youre running the show  and i
               dont believe youd be running this show
               if you didnt know what was going on

                          deirdre
               well i dont

                          vincent
               and i dont believe you

     vincents gun is out in the blink of an eye at deirdres
     head but shes as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
     well jammed into his stomach

                          deirdre
                   suddenly feral 
               you go shoot me if you want vincent but
               youll be dead before i hit the ground

                          vincent
                   matching her intensity
               i dont want you dead woman i want the
               the truth

                          sam os
                   with a dead cool in his voice
               both of you

     another angle  sam has the two of them covered with his gun 
     an interesting moment because he can shoot either deirdre or
     vincent but not both at the same time  the question is
     whose side is he on

                          sam
                   continuing without missing a
                    beat
               put your guns down and chill out

     a beat  and then vincent and deirdre lower their weapons
     followed by sam

                          sam
               like it or now were on the same side
               were here and the package isnt
                   looks at deirdre
               youre not the boss any more youre our
               partner  so tell us what you know so we
               can figure a way out of this mess

     sams look isnt romantic but it implies a level of trust
     based upon their physical intimacy

                          sam
               now what did we steal

                          deirdre
                   she hates to admit this
               i dont know
                   defensively off vincents
                    look
               well i dont  its a goddamned mystery
               to me just like it is to you
                   quick beat then reluctantly
                    continuing
               but i do know who were working for  my
               people and the russian mob

                          larry
               your people  who the fuck is your
               people

                          vincent
               who do you think larry  the ira

                          deirdre
               and you believed me
                   passionately
               but it wasnt my people who did it

                          larry
               how do we know that

                          sam
               because if they had shed be gone along
               with the package instead of sitting here
               with us

                          deirdre
               exactly  gregor he was the russians
               man  it was my people came up with the
               idea for this run but the russians who
               had the capital to finance it  gregor
               he was their insurance and i was ours
               everybody else was supposed to be
               neutral  gregor mustve got to swede

                          larry
               i never did trust that blonde fuck

                          deirdre
               thats why you were riding with him

                          vincent
               the question still remains what do we do
               now

                          sam
                   he figures something out
               gregors cell phone

                          larry
                   to himself
               what are you gonna do call him up and
               ask him to give us back our shit

                          sam
                   ignoring larry to deirdre
               did he bring that with him

                          deirdre
               i bought it for him  all the stuff he
               was using it was in his contract  cost
               a nice penny too especially that
               goddamned phone gregor had expensive
               tastes

                          sam
               check this out
                   hes thinking on his feet
               gregors a spook or he was one until
               recently  when he was a spy he lived the
               life  you know a prince in some
               eastern bloc country where nobody had
               shit and gregor had everything  then the
               wall goes down  no more cold war  and
               gregor is out of a job  no apartment no
               special stores with western food and
               video tapes  i would bet dollars against
               shit that gregor liked that phone and he
               doesnt want to give it up  and i
               wouldnt be surprised if hes arrogant
               enough to think

                          deirdre
                   finishing his sentence
               that were too stupid to trace his calls

     deirdre and sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
     as they realize theyre both thinking the same thought they
     might still win this one

     ext aix en provence  twilight

     were on perhaps the most beautiful street in all of france
     the cours mirabeau in the town of aix

     outdoor cafes line the sides of the street while a canopy of
     interlocking trees covers everything  now were  moving
     down the street towards a cafe where a dapper gent sits
     sipping a mineral water  the gent has a satchel at his feet
     now  a jeep pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
     neutral  the dapper gent throws some bills on the table and
     gets up crossing to  the jeep  a door opens and the
     dapper gent carrying his satchel gets into the jeep which
     drives off as we 

     cut to

     int jeep  same time

     gregor and the dapper gent drive in silence for minute down
     the length of the cours mirabeau

                          gregor
                   breaking the silence
               its a beautiful street no

     the dapper gent also has an accent a much thicker one than
     gregors its an accent that places the gent as a resident
     of what used to be called the soviet union

                          dapper gent
                   he cant wait any longer
               do you have it

                          gregor
               always in a rush you are  all these
               years ive known you you could never
               wait for anything

                          dapper gent
               this is important

                          gregor
               do you really think so

                          dapper gent
               you know it is

     gregor still driving takes out a silenced pistol and the
     dapper gent reaches for his own piece

                          gregor
               relax

     the dapper gent loweres his hand leaving his gun in his coat
     gregor pulls the van to a curb

                          gregor
               look over there

     gregor  the gents pov through the windshield  a group of
     children are playing

                          gregor os
               do you see that one  the girl in the
               light blue dress

     we find one particular little girl around eight holding the
     end of a jump rope wearing a light blue dress  shes
     breathtakingly beautiful and now  gregor raises his
     silenced pistol as if to shoot her

                          dapper gent
               what are you doing have you lost your
               mind

     gregor pulls the trigger as he does so the dapper gent jogs
     his arm and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
     just as the shot goes off  missing its mark harmlessly
     shooting into a tree causing a single leaf to float to the
     ground behind the playing children  nobody notices a thing
     beat  the dapper gent is visibly shaken because there is no
     doubt that gregor would have killed the girl if the gent
     hadnt ruined his aim

                          dapper gent
               why did you do that

                          gregor
               to make a point  i dont know her and i
               was ready to splatter her brains all over
               the sidewalk
                   giving the gent a look
               i dont particularly like you so imagine
               what ill do if you try anything

     gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
     necessary and then starts the jeep as we 

     cut to

     ext a country road outside of aix  night

     a full moon casts a silver light over a field of wild grass
     a soft wind blows and the grass moves gently from side to
     side  now  gregors jeep glides down this road as we move
     through to 

     int the jeep  same time

                          dapper gent
                   squirming
               enough  weve been driving for an hour
               where is my package

     gregor smiles  hes been waiting for this  he pulls the
     jeep over and looks at the dapper gent

                          gregor
               its under your seat

                          dapper gent
                   incredulous
               what

                          gregor
               as my american friend larry would say
               are you fucking deaf  its under your
               seat

     the dapper gent looks down and sure enough the edge of the
     briefcase sticks out beneath the seat

                          dapper gent
               i cant believe youd do that gregor  i
               thought i trained you better than that

     with a laugh the dapper gent hands his satchel to gregor
     whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward
     he cant help himself he opens the satchel and there it is 
     cold hard cash in large bills enough for gregor to live like
     a prince for quite some time  gregor sucks in an involuntary
     breath and then looks back up to see  the dapper gent hasnt
     reached for the briefcase  instead hes taken out his gun
     and its only inches from gregors head

                          dapper gent
               ive never particularly liked you either
               gregor

     the dapper gent yanks out the briefcase and as he does 

     the severed hand comes whipping out along with it still
     attached by the handcuff chain  the hand flies up in the
     dapper gents face and we notice that the hand is starting
     to rot  its bloated and swelling and horrific and it
     scares the shit out of the dapper gent who drops his gun and
     fumbles with the briefcase as  thwpfftwe hear the sound
     of another silenced shot as we 

     smash cut to

     ext outside the jeep  same time

     a dark stain splashes against the passenger side window of
     the jeep  seconds later  the door swings open and the
     dapper gents body plunks out onto the ground  a moment
     later something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
     the gent as the jeep drives off  now  we hold for a beat on
     the dapper gents dead body which lies in the silver
     moonlight blood running out from beneath him while the
     severed hand palms the gents face fingers splayed out
     around his head  now  we hear the sound of phone tones
     and not just any phone

     int the jeep  same time

     gregor finishes punching a number into his cell phone  we
     hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
     picked up

                          phone voice vo
                   in russian english subtitles
               is it done

                          gregor
                   in english
               its done

     beat  the phone voice doesnt respond for a moment  whoever
     this is they didnt expect to hear from gregor  the voice
     switches to english

                          phone voice vo
               gregor is that you

                          gregor
                   with a low chuckle
               much to your disappointment no doubt

                          phone voice vo
               it was a mistake it shouldnt have
               happened

                          gregor
                   suddenly cold furious
               im in the middle of saving you people a
               great deal of money  the least you
               could do is have the decency to pay me

     beat

                          phone voice vo
               so what do we do

                          gregor
               what i do is none of your concern  what
               you should do is wait for my next phone
               call  im going to find a place where i
               can tilt the field in my favor  when im
               ready ill call you and tell you what i
               want you to do

     the phone voice says something unintelligible in russian cut
     off by gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we 

     cut to

     int the cheap apartment  dawn

     larry snores on the couch while deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
     bag on the floor  vincent sits in a ratty easy chair feet
     propped on an overturned crate dozing lightly  suddenly 
     vincents eyes open warily as if something has changed in
     the room  he looks around  no sam  vincent gets up takes
     out his gun and silently gets to his feet  he moves down a
     long hall and  no sam  now like a cat vincent moves into 

     the bathroom pitch black  he moves in swipes the string of
     the overhead light and  nothing  nobodys here  the only
     place left is the front door and now vincent approaches  he
     opens the door gun still at ready and moves out into 

     int the landing outside  same time

     this is a small building  there is no other apartment on
     the floor  at the far end of the landing there is a small
     ladder which leads up to 

     the roof  and the door which leads to the roof is flapping
     in a light wind

     ext the roof  same time

     vincent bursts onto the roof gun straight out finger on the
     trigger only to find  sam is there his gun pointed at
     vincent  a beat then both men give little laughs and put
     their weapons away like samurai so trained in combat that
     they know when its safe to relax

                          sam
               whats going on

                          vincent
               you werent around when i woke up i
               thought maybe something had happened
                   off sams look
               this has been one very fucked up job
               sam and im not taking any more chances
               on anybody
                   a quick beat
               including you

     in answer sam takes out vincents pack of cigarettes and
     tosses them back to him  vincent looks almost delighted at
     this

                          sam
               i came up here to sneak a smoke

                          vincent
               you were smoking

                          sam
               i hope you dont mind i took your pack
               it was on the table

                          vincent
                   very sincere offering the
                    pack
               please help yourself  smoke as many
               youd like

     sam considers for a minute and then takes one  vincent does
     so as well and he searches for his lighter which he cant
     seem to find because  sam has it and he lights their
     cigarettes and then hands the lighter back to vincent

                          sam
                   a shrug of the shoulders
               i borrowed that too

                          vincent
                   puffing contentedly
               of coursewhenever you feel like it
               just help yourself

                          sam
               i have a feeling im about to start
               buying my own

     beat  the two men smoke in silence looking out at 

     the curved shoreline of nice 

     which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
     buildings and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
     the road that leads into town the promenade des anglais

                          vincent os
               that was a bad bit of business today

     back on sam and vincent

                          sam
               it was at that

                          vincent

                          sam

               i had to do it times when the only way
               to get out alive was to see that the

               you might be a hired gun vincent but i
               got a feeling you cost more than two
               bits

     this conversation might have gone further but it is
     interrupted when deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof

                          deirdre
               christ i was starting to think that the
               two of you had thrown it in and walked
               away
                   to vincent
               theres someone on the phone downstairs
               asking for you and my somewhat limited
               french leads me to believe that he might
               have something to tell us about gregor

     ext the highway  later  night

     a car we havent seen before a citroen hums up the french
     highway in the night along on the road  its a postcard
     moment but only for a moment

                          larry vo
               im telling you

     int the citroen  same time

                          larry
                   continuing
               that i could be dead and id drive better
               than you

     deirdre is driving and larry  much to his chagrin  is in
     the passenger seat watching her every move

                          deirdre
                   very curt
               oh shut up

     in the back seat 

     sam and vincent have a map spread out  vincent is tracing
     gregors route so far and we follow his red magic marker as
     it traces a line up the highway

                          vincent
               hes going north
                   circles something on map
               thats aix en provence where he used the
               phone

     sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
     map  destination paris

                          sam
                   making up his mind
               hes going back

                          vincent
               not necessarily  he could go off road at
               any number of places  he might not even
               be in the country anymore

                          sam
               its paris  the routes too indirect for
               anything else  a guy like gregor he
               doesnt waste time on this road unless he
               has to be on it in the first place
               otherwise hed be out of the country by
               now  hes going to paris
                   beat
               now i just hope we can find him before he
               gets there

                          deirdre
               if somebody else doesnt find him first

     ext the town of orange  day

     orange pronounced auronge is a midsized town of fifty
     thousand souls  it is small charming quaint and it has
     one particular thing that no other town in france can claim 

     an ancient roman theater that has been painstakingly
     restored  we see this roman theater from the outside as we
     move through the streets of the town to the town square
     its packed  every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
     with a tourist having breakfast  this normally quiet place
     explodes one month out of the year when an internationally
     famous music festival is held in the roman theater  we come
     upon 

     a table of american tourists a family  dad is angry at mom

                          dad
               opera  this is an opera festival

                          mom
               i told you that henry

                          dad
               i thought you meant phantom of the opera
               you know andrew lloyd weber cats that
               kind of thing

     mom and dad continue their discussion but weve left them
     behind moving through the seats and cafes until we get to a
     cafe on the outskirts of the town square  here in the most
     removed table in the entire square we find gregor sitting in
     the shadow of the trellis  unless youre on top of him you
     cant see him but he can see everything perfectly  his cell
     phone sits on the table in front of him  he picks it up and
     starts to punch in a number

     cut to

     ext a rest stop on the highway  meanwhile

     the citroen is parked among a number of other cars  sam is
     sleeping in the back seat while vincent is seen on an
     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot
     deirdre and larry sit at a nearby picnic table eating french
     fast food which we get a good look at as we  pan the length
     of the table which is covered with pasta grilled sausages
     with dijon mustard really good fried potatoes

     in fact everything thats on this table is so far beyond the
     imagination of your average american truck driver that larry
     cant contain himself  hes stuffing himself washing
     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
     roadside rest stops  deirdre drinks coffee

                          larry
                   mouth full
               thisthis is incredible is the rest
               of europe like this

                          deirdre
                   with a laugh
               some places not all  italy for
               instance theyre serious about their
               food  but try bloody britain anywhere
               in the uk you dont get much fancier
               than a deepfried bar egg  foods not
               our thing you see

                          larry
               what is

                          deirdre

               me thanks

                          deirdre

               budweiser  you talk to me of beer and
               youve the unbridled gall to mention
               budweiser in the same sentence  thats
               not beer  christ its not even a poor
               excuse for rabbit piss

                          larry
               oh yeah  whatta you drink then

                          deirdre
               i drink what every civilized man woman
               and child in the world drinks guinness

                          vincent os
               i hate to interrupt a conversation of
               such cultural depth

     cut away to reveal vincent 

     who has finished his phone call and returned to join them

                          vincent
               but weve got to get back on the road

     vincent raps lightly on the car window next to sams head 
     sams eyes shoot open a light sleeper  all eyes are on
     vincent who waits for a beat before he reveals his news

                          vincent
               weve got him

                          larry
               im driving

     ext the town square  a little later  day

     gregor is seated where we saw him last  at the little table
     in the corner cafe  hes been here for hours observing the
     town square and now he finally sees what hes been looking
     for  two men definitely not tourists here for the music
     have entered the square  everything about these guys
     screams gunmen  now as gregor watches  a punkedout teen
     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope  the
     gunmen look around the square trying to see where gregor is
     but hes too far back in the shadows  the gunmen ask the
     teen a question to which the teen can only shrug his
     shoulders  now  the teen walks away leaving the gunmen to
     open the envelope and look at its contents which are quickly
     read  from off screen we hear the sound of gregor punching
     in a number on his cell phone  simultaneously the gunmen
     finish reading the instructions gregor has sent them and
     turn around to face  a pay phone  the phone rings and one
     of the gunmen goes to pick it up

     ext another street  meanwhile

     the citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl cruising
     the streets looking for gregor

     int the citroen  same time

     vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
     causes him to swear under his breath in french  its 

     the gunmen walking down the street

                          vincent
               i know those men

     sam frowns he also seems to recognize at least one of the
     gunmen  none of the others in the car notice sams reaction
     but we do  the gunmen are heading straight for 

     ext the ancient roman theater  meanwhile

     the midafternoon sun shines down on the open air roman
     theater  the theater itself is almost two thousand year
     old  a semicircle of seats surrounds a huge stage wall a
     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
     kind in the world  the gunmen enter at the bottom of the
     theater holding ticket stubs  they are with a tour group
     led by an ancient geezer who speaks in rapidfire french  as
     the tour moves off to see the stage wall the gunmen hang
     back and then separate from the crowd

     ext outside the theater  same time

     the citroen sits at a curb  larry sits behind the wheel of
     the car the getaway driver with the motor running  vincent
     and deirdre are already walking towards the theater  sam
     stays behind for a second to say something to larry

                          sam
               whatever you hear whatever happens when
               your partners come back out you make
               sure youre here with the motor running

     and on that note sam follows after vincent and deirdre
     larry doesnt notice it but  the watcher has found them
     hes a block or so away wearing a twoday stubble of beard
     and hugging the shadows of back alley  cradled in one hand
     barely visible but ominously present his knife which for
     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we 

     cut to

     ext inside the roman theater  meanwhile

     the gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum
     like staircase  behind them we can see the tour group
     standing on the stage being lectured to by the ancient
     geezer  in front of them the gunmen find 

     an exit which leads to an interior hall  inside the exit
     its dark while a bright sun falls down on the gunmen  they
     look into the dark unable to see a thing while a voice
     come at them from out of the dark

                          gregor vo
               thank you gentleman that will do
               nicely

     in the hall 

     on gregor  its dark in here  there are no lights no
     torches  from the dark in here he can look out and see 
     the gunmen who make plain targets backlit as they are by
     the sun  now we cut back and forth between these two angles
     and it becomes clear that gregor has chosen wisely  he can
     see his quarry but they cant see him

                          gregor
               edvard is that you

     edvard the more dangerous looking of the two gunmen
     responds

                          edvard
               yes gregor they sent me

                          gregor
               im touched really that theyd send
               someone of your caliber  its nice to
               know that they didnt make the mistake of
               underestimating me twice

                          edvard
               that was a mistake trying to kill you
               mikhi did it without consulting me id
               have never allowed it

                          gregor
               im sure  but im sorry to say that its
               too late for trust we have a serious
               problem

                               edvard
               well double your price

                          gregor
                   now thats interesting
               really  do you have the money with you

                          edvard
               do you have the material

                          gregor
               you first edvard

                          edvard
               perhaps we could both go at the same
               time

                          gregor
                   a short laugh
               i think not
                   with a flourish
               after you

     a gun comes into frame trigger cocked the barrel placed to
     gregors temple

                          sam os
               after you asshole

     gregor stiffens as we pull back on sam who has snuck up on
     gregor and gotten the drop on him

                          sam
               you might have been one mean technical
               spook gregor but you wouldnt have
               lasted a week in the field

     cut to the gunmens pov looking into the tunnel  its dark
     they cant see a thing but theyve heard sams voice and
     they know somethings wrong

                          edvard
               gregor are you alright

                          deirdre os
               gregors fine

     cut away to reveal deirdre 

     shes snuck up on the gunmen weapon drawn

                          deidre
                   continuing
               but i think youre in a bit of
               trouble

     the gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do 

                          vincent os
               dont even think it

     cut away to reveal vincent  and his piece is also out 
     the gunmen are trapped and they know it  now we notice that
      the ancient geezer and his tour group are coming towards
     us  meanwhile back in 

     the tunnel 

     sam is grilling gregor furiously his gun still to gregors
     head

                          sam
               dont talk to me unless you tell me what
               i want to hear understand  you have
               no choice in this dont think about
               winning think about staying alive  i
               want the item and if you dont give it
               to me im gonna kill you

                          gregor
                   a panicky hiss
               i dont have it with me

                          sam
               bullshit

                          gregor
               i swear

                          sam
               then where is it

                          gregor
               i sent it to myself in paris

                          sam
               sent it where

                          gregor
               a post office box

     suddenly gregor runs forward towards the exit  sam runs
     after him tackling him just as they reach  the outside
     where the two men roll into plain sight of  the gunmen who
     are still covered by vincent and deirdre  now we notice 
     that the ancient geezer and his tour group are really close
     no more than ten yards away as  sam has gregor pinned face
     first on the ancient stone of the theater  he looks up at
     the others and thats when it happens  edvard looks at sam
     and recognizes him

                          edvard
                   stunned announcing to the
                    group
               do you know who he is  hes with
               interpol the internation police  hes
               a cop

     a slow motion beat

     vincent and deirdre dont know what to make of this their
     heads turn to look at sam and in this instant  the tour
     group walks into their midst and  the 2nd gunman reaches for
     his piece and  sam fires his gun at the 2nd gunman and with
     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to real time as 
     the crowd panics screaming and now edvard is reaching for
     his weapon as  sam shoots again killing the 2nd gunman
     and now  the crowd is still screaming and running as 
     gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit as 

     deirdre pushes through the crowd and now shes made it into
     the tunnel  now we go 

     outside the theater 

     where larry has heard the shot  his piece is drawn but
     hes been ordered to stay in the car  in frustration he
     slams on the steering wheel as we see that  behind larry
     the watcher is slowly closing in knife poised to strike as
     we go back 

     into the theater 

     edvard tries to get to the exit but there are too many
     tourists in his way and he proceeds to shoot several of
     them including the dad we saw earlier  seconds later
     edvard has vanished into the tunnels and now  vincent and
     sam meet in the middle of the crowd  there is time for a
     quick beat while vincent glares at sam

                          vincent
               youre a copyoure a fucking copi
               should kill you

                          sam
               but you cant

     and now sam runs into the tunnel after the others leaving
     vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh and then follow
     sam into 

     the tunnels 

     its like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena
     except that everything here is made of stone and the only
     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
     just barely enough light for us to see  now we do a series
     of quick cuts  sam running followed by  vincent while 
     edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
     dead end  he turns around looking for a way out as  gregor
     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go 

     out in the street  larry is still behind the wheel of the
     citroen anxiously looking at the exit not realizing that 
     the watches is almost on him and now were back 

     in the tunnels 

     deirdre comes running around a corner and now shes almost
     reached the exit as 

     out in the street 

     gregor hits the street running  he doesnt notice the
     citroen parked ahead because hes never seen it before but
     as he runs by 

     the car door swings open and gregor runs straight into it
     he smashes into the door and falls to the ground injured
     strong hands reach out of the car and pull him in  its the
     watcher and lets give him a name now because he needs one
     seamus reilly  seated in the front seat is  a very dead
     larry  seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear

                          seamus
                   to gregor with an irish
                    accent
               if you want to live youll do exactly as
               i tell you

     through the back window  deirdre appears exiting the
     theater and running towards the citroen as we go back to 

     int the tunnels  same time

     vincent gun drawn moves warily down one of the tunnels
     outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren
     vincent turns a corner and  a gun jams itself into his face
     its edvard

                          edvard
               where do i know you from

                          vincent
               vienna

                          edvard
               of coursei remember  i quite liked
               you im sorry to have to do this

     edvards finger tightens around the trigger when 

                          sam os
               hey

     edvard is startled by the sound of sams voice  even as he
     squeezes off the shot edvard turns to look at sam and as he
     does so vincent strikes out at the gun sending the shot
     awry causing it to  ricochet wildly whining around the
     room until it  rips through sams side a nasty wound but
     not fatal as  edvard tries to fire another shot but its
     too late because  vincent fires a single shot to the head
     that kills edvard

     ext outside the theater  meanwhile

     deirdre has reached the citroen  she looks in and sees
     seamus and gregor  lastly she looks at the dead larry  she
     sighs in disgust but otherwise doesnt react as if
     surprised

                          deirdre
               cold cocking the poor sonofabitch
               would have sufficed seamus dont you
               think

     scant second later 

     larrys body hits the street as the citroen drives off
     deirdre behind the wheel just as  sam and vincent run out of
     the theater with vincent helping a wounded sam who bleeds
     from the wound in his side  they arrive at the street only
     to see  larry lying dead in the street even as the citroen
     speeds away from them turning the corner before they can
     even think to raise their guns

                          vincent
               that doublecrossing bitch

     sam isnt even capable of saying that much  he just stares
     after the departed citroen with a look on his face unlike any
     weve seen in the film how the hell did that happen  but
     theres no time to ponder this because theyve been joined by
      a cop  hes a local guy he directs traffic and busts
     drunks in the town square  and hes scared shitless
     holding his gun in both hands trying not to tremble as he
     stares back at  two guns sams and vincents and theyre
     both pointed at the cop  long beat  in the way off distance
     another siren can just be heard  sam and vincent glare at
     the cop who strains with all his might to control himself
     but he cant because sam and vincent are death waiting to be
     served  the cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
     mind  two  one  the cop puts his gun on the ground and
     steps back raising his hands in the air  now  sam and
     vincent stumble into the street and are instantly almost hit
     by  a car speeding around the corner its driver oblivious
     to whats going on  the car screeches to a halt and the
     driver curses loudly in french  and then the next thing the
     driver knows  a gun is in his face  the door is yanked open
     and the driver is yanked out as we 

     cut to

     ext a back road  laterearly evening

     the town of orange is just visible below us as the
     commandeered car drives up into the hills  vincent is behind
     the wheel while the wounded sam sits in the passenger seat
     gritting his teeth sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
      the wound and its small but bad  the ricochet ripped a
     small raw hole in sams side  the wound bleeds but
     moderately so  no major organs or arteries have been hit

                          vincent
               that makes twice now youve saved my
               life

                          sam

               risked it maybe  but i didnt save
               shit

               hospital

                          sam
                   sharply
               no hospitals  ill fix this myself if i
               have to

                          vincent
                   he cant believe this
               fix it yourself
                   a thought comes to him
               why are we even doing this  theres no
               need to run christ
                   he cant disguise his disgust
               youre a cop

                          sam
               not exactly

                          vincent
               youre with interpol  youre a cop

                          sam
               if i was a cop a real cop id have
               busted you a long time ago  this isnt
               about you its about the job i have to
               do

                          vincent
               and what job is that

                          sam
               my job vincent a job you dont need to
               know about  i cant go to the local cops
                theyd never be able to get close
               enough at this point  its me or nobody
               and ive been on this job too goddamned
               long not to finish

     beat  sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes offers one
     to vincent and takes another for himself  they smoke for a
     second before vincent speaks

                          vincent
               it looks to me like were all thats left
               of our group

                          sam
               we  there is no we in my world now
               vincent just me

                          vincent
               im going with you

                          sam
               this doesnt involve you dont you
               understand  i cant even guarantee you
               any money out of all this

                          vincent
               it isnt about money for me not
               anymore

                          sam
               you dont have to do this

                          vincent
                   with great finality
               yes i do

     sam gives vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief 
     vincents loyalty and sense of honor is something hes never
     seen before and sam can only smoke in silence and consider
     this as we 

     cut to

     int a cheap back room  night

     a peephole slides open and we look through it into 

     int an adjoining room

     where gregor sits bound and gagged in a chair his eyes wide
     with fright  now  the peephole snicks shut and deirdre
     turns to face seamus reilly

                          deirdre
               when were done with this i want to do
               for that one myself

                          seamus
               now theres the deirdre i know

                          deirdre
               and whats that supposed to mean seamus
               reilly

                          seamus
               it means i was worried that all the time
               you spent away from the fold might have
               affected you  youve been living the
               life of the hired gun  the well paid
               hired gun i might note  theres no
               glory to it but there are those that
               like it

                          deirdre
               so you thought that maybe id grown too
               attached to this charade ive been
               playing is that it

                          seamus
               its been known to happen

                          deirdre
               not to me you know that

                          seamus
                   goading her
               i thought i did

     seamuss taunt works deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
     to his head

                          deirdre
               i guess you dont know me then if you
               think i wont kill you for an insult like
               that

     seamus glares at deirdre for a moment and she glares back at
     him until he starts to laugh

                          seamus
               just testing lass  forgive me but i
               had to do it

     deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun

                          deirdre
               remember what we agreed on seamus when
               we get home i dont play the girl
               again

     deirdre gives seamus a look to make sure this last point is
     clear and we 

     cut to

     ext a farmhouse  the country  night

     the stolen car parks behind a barn and sam and vincent get
     out  waiting for them is a friend of vincents  jean
     pierre a frenchman in his forties hearty burly friendly

                          vincent
               hello jeanpierre

                          jeanpierre
               hello my friend
                   with a look at sam
               he doesnt look french to me vincent

                          sam
               american

                          jeanpierre
               well vincents american friend shall we
               see what we can do for you

     int the farmhouse kitchen  laternight

     surgical implements  are laid out on a clean cloth
     scalpel forceps a clamp a sponge medical thread and
     needles  we pull back to reveal sam stretched out on the
     kitchen table  around him we see  vincent and jeanpierre
     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining sams wound
     jeanpierre holds a mirror up so that sam can see whats
     going on  sam with his medical training is treating
     himself

                          vincent
                   to sam
               its right there beneath the surface  i
               can just make it out

     sam is in terrible pain but necessity dictates that he focus
     on whats going on so that he can talk vincent through this
     next procedure

                          jeanpierre
               are you sure you wont have a drink

                          sam
                   sharply
               no boozepains in the mind and the
               mind i can control
                   quick beat
               alright lets do it

     during this next sequence we cut back and forth between
     sams reactions to the surgery and the mirror itself where
     hes watching

                          sam
               douse the wound with alcohol

     vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
     wound and  sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
     central nervous system

                          sam
                   to jeanpierre
               take that sponge and wipe away as much of
               the blood as you can keep it clean so i
               can see

     jeanpierre does as sam says wiping away the blood that
     keeps filling the wound  throughout the procedure jean
     pierre will do this every time the sponge is saturated he
     squeezes the excess blood into  a bucket which sits on the
     floor slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge

                          sam
                   to vincent
               take the clamp

     vincent picks up the clamp

                          sam
               peel back the skin and attach the clamp

     vincent attaches the clamp to sams wound  it takes perhaps
     fifteen seconds and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
     for sam  he sweats he grits his teeth he grunts the
     smallest of grunts  but he doesnt move  finally vincent is
     done

                          vincent
               alright its done

                          sam
               you see the bullet

                          vincent
               clearly

                          sam
               good  now take the forceps and
               remember vincent what were doing here
               is routine  ive done stuff like this at
               least twenty times in the field  there
               are no vital organs where youre working
               no major muscles or arteries  you cant
               kill me  just make sure youve got the
               bullet before you try to pull it out

     vincent probes the wound with the forceps  this takes
     probably thirty seconds and it hurts even more then when the
     clamp was attached

     several times  vincent seems to have the bullet in his
     grasp but it slips and each time it slips  sam makes the
     smallest of noises as if to indicate the level of the pain
     finally  the forceps firmly grasp the bullet and with a
     single tug vincent extracts it

                          vincent
                   holding the bullet aloft
               a souvenir

     he tosses the bullet through the air and we follow it in
     slow motion as it lands in  a saucer which sits on the
     kitchen counter  were back in real time as the bullet
     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt
     now  sam breathes the hugest of sighs and his face relaxes
     instantly vincent puts a lighted cigarette in sams mouth
     and he drags deeply on it

                          sam
                   to vincent
               you think you can stitch me up on you
               own

                          jeanpierre
               dont worry well take care of it

                          sam
               then if you dont mind
                   he hands the cigarette back to
                    vincent
               im gonna pass out

     and thats exactly what he does

     a time cut to

     int farmhouse living room  later that night

     vincent and jeanpierre sit on easy chairs  an open bottle
     of wine sits between them a fire burns in the fireplace and
     they smoke in a contented silence for a moment  when they
     speak it is in french with english subtitles

                          jeanpierre
               hes tough your american friend

                          vincent
               yes sams tough alright

                          jeanpierre
               and you respect him

                          vincent
               of course  dont you

                          jeanpierre
               ive never seen a man who could have
               taken what he just went through
                   beat
               hes a cop

                          vincent
                   beat trying to find a way to
                    say it
               not exactly

                          jeanpierre
               not exactly  but close enough eh
                   beat
               so he saved your life then

                          vincent
               how did you know

                          jeanpierre
               if he hadnt youd have put a bullet in
               his head a long time ago

     both men stare back into the fireplace and we hold for a beat
     before we 

     dissolve to

     int the farm  kitchen  dawn

     sam is awake  pale from the loss of blood he moves softly
     around the kitchen searching professionally for something
     giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
     so intent on what hes doing and then he finds it  the
     coffee

     ten minutes later 

     a stream of hot coffee migles with a stream of steamed milk

     ext the farmhouse porch  sunrise

     a steaming cut of coffee sits in sams hands as he lights a
     cigarette to go with the coffee  he sits on an ancient
     chair smoking in silence looking out at  the woods around
     the house and this place is postcardbeautiful the french
     farmhouse you see only in pictures  but sams mind is
     elsewhere hes staring into space lost in thought

                          jeanpierre os
               youre feeling better

     another angle  jeanpierre stands in the open front door of
     the farmhouse with a cup of coffee  now jeanpierre moves
     out to join sam sitting down on another chair opposite him

                          sam
                   responding to the question
               some thanks  enough to move on for
               now

                          jeanpierre
                   pointing at sams wounded
                    side
               you should really let a doctor look at
               that

                          sam
               soon

                          jeanpierre
               but first you have something to take care
               of

                          sam
               yeah

                          jeanpierre
               something important  a thing that cannot
               wait

                          sam
               it gets done now or not at all  another
               couple of days and the parties concerned are
               gone where i cant get them

                          jeanpierre
               forgive my intrusion into your affairs
               but i am the one who connected vincent to
               this job his agent if you will  he is
               one of my oldest friends and i owe him a
               great debt much like the debt i suspect
               he owes you

     a quick cut to

     inside the farmhouse

     where vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
     a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
     outside

                          sam os
               vincent doesnt owe me a thing

     vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
     the sound of the voices

                          jeanpierre os
               he sees this differently as you well
               know

                          sam os
               i didnt expect that he would

     back on the porch 

                          jeanpierre
               you suffered through an agonizing pain
               last night pain you could have avoided
               by declaring yourself an agent of the
               law

                          sam
               vincent told you that im a cop

                          jeanpierre
               not a word  but no ordinary criminal
               would have the extensive military and
               medical expertise you do  and so i place
               the pieces of the puzzle together in a
               way that makes sense to me  you work for
               some government agency and you carry a
               gun and in my world that makes you a
               cop

     and now jeanpierre produces a long barreled revolver which
     he places loosely in his lap  a gesture which seems to say
     youd better explain things to my satifaction or were
     gonna have a problem  sam notices the weapon but he
     doesnt react overtly

                          sam
               so this is what a test

                          jeanpierre
               call it a reckoning of character

     beat  sam looks at the revolver again

                          sam
               if i was healthy i could take that away
               from you

                          jeanpierre
               perhaps  but you are not healthy and if
               you try ill kill you

     quick cut to vincent  who stands inside the house out of
     sight but not out of ear shot  hes listening to
     everything and we notice that vincent has taken out his
     own gun

     back on jeanpierre and sam  by now jeanpierre has raised
     the pistol  he doesnt point it at sam but his finger cocks
     the hammer

                          sam
               so what is it you want to know

                          jeanpierre
               i suppose i want to know how a man like
               you is created

                          sam
               created

                          jeanpierre
               perhaps forged is a better word  like
               steel  like a sword  youre a modern
               samurai  ive spent my life around
               extraordinary men  men like vincent
               but ive never seen anyone like you
                   beat
               im afraid vincent will die if he goes
               with you

                          sam
               vincents life is his own burden hell
               have to carry it for himself  and im
               not any kind of samurai

                          jeanpierre
               you seem one to me

                          sam
               a samurai has honor a samurai live by
               the code of bushido the way of the
               warrior  im just a killer for hire
                   beat
               the world isnt about honor anymore
               its about survival

     long beat  something in sams speech touches jeanpierre
     he relaxes his finger on the hammer

                          jeanpierre
               survival  i suppose thats as good a
               cause as any

     back on vincent  who relaxes his grip on his gun back on
     sam and jeanpierre  and were pulling back away from the
     farmhouse which glows in the morning sun as we 

     dissolve to

     ext a paris street  day

     a black compact car sits in front of a parisian post office
     inside the car behind the wheel we see deirdre  now
     coming out of the post office we see  gregor and seamus
     reilly  seamus has a coat slung over his arm hiding the gun
     which he keeps pressed to gregors side  theres no sign of
     the briefcase as seamus and gregor get into 

     int the car  sam time

     thunk  the door slams shut  gregor and seamus are in the
     back seat  almost instantly seamus angrily snaps a pair of
     handcuffs on gregor  immediately deirdre pulls out

                          deirdre
               wheres the case

                          gregor
                   nervous
               theres a problem

                          seamus
                   jumping all over him
               problem my ass  i think youre lying to
               me and if you are youre a dead man

                          deirdre
               would somebody tell me what fucking well
               happened in there

                          seamus
                   disgusted
               nothing

                          gregor
                   eager to explain
               the package didnt come  im sure it
               will tomorrow

     suddenly seamus seems to lose it  he grabs gregor and slams
     a gun against his head

                          seamus
                   hes almost foaming at the
                    mouth
               if youre lying to me you poor excuse for
               a human being im gonna blow your brains
               all over this car

                          gregor
                   beyond desperate
               i swear it has to come here  it has
               to

     beat  for one tensionfilled moment we think seamus is
     going to splash gregors brains all over the place  but then
     he smiles puts his weapon away and pats gregor gently on
     the face

                          seamus
               ease up manim just checking to make
               sure youre on the level

     gregor is beyond speech  he can only whimper

                          seamus
               and it seems to me i saw a sign in there
               that says they got a late afternoon
               delivery  why dont we come back later
               today and do this all over again huh

     seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
     sadistic  neither gregor nor deirdre smiles in return as we 

     cut to

     ext another street  paris  day

     the eiffel tower fills our eyes  and then we pull back to
     reveal that its a tacky flyblown poster on a dingy street
     and now were 

     moving down the street until we come to a store whose sign
     advertises in english  hong kong movies  the windows of the
     store are filled with posters  we move through to

     int the store  same time

     tony simon an expatriate black american runs this place and
     lives above it  his shelves are lined with action films made
     in the far east  tony knows everything there is to know
     about the films he sells  but he also knows quite a bit
     about whats going on in the parisian underworld  hes a
     professional information broker  right now hes talking to a
     customer in perfect french with english subtitles

                          tony
               hey man theyre both great movies  one
               is more of a character study the other
               is more of a straight action thing but
               theyre great movies and hes an amazing
               fucking filmmaker

     tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention

                          tony
               excuse me

     vincent and sam have entered the store  sams ability to be
     back on his feet in such a short time is amazing  but we
     can see that hes not the same guy he was at the start of the
     film  what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
     will  now  tony moves to join them and the conversation
     immediately turns to english

                          tony
                   to vincent
               my man how you doing

                          vincent
               im alright  and you

                          tony
               doing well
                   with a look at sam
               this is

                          vincent
               a friend  i was telling him about how
               you always have the latest tapes

                          tony
               why dont we step into my office

     tonys office it turns out is the area behind the counter
     tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
     to the other side and then he closes it behind him

                          tony
               so what can i do for you

     vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking  the
     place is empty except for  the single customer tony was just
     talking to  the customer is still considering the two films
     tony was showing him

                          vincent
               i was wondering if you had any movies
               that were particularly new

                          tony
               matter of face theres this flick ive
               been hearing about  i havent seen it
               but from what i hear its pretty cool

                          sam
               whats the story

                          tony
               its an international thing  several
               different peoples involved criminals
               from all over the world experts brought
               together to do a job  but maybe the most
               interesting thing about it is that
               preeminent in the plot we find the
               russian mob and the ira in bed together
               an unlikely group of partners

                          vincent
               do you have the tape

                          tony
               i might know where you could get a copy

     the customer approaches the counter  he has both tapes with
     him

                          tony
                   to vincent and sam
               let me do some business with my boy here
               and ill meet you across the street in
               five  i gotta make homes here feel like
               hes getting a good deal while i give him
               the pleasure of overpaying me for a
               couple of second generation pirates

     ext the street outside  a few minutes later

     the customer exits smiling and carrying his tapes  what a
     great fucking deal he just got  a few seconds later tony
     comes out and locks up the store front  he crosses the
     street towards 

     int a falafel joint  a few minutes after that

     a huge falafel drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end
     we pull back on  tony whos just taken a bite out of the
     falafel  he sits at a table in the back with vincent and
     sam

                          tony
                   his mouth full
               what ive heard so far its all a lot of
               talk  i wasnt so sure what to make of
               it at first cause like i said the
               irish and the russians are an unlikely
               mix

                          vincent
               you said you might know where we can get
               a copy of this tape

                          tony
               all depends on whether you want the
               russian or the gaelic language version

                          sam
                   instantly
               gaelic

                          tony
               you sure

                          sam
               im sure

                          vincent
                   to tony
               can you get it

                          tony
               the russian would be easier

                          sam
               whys that

                          tony
               cause the russian production company
               would be easier to find

                          sam
               its the irish tape we want

                          tony
                   with a sigh
               gonna be tough

     tony scribbles something on a piece of paper

                          tony
               last i heard there was a film rep for the
               irish players staying at this address

                          vincent

     sam reaches for the piece of paper but vincent puts his hand
     on top of it

                          vincent
               tony and i have to talk some business

                   to sam
               why dont you wait outside this wont
               take long

     sam smiles slightly and rises from the table moving towards
     the exit  behind him in rapidfire french tony and vincent
     are now discussing the price of the information  they are
     both loud and abusive and obviously theyre enjoying
     themselves immensely

     ext the falafel shop  a little later  day

     vincent exits the shop and gets into 

     int the peugeot

     where sam sits in the passenger seat as vincent slides behind
     the wheel  vincent tosses sam a piece of paper

                          sam
               the irish representative

               continue when it would be so much easier

     their pov through the windsheild  deirdre exits the
     apartment building

                          sam os
                   quietly exultant
               all things come to those who wait

     now deirdre is followed by seamus and gregor

                          vincent os
                   really surprised by this
               hes not dead

     back on sam and vincent

                          sam
                   figuring it out
               they dont have the package

                          vincent
               you think

               you said it yourself gregors not dead
               if they had the package theyd have
               killed him

     vincent and sam exchange a look  now they both figure it
     out

                          vincent  sam
                   simultaneously
               theyre going to get it

     cut to

     int the post office  late afternoon

     a hand signs a receipt and we pull back to reveal gregor at
     a counter signing for his package which slides across the
     counter  its the briefcase although its been wrapped in
     brown paper for its journey through the french postal system
     now we see that  seamus is still right beside gregor is in
     face almost on top of him with a hand in his coat pocket
     which lets us know where his gun is  now  the two men start
     to move towards the exit as we 

     cut to

     ext the street outside  a minute laterlate afternoon

     the black compact car idles at a nearby curb with deirdre
     behind the wheel  shes staring so intently at the front of
     the post office that shes surprised when a shadow falls
     across her  she looks up to see  sam standing next to the
     car  deirdre starts to reach for her weapon but sam cuts
     her off with a word

                          sam
               dont do it

     something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
     backs off  now she and sam exchange a long look

                          deirdre
               well if it isnt mr interpol himself
                   she really sounds betrayed
               i cant believe i misjudged you like i
               did

                          sam
               oh pleaseyoure on some sort of holy
               mission

                          deirdre
               im a patriate

                          sam
               dont even think that im buying that

                          deirdre
               where do you get off saying word one
               all the time pretending to be one of us
               its the same thing we were doing seamus
               and myself  and here you are so high and
               mighty like youre so different from the
               rest of us

                          sam
               i didnt say i was

                          deirdre
                   she sees something
               bloody fucking hell

     cut away to gregor and seamus are leaving the post office
     by now seamus has taken the package away from gregor
     unseen by these two men  vincent is approaching from the
     side on an intercept course his hand inside a bag which he
     carries with him  now  deirdre turns and shoots sam a look
     hes still watching her keenly and we can see that shes
     aching to reach for her piece but she cant because sam is
     still on her like a hawk

                          sam
               dont even think it

     he pulls back the folds of his suit jacket revealing his
     gun putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip

                          sam
               id kill you before you had it halfway
               out

     vincent is closing on gregor and seamus another ten seconds
     and hell have them

     now  deirdre looks back at sam then back at the situation
     developing in front of her and then suddenly  she slams the
     car into gear and drives off tires squealing while  sam
     pulls his piece sighting down the barrel and  he cant do
     it cant shoot deirdre  now  the sound of the car alerts
     seamus who turns in time to see  vincent who is raising
     the bag wrapped around his hand as  the car flies directly
     at  vincent who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
     pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag  the end
     of the bag explodes in a burst of fire but the shots are off
     the mark  missing seamus and gregor as  vincent rolls out
     of the way just in time while  deirdre brakes the car to a
     screaming halt as seamus pushes gregor in ahead of him and
     then gets in  seconds later the car pulls out even as 
     sam drives up in the peugeot to vincent who picks himself up
     off the ground and leaps into the car  the last thing we
     hear is the sound of sams voice as the peugeot drives off

                          sam vo
               put your seatbelt on

     cut to

     intext  car chase montage

     during this sequence well jump cut between the two cars and
     the streets they travel through  now  the black compact car
     flies down a small street followed closely by  the peugeot
     where sam is driving as vincent tries to steady his gun to
     get a clear shot at the other car

     inside the peugeot 

                          vincent
               what the fuck happened

                          sam
               i dont know

                          vincent
               you dont know  bullshit you had her
               there was no way out

     in the compact car 

     where deirdre is driving for dear life while seamus is
     freaking out

                          seamus
               what in bloody hell is going on

                          deirdre
               theyre part of the team  one of thems
               the guy i told you about

                          seamus
               from interpol

                          deirdre
               thats him

     in the peugeot 

                          vincent
               why didnt you kill her

     in the compact 

                          seamus
               why didnt you kill him

     out in the street 

     the two cars slam through the traffic heading for a highway
     ramp which appears now perhaps two blocks away

     in the peugeot 

                          vincent
                   figuring it out
               you slept with her

     in the compact 

                          seamus
               how is it these fellahs managed to get
               the drop on us

                          deirdre
               i told you theyre good

     out in the street 

     the two cars have reached the highway ramp and as first one
     and then the other pulls onto the highway we pull back and
     up to reveal

     the periferique 

     the massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
     city of paris  right away we notice that this entrance ramp
     leads to a traffic circle filled with various off ramps
     which lead to no less than four different sections of the
     periferique

     in the peugeot 

                          vincent
                   slamming the dashboard in
                    disgust
               you slept with her

     in the compact 

                          seamus
                   lecturing deridre
               you should have kill him when you had
               the chance  but no

     in the peugeot 

                          vincent
               you put everything on the line because
               you

     in the compact

                          seamus
                   as if finishing vincents
                    sentence
               you slept with the fucker

     on the periferique 

     the peugeot cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle
     while down below them  the compact turns towards one of the
     roadways

                     vincent os
          fuck

     in the peugeot 

                          vincent
               left left left

     sam looks up and sees  three possible ramps one to the
     right one to the center and one to the  left  at the last
     second he takes the left turn as we go back to 

     in the compact car 

     where seamus has turned from lecturing deirdre to threatening
     gregor  seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
     the other

                          seamus
                   waving the package
               this better be the real thing or youre a
               dead man

                          gregor
               it is im telling you it is

                          seamus
               youve told me a lot of things boyo

     zingshatter  a bullet blows a hole in their back windshield
     as  the peugeot is catching up and vincent is leaning out
     of his window firing away  now  seamus turns to deirdre

                          seamus
               lose them

                          deirdre
               you lose them

     deirdre swings the wheel wildly and the compact takes a
     screaming turn followed by  the peugeot and now theyre
     both speeding towards another junction where several other
     roadways of the periferique run together  now we see that 
     seamus is returning vincents fire even as  the junction
     approaches and now  seamus screams at deirdre

                          seamus
               to the right

     deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that shes now
     on an 

     exit ramp going against heavy traffic  now 

     deirdre swerves her car around sideswiping several cars
     but avoiding a major crash while  the peugeot follows along
     and now 

     one of the cars that deirdre sideswiped careens wildly down
     the ramp crashing into  the peugeot which grinds to a halt
     as vincent and sam bounce forward in their seats restrained
     by their seatbelts  the car has stalled and sam has to
     start her up again and slam it into gear before following
     after  the compact which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
     yards  but at least its possible for the peugeot to follow
     after the compact because its the only car on the highway
     ahead of them thats going the wrong way and now we  pull
     back looking down from above and the two cars are flying
     through the rushhour traffic going the wrong way and now 
     the peugeot is gaining ground as sam turns to vincent

                          sam
               give me a cigarette

                          vincent
               right now

                          sam
               gimme a goddamn cigarette

                          vincent
                   fumbling with a cigarette
               why are you driving
                   rapid fire
               youre not french you dont live here
               you dont know these roads  why are you
               driving

     he puts the cigarette in sams mouth and as he does  the
     peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic gaining ground on
     the compact and now  screeeeecchhh  about fifteen cars
     pile up crashing into one another and yet somehow  the
     compact car emerges from the pile up unscathed and seamus
     breathes a hugh sigh of relief

                          seamus
               about time

                          deirdre
                   glancing in her mirror 
               not yet

     the peugeot has also managed to avoid the pileup and its
     back on their tail

                          seamus
                   practically tearing his hair
               good christ  cant you lose these
               jokers

                          deirdre
                   through clenched teeth
               theyre good

     and now the peugeot slams into the side of the compact car
     and as it does  seamus opens fire with his gun even as 
     vincent unloads the better part of a clip as  glass shatters
     in both cars and now deirdre looks up to see 

     a fork in the road and the left side of the fork is closed
     off blocked by  a serious concrete barricade and the
     compact car is headed right for it and now 

     sam has the peugeot pinned right to the side of the compact
     car metal against metal a scream of steel as the barricade
     rushes straight at them and at the last second  deirdre
     slams on the brakes as 

     seamus fires one last shot that  blows out the window in
     front of sams eyes causing sam to  jerk the wheel of the
     peugeot wildly spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
     gregor reaches over and unbuckles seamuss seatbelt right as 
     the compact car slams into the barricade and crashes and
     were in slow motion as 

     deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact but
     theres a drivers side air bag and it explodes cushioning
     her even as 

     seamus is hurled form the car crashing through the
     windshield and flying through the air as 

     the compact car flips over and over and over while 

     gregor who is wearing his seatbelt hangs on for dear life
     to the briefcase which he grabbed back from seamus before
     the crash and now 

     seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud his face
     sliced to ribbons by the windshield but somehow still alive
     as 

     sam tries to control the peugeot which is in a spin on the
     exit ramp as 

     gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the car
     carrying the briefcase with him as 

     deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck which is
     now  on fire and now 

     sam has managed to stop the peugeot but its too late to go
     back because 

     a veritable fleet of cop cars is now closing on the accident
     and its too late to turn around and even as 

     deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck it 
     explodes into a ball of fire and the blast wave of fire 
     hits seamus knocking him down covering him for a second
     even as  deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
     out  rolling away with seamus who is now not only cut to
     pieces but his face is covered with some hideous burns

     now deirdre pulls seamus over the side of the embankment
     right before the cops arrive and the two of them rollfall
     almost thirty down a steep incline even as 

     sam catches a quick glimpse of 

     gregor scurrying away from the highway carrying the
     briefcase and now sam has to gun his car and get gone
     because the cops have reached 

     the wreck which is quickly burning itself out and as the
     cops look into the debris they see that 

     theres nobody left  everybodys gone

     fade out

                          vincent vo
               we dont have much time

     fade in on

     int vincents apartment  night

     a front door guarded by about five heavy locks opens and
     vincent and sam enter  sam looks around and surveys the
     apartment

                          sam
               nice place

     another angle  and we see the rest of the apartment theres
     practically nothing here  a table with a couple of chairs a
     fridge  an open door leads to a bedroom with a small spare
     bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp

                          vincent
                   by way of explaining
               im not here very much

                          sam
               business keeps you on the road

                          vincent
               something like that

     the two men crass the room towards  a metal cabinet which is
     tucked into a nook in the wall  vincents hand turns a heavy
     duty combination lock and then click the cabinet opens and
     we see  weapons  an endless cache of guns knives
     explosives surveillance devices gun scopes  you name it
     its here  now vincents hands reach into the cabinet and
     start taking out weapons  we pull back on 

     vincent who gives the weapons to sam  sam checks to make
     sure the weapons are loaded andor ready for use and then
     piles them one on top of the other

                          sam
               i know i dont need to say this to you
               but i need to say it to you

                          vincent

               leave me

                          sam
                   he says this too quickly
               in a minute

                          vincent
               i think not

     beat  sam cant say anything because he knows that what
     vincent is saying is true

                          vincent
                   considering the weapons
               do we need anything else

                          sam
               yeah  we need out fucking heads examined

     vincent thinks about this for a seoncd  and then burst out
     laughing as we 

     cut to

     int another car  meanwhilenight

     deirdre once behind the wheel  the passenger seat next to
     her is empty but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
     flick from the road in front of her to the rearview mirror
     which reveals 

     a glimpse of the hideous face of seamus reilly  crashing
     through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
     changed the way he looks his face is now a mass of oozing
     wounds and burn tissue  in his eyes we see the light of a
     sick twisted man whos gone over the edge

                          deirdre
               you better be careful seamus before
               something happens a plastic surgeon cant
               fix

                          seamus
                   a hideous laugh
               plastic fucking surgeon
                   indicates his face
               you think im going to fix this deirdre
               lass  its the mark of the patriot and
               ill wear it like a badge  as for those
               who done it to me ill take my pound of
               flesh before this is all over

                          deirdre
               youre thinking with your gun seamus
               and not your head

                          seamus
                   losing it
               shut up
                   he puts a gun to her head
               shut up and drive  im your superior
               officer and you will do as i goddamn well
               say is that understood

     beat  deirdre bristles at seamuss words but says nothing

                          seamus
               do i need to repeat myself

                          deirdre
               no seamus  i heard you the first time

     ext outside the car  same time

     the car zooms off into the night and as it does 

     a light rain starts to fall and we 

     dissolve to

     ext a chateau outside of paris  night

     the same rain falls more of a steady mist than a rain  the
     mist gleams electrically in the thousand watt lights which
     shine from  the chateau  hundreds of years old it sits far
     back from its own main gate  in front of the chateau  armed
     men  lots of them  whatever this place is its not one
     that invites company  now were  moving towards the
     chateau and as we move we get a glimpse of the surrounding
     environment ancient statues sitting benches in private
     gardens small pools of fish  you name it this place has
     it  we hear voices and theyre talking in  russian
     heavy thick russian punctuated with words like da and
     nyet  making it clear that weve reached the address of
     the russian production company  behind the chateau  more
     gardens more everything  its wellpatrolled but there
     arent quite as many guards back here as there are out front
     because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress 

     a woods 

     a forest really  filled with ancient trees almost mythic
     in appearance and for all the light of the chateau this
     place is darkness visible  light comes here and dies  and
     in this woods looking out we find  vincent and sam
     heavily armed theyve just humped god knows how many miles
     through the woods to get here  both men exhausted from the
     walk  sam from his wound vincent from his smoking habit
     they collapse and vincent takes out his cigarettes  even
     though theyre screened from the chateau back here sam
     reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of vincents hands

                          sam
               not here  they might see it

                          vincent
               if im going to die for the cia im
               going to go out smoking
                   takes the cigarettes back and
                    lights one
               besides theres half a forest between us
               and them they cant see a goddamned
               thing

     vincent offers one to sam who declines with a shake of
     his head

                          sam
               time to quit

                          vincent
               just like that

                          sam
               not just like that just before i turn
               around and its six months from now and
               the first thing i do when i wake up in
               the morning is light a cigarette

                          vincent
                   obviously he does this
               what of it
                   almost to himself
               samurai pain in the ass

                          sam
                   he hates this
               would you stop with that

                          vincent
               why  youve got more force of will than
               anyone ive ever seen  you handle a gun
               like its a part of you you perform
               surgery on yourself without anesthesia
                   quick beat
               and most amazing of all you quit
               smoking just like that

                          sam
                   qith a cynical laugh
               the mark of a true samurai
                   seriously
               what i do for the company vincent is no
               different than what you do  were both
               hired guns and this is a job  like any
               other job

                          vincent
               why then sam dont you act like this is
               a job like any other  surely if you are
               a hired gun you realize that some times
               you just have to walk away without
               getting what you came for

                          sam
               because i dont walk away

                          vincent
               why not

                          sam
               its the one thing ive got left to hold
               onto
                   beat
               jeanpierre is one of your closest
               friends is he not

                          vincent
               closest and oldest

                          sam
               and yet you would have killed him to save
               my life
                   quick beat
               you have a sense of honor vincent that
               i cant even remember anymore  i dont
               know that i ever even had it to begin
               with  all i know to do vincent is to
               finish my job

                          vincent
               and when you finish  what then  this
               package whatever it is do you give it
               to the cia  do you really think they
               deserve it

                          sam
               thats a good question

                          vincent
               do you have a good answer

                          sam
                   hes really just considering
                    this
               no i dont

     int the chateau  meanwhile

     armed russian mobsters everywhere  a convention of the goon
     squad

     moving through the chateau itself and from in here we see
     the side of france we havent yet seen in this film culture
     each room could be a museum as we move through 

     a gallery filled with paintings by renaissance masters 

     a parlor with antique furniture the youngest piece of which
     is two hundred years old 

     a ballroom empty and barren but lit by the dazzling light
     of an exquisite chandelier 

     a kitchen where a cigarette smoking chef is putting the
     finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
     youve ever seen  now  a servant takes the tray and carries
     it out to 

     a dining room and the table is set for a formal dinner for
     twenty with crystal and china at every place setting and
     yet the table is occupied by only one man 

     mikhael rachev russian gangster supreme called mikhi  now 

     the servant sets the food down in front of mikhi and as this
     chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we pull
     back moving down the length of the waytoolong table

     ext the chateau walls  night

     a taxi pulls up to the main gate and gregor gets out
     attached to his wrist by that same handcuff the briefcase
     gregor is admitted by a guard as we 

     cut to

     int the dining roomchateau  a little later

     mikhi the gangster is eating his dinner as gregor is ushered
     into the room  three thugs hang back behind gregor watching
     to see what mikhi wants  now 

     mikhi waves the thugs out of the room leaving gregor alone
     with the gangster  mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
     he motions for gregor to sit

                          mikhi
                   in russian english subtitles
               sit sit
                   offering a cigarette
               would you like one

                          gregor
                   in english
               no mikhi i wouldnt
                   letting that sink in for a
                    minute
               since i wont speak your language and
               you cant speak mine english will do
               nicely

                          mikhi
                   makes no never mind to him
               whatever you wish
                   lights his own cigarette
               this has all been a terrible mistake
               gregor  i wanted to play straight with
               you but edvard insisted we try and kill
               you

                          gregor
               edvard said the same thing about you
               before he died

                          mikhi
               im shocked shocked to think that youd
               believe him

                          gregor
                   suddenly sharp
               enough

     gregor raises the briefcase which is still attached to his
     wrist via the handcuff  gregor rests the briefcase on the
     table

                          mikhi
               ahh

     the moment of truth  before this scene can develop any
     further a voice comes from off screen and as the voice
     speaks gregor blanches

                          seamus os
               the moment of truth is it

     another angle  deirdre and seamus have entered the room
     and we notice something unusual nobody is alarmed except
     for gregor that is  its as if they were expected

                          gregor
               what is he doing here

     as seamus speaks he walks through the room examining the
     valuable china and crystal all the while moving inexorably
     closer to gregor  his face is if anything even more
     horrific than it was a short while ago as his formerly fresh
     wounds have started to scab over

                          seamus
               what am i doing here  why im here to
               see my partners gregor the boys in the
               russian mafia  see your bosses had
               hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
               your thieving double cross  but they
               only just found out that whats in the
               briefcase is completely useless without
               me  i cant fight them and they cant
               kill me  that means were gonna have to
               do business together

                          gregor
               but you hate each other

                          seamus
               whats a little hate between business
               partners

     ext the woods  meanwhile

     vincents cigarette is stubbed into a rock and the two men
     rise with a slow purpose  they exchange a look and then sam
     steps forward leading the way

                          sam
               im on point vincent

     a wide angle  the back lawn of the chateau 

     pure kurosawa  the japanese drum weve heard before starts
     to play again as 

     the long shadows of sam and vincent come out of the woods and
     into the brilliant light of the back lawn  for one minute
     they stand still and among the many weapons that sam carries
     is a long automatic rifle strung over his back and in the
     silhouette for one minute it looks like a samurai sword  now
     the two men start to move across the lawn hugging the
     shadows of the various statues and hedges trying to keep
     from being discovered for as long as possible

     back in the dining room 

                          gregor
                   to seamus
               so youve got it all figured do you

                          seamus
               figured enough to know theres an odd man
               out and im looking at him

                          gregor
               i think not
                   holds up the briefcase
               i have of course taken the precaution
               of wiring the briefcase to explode five
               seconds after it opens  unless of
               course i deactivate it before it goes
               off

                          deirdre
                   under her breath
               that fucking figures

                          gregor
               should any of you decide to rush me ill
               kill myself and whoever happens to be
               near me at the time

                          mikhi
               and more importantly 

                          gregor
               ill destroy whatevers in the case

     beat  nobody moves  nobody speaks  until finally 

                          seamus
               it looks gentlemen as if were gonna
               have to sit down to table and work out an
               agreement

     before this entirely tooweird scenario can play itself we go
     back to 

     the back lawn of the chateau 

     sam and vincent are closer to the chateau moving in stealth
     avoiding any entanglements and then sam turns a corner and
     comes face to face with  a guard and his gun is aimed at
     sams head sams a dead man as we go 

     back to the dining room

     automatic weapons fire splits the night and everyone in the
     room looks at one another before mikhi speaks

                          mikhi
               what was that

     back outside the chateau 

     the guard who had sam in his sights falls down dead shot by
      vincent whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms
     vincent smiles at sam

                          vincent
               thats one less i owe you

     sam smiles but its no time to get satisfied  their
     presence revealed theres no point in moving quietly  sam
     draws his weapons and as he and vincent charge across the
     lawn towards the chateau while 

     back in the dining room 

     more gunshots from outside  not a war but enough to cause
     serious alarm  deirdre ever the soldier draws her two
     automatic pistols

                          deirdre
                   to seamus and mikhi
               you two stay here and watch our mutual
               interest

     she nods at gregor and his briefcase indicating what this
     mutual interest is  then she turns and bolts the room and
     as she does were 

     back outside the chateau 

     sam and vincent are running along hugging the ground and
     whatever darkness they can find while blind weapons fire
     rips into the ground around them russian thugs not even sure
     what theyre shooting at but shooting all the same as sam
     and vincent hurtle towards 

     a back entrance to the chateau 

     some kind of kitchen storage area and as sam and vincent
     burst in from outside  five russian hoods come flying in
     from an interior entrance and this is it sam and vincent
     are outnumbered outgunned theyre going to die and then 
     they take out the entire room  sam holds an automatic pistol
     in his left hand and a submachine gun in his right and when
     he fires he does so in short controlled bursts firing only
     when he has the target in his sights while  vincent fights
     with a kind of sheer force a shotgun in one hand an uzi in
     the other he fires at anything and everything that moves
     and he hits almost all of it  and suddenly the room is
     quiet  everybodys dead except for sam and vincent  they
     drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
     move towards  the door  it leads to two passages each one
     leading to a separate wing of the chateau

                          sam
               lets work our way through the building
               ill take one wing you take the other

     vincent and sam split up moving into separate wings of the
     chateau and as they move off sam speaks a word of warning

                          sam
               watch your back vincent

     and then theyre gone and were with 

     deirdre whos running through the house going from room to
     room and were with her for a minute the japanese drum
     starts to play again and now its joined by more and more
     drums and they continue for the test of this sequence and
     suddenly  a huge burst of gunfire is heard dragging
     deirdres attention towards 

     the ballroom 

     and sams in the middle of a pitched battle with three
     gunmen  he kills the first and then the second and then 
     no third  the third gunman rolls out of the way as sam
     fires the third gunman fires back and  their shots go wide
     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers littering the floor
     with glass  and now were 

     on deirdre 

     running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
     gunfire somebody in the ballroom is dead  deirdre has
     almost reached the ballroom when  sam comes flying out and
     the two of them crash together sending the two of them
     sprawling into  the shotup mess that used to be the
     ballroom  and as they crash to the ground sam loses his
     weapon in the fall but deirdre manages to hold onto one of
     her two guns  now the two of them roll to their feet and as
     they do were back in 

     the dining room 

     seamus the madman is pacing the floor his face even worse
     than before with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
     his face is becoming more grotesque  little pustules have
     started to form all over its surface oozing a whitish
     viscous liquid  a new burst of fighting sounds can be heard
     and seamus who is no longer capable of thinking straight
     loses it

                          seamus
               i cant take it anymore
                   to mikhi
               watch him man im going out and finish
               what needs finishing

     and seamus is gone and so are we  back to 

     the ballroom 

     where deirdre has her two guns pointed at sam and  does nothing
     beat

                          sam
               go on them

     but deirdre cant do it  theres something between these
     two and now  sam looks around and sees deirdres other
     pistol lying on a broken chair and now he 

     kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg causing it to
     function as a lever sending the gun  through the air in a
     graceful slowmo arc until it  thwacks into sams hand  now
     hes armed and he looks back at  deirdre  her finger
     tightens on the trigger shes almost ready to shoot  if
     sam raises his piece hes a dead man

                          deirdre
               let it go sam walk away

     in response sam stares at deirdre for a beat and then he
     smiles an enigmatic smile and  he steps sideways into a
     nearby corridor vanishing

                          deirdre
               god damn it

     she runs after him but shes too late  the corridor outside
     is empty  now were back in 

     the dining room 

     with gregor and mikhi and the tension is unbearable because
     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
     then stops but they dont have the least idea of whats
     going on  still mikhi wont let gregor leave without giving
     up the briefcase  mikhi has a gun on gregor who in turn
     holds the briefcase close ready to open it and set off the 5
     second timer that will blow it up

                          gregor
                   a feral hiss
               well die if we stay here

                          mikhi
                   threatening with the gun
               youll die if you leave here

     gregor sits back down fairly close to mikhi  then in a
     manner so deft that mikhi never even notices gregor extracts
     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
     briefcase  before mikhi can even react gregor stabs his arm
     forward in a savage arc  jamming the blade into mikhis
     throat  mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade
     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
     slashed artery  within seconds  mikhi falls to the ground
     jerking viciously in his death throes as  gregor picks up
     the pistol and runs to leave the room and as he does we move
     to  

     the gallery 

     filled with paintings and sculptures nothing less than 200
     years old  this place is a maze what with its walls of
     paintings that jut out here and there the various corridors
     which lead from room to room and the sculptures which block
     sight lines  now we find  vincent pressed against a wall a
     gun in each hand while  five russian mafia guys are hunting
     him down  we do a series of quick cuts as the five guys split
     up and look for vincent all the while speaking in low russian
     voices  suddenly one of the guys turns a corner and sees 
     nothing  no vincent  now he turns back and  a fist crashes
     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall  its
     vincent  his hand wraps around mafia guys neck pinning him
     in place  seconds later  two quick shots rip through the
     painting hitting mafia guy in the head  now  the other men
     are alerted by the shots they come running and  vincent steps
     out firing 

     and now its a bulletfest as he gets the drop on them
     using the maze of the gallery to his fullest advantage
     gunning them down  first one  then two  three and then 
     no four  vincent turns surprised that his man wasnt where
     he expected him to be when  a shot rings out hitting
     vincent a flesh wound that disarms him  the last guy has
     the drop on vincent  now  the last guy smiles a nasty
     little smile at vincent and  a pistol spits fire and  a
     bullet bursts out of the last guys chest  its sam  now
     sam and vincent exchange a look sam has once again saved
     vincents life

                          vincent
               you have to stop doing that

                          sam
               ill work on it

     the two men dont have time for any more words they move
     from the gallery and find themselves in 

     the dining room 

     where they find nothing but the bloody remains of mikhi the
     gangster  sam and vincent are surveying the room when a
     voice comes from behind them 

                          seamus os
               turn around real slow and try hard not
               to breathe when you do it

     another angle  seamus reilly has come in behind them and
     hes got his gun pointed straight at sams heart  if seamus
     is enraged at discovering gregors absence hes overjoyed to
     find sam in his place

                          seamus
               its you
                   touches his face
               youre the one did this to my face are
               you

                          sam
               thats me

                          seamus
               have a nice afterlife

     seamus pulls the trigger and his bullet spins out towards
     sam ready to blow a hole through him except that  vincent
     leaps forward and takes the bullet  it rips into his side
     a huge splash of red against his white shirt  he falls to
     the ground horribly wounded but hes given sam enough time
     and now  sam and seamus open fire on one another  bullets
     ripping into the table chewing up the china and crystal
     taking glass shattering bites out of the chandelier above the
     table turning the dining room from a primo louis xiv
     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
     suddenly  theyre face to face each with a gun to the other
      mexican standoff  suddenly from off screen 

                          deirdre os
               seamus

     another angle  deirdre has appeared her gun leveled at the
     two men

                          seamus
               deirdre do for him woman put a fucking
               bullet in his head

     deirdre hesitates uncertain

                          seamus
               do it for christs sake do it so we can
               find that stinking gregor hes got the
               bloody package  for gods sake youre a
               soldier

     these last words sink into deirdre she is a soldier  her
     gun swivels towards sam

                          seamus
                   sensing hes getting to
                    her
               youre one of usyou been born and bred
               with your own people you cant go
               against your nature  cmon girl im
               youre people

     deirdre makes up her mind

                          deirdre
               im no girl seamus

     she fires a shot  blowing seamus off his feet and through a
     huge plate glass window

                          deirdre
               and you aint nobodys people

     she moves with sam to vincent who is seriously wounded 
     perhaps lifethreateningly so

                          sam
                   to deirdre
               lets get him out of here

                          vincent
               finish the job

                          sam
               and now

                          vincent
                   a commanding whisper
               finish it

     sam considers but before he can make up his mind deirdre
     sees something through the wreck of the dining room window 

     out on the back lawn  weve already seen that its bordered
     on one side by the woods for the first time we notice  a
     lake which laps against a private dock where a row boat is
     tethered  now  beneath a very full moon the stark figure
     of gregor makes its way toward the dock

                          deirdre
                   calling out
               sam

     sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees gregor making
     his escape  sam looks back at vincent who is almost passed
     out from blood loss

                          vincent
               im really sick of you saving my life  go
               out and get the bastard

     same makes up his mind and as vincent passes out sam runs
     out after deirdre and towards 

     the private dock 

     and as the two of them run we move with them

                          deirdre
               hes got the briefcase rigged to explode
               five seconds after anybody other than
               himself tries to open it

     and now they reach the dock and they find  nothing  no
     gregor  and the boat is still there  before sam can
     restrain her  deirdre stps out towards the boat

                          sam
               deirdre wait up 

     but its too late gregor steps out from behind 

     a boathouse and before deirdre can even figure out what
     happened gregor has her in an arm lock a gun to her head
     his free hand sticks out and we see the briefcase which is
     still handcuffed to his wrist

                          gregor
               you might have made a good field agent
               you arrogant american prick but youre
               not smart enough to go up against me

     gregor and deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake  this
     private dock is made completely of stone and the drop to the
     water is nearly five feet  sam has reached a position where
     there is no right answer  still he points his gun at
     gregor who in turn shields himself with deirdres body

                          gregor
               go ahead shoot shoot and kill the
               bitch i dont care
                   beat
               and yet you dont shoot  interesting
               put down your weapon and walk away

                          deirdre
               dont do it sam

                          gregor
               shut up

                          deirdre
               hell kill me anway sam shoot though
               me and kill this fucker

                          seamus os
                   a horrible croak
               if you dont i will

     another angle  seamus is somehow still barely alive  hes
     not long for this world but the will for revenge has driven
     him this far

                          seamus
                   to sam in a cold pale rage
               shoot that traitorous bitch and ill let
               you live

     the top of seamuss head explodes finishing him off once and
     for all killed by 

     vincent who has staggered out to make this one necessary
     shot  but he can go no further and he collapses in his own
     blood near death just as  gregor takes a step towards the
     boat and  sam makes up his mind and shoots  the bullet
     flies across the screen 

     impact  the briefcase bursts shot open by sam and now were
     in slow motion as 

     gregor relaxes his grip on deirdre as he struggles to close
     the case and  deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
     other into the lake while 

     baboom  the case explodes a flash of phosphorescent white
     light that incinerates gregor and the case and whatever was
     inside it with an explosion that knocks sam to the ground and
     when the light clears  gregor and the case are gone while 
     the explosion echoes out over the lake booming again and
     again until finally there is  silence  sam looks out over
     the lake for any sign of deirdre  but there is none  and
     then after weve held for a beat longer than it should be
     possible for her to have survived  her head splits the
     surface and she emerges coughing  sam reaches down to help
     her out

                          sam
               are you alright

                          deirdre
               alright  its bloody fucking freezing in
               here

     sam pulls deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
     immediately turn and move towards vincent and as they do we
     start to pull back on them and now the sounds of sirens can
     be heard one then two more and then a symphony of noise
     and were still pulling back on 

     the chateau  or whats left of it because its started to
     burn and quickly the flames start to rise into the night
     like something out of medieval times as we 

     dissolve to

     int a hospital waiting area  night

     sam waits outside a hospital room inside of which we get a
     glimpse of  a doctor tending to a heavily bandaged and
     sedated vincent  as sam waits  two gendarmes and a
     plainclothes detective approach  the detective looks at sam
     for a beat and then goes to push past him  sam blocks his
     way

                          detective
               i need to speak with that man

                          sam
               im sorry i cant allow that

     sam reaches into his coat and for a moment everybody thinks
     hes going for his gun but instead he comes out with  a
     piece of paper  he hands it to the detective

                          sam
               call that number and ask them what you
               should do

     the detective eyeballs the number suspiciously

     five minutes later 

     the detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
     over at sam in disgust  without another word the detective
     signals to the two gendarmes and all three men exit  now 

     the doctor a beautiful french woman comes up and speaks to
     him in french  and the amazing thing is that sam speaks
     back  everything in subtitled

                          doctor
               you can see your friend now

                          sam
               thank you very much

                          doctor
               the field dressing you put on saved his
               life
                   giving him a look
               where di you learn to do that

                          sam
               here and there i guess

     the doctor isnt entirely satisfied with this answer but
     its the only one shes going to get because sam moves past
     into 

     int vincents room

     hes barely alive  but alive nonetheless  and hes heard
     sam speak in french to the doctor

                          vincent
               you sonofabitch

                          sam
               what

                          vincent
               you speak french

                          sam
               what of it

                          vincent
                   in mock exasperation
               nothing

     he lies back on his pillow pissed and yet amused

                          vincent
                   repeating the doctors words
                    in english
               your field dressing saved his life
               thats three i owe you

                          sam
               you dont owe me a goddamned thing
               vincent and you know it  you stepped in
               front of a bullet for me
                   very seriously he now
                    believes this
               i owe you a heavy debt

                          vincent
                   relishing this
               i know

                          sam
                   rising to leave
               you better get some sleep alright

                          vincent
               tell me something first
                   a quick beat
               the package what was it

                          sam
               i dont know  nobody knows except a
               bunch of people who are too dead to tell
               us  theres probably a couple of guys
               back at the company who know but i dont
               think they plan to tell me anytime soon

                          vincent
               what happened to it
     
                          sam
               gone  destroyed

                          vincent
                   sighs then a beat
               i guess thats for the best

     sam turns for the door but vincent has one last thing to say

                          vincent
               sam when gregor had deirdre by the lake
               you could have killed the two of them
               with one shot  you could have had the
               package finished the job  but you
               didnt you sacrificed the job to save
               her life  why

     same has to think about this for a second and his answer
     reveals just how full circle hes come

                          sam
               its what you would have done

     and on that note sam exits the room leaving a bemused
     vincent behind

     ext the bank of the river seine  early morning

     a wispy fog atmospherically rises off the river  not too
     thick not too thin

     a title one month later

     were moving along the cobblestone walk next to the river as
     a voice cuts through the fog

                          vincent vo
               would you just smoke already

     a riverside cafe  where sam vincent and deirdre are having
     morning coffee  a mostlyhealed vincent is smoking a
     cigarette trying to get sam to light up

                          sam
               i told you i quit

                          vincent
               just to keep me company sam  i hate
               smoking alone
                   turning to deirdre
               how about you  i thought all you ira
               types smoked

                          deirdre
               only the stupid ones  cigarettes kill
               more patriots than bullets
                   a quick beat
               besides im not ira no more

                          vincent
               so where do you go from here

                          deirdre
               i dont know  i was thinkingmaybe the
               three of us might partner up  guns for
               hire that sort of thing

                          vincent

               available

     sam cant help it  hes interested

                          sam
               how much does it pay

     slam cut to

     ext out on the river seine  meanwhile

     silence and fog  a river ferry does a slow ghostly glide
     down the river and in seconds it approaches 

     the riverside cafe which appears through the mist looked at
     by 

     a sleek pair of sun glasses attached to a young punk in a
     leather coat and the punk is looking at  sam vincent and
     especially deirdre  sam looks up and shouts a warning as 
     the punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat pumps
     the gun and screams out at deirdre with an irish accent 

                          punk
               this is for seamus

     boom  the punk pulls the trigger a blast of fire as  sams
     gun is already out two quick shots squeezed off and  the
     punk is capped twice in the head dead sailing away on the
     ferry which never stops as 

     the cafe goes wild customers running screaming waiters
     dropping their trays  but  sam doesnt run and neither
     does vincent  sam stands stunned by what he sees  deirdre
     lies on the ground hit full on in the chest shes dead  a
     beat of pure silence  broken by sirens in the distance but
     quickly growing closer  now  vincent looks at deirdres
     corpse then at sam who is unable to move  for maybe the
     first time in his professional career sam is staggered by
     the loss of a life  vincent gently takes sams arm

                          vincent
                   soft yet urgent
               we have to go sam we cant be here

     sam looks at vincent and for a moment sam struggles to find
     something to say but he cant find a goddamned thing  the
     sirens are getting louder 

                          vincent
                   a little louder bordering
                    desperation
               lets go

     vincent literally drags sam away and now the sirens have
     arrived followed quickly by  the gendarmes who come
     running into the cafe but  its empty except for deirdres
     body  now 

     the street above the river 

     sam and vincent are running through patchy fog vincent
     leading the way and now 

     were closer on vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
     feels hes far enough away from the scene of the crime to
     relax  he collapses against a stone wall chest heaving
     shaking out two cigarettes one for himself and one for sam

                          vincent
                   thrusting the cigarettes out to
                    sam
               doctors orders

     but sam isnt there to take the cigarette  vincent looks
     around trying to see what happened to his friend but the
     fog has covered any sign of sam  vincent stands there
     stunned alone the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
     slowly falls back to vincents side as he realizes that sam
     has left him on purpose  then  vincent lights both
     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
     stone wall  the glowing cigarette arcs through the air until
     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss

                          vincent os
               goodbye sam

     back at the cafe 

     the gendarmes have secured the scene there isnt much to
     secure since everyone has run away  a majority of cops
     surround deirdres dead body but  one gendarme wanders
     around the cafe looking about and then he sees something 

     on the street above 

     a shape in the fog  the wind blows and the fog clears for a
     second and we see that its  sam  getting one last look at
     deirdre  quickly  the gendarme points sam out but as he
     does the wind continues to blow and  the fog swallows sam
     seconds later the fog clears again and when it does  sam is
     gone

     fade out
