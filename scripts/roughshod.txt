                         hill

               he lifts some things out of the surrey and carries them toward 
               the wagon

                                     helen

                         for him that usually works
                              then shocked at the 
                              thought
                         yeah but suppose he took us up on 
                         it where would we be

               she starts around the surrey helen follows

               clay bends over elaine

                                     clay

                         too much excitement or maybe its 
                         just the heat how about the surrey 
                         can you fix it

               as clay turns from elaine marcia joins the other two their 
               attention on clay and the surrey left alone elaine is 
               suddenly alert and no longer sick she glances around then 
               unobserved slides out from under the shade of the surrey

               another angle

               on rear of surrey in the bg steve pulls the wagon to a 
               stop jumps off and comes running over elaine stands for a 
               moment searching the ground with her eyes

                         jiminy you sure were lucky just 
                         bustin a wheel

               helen moves toward clay she smiles without humor with this 
               new diversion elaine still unnoticed starts away  back 
               toward where they dropped the trunk

                                     helen

                         it wouldnt happen to be this

               elaine stops now and turns as clay takes the folding 
               daguerrotype case from his pocket elaine her eyes wide and 
               frightened starts back as mary takes the case from clay and 
               opens it

                                     mary

               she jerks the case from marys hands snaps it shut and 
               stands staring at mary with a strange mixture of fright 
               anger and hysteria mary glances around as if to say what
               didido to cover the embarrassed silence clay kicks the 
               unbroken back wheel the spokes rattle

                                     clay
                         this must have been in the family a 
                         long time

               elaine glances at him as though he had insulted her turns 
               and starts toward the blanket again

                                     mary
                              dryly

               she looks at him to see if the name registers at the surrey 
               side elaine is abruptly weak again she leans against it 
               for support mareia moves to her as she slides back down on 
               the blanket clutching the case

               it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream the 
               girls sit lifelessly on the wagon they seem too tired to 
               dismount then finally marcia helps elaine to climb stiffly 
               down with the exception of mary they all let themselves

                         about his horses

               as she speaks she edges mary to the door leading outside

                                     helen
                         a man has only so many nos in him

               out a comb he glances at the box then reaches over and 
               from it takes her powder box he sniffs it without 
               irritation as though borrowing a toy from a child helen 
               takes the powder box from him

                         hankering to smell powder

                         then why stay in the hills

               she looks at him then up the bank where the cradle is

                                     helen
                         that why

               fowler hesitates helen hands him back the powder box as 
               matteroffactly as she took it he accepts it gratefully 
               again putting it to his nose now he looks up at her 
               regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two their eyes 
               meet

                         placer mining in a place nobody ever 
                         thought to look for gold before

               he reaches to his throat and lifts over his head a braided 
               loop of rawhide attached to the loop is a small plump 
               softleather poke still holding the powder box he passes 
               her the poke she starts to work with the thong

                                     fowler
                         look at her  see her shine one 
                         weeks work

               helen still struggles with the thong he takes the poke 
               pulls it open pouring grains of gold into his palm helen 
               looks at the shining heap in his hand then she takes the 
               poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm she looks 
               down at it her expression is calculating she looks up at 
               fowler and then the hard look goes away she gives him a 
               soft smile

                                                                   dissolve

               and rolls a cigarette he holds it out she licks it then 
               puts it in her mouth clay lights a match holds it out she 
               catches his hand and holds the flame to her cigarette

               hands crush her shoulders mary holds the kiss for a moment 
               then draws back waiting for him to say the words she wants 
               to hear his hands pull her toward him mary wants the kiss  
               but she also wants a declaration of love she makes one last
