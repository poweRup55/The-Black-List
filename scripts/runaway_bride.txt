	the wind rustles the endless field of corn blows over the 
	freshly mown meadow of soybeans and magically sways a copse of 
	trees 
	
	its a fall afternoon a sudden pounding of galloping hooves 
	breaks the peace and a horse and rider burst between the rows 
	of corn into the meadow  they are running for their lives

	close on

	the rider is a bride  a beautiful woman dressed in a 
	disheveled wedding gown its train tattered and flying like a 
	knights banner out behind her this is maggie carpenter

	the horse is frothing and wildeyed like the bride who turns 
	to look behind her in terror  the horses labored breathing 
	mingles with maggies panicked gasps

	we see a wedding bouquet fly into a ditch as the horse thunders 
	on  maggie clings to the reins  she looks as though she is 
	running from the devil himself

	grateful dead rose

			    maggie contd
		gill  of course  he proposed at the 
		tiedye tshirt stand at a dead concert  
		it was very sweet until he hallucinated 
		that the drum set was a bloodsucking 
		space alien

			    ike
		always a mood killer

			    maggie
		still sweet

	maggie hands ike a third ring  its in the shape of a butterfly 
	and studded with multicolor gems

		for me  i cant believe you waited for 
		the wedding to run

			    maggie
		hes an entomologist  i thought it was 
		very unique

	now maggie shows ike the ring on her hand  its a gold 1 with 
	a diamond set into the number

			    maggie contd
		and here we are at bob  he proposed 
		during the seventh inning stretch

			stopping
		highly suspect

			    maggie

		romantic

			    ike
		maybe its just me but  if you got 
		to dress it up it doesnt ring true

	ike moves back to the couch

			    ike contd
		i think the most anybody can honestly 
		say is look
			sits on the arm 
			 of the couch
		i guarantee that well have tough 
		times  i guarantee that at some point 
		one or both of us will want to get out 
		of this thing  but i also guarantee 
		that if i dont ask you to be  mine 
		ill regret it for the rest of my life  
		because i know in my heart  youre 
		the only one for me

	maggie stares at ike for a beat  his words have taken a little 
	bit of her breath away  she covers

		dollars

	maggie lowers her voice hoping to lessen the humiliation of the 
	moment

			    maggie
		is this dress for sale

			    mrs whittenmeyer
		it just seems like an awful lot of 
		money to spend on one of your dresses 
		maggie you only wear them for about 
		ten minutes

	ike watches with regret as maggies childlike enthusiasm 
	drains away her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of 
	the shop owner  hes starting to see that its no always easy 
	being maggie theres a tremor in her voice

			    maggie
		yeah thats a good point
			then sitting

	ike calls out to mrs whittenmeyer

	ike turns around  maggie is standing on the pedestal wearing 
	the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous  she is overwhelming 
	to behold and ike has to struggle to keep his face under control

	maggie leads ike through a cornfield

			    maggie
		do you think theres only one right

	ike chooses his words carefully

			    ike
		no  but i think attraction is too 
		often mistaken for rightness  
		attraction is very misleading  and if 
		its mutual its well terribly 
		distracting

			    maggie
		yes it is  and it doesnt mean 
		anything

	ike nods as they come to a wooden fence  she puts her hand on 
	his shoulder  ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a
