	credits  white lettering over a back background  the 
	thunderous sounds of a massive naval barrage are heard  the 
	power is astonishing  it roars through the body blows back 
	the hair and rattles the ears

	fade in

	ext omaha beach  normandy  dawn

	the roar of naval guns continues but now we see them firing  
	huge fifteen inch guns

	swarm of landing craft

	heads directly into a nightmare  massive explosions from 
	german artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the 
	beach  hundreds of german machine guns loaded with tracers 
	pour out a red snowstorm of bullets

			superimposition

					  omaha beach normandy
			june 6 1944

					  0600 hours
			hundreds of landing craft each holding 
			thirty men near the beaches

					  the cliffs
			at the far end of the beach a ninety
			foot cliff  topped by bunkers  
			ringed by fortified machine gun nests  
			a clear lineoffire down the entire 
			beach

					  ten landing craft
			make their way toward the base of 
			the cliffs  running a gauntlet of 
			explosions

					  superimposition
			the following is based on a true 
			story the lead landing craft plows 
			through the waves

	the camera moves past the faces of the men

	boys  most are eighteen or nineteen years old  tough  
	welltrained  trying to block out the fury around them

	a direct hit on a nearby landing craft

	a huge explosion of fuel fire metal and flesh

	the lead landing craft

	the motorman holds his course  shells explode around them  
	flaming oil burns on the water  cannon fire smashes into 
	the bow

	the motoraman is ripped to bits

	blood and flesh shower the men behind him  the mate takes 
	the controls

					  a young soldier
			his face covered with the remains of 
			the motorman  starts to lose it  
			begins to shudder and weep  his 
			name is delancey

	the boys around him

	do their best to stare straight ahead  but the fear infects 
	them  it starts to spread

					  a figure
			pushes through the men  puts himself 
			in front of delancey

	the figure is captain john miller  early thirties  by far 
	the oldest man on the craft  relaxed battlehardened 
	powerful ignoring the hell around them  he smiles puts a 
	cigar in his mouth strikes a match on the front of delanceys 
	helmet and lights the cigar

	delancey tries to look away but miller grips him by the jaw 
	and forces him to lock eyes  miller smiles  delancey is 
	terrified

	delancey captain are we all gonna die

	miller hell no twothirds tops

	delancey oh jesus

	miller i want every one of you to look at the man on your 
	left  now look at the man on your right  feel sorry for 
	those to sonsofbitches theyre going to get it youre 
	not going to get a scratch  a few including delancey manage 
	thin smiles  miller releases his grip on delancey who moves 
	his jaw as if to see if its broken  miller pats him on the 
	cheek and moves on to the bow

					  miller
			looks over the gunwale at the hell 
			in front of them

	pan down to millers hand

	it quivers in fear  miller glances around sees that none 
	of the men have noticed  he stares at his hand as if it 
	belongs to someone else  it stops shaking  he turns his 
	eyes back to the objective

	the lead landing craft hits the beach

	the six surviving boats alongside

	explosive propelled grappling hooks fire

	from the landing crafts  arc toward the top of the cliffs

	the lead craft ramp goes down

	a river of machine gun fire pours into the craft  a dozen 
	men are instantly killed  among them delancey

					  miller
			somehow survives  jumps into the 
			breakers

					  miller
			move goddamn it  go  go  go

					  explosions everywhere
			the germans on the edge of the cliff  
			rain down machine gun fire and 
			grenades

					  the americans
			struggle through the surf  firing 
			up as best they can  making for the 
			base of the cliffs

	incendiary grenades hurled from above

	explode spreading fire

					  miller
			ignores the explosions and bullets  
			uses hand signals and curt orders

					  miller
			there  there  hooks there  fire 
			squad those rocks

					  the men
			obey instantly  set the grappling 
			hooks  take position  return fire

	the sounds of battle

	drown out most voices  except the screams of the wounded 
	and dying

					  the men
			know what they have to do  start up 
			the ropes  into the teeth of the 
			german defenders

					  miller
			backstraps his thompson submachine 
			gun  starts climbing with the first 
			group

					  the cliff face
			the americans swarm up the ropes  
			taking turns firing up at the germans

	miller sees a stalled climber

	a softfaced boy  grabs him by the back of his collar  
	roughly yanks him up  nearly choking him  they boy climbs 
	on

					  halfway
			an american private is hit  falls 
			taking two others with him  all 
			three land on the rocks below  
			another way to die

					  near the top
			less steep  they leave the ropes  
			free climb scrambling up the rocks

					  miller
			joins halfadozen pinned down men  
			others bottleneck behind them  miller 
			scans the route and the defenders

	sees an open gap  deadly  beyond is a protective overhang  
	with a clear line to the top

					  miller
			thats the route

	miller motions to six men huddled near him

					  miller
			go

					  the six men
			take an instant to get ready  then 
			scramble into the gap

	miller and the others

	do their best to cover them  pour fire up at the germans  
	bad angle  no germans are hit

					  the six men
			are cut to ribbons by machine gun 
			fire  all killed  they fall to the 
			rocks below

	sarge midtwenties experienced millers right arm and 
	best friend dives into the rocks next to miller

	sarge thats a goddamned shooting gallery captain

					  miller
			its the only way

					  miller
			turns to the next halfdozen men

					  miller
			youre next

					  the second six
			move to the head of the gap  miller 
			moves for a better angle against the 
			machine guns  calls to jackson a 
			tall gangly southern country boy 
			sharpshooter

					  miller
			jackson pick off a few of them 
			will you

					  jackson
					heavy southern accent
			you betcha captain

	miller signals others where to direct their cover fire  
	turns to the second six

					  miller
			go

					  the second six
			take deep breaths  head into the 
			gap

	miller and others blast surprising fire

	jackson nails a pair of germans  miller cuts down two more  
	sarge gets one  not enough

					  the second six
			are raked by machine guns  all are 
			killed

					  miller
			turns looking for the next six  
			his eyes fall on sarge and reiben 
			who is a cynical sharp new yorker  
			reiben smiles

					  reiben
					heavy brooklyn accent
			captain can i put in for a transfer

					  miller
			sure meet me at the top well start 
			the paperwork

					  the third six
			moves into place  sarge and miller 
			exchange a look  they both see the 
			madness of what theyre doing

	miller and the others

	open up on the germans

					  miller
			go

					  sarge
			rolls his eyes takes a breath  
			scrambles into the gap  the other 
			five right behind

					  in the gap
			bullets everywhere

	three are hit  then another  potato masher grenades bounce 
	down  explode below

	the german machine gun swings toward sarge and reiben  miller 
	sees them about to get it  miller steps out into the open

	a perfect target  captains bars glinting  firing  trying 
	to draw the german fire

	the german machine gunner

	sees miller standing in the open  too much to pass up  he 
	swings the machine gun away from sarge and reiben toward 
	miller

	a row of german bullets approaches millerhes an instant 
	from death

	sarge and reiben dive

	under the overhang to safety

	miller dives back to cover barely makes it his boot heal 
	is blown off

	under the overhang sarge and reiben untangle themselves

					  reiben
			ill be goddamned  im not dead

	sarge hollers back to miller

					  sarge
			captain if your mother saw you do 
			that shed be very upset

					  miller
			i thought you were my mother

	quick smiles  miller and his rangers lean out and fire  
	hit more germans

	sarge and reiben run up the path under the overhang  stop 
	near the top  pull pins on grenades  count  both throw 
	long arcing over the crest perfectly aimed

	the two grenades explode

	putt out the two worst machine gun nests

					  miller
			crosses the gap  his men follow

					  at the crest
			the americans swarm over the top  
			firing

	two dozen germans fire back as they retreat

	abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers  the germans 
	are cut down

	miller motions to wade a small wideeyed demolition man 
	whos struggling under the weight of halfa dozen satchel 
	charges

					  miller
			okay wade your turn

	wade captain i love it when you say that

	miller sarge reiben and jackson cover wade as he races to 
	the first of three bunkers  dodging bullets from inside  
	wade tosses a satchel charge into a gun port  a huge muffled 
	explosion rocks the bunker

					  miller and sarge
			survey the field

					  sarge
			what the hell were you doing  drawing 
			fire

					  miller
			worked didnt it

					  sarge
			you tryin to get yourself killed

					  miller
			dont need to the krauts go that 
			covered

	sarge shakes his head at miller then he looks over the cliff 
	at the scores of men their shattered burning bodies covering 
	the rocks and the beach below  hes clearly affected

	miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded  then he moves 
	on leading his surviving men toward the two remaining german 
	bunkers  the sounds of big guns and machine guns fire 
	surround him  dissolve to

	off then he smiles too

					  colonel anderson
			alright ill give you that  
			continue

					  miller
			the numbers dont make sense sir  
			his brothers are dead thats too 
			bad but theyre out of the equation  
			sending men up there is bleeding 
			heart crapola from three thousand 
			miles away  one private is simply 
			not worth a squad  colonel anderson 
			this one is  hes worth a lot more 
			than that  which is why im sending 
			you youre the best field officer 
			there is

	miller shrugs

					  miller
			yes and no sir what about morgan

			in action  command wants him out of 
			there

	the supply sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly

					  supply sergeant
			damni got a couple brothers

	miller looks at him noting his reaction coldly  the supply 
	sergeant shifts his eyes toward general gavins jeep

	ext road leading from transport  day

	miller and his men drive off fast in general gavins jeep  
	sarge is at the wheel weaving and bouncing through the bedlam 
	of men and vehicles  miller rides shotgun  reiben jackson 
	and wade are crammed in the back

	the supply sergeant watches them go  behind him general 
	gavin pure piss and vinegar strides up trailed by his 
	huge staff  he looks around for his jeep comes up empty

					  general gavin
			sergeant where the hell is my 
			goddamned jeep

	the supply sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns 
	to take his lumps

	ext road  day

	miller and his men weave through the chaos of the american 
	staging area

					  miller
			weve got to make one stop

	miller points the way for sarge

	ext intelligence tent  day

	miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly 
	white tautlined tent  a steady stream of roaring vehicles 
	and chattering men move out around them  distant guns rumble  
	sporadic mediumdistance explosions boom  miller hops out

					  miller
			wait here

	he strides into the tent

	int intelligence tent  day

	three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious 
	nerds the day before finals  theyre breaking down and 
	gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine  tedious 
	detailed work

	one of them is tim upham a thin twentyfour year old 
	patrician with gentle thoughtful eyes behind his thick 
	glasses  he nervously jumps at the sound of a very distant 
	explosion then he forces himself to concentrate on his work  
	miller strides in  miller im looking for corporal upham

	upham raises his eyes from his map and refocuses

	upham sir im upham

					  miller
			i understand you speak french and 
			german

	upham yes sir

					  miller
			do you have an accent

	upham a slight one in french  my german is clean  it has a 
	touch of the bavarian

					  miller
			good youve been reassigned to me 
			were going to ramelle

	upham knows enough geography to know what that means

	upham uh sir there are germans up at ramelle

					  miller
			thats my understanding

	upham lots of them

					  miller
			do you have a problem with that 
			corporal

	upham sir ive never been in combat  i make maps  i

	millers expression gives him his answer

	upham uh how about a pencil

					  miller
			a small one

	miller shoos him off

					  miller
			go go

	upham scurries away  miller sighs

	ext road leading from intelligence tent  day

	miller and his men peel out now with upham crammed with the 
	others in the back of the jeep  as they drive off the camera 
	cranes up to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion 
	in military history

	the scope of the operation is stunning  the beach is covered 
	with mountains of supplies  a steady stream of vehicles 
	winds up the dunes  hundreds of barrage balloons anchored 
	by heavy steel cables hover over the entire scene  off
	shore a massive mulberry port is under construction workers 
	swarming over it like ants  beyond that thousands of ships 
	and boats of every type and description  the smoke of 
	hundreds of fires rises on the horizon  explosions some 
	distant some close boom and rumble

	its an awesome breathtaking sight  miller and his tiny 
	band of men weave their way through the middle of it 
	speeding away from the beach heading inland leaving the 
	bulk of the american army behind  ext french road  day 
	miller and his men drive fast passing american vehicles and 
	infantrymen moving forward  the sides of the road are 
	littered with the debris of burning german vehicles abandoned 
	equipment bodies

	sarge drives  miller reads a map  upham cradling a pristine 
	m1 rifle is all eyes and ears  jackson and wade calmly 
	take in the view  reiben checks out the close quarters in 
	the back of the jeep

					  reiben
			captain can i ask you a question

					  miller
			sure reiben

					  reiben
			where are you planning on putting 
			private ryan sir

	miller doesnt raise his eyes from the map

					  reiben
					continuing
			its just that its kind of crowded 
			back here i was wondering if youre 
			expecting to have more room on the 
			way back

	miller points out a turn to sarge

					  miller
			left

	sarge makes the turn  miller folds up the map and pockets 
	it

					  miller
			now weve got a straight shot due 
			north to ramelle twentysix miles 
			two villages between here and there 
			st mere then bernay  well take 
			the jeep as far as we can then go 
			on on foot

					  sarge
			we in radio contact with anybody up 
			there

					  miller
			somebody put the wrong crystals in 
			every one of the hundredandfirsts 
			radios the night before the drop 
			not one of them works  were going 
			in blind

					  reiben
			i usually like surprises

					  sarge
			what are we likely to run into

					  miller
			a fucking mess two maybe three kraut 
			divisions no fronts no lines the 
			drops were completely fouled up 
			weve got little pockets of 
			paratroopers all over the place 
			trying to hang on  command says we 
			hold st mere but north of that 
			its all krauts  even if ryans 
			where hes supposed to be hes more 
			than likely dead

					  sarge
			hell of a mission

					  miller
			yep hell of a mission

	in the back of the jeep

	upham avidly takes in everything  he notices reiben staring 
	at him grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful 
	smile

	upham hi  so uh youre all rangers

	reiben jackson and wade look at upham as if he were an 
	insect

	upham im upham

	pointing at his corporals stripes

	ignore these please i know all that breaks down in combat  
	their jaws drop

					  reiben

	wade its not my turn

					  reiben
					politely

	upham reacts to the metion of millers name

	upham miller

					  miller
			i dont want anybody to shoot him 
			thats an order  he speaks french 
			and his german has a touch of the 
			bavarian

	upham sir are you captain john miller

	miller sighs he knows whats coming

					  upham
					continuing
			who won the congressional medal 
			of hon

	uphams words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances 
	of millers men  miller himself remains relaxed but stone
	faced

	no one speaks for a few seconds then the moment passes as 
	if it had never happened

					  reiben
			captain i gotta tell you the irony 
			of this mission is fucking killing 
			me

					  miller
			yeah how so

					  reiben
			i should be on my way to caen sir  
			its like beethoven the guys one

			and he goes deaf  go figure i mean 
			whod he piss off  and here i am 
			the beethoven of ladies foundation

			whos probably already dead

					  miller
			theres to be a bright side look 
			for it

					  reiben
			sir you know what ramelle is famous 
			for  cheese  the rest of the company 
			is going to caen and were going to 
			the goddamned cheese capital of 
			france  there is no bright side

					  miller
			theres always a bright side

					  reiben
			im listening sir

					  miller
			well i for one like cheese

	wade pipes up cheerfully

	wade hell i dont mind going to ramelle as long as theres 
	something up there for me to blow up

					  reiben
			well youre a happy idiot

	they round a turn

	skid to a stop at a

	bottleneck of american vehicles

	a lieutenant is roadmaster  miller calls to him

					  miller
			hows the road up to st mere

	lieutenant bad sir  therere some eightyeights hiding 
	somewhere knocking the hell out of our traffic

					  miller
			anybody getting through

	lieutenant the lucky ones

	miller nods to sarge who floors it  they take off spraying 
	gravel behind them  ext st mere road  day the jeep barrels 
	down the road fast  the road is pockmarked with craters  
	they pass the wreckage of a pair of american jeeps  direct 
	hits  sarge swerves around them without slowing

	an american troop truck smolders

	on the side of the road surrounded by the charred bodies of 
	a dozen american troops  its a nightmare vision  upham 
	grows weak at the sight  miller takes note of uphams 
	reaction

					  in the back
			the men bounce up and down like 
			stuffed animals doing their best to 
			not be thrown out

					  reiben
			hell this is better than coney 
			island

					  a huge bump
			bounces reiben up and slams his back 
			down on his shovel  he hollers in 
			pain

					  miller
			just trying to make room for ryan

	reiben shoots miller a smile and shifts his belt moving his 
	shovel from under his bruised ass

	they round a bend

	see a long straight stretch of road  halfadozen burning 
	obliterated american vehicles  a gauntlet to run

	an eightyeight shell screams in

	lands right behind them  blows a new crater

					  miller
					sweetly
			sarge

	sarge floors it  everyone hangs on

					  another shell explodes
			thirty yards ahead of them

					  miller
			directs sarge off the road

					  miller
			theyve got the road zeroed

					  sarge
			yanks the wheel driving the jeep 
			off the road

					  the jeep bounces
			off the shoulder  nearly throwing 
			everyone out  somehow they hang on  
			the jeep tears along the rutted field

					  another explosion
			just behind them

					  sarge drives madly
			not slowing down  trying to avoid 
			the biggest ruts and bumps

					  another explosion
			close on their side  showers them 
			with debris

					  sarge
			jesus christ

	miller scans the terrain

	sees a cluster of buildings about halfamile ahead

					  miller
			theyve got a hell of a spotter 
			somewhere

					  another explosion
			even closer  the jeeps peppered 
			with shrapnel  they barrel through 
			the smoke

					  miller
			scurves sarge

					  sarge
			turns shallow curves without slowing 
			down

	suddenly sees a crater

	tries to avoid it  too late  brakes  plows into overturned 
	earth  stops short

	reiben upham wade and jackson

	thrown from the jeep  tumble into the dirt  not hurt

					  sarge and miller
			hang on  stay in the jeep but are 
			battered  all stunned  miller is 
			first to regain his bearings  jumps 
			up  checks out the jeep  undamaged  
			deep in the soft dirt

	an eightyeight shell screams in explodes thirty yards left

					  miller
			sarge  reverse

	sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear  
	the wheels spin  miller throws his shoulder into the jeep  
	yells to the others

					  miller
			come on  you wanna walk

					  still dazed
			reiben wade jackson upham screw 
			their heads back on  shoulder into 
			the jeep  push for all theyre worth  
			the wheels still spin

	another eightyeight shell lands explodes thirty yards right

					  miller ignores it
			hes the only one who does

					  sarge
			captain they got us zeroed

	upham is very nervous

					  upham
			thats bracketing right

	they all ignore him

					  upham
			i know about bracketing  i read 
			about it  the next one is going to 
			land right on us

					  miller
			forward  forward
					beat
			now reverse

	sarge slams the jeep into reverse  rocks it  slams it back 
	into forward  makes progress

	all the men push all eyes up  waiting for the next shell

					  sarge
			uh captain

					  miller
			push

					  sarge
			uh captain

					  the tires scream
			a bit more progress  its almost 
			out

	they all push like maniacs

	knowing the shell is coming any second  upham is beside 
	himself

					  sarge
					sweetly
			oh captain

					  one more push
			the jeep rocks back in deeper

					  miller
			shit

	they hear the scream of the shell miller barks to his men

					  miller
			go

					  the men
			instantly take off  away from the 
			jeep  as fast as they can

	the shell screams in

	the men hit the dirt

					  direct hit
			obliterating the jeep

					  the men
			barely out of the blast perimeter  
			stunned by the concussion  showered 
			with dirt rock and debris

					  miller
			is first up  sarge and the men 
			struggle to their feet  hear more 
			incoming  miller grabs upham by the 
			collar and pulls him up

					  miller
			here come the mortars

	they all take off

	running as fast as they can

	the first of the mortar shells come in

	the eightyeight is big with pauses spaces between  but 
	there must be a dozen mortars firing  the shells are almost 
	constant

					  the field
			the six americans run madly in zig
			zag patterns through the gauntlet of 
			mortar explosions  boom

					  running stumbling
			boom boom boom

	upham is thrown to the ground

	miller yanks him up  halfdrags him to the edge of the field

	they make it to the trees

	keep running  through the bushes and brambles  thirty yards 
	in

					  the explosions stop
			the men all stop panting  struggling 
			to catch their breath check their 
			body parts  everythings there  
			they have their weapons most of 
			their gear

	reiben looks back through the trees at the jeep which is 
	nothing more than a burning carcass  he shakes his head

					  reiben
			general gavin is going to be very 
			irritated at you captain

					  miller
			stands on the edge of the woods 
			almost in a trance

					  upham
			captain i

					  sarge
			sssssh

	miller far away quickly shifts his eyes and ears from 
	position to position

					  miller
			sarge maps

	sarge quickly opens up the map case  the men are dead silent 
	frozen in place

					  miller
			two eightyeights just under two
			andahalf miles that way vector 
			from the jeep through those two 
			trees at the base of the hill  the 
			mortars came from behind that rise 
			there four of them

	sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map  miller snaps out 
	of it

					  miller
			wade the radio

	wade instantly starts cranking it up  upham is amazed

					  upham
			you can tell all that just by the 
			sound sire

					  miller
			thats not all  there were nine 
			gunners on the eightyeights one 
			had a broken heel on his boot two 
			had bratwurst for supper last night 
			one of them is named fritz the other 
			hans maybe i dont know its hard 
			to tell

					  jackson
			corporal you have just seen one of 
			captain millers many godgiven 
			talents  if by some miracle you 
			survive you will witness many more 
			of them

	sarge finished vectoring

					  sarge
			got it sir  we gonna go take care 
			of those eightyeights

					  miller
			thats not what were here for

					  wade
					re radio
			ive got command captain

	miller takes the handset from wade and the map from sarge

					  miller
					into radio

			sector three foxtrot quadrant four
			three by bakerthree  two eighty
			eights  tell our boys to come in 
			low from the east in case the krauts 
			have ackack  good hunting  over

	a voice on the radio signs off through the static  wade 
	packs up the radio  miller folds up the map  jackson sir 
	wouldnt take us but a minute to put out them eightyeights

					  sarge
			hes right captain it might be 
			kind of dangerous for those flyboys

					  miller
			tell that to private james ryan  
			weve got our orders  lets go

	miller heads off without pausing or looking back  the rest 
	of the men dont like it but they follow  upham trails 
	amazed at miller

	ext woods  day

	miller walks point  his men follow warily  upham falls in 
	alongside reiben

					  upham
			so where are you from

					  reiben
			get lost

	upham smiles lamely and moves on to jackson

					  upham
			so where are you from

					  jackson
			you writin a book or somethin

					  upham
			as a matter of fact i am

					  jackson
			figured

	wade overhears and smiles at upham

					  wade
			im wade thats spelled wade 
			im small but wiry with piercing 
			steelgray eyes and a roughhewn 
			but handsome face im from colorado 
			my fathers a mining engineer dont 
			you take notes

	upham shakes his head

					  upham
			demolition right

					  wade
			since i was nine years old  they 
			got a lot of explosives around mines  
			me and my little brother could get 
			into any warehouse you ever saw  
			damn we had fun

	jackson shrugs

					  jackson
			im jackson  im from west fork 
			tennessee  my pappys a preacher  
			him and his two brothers got a 
			ministry the blessed church of the 
			wandering gospel

					  upham
			in west fork

					  jackson
			in the back of a nineteen and thirty
			one stretch hudson with a big ole 
			trailer

					  upham
			no kidding

					  jackson
			i dont make jokes about things of 
			or related to the preaching of the 
			holy gospel including the ministerial 
			calling of my family

					  upham
			so they travel around from place to 
			place and preach

					  jackson
			we got us a tent fortytwo feet 
			across eighteen feet at center 
			hundredandten foldin chairs  
			circuits eleven towns covers all 
			a hasset county and most a weller 
			county  i expect that upon completion 
			of my military service i will be 
			joinin said ministry

					  upham
			what about the captain  wheres he 
			from

	they all shake their heads  millers out of earshot

					  jackson
			you figure that out you got yourself 
			one nice prize

					  sarge
			over three hundred bucks last i 
			heard  wade companys got a pool 
			five bucks gets you in whoever 
			guesses where the captains from and 
			what he did as a civilian gets it 
			all

					  jackson
			the whole kit and caboodle

					  upham
			but everybodys heard of him he won 
			the congressional medal of honor he 
			saved a dozen men

					  reiben
			we know

					  upham
			somebody must know where hes from 
			what he did for a living

					  sarge
			somebody probably does

					  upham
			why dont you just ask him

					  jackson
			the captain prefers not to discuss 
			certain aspects of his life in 
			particular everything up to and 
			including his enlistment in the united 
			states army

					  sarge
			ive been with him since anzio  im 
			closer to him that i am to my own 
			brother but i dont even know what 
			state hes from  somewhere in the 
			northeast as near as i can figure  
			i dont even have a clue what he did 
			for a living as civilian

	reiben shakes his head

					  reiben
			no ones gonna win the money for the 
			simple reason that the captain never 
			was a civilian  they assembled him 
			at ocs out of spare body parts 
			from dead gis  i know this for a 
			fact

					  jackson
					defensively
			you got somethin against the capn

					  reiben
			hell no  i think hes the best 
			officer in the whole goddamned army 
			bar none

	they all nod in assent no argument there

					  jackson
			you got that right

	miller walks on ahead unaware of their conversation  upham 
	watches miller with even more curiosity

	ext hedgerow field  day

	miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a 
	country cow path  theyre staying close to the cover of the 
	brush  miller walks tall now

					  jackson
			captain my feet are most 
			uncomfortable  if id a known we 
			was gonna have to walk all the way 
			to ramelle i never would a 
			volunteered for this here mission

					  miller
			you didnt volunteer jackson

					  jackson
			i most likely would have sir had i 
			been given the opportunity

					  reiben
			if we find ryan and hes still alive 
			that sonofabitch is gonna carry 
			this goddamned bar back to the 
			beach for me

					  jackson
			army life is too dang easy my feet 
			have gone soft  back home we go 
			out squirrel huntin i walk forever 
			and a day and then some dont even 
			raise a blister

					  reiben
			you know what a bar weighs  
			nineteen and a half pounds not 
			counting ammo
					re ammo bandoleers
			and you think these things are 
			comfortable  they may look good but 
			they weigh twelve pounds each thats 
			thirtysix pounds right there

					  wade
			so what  ive got three satchel 
			charges six gammon grenades a dozen
			andahalf pineapples and all my 
			regular gear  you dont hear me 
			complaining

					  reiben
			thats because as i have pointed 
			out on numerous occasions you are a 
			happy idiot

					  wade
			no i just happen to take the 
			captains advice and look at the 
			bright side of things

					  upham
			how do you do it

					  wade
			its easy it runs in my family 
			take my grandfather for example

					  reiben
			oh christ now we gotta listen to 
			that grandfather thing again

					  wade
			as i was saying before i was so 
			rudely interrupted my grandfather 
			got old as grandfathers tend to do  
			he needed someone to take care of 
			him  we move around all the time 
			going from one mine to another so 
			we had to put him in a home  nice 
			enough place but kind of depressing  
			but not for granddad  he just 
			convinced himself he was on a cruise 
			ship going to tahiti he had his 
			own cabin first class with room 
			service  it just so happened that 
			the weather was always lousy so he 
			never bothered to go up on deck  
			happiest guy you ever saw until the 
			day he died

					  upham
			you think he really believed it

					  wade
			who knows  it worked

					  reiben
			fine you convince yourself you got 
			a pack full of feathers and goddamned 
			private james ryan can carry my 
			fucking gear

					  wade
			reiben you can be very unpleasant 
			to be around sometimes

					  reiben
			you want unpleasant  just wait i 
			can do much better than this

					  wade
			look at upham you dont hear him 
			complaining

	upham feeling bold and a bit naughty decides to give it a 
	shot

					  upham
			well as a matter of fact i was 
			just thinking

	the men roll their eyes expecting the worst

					  upham
					continuing
			that im so fucking tired of this 
			goddamned walking id pay a thousand 
			dollars to see that bastard ryan 
			crawl on his belly over an acre of 
			broken glass to hear my greataunt 
			martha fart through a fieldphone

	the men are stunned

					  reiben
			jesus christ hes a natural

					  miller
			upham are you sure youve never 
			been in combat

	upham wiggles with pride  upham positive sir im certain 
	id remember

	miller eyes upham respectfully and nods to the men

					  miller
			hes good

	they walk on

					  jackson
			capn my feet are most uncomfortable

	miller smiles situation normal

	ext st mere  late afternoon

	a small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active 
	battlefield  heavy small arms fire  grenade and mortar 
	explosions  medium artillery beyond  american soldiers 
	crouch in doorways firing at wellplaced germans

	some french civilians dash across a street  a man and a 
	couple of women one carrying a child  they make it across 
	and disappear into the remains of a building

	miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a 
	corner  sarge and the other men follow in leapfrog spread 
	out down the block behind him

	miller glances around the corner taking a quick mental 
	picture of a gathering of gis crouching in the cover of 
	an alley across the street and down the block  they are 
	captain hamill about millers age and his men

	as miller ducks back behind the corner a german bullet 
	smashes into the bricks where his head was an instant before

	miller motions jackson across first

					  miller
			stay low

	jackson gathers himself takes off  german bullets blast 
	kicking up the cobblestone behind him  jackson zigzags and 
	makes it to the cover of the far side

					  jackson
			dang  that was close

	miller nods to upham

					  miller
			your turn

	upham scared shitless doesnt move  miller speaks to him 
	very gently

					  miller
			zigzag change your pace a couple 
			times youll be alright

	uphams frozen  he can barely breathe  miller sighs

					  miller
			okay im going to draw fire for 
			you
					sternly
			but if i do you goddamned well better 
			go

	upham nods  miller gathers himself takes a deep breath

	close shot  millers hand quivers

					  miller
			looks to upham

					  miller
			ready

	upham nods still terrified

	miller steps into the open

	stands motionless presenting himself to the german snipers

					  miller
			go

	upham runs

	a german bullet hits the bricks near miller

	he doesnt budge

	upham tears across the street very very fast

	reiben watches upham run

					  reiben
			hey that guy can move

	a german bullet whizzes past millers ear  upham gets to 
	the far side

	miller ducks back around the corner  reiben and wade dont 
	even react to what miller has just done  sarge is pissed  
	he shakes his head at miller like an irritated parent

					  sarge
					under his breath so 
					only miller can hear
			damn fool
					beat
			sir

					  reiben
			captain hes fast

					  miller
					glances at sarge 
					speaks to reiben
			glad of it

					  upham

			crouches in a doorway with jackson  
			upham is a bit in shock less from 
			the nearness of the bullets than 
			from what miller just did for him

					  miller
			dashes across the street

	german bullets trail him shattering the cobblestones inches 
	behind him

	he makes it across  calls back to sarge

					  miller
			bring em over

	upham tries to thank miller

					  upham
			captain i

	miller ignores him motions to sarge reiben and wade

					  miller
			one at a time

					  miller
			ducks out of the doorway and crouch
			runs down the block  he passes a

					  bombed out building
			out of the line of fire  a dozen 
			dead american soldiers lined up on 
			the ground  the battered bloody 
			bodies only partially covered by 
			ponchos

	some badly wounded gis are being treated next to the dead  
	blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk

					  miller
			sees the dead and wounded shows no 
			reaction  runs to

					  an alley
			captain hamill and his men are bunched 
			there out of the line of fire  
			hes sending off a squad to continue 
			their doortodoor

	captain hamill fundamentals short runs double up at the 
	corners one man close one man wide  be careful  go

	the squad takes off  captain hamill sees miller  the two 
	captains glance at the bars on their shoulders then speak 
	familiarly

	captain hamill how was the road in

					  miller
			we had a jeep until a few hours ago 
			a nice one it had a cute little 
			flag with a couple of stars on it

	captain hamill oh what a shame

	one by one millers men join them in the alley

					  miller
			we called in a strike on the eighty
			eights that took it out but its 
			the kraut spotter that counts 
			wherever the hell that bastard is

	captain hamill points across a wide field toward a distant 
	chateau that has a private chapel with a fiftyfoot steeple

	captain hamill thats where your boy is  weve been trying 
	to get him since this morning  he killed two of my men trying 
	to get close enough for a shot  miller eyes the distant 
	steeple

					  miller
			jackson

	jackson steps up  miller points to the steeple  jackson 
	knows what hes supposed to do  he puts down his m1 and 
	takes off the long zippered leather sheath strapped to 
	his back

	he spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice then calmly and 
	methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very 
	unusual longbarrel rifle

	miller and his men give him some room  hamill and his men 
	along with upham watch curiously

	jackson opens a twofoot tripod with a flick of his wrist 
	sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it  then he 
	takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it  he 
	adjusts the eyepiece and clicks in the boltaction  upham 
	is fascinated

					  upham
			what is that

	jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single oversized 
	shell

					  jackson
			thirtyoughtsix norton longbarrel 
			with dualgroove parallel rifling 
			elevated threeglass scope and a 
			singlethrow hammer

					  upham
			the army gave you that

					  jackson
			yep

					  upham
			you must be a hell a shot

					  jackson
			not where i come from

	jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and 
	fires  evaluates  calibrates the scope  he reloads

	jackson fires again  evaluates  perfect  he wipes the 
	dirt and sweat from his forehead puts his eye to the sight 
	and waits absolutely motionless

					  upham
			that must be four thousand yards

					  jackson
					without taking his 
					eye from the scope
			fortytwohundred i figure

					  upham
			you take account of the wind

	jackson doesnt dignify that with an answer but he looks 
	back with an expression that clearly says what are you 
	some kind of fucking idiot reiben puts himself between 
	upham and jackson

					  reiben
					puton southern accent
			dang right he take count of the 
			wind aint yall ever heard a 
			kentucky windage

	jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the 
	trigger

					  jackson
			reiben how many time i got to tell 
			you im from tennessee

					  reiben
			they got squirrels there too right

	jackson fires  waits  a tiny smile  he starts taking apart 
	the rifle  a very impressed captain hamill barks to his 
	radioman  captain hamill get a hold of command tell them 
	the st mere road is open

	the radioman cranks up his radio  captain hamill turns to 
	miller

	captain hamill how far back is the rest of division

					  miller

	captain hamill goddamn it i was afraid of that  were in a 
	lot of trouble up here and its gonna get worse before it 
	gets better  how many men did you bring

					  miller
			five but we not staying were on 
			our way to ramelle

	captain hamill shit are you the guys going up to find private 
	ryan

					  miller
			yeah you know about that

	captain hamill command radioed wanted to know if he came in 
	with the early wounded or dead

	several of captain hamills men among them a gentlefaced 
	private prick up their ears at the mention of private ryan

	captain hamill were supposed to tell you they intercepted 
	a german transmission after you left  the krauts have two 
	companies on their way to ramelle to take back that bridge 
	theyll be there sometime late tomorrow

					  miller

	hell out of there before those krauts show up

					  miller

	captain hamill you dont until tonight were hemmed in 
	real tight  after dark you try to slip out to the east  if 
	you tiptoe stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens 
	youve got a fair chance of making it up to ramelle by 
	tomorrow night

	miller processes the information  captain hamill shakes his 
	head

	captain hamill tough huh  three brothers

	miller shrugs

	captain hamill we sure as hell could use your help here but 
	i understand what youre doing

					  miller
			yeah

	captain hamill good luck

					  miller
			thanks

	captain hamill i mean it  find him  get him home

	miller is a bit taken aback by captain hamills forceful 
	sincerity  then he shakes it off and motions to his men

					  miller
			lets find someplace to hole up

	miller nods to captain hamill then as he moves to the head 
	of the alley miller passes upham

					  upham

	he takes off crouchrunning back down the block  upham 
	watches him go

					  upham

			he stepped right into the open so i 
			could get across

					  jackson
			shit that was no big deal

					  wade
			they cant kill him

					  sarge

					  reiben
			wades right its some kind of 
			scientific magnetic thing i cant

	the men are equal parts joking and admiring  sarge is 
	neither

					  sarge
			no ones bulletproof  no one

			cmon stay low

	sarge takes off after miller

	ext st mere cathedral  dusk

	miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins 
	of a medieval church  miller settled into a comfortable 
	spot in the debris eating his krations looks very relaxed  
	reiben paces

					  reiben
			captain could you please explain 
			the math of this mission to me

					  miller
			sure what do you want to know

					  reiben
			well sir in purely arithmetic terms 
			since when does six equal one  whats 
			the sense in risking six guys to 
			save one

					  miller
			ours is not to reason why

					  reiben
			huh

					  miller
			never mind dont worry well pick 
			up this kid hightail it back to 
			division everythingll work out 
			fine

					  reiben
			id much rather die in caen than 
			ramelle sir  its a personal thing

					  miller
			reiben theres a fairly good chance 
			youre not going to die at all

					  reiben
			easy for you to say sir
					beat
			fucking james ryan id like to wring 
			his fucking neck

					  sarge
			jesus reiben think of the poor 
			bastards mother

					  reiben

					  reiben
			wade sarge corporal insect all of 
			us hell ill bet even the captain

	miller smiles  reiben eyes him and reconsiders

					  reiben
			well maybe not the captain but the 
			rest of us have mothers

					  miller
			you have orders too

					  jackson
			sir i have an opinion on this matter

					  miller
			id love to hear it

					  jackson
			seems to me capn this mission is 
			a serious misallocation of valuable 
			military resources  miller go on

					  jackson
			well sir by my way a thinkin i am 
			a finely made instrument of warfare  
			what i mean by that is if you was 
			to put me with this here sniper rifle 
			anywhere up to and includin one 
			mile from adolf hitler with a clear 
			line of sight wars over

	miller nods

					  miller
			reiben i want you to listen closely 
			to jackson  this is the way to gripe  
			jackson continue

					  jackson
			yes sir  it seems to me sir that 
			the entire resources of the united 
			states army oughta be dedicated to 
			one thing and one thing only and 
			that is to put me and this here weapon 
			on a rooftop smackdab in the middle 
			of berlin germany  now i aint one 
			to question decisions made up on 
			high sir but it seems to me that 
			saving one private no matter how 
			grievous the losses of his family 
			is a waste of my godgiven talent

					  miller
			wade

					  wade
			hell i dont mind this mission 
			sir as long as theres something up 
			at ramelle for

					  reiben
					finishing wades 
					sentence
			for you to blow up yeah yeah 
			we heard that

					  miller
			upham

					  upham
			pass

					  miller
			sarge

					  sarge
			im just here to keep a bunch of 
			numbnuts including one certain 
			frequently suicidal tempteroffate 
			from getting themselves killed

	reiben eyes miller

					  reiben
			and what about you captain

	miller looks at reiben shocked

					  miller
			reiben whats the matter with you  
			i dont gripe to you  im a captain  
			theres a chain of command  griping 
			goes one way up only up never 
			down  you gripe to me i gripe to 
			my superior officers  up get it  
			i dont gripe to you i dont gripe 
			in front of you  how long you been 
			in the army

					  reiben
			im sorry sir i apologize
					beat
			but if you werent a captain or if 
			i were a major what would you say

	miller considers his response

					  miller
			in that case i would say this is an 
			excellent mission with an extremely 
			valuable objective worthy of my 
			best efforts

	reiben rolls his eyes  miller plays it straight with no 
	obvious sarcasm

					  miller
					continuing
			in addition as i pointed out earlier 
			i have a fondness for cheese and i 
			hope to have the opportunity to sample 
			some of the ramelle products when 
			we arrive there to see if they live 
			up to their excellent reputation  
			moreover i feel heartfelt sorrow 
			for the mother of private james ryan 
			and im more than willing to lay 
			down my life and the lives of my 
			men especially you reiben to help 
			relieve her suffering  the men 
			thoroughly enjoy the performance

					  reiben
			sir if you were not a captain i 
			would compliment you now for being 
			an excellent liar

					  miller
			but i am a captain  if i were not a 
			captain i would thank you for the 
			compliment and tell you that the 
			ability to lie comes from being a 
			topnotch poker player which i am 
			having learned at the side of my 
			mother who is by popular acclaim 
			the best poker player in

	the men all  learn forward expectantly believing theyre 
	about to find out millers home town  miller smiles

					  miller
					continuing
			my home town which shall remain 
			unnamed

	the men ease back disappointed

					  miller
			any further thoughts on the subject

					  reiben
			yes sir as a final note id like 
			to say fuck our orders fuck ramelle 
			fuck the cheese capital of france 
			and while were at it fuck private 
			james ryan

					  miller
			ill make a note of your suggestions 
			but ill leave that last one to you 
			especially if hes already dead

	the men wince and laugh  miller checks his watch and gets 
	serious

					  miller
			we move out in two hours try and 
			get some sleep

	the men know when to can it  without another word they all 
	settle down into the debris close their eyes and try to 
	follow millers order  upham looks around at these strange 
	men then a simple hard glare from miller makes him follow 
	suit

	miller looks at his men then pulls out his map case and his 
	flashlight  he turns it on in the dim glow of the light 
	he studies his maps while his men rest

	ext st mere cathedral  night later

	dark  artillery rumbles in the distance  reiben jackson 
	wade and upham sleep  miller still sits in the glow of his 
	flashlight studying his maps  sarge lies near him awake 
	watching him  sarge notices some unopened envelopes in 
	millers map case and speaks quietly to him

					  sarge
			you ever going to open those letters  
			miller keeps his eyes on the maps

					  miller
			maybe

					  sarge
			its not normal not reading letters 
			from home

					  miller
			since when have things been normal

					  sarge
			you got me  afraid of bad news

					  miller
			nope

					  sarge
			good news

	miller looks at sarge  a moment passes between the two of 
	them then miller takes refuge in the maps  sarge looks at 
	the men

					  sarge
			you think theyll be alright

					  miller
			theyre fine  as long as they can 
			gripe theyll be alright

					  sarge
			and what about you

	miller considers the question doesnt answer

					  miller
			they guys here arent going to be 
			able to hold out until battalion 
			shows up

					  sarge
			nope

					  miller
			command isnt going to let them 
			withdraw and the germans sure as 
			hell arent going to let them 
			surrender

					  sarge
			three for three

					  miller
			if we stayed we could make a 
			difference

					  sarge
			youre kidding yourself

					  miller
			you never know

	they sit in silence for a moment

					  sarge
			i hope this boy ryan is worth it

					  miller
			now youre the one kidding yourself

			hell of  a mission

					  sarge
			yup hell of a mission

	miller looks at his watch rises and barks at the men

					  miller
			rise and shine boys  lets go

	gear

	ext st mere street  night

	small arms fire echoes through the village  distant artillery 
	booms  miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral 
	toward the outskirts of town  theyre just a small squad 
	but these six heavilyarmed men in full battle gear are 
	very formidablelooking

	ext st mere  outskirts  night

	millers men are getting ready to move out  captain hamill 
	and a few of his men are there to see them off  suddenly

	a flash of light appears on the horizon

	then repeated flashes of light  the sky is on fire  the 
	air trembles  a far off rumbling thunder rolls over the 
	countryside like a tidal wave

	then the opposite horizon lights up as well

	its a massive artillery battle  the magnitude of the fury 
	is incredible strange otherworldly

	every man there is transfixed

	frozen in place  the lights play on their faces

	miller looks down and sees his hand quivering

	sarge notices says nothing

	miller stares at his hand forcing it to stop  their eyes 
	go back to the blazing sky

					  sarge
					awestruck
			makes you feel small doesnt it

					  miller
			it doesnt take this

	uphams face shows more fear than awe

					  upham
			i wasnt made for this

					  miller
					bitterly
			you think the rest of us were

	upham recoils  miller instantly regrets his words  he turns 
	to upham and sees that hes really scared  miller get a 
	hold of himself and speaks gently

					  miller
			dont worry upham godll protect 
			you this shits gonna keep him up 
			all night anyway

	upham manages a slight smile  miller watches the lights for 
	a moment more then he pretends to shrug it off

					  miller
			lets go this aint what they pay 
			us for

	captain hamill is next to snap himself out of it  he points 
	the way

	captain hamill along the wall about thirty yards theres a 
	gate on the other side a drainage ditch stay low until 
	you clear the second field then youll hit the woods

	as miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to 
	move out on of captain hamills men the gentlefaced private 
	who was so interested in the talk of private ryan steps up 
	with a couple bandoleers of bar ammo  he offers them to 
	reiben

	gentlefaced private here

	reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart
	ass response when a look at the gentlefaced privates 
	vulnerable expression stops the comment dead

	gentlefaced private my older brother was killed at 
	guadalcanalthese might come in handy

	reiben takes the ammo

					  reiben
					gently
			just what i need

	miller steps over takes the bandoleers from reiben and hands 
	them back to the gentlefaced private

					  miller
			thanks but you may need these more 
			than us or ryan

	captain hamill nods to the gentlefaced private who takes 
	the ammo back

					  miller
			lets move out

	miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness 
	lit intermittently by the distant flashes  captain hamill 
	and his beleaguered men watch them go with dread and a 
	strange bit of hope

	ext french country side  night

	the final rumbles of the distant artillery fade away  the 
	night is dark  the band of six americans makes their way 
	warily along a french cart path  sarge eases up alongside 
	miller and speaks quietly to him  the others dont overhear  
	sarge how longs your hand been shaking

					  miller
			a couple of weeks  it started in 
			portsmouth when they brought us down 
			for loading

					  sarge
			is it getting worse

					  miller
			no  it comes and goes  it stops 
			when i look at it

					  sarge
			you may have to find yourself a new 
			line of work this one doesnt seem 
			to agree with you anymore

					  miller
			ill be alright

	sarge looks at miller closely evaluating him they walk 
	on

	ext french cart path  night later

	farther along  the men are tired but alert  jackson is at 
	point  miller behind him  the others at intervals  sarge 
	brings up the rear

	a sound  jackson stops  no one speaks they communicate 
	only with hand signals

	jackson signals to miller ten twenty thirty men coming

	miller signals for the men to get off the path  they ease 
	into the brush  an instant later a pair wary german infantry 
	men appear

	reiben grips his bar and looks to miller for permission 
	to open up  miller shakes his head and signals let them 
	go a moment later an entire platoon of germans rounds the 
	bend  fifty men  heavily armed  reiben breathes a sigh of 
	relief and lowers hi bar

	the german platoon passes their boots no more than two feet 
	from the faces of the hidden americans  upham is wideeyed 
	with fear  the others are stonefaced

	the germans pass

	miller motions for his men to hold their positions

	upham doesnt see the signal  he stands breathing a sigh 
	of relief just as a german whiptail squad appears trailing 
	the platoon by thirty meters protecting their rear

	upham freezes  hes standing barely in the shadows nearly 
	exposed  shitting bricks

	pissed miller prepares to fire  the whiptail squad 
	approaches

	then the germans pass miraculously not seeing upham in 
	the shadows  they walk on and disappear  upham is weak
	kneed amazed that hes still alive

	miller shoots a devastating glare at him then signals the 
	rest of the men to follow him into the woods  upham scurries 
	after miller staying close on his heels

	ext field  night

	the little band of americans walks along the edge of a field 
	parallel to a cart path  wary

	miller notices jackson and wade drifting too close to each 
	other  he snaps his fingers getting their attention and 
	motions curtly for them to open it up a bit  they do so

	ext crossroads  night

	dark  faint distant artillery  miller checks the map as 
	sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional 
	signs  one of them reads  ramelle 16 km miller puts 
	away the map  checks the horizon  the first glow of dawn 
	is visible

					  miller
			itll be light soon  lets pick it 
			up

	ext french countryside  dawn

	first light  the sound of distant guns has been replaced by 
	the chirping of birds  the americans are taking five

	miller stands a bit apart from the others looking out at 
	the view  its lovely  dew shimmers on the long grass  
	the war is far away

	upham walks next to him  they look out at the view together 
	without speaking for a moment

					  miller
			it looks like a renoir

					  upham
			yes  do you know sibelius fourth 
			symphony the normandy

					  miller
			ive been humming it

					  upham
			i heard

			ill let you know and well split 
			the money

					  upham
			if thats the way you feel why dont 
			we wait until its up to a thousand

					  miller
			i dont expect to live that long

	upham looks closely at miller and sees that he means it

					  upham
			five hundred then

	miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to 
	feel an overwhelming wave of sadness  then he turns himself 
	back into a commander and barks at upham

					  miller
			lets go private

	miller strides away  upham watches him trying to figure 
	him out then he simply follows him

	ext hedgerow lane  dawn

	the seven americans walk along a hedgerow lane untouched by 
	war  spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is 
	lined with hedgerows thick rooted masses impenetrable 
	hundred of years old

	miller sees smoke ahead  he motions to the men  they 
	advance  ext french farm  day a burning house and barn  
	an old french farmer kneels on the ground weeping next to 
	this slaughtered family two adult women an adult male and 
	a boy no more than ten  his animals a pair of cows and a 
	draft horse and some pigs are dead as well shot to pieces  
	a dead american paratrooper lies sprawled in the dirt with 
	empty shell casings around his body

	miller and his men approach carefully  miller motions to 
	upham who squats down next to the french farmer and speaks 
	gently to him in french

	the farmer speaks softly as if in a trance  upham stands 
	and translates

					  upham
			five nights ago he found this 
			paratrooper caught in a tree with a 
			broken leg  the leg got infected  
			last night he went to ville cholet 
			to get a doctor  the doctor refused 
			to come and when he got back this 
			is what he found  the krauts must 
			have shown up while he was gone

					  miller
			did he see any sign of them

	upham gently asks  the farmer answers

					  upham
			no but he heard firing just east 
			less that a kilometer

					  miller
			thank him and tell him were sorry 
			about his loss

	miller heads off without glancing back  the men hesitate  
	sarge jerks his head for them to move out  they do so

	upham squats down and speaks softly to the farmer puts his 
	hand on the mans shoulder then rises and follows the others

	ext hedgerow field  day

	a beautiful hedgerowlined field of tall grass  the last 
	of the dew and morning mist is just burning off

	the six americans walk carefully through the woods to the 
	edge of the field

	miller notices something  he silently signals stop crouches 
	and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side

	sarge and jackson ease up next to him  jackson points to 
	some trees nearby freshly shattered and pockmarked with 
	bullets

	wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush

					  wade
			captain

	staying low they join wade who has found

	two dead american paratroopers

	a trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field

	miller sarge and jackson

	crawl to the edge of the field scan the far hedgerow  the 
	others crawl up behind them

					  miller
			where

					  jackson
			in the shadow by those two trees

					  miller
			my guess too

					  upham
			what is it

					  miller
			a machine gun

	miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover 
	of the brush  he stands and takes off his pack

					  reiben
			sir ive got an idea lets go 
			around

					  miller
			we cant leave it here

					  jackson
			we left them eightyeights

					  miller
			they dont send planes to put out 
			machine guns
					beat
			two flank runners with surpressing 
			fire  im going right whoever goes 
			left has to be fast

	upham steels himself and steps forward

					  upham
			sir i ran the 220 in high school

	miller takes uphams measure  wade laughs with a sneer

					  wade
			how fast

			i would have won the states if some 
			bastard hadnt tripped me in the 
			finals

	miller points the others to their firing positions

					  miller
			sarge upham here  jackson reiben 
			ten yards either side

	as they take their positions miller and sarge speak quietly 
	out of earshot of the men

					  sarge
			rule of thumb captain says you 
			ought to detail this one instead of 
			going yourself

	miller looks at the two dead paratroopers

					  miller
			yeah  what rule of thumb is that

					  sarge
			how about i go right sir

					  miller
			how about you take your position

	sarge hesitates

					  sarge
			how about

					  miller
					interrupting
			how about you shut up and take your 
			position

	he watches miller head off into the brush alone

	miller walks into a small clearing slows then stops  the 
	life drains from him  he stands there looking at the dirt 
	tilting his head this way and that as if listening for 
	faint distant voices  his face shows a battle raging within 
	as he fights to keep from losing it entirely  behind him 
	sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches  miller 
	senses his presence turns and looks at him if he were a 
	thousand miles away  sarge sits down on a log and waits

					  miller
			what was the name of that kid at 
			anzio the one who got his face burned 
			off

					  sarge
			vecchio

					  miller
			yeah vecchio i couldnt remember 
			his name he was a good kid remember 
			how he used to walk on his hands and 
			sing that song about the man on flying 
			trapeze

					  sarge
			yeah

					  miller
			you know why im such a good officer  
			because of my mother  have i ever 
			told you about her

					  sarge
			bits and pieces

					  miller
			shes the best poker player you ever 
			saw  my father used to go to these 
			saturday night games and lose his 
			shirt  finally my mother gave him 
			an ultimatum either she gets a 
			regular seat at the table or she 
			locks him in every saturday night  
			he squawked and so did his buddies 
			but after a while they gave in and 
			from the first night she sat down 
			she never lost  she could read those 
			cocky bastards like they were playing 
			open hands  and he bluffs  he had 
			sixteen levels of bullshit  her 
			eyes the tone of her voice her 
			bets her jokes the way she sipped 
			her coffee she was a master  she 
			won more money on shit hands than 
			anyone in the history of the game  
			every saturday night my father would 
			lose two three hundred bucks and 
			shed win it all back and then some  
			and id stand there glued to her 
			shoulder from the time i was five 
			years old watching every hand every 
			move studying how she did it
					beat
			thats why im such a good officer 
			i can look at a mans face and tell 
			you exactly what hes holding and 
			if its a shit hand i know just 
			what cards to deal him

					  sarge
			and what about your own hand

					  miller
			no problem  a pair of deuces  less  
			so what  i bluff  it used to tear 
			me apart when id get one of my men 
			killed but what was i supposed to 
			do  break down in front of the ones 
			who were standing there waiting for 
			me to tell them what to do  of course 
			not so i bluffed and after a while 
			i started to fall for my own bluff  
			it was great it made everything so 
			much easier  sarge is that why your 
			hands been shaking

					  miller
			it could be worse  you know the 
			first thing they teach you at ocs  
			lie to your men

					  sarge
			oh yeah

					  miller
			not in so many words but they tell 
			you you can have all the firepower 
			in the world and if your men dont 
			have good morale its not worth a 
			damn  so if youre scared or empty 
			or halfastep from a section eight 
			do you tell your men  of course 
			not  you bluff you lie

					  sarge
			and how do you bluff yourself

					  miller
			simple numbers  every time you 
			kill one of your men you tell 
			yourself you just saved the lives of 
			two three ten a hundred others  
			we lost what thirtyone on the 
			cliffs  ill bet we saved ten times 
			that number by putting out those 
			guns  thats over three hundred 
			men  maybe five hundred  a thousand  
			then thousand  any number you want  
			see  its simple  it lets you always 
			choose mission over men

					  sarge
			except this time the mission is a 
			man

					  miller
			thats the rub  i liked wade  whos 
			ryan  if theyre both standing in 
			front of me and i have to shoot one 
			or the other how do i choose  look 
			at my hand there it goes again

					  sarge
			john ive got to tell you i think 
			youre about used up

					  miller
			i think youre right keith

					  sarge
			you want me to take over

	the question helps miller pull himself back together  he 
	looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again

					  miller
			no but if i get any worse youll 
			have to relieve me

					  sarge
					sighs
			just what i want to do

	they share a smile

					  miller
			you know wade was the eleventh of 
			the twelve youre the last one still 
			alive

					  sarge
			i know

					  miller
			dont let yourself get killed if 
			you do they might make me give back 
			the medal and then i wont be able 
			to lip off to colonels anymore

					  sarge
			ill do my best

	they shake their heads at the madness of it all  miller 
	hell of a

					  beat
			ah forget it

	miller picks up his thompson and looks around reorienting 
	himself  hes about ninetyfive percent there

					  miller
			thanks for drawing that machine gun 
			off me

					  sarge
			youre welcome john

					  miller
			but thats my personal brand of 
			stupidity i feel kind of proprietary 
			about it if you do it again youre 
			busted

			there was one but he died a long 
			time ago hes been dead for so long 
			you can hardly remember his name 
			you understand

					  jackson

			yep you step on a rusty nail get 
			lockjaw never say another word as 
			long as you live

	miller laughs  miller ill bite reiben

					  reiben
			ive given this a lot of thought 
			sir  the best thing that could happen 
			is we find ryan and hes dead

					  miller
			whys that

					  reiben
			well sir consider the possibilities  
			a  ryan is alive  we have to take 
			him back to the beach  knowing you 
			you dont let him carry my gear 
			even though he really should and we 
			all get killed trying to keep him 
			alive

					  miller
			except for the last part that ones 
			not bad

					  reiben
			b  ryan is dead  hes been blown 
			up by the german equivalent of wade 
			whose name i know you dont want me 
			to mention  theres nothing to find  
			the biggest piece is the size of a 
			pea  we wander around looking for 
			him until the germans pick us off 
			one after another

					  miller
			i dont like that one

					  reiben
			neither do i sir  c  and this is 
			the worst one we find ryan and hes 
			wounded  not only does he not carry 
			my gear we have to carry his gear  
			and him

					  miller
			but we accomplish the mission

					  reiben
			maybe  but what if he dies on the 
			way back  you see what im saying 
			sir  the best possible situation 
			is hes dead we find his body 
			more or less intact we grab one of 
			his dogtags and hightail it back 
			to the beach or better yet we head 
			over to caen and catch up with 
			division

					  miller
			has anyone ever told you youre

	do  the sound grows louder  its an ominous rumble

					  miller
			i dont think so

	appear down the road heading for the german soldiers who

	to leap over the barricade

	forrest eleven sir  we started with thirtysix  the bridge

	somehow he remains upright

	ryan all three
