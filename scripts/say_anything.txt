skies again

dad do you know what he did the first night i went out with him  
we were walking across by the seveneleven and he pointed out 
some glass for me to walk around  and i always think of that 
when people say what are you doing with lloyd dobler  and i 
never get nervous around him  so we started spending all thins 
time together as friends  but i could feel him getting 
anxious and then i knew that there would be a confrontation over 
getting physical  and he started to get that look at the end of 
the night  do you know that look

jim nods

and then you know its going to be an issue  so i went through 
all the different feelings and all the different arguments youre 
supposed to go through

jim
did he ever get rough with you

diane
dad no  but i didnt want any problems so i decided not to 
sleep with him

jim looks relieved

but then i attacked him anyway

for his reaction

it always feels good to tell you the truth  because if i cant 
share it with you its almost like it didnt happen

statement
