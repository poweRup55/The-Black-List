               harris watches in awe a magicians assistant passes a hoop 
               over her

               the ceiling fan whack the blades slam into her head sending 
               her flying back down on to the bed

               he staggers over to the bed kneels and starts to pray

               harris exits the room to retrieve his medical bag he returns 
               to find mcfeely lying unconscious on the bed megan sitting 
               quiet looks at mcfeely

               harris rushes over to mcfeely

               harris caught up in the moment is oblivious that mcfeely 
               is okay he starts pounding violently on his chest

               harris kneedrops mcfeely his efforts to revive mcfeely 
               resemble a wwf grudge match harris diving off of furniture 
               slamming down on mcfeely finally he checks his pulse he 
               thinks mcfeely is dead harris shouts out at megan

                         look what youve done

               megan sits quietly

               harris dives on top of megan and starts choking her

                                     harris

                         him at the mall about six months ago 
                         and i was too nervous to introduce 
                         myself so i followed him to his car 
                         and jotted down the license plate 
                         number it was registered to his 
                         mother so i went to her house she 
                         was so nice i mean she seemed like 
                         she would be nice cuz i never really 
                         spoke to her i just waited til she 
                         went to work then i climbed in through 
                         her window and borrowed her phone 
                         book i say borrowed because im 
                         going to give it back one day but 
                         anyway i called everyone in it til 
                         i found her son he wasnt home when 
                         i called so i left this message how

               hanson raises a large knife then rests his little hand on 
               the turkey to hold it steady

                                     hanson

                         ingredient in the stuffing

               hanson pulls out a box of hamburger helpless with a crippled 
               white glove on the box

               everyone moans their appetites ruined as hanson continues

                         man named archibald keaton as a gift 
                         to his wife cora

                         anyway the last owner was a very 
                         rich man who built his empire off

                         this town he lived like a king until 
                         one day the servants of the house 
                         killed him

               a log in the fireplace snaps startling everyone

                                     brenda

                         this clock

               the clock strikes twelve the bird shoots out and pecks her 
               in the face she falls into a mirror

                                     brenda
                         this mirror

               her own reflection punches her in the face

               brenda sails against the wall she sees a collection of swords 
               and knives displayed on the wall

                                     brenda

               cindy opens it to reveal a secret room

                                                                    cut to

                         it must be a private study or 
                         something

               cindy finds an old newspaper

               headline servants kill hugh kane theres a picture of 
               hugh kane and an article on the killing

                                     cindy
                         theres more to the story of this 
                         house than the professor told us it 
                         says here that hugh kane had a wife 
                         who died mysteriously a week before 
                         the servants killed him

               buddy looks at the painting on the wall he wipes away the 
               dust exposing the face

               the painting is of a woman it looks like cindy shes wearing 
               a pendant around her neck

                                     buddy
                         whoa check this out she looks like

                         wow shes beautiful you really 
                         think she looks like me

                                     buddy

                         ends at yours her skin isnt as 
                         oily as yours either also sometimes 
                         your eyes get kinda squinty and they 
                         look like you might have downs 
                         syndrome or something otherwise the 
                         resemblance is uncanny

               cindy is feeling terrible about herself now for a moment we 
               think the criticism is done

                                     buddy
                         oh yeah another difference is she 
                         looks more sophisticated and classy 
                         more feminine and her tits are 
                         perfect not pointy and funny looking 
                         or spaced too far apart

                                     cindy
                              annoyed
                         alright

               cindy finds a small chest ornately decorated the name 
               carolyn inscribed on it

                                     cindy
                         buddy look at this i think it

               cindy and buddy nearly jump out of their skin

               reveal

               a black cat

                                     buddy

               cindy grabs the chest and they exit

               int brendas bedroom  night

               the room is dark the only light is the moonlight brenda 
               stirs in bed ray is next to her

                         sleeping in the arms of a strong 
                         man

                                     ray
                         yeah me too

               brenda gives a confused look

                                     brenda
                         im gonna take a shower ill be 
                         right back

               brenda exits

               ray sits on the bed for a moment he notices a clown doll 
               sitting in a rocking chair across the room the moonlight 
               gives the clown face an eerie glow

               ray takes off his shirt and tosses it at the clown covering 
               its face an causing the chair to rock

               ray gets down and does a few pushups

               close on

               the door a foglike mist comes into the room ray feels a 
               chill and checks the thermostat

                                     ray
                         damn its cold

               ray goes to retrieve his shirt he notices the clown is gone

               ray looks around and doesnt see the clown doll anywhere

               suddenly a rustling noise comes from under the bed

               rays breathing quickens he knows where he must now look  
               ray slowly lowers himself head first to the floor of the 
               bed in preparation to look under it

               he very very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and lets the 
               top of his head touch the rug ray is upsidedown as he looks 
               into the darkness under his bed

               under the bed the clown is there face to face with him 
               smiling sardonically

               in the splitsecond it takes for a child to draw a breath 
               and let it out through the vocal chords the clown wraps its 
               five foot extension arms around rays neck cutting off half 
               his air

               wide angle high

               struggling now for his life ray is dragged helplessly under 
               the bed and out of sight under the bed we hear a struggle 
               followed by the evil laugh of the clown

                                     clown doll vo
                         hee hee hee hee

                                     ray vo

               we hear more struggling

                                     clown doll vo
                         hey stop that homey dont play 
                         that

               the clown attempts to climb from under the bed only to be 
               dragged back under by ray now we hear ray laughing 
               maniacally

                                     ray vo
                         hee hee hee hee

                                     clown doll vo
                         no no noooooo

               int brendas bedroom  moments later

               brenda enters to find ray out of breath and buckling his 
               pants

                                     brenda

               angle on

               the clown doll his pants are down by his ankles his head 
               turns to the camera his smile is gone replaced by a frown  
               a single tear is running down his face

               int alexs bedroom  night

               the window blows open curtains flutter in the wind

               alex sleeping her head back her mouth open she snores 
               lightly unaware of the presence in the room a breeze brushes 
               past her causing her hair to move alex remains asleep

               close on

               alex

               the ghost pulls up her tshirt to reveal a pair of perfect 
               breasts

               her breasts get squeezed at the base and bulge out like 
               water balloons but she still doesnt wake up

               the ghost continues kissing her neck

               alex moans still sleeping

               close on

               alexs face

               her mouth opens wider we see a growing indentation in her 
               cheek as if something is going in and out of her mouth

               suddenly alexs eyes open she sits up and tries to speak

                                     alex
                         mmph mmph

               the back of her head stretches to the shape of a penis

               alex struggles with the force finally breaking free

                                     alex
                         somebody help help

               the ghost pins her to the bed and attacks her throwing her 
               arms over her head alex screams

                                     alex
                              startled
                         ah

               then throwing her legs behind her head she screams again

                                     alex
                         oh okay

               the ghost starts fucking alex hes very rough and dominate

                                     alex
                              intrigued
                         oh my god yes yes

               the ghost drags her up the wall and over a portrait of a 
               solemn looking man

               then alexs butt slides over his face and the man is now 
               smiling

               the ghost drags her across the ceiling and crashes her head 
               into the light fixture

               the sexual olympics continue as she spiderwalks down the 
               wall and is dragged across the floor smoke comes up from 
               beneath her

                                     alex
                         oooh oooh rug burn rug burn

               the ghost gets alex back to the bed and flips her over to 
               reveal tire skid marks down her back

               still the sexcapades continue

                                                                    cut to

               ext house  continuous

               the bedroom window is totally fogged over when alexs hand 
               hits it and slides down the glass ala titanic

                                                                    cut to

               int alexs bedroom  continuous

               suddenly it stops as quickly as it begun

               alex lays disheveled on the bed

                                     alex

               int cindys bedroom  night

               cindy sitting in bed trying to open the chest she is 
               startled by the sound of the door creaking open

                                     cindy

                         hey kitty kitty how you doin 
                         girl

               the cat pauses and gives her the finger by flicking his claw 
               out with the gesture

                                     cindy
                         huh

               suddenly the cat attacks grabbing and scratching her throat

               cindy tosses the cat off and jumps to her feet

               the cat lands and pounces right back

               cindy catches it and throws it down harder sending it 
               crashing into a table which smashes into pieces

               the cat grabs a bottle from the table breaks it holding 
               the jagged side out towards cindy

               gritting with effort

               cindy slowly turns the bottle towards the cat who now looks 
               worried

               cindy makes her move flipping the cat over now shes on 
               top pushing the bottle close to the cats throat

               the cat gives a huge effort and shoves cindy off of itself

               some of the sand in cindys eyes  the cat then picks up a 
               chair and breaks it over cindys head then jumps on her 
               back and tries to strangle her with piano wire but cindy 
               manages to flip the cat forward over her shoulder

               cindy runs into the bathroom and locks herself inside

                                                                    cut to

               hole for the kitty to reach in and turn the knob

                                     cindy

               fall again this time the frame breaks revealing a key hidden 
               in the frame

               beneath her bed she places the key in the hole and turns

               strange look she slowly turns and looks at the bedroom door

                         gotten into you

               he snatches the apple back

               cindy walks over to a basket of fruit on the counter and 
               picks up a banana

               provocatively she peels it and looking deep in his eyes 
               she slips the banana into her mouth sliding it in and out 
               simulating a blow job suddenly the banana breaks off in 
               her throat and she starts to choke on it she turns red 
               gagging and coughing

                                     cindy

               finally realizing that something is wrong the professor 
               runs over to her and does the heimlich on her she finally 
               spits up a big chunk of banana and it plops on the floor

               recovering she sits back down on the stairs continuing her 
               seduction she picks up a whole pineapple and starts licking 
               it sexually and finally shoves the whole thing in her mouth 
               again simulating a blow job

               angle on

               the professor

               hes getting back in the mood getting turned on again

               cindy

               she drops the pineapple and picks up a watermelon shoving 
               that in her mouth  stretching out her mouth and face 
               insanely she slides it in and out of her mouth

               angle on

               satisfied that the professor is well turned on cindy drops 
               the watermelon she then grabs a lit candle and struts to 
               the kitchen steps where she sits and places the candle between 
               her legs

               the professor watches seductively

               cindy spreads her legs lifts the front of her dress a strong 
               gust of air comes from between her legs blowing out the 
               candle the wind is so strong it begins to blow papers and 
               the professor back

               apple to his mouth he takes a bite and she mashes it hard 
               into his mouth then pulls it out along with his dentures

               he quickly pops them back into his mouth

               cindy rips open his shirt to reveal unusually large nipples 
               for a man

               then unbuckling his belt and pants to reveal an adult diaper 
               underneath

               she pushes him back onto the desk and straddles him

                                     professor

               eyes

                         talk with the professor

                                                                    cut to

               int basement  moments later

               the professor exits the lab and heads for the stairs

               out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of a beautiful 
               female ghost in flowing white robes she illuminates a 
               brilliant white light

                                     professor
                         hello have we met hi

               the ghost lures the professor down the corridor

               new angle

               we are in a different section of the hallway

               the professor continues to follow the ghost he has a bit of 
               trouble keeping up

                                     professor
                              calling after
                         ummmm hello umm

               the professor follows into yet another area of hallway

               new angle

               the ghost tempts the professor into a pitch black corridor

                                     professor
                         ummm are you mrs hanson

                         creature

               the professor disappears into the darkness

               he takes out a lighter to illuminate his way

                                     professor
                         hello hello are you hiding
                              alternate
                         where are you sexy pants

               a horrific look crosses the professors face the beautiful 
               spirit morphs into hugh kanes ghost

               the professor takes a beat

                                     professor
                              resigned
                         what the hell ive done worse

               the professor walks into the darkness

               rest of scene to come

                                                                    cut to

               int alexs bedroom  night

               alex sits in front of her vanity mirror wearing a sexy robe 
               and nightgown she brushes her hair humming to herself 
               happily full of anticipation

               she takes her perfume  obsession  and dabs some on her 
               neck behind her ears inside her thighs then she puts the 
               bottle to her mouth and  glug glug glug  drinks the 
               whole thing down like gatorade

               alex applies hot wax to a waxing strip then to her legs 
               tearing it off satisfied her legs are smooth she does her 
               underarm she then applies a waxsoaked strip between her 
               legs then tears it off

                                     alex
                         ouch

               she checks the strip to reveal her pussy lips stuck to the 
               strip

                                     alex

               she puts them back between her legs

               she rises and walks over to the old 19th centurystyle 
               portrait of the supposed ghost which once hung prominently 
               downstairs it now sits propped up in a corner of her room 
               with a shrine set up all around it consisting of candles 
               little i love you hearts and her vibrator

               alex walks over to the portrait regards it lovingly for a 
               moment and then kisses the figure sweetly on the lips then 
               she works her way down the portrait  hungrily kissing 
               nibbling and licking when she pulls back seductively the 
               cobwebs dust and spiders that were clinging to the portrait 
               are now all over her face she doesnt care she simply 
               brushes them aside  shes in love

               everythings ready she sits back and waits

               sexual calisthenics she lies flat on her back sticks her 
               legs in the air and stretches them wide apart a few times

               just as the gang is about to leave the house a loud rumble 
               along with a violent wind all the doors and windows lock

               everyone desperately tries to open a door or break a window

                                     cindy

                                                                    cut to

               int basement stairs  moments later

               dwight leads everyone to the basement door he opens it a 
               long flight of concrete steps

                                     dwight

               by now the group is so used to dwight going down steps 
               they simply give him a push

               dwight goes tumbling down the hard steps the gang running 
               behind him

               dwight lands hard at the bottom of the steps the group 
               tramples him as they rush by

                                     dwight
                              heroic

               everyone assembled inside dwight finally catching up his 
               wheels slightly bent and his glasses a mangled mess

                                     dwight

               dwight rolls over to a complex machine with a circle marked 
               on the floor in front of it

                                     dwight
                         ghosts are just energy fields we 
                         can capture that energy we can 
                         dissipate it but in order to do 
                         that weve got to get him in here  
                         on that spot

                         force out there ready to render us 
                         helpless tear on our flesh and 
                         penetrate our bodies

                                     brenda
                         hes so brave

               dwight rolls over to a supply cabinet opens it and starts 
               to hand out equipment

               dwight is arming the teenagers giving them each a strange 
               looking gun

                                     dwight
                         these are highly experimental guns 
                         that emit a bolt of concentrated 
                         energy able to damage ectoplasmic 
                         cells giving it the ability to injure 
                         or even destroy a ghost there is no 
                         ammunition you only get three shots 
                         a piece so use it very wisely

               goofing with his gun shorty fires it at brendas butt 
               burning it

                                     brenda
                         hey

               shorty laughs

                                     dwight
                         conserve your ammunition

                                     shorty
                         sorry right right

               shorty is startled by a cockroach and shoots it

                                     dwight
                         the only way were going to track 
                         down these ghosts is if were all 
                         wearing one of these

               dwight pulls out a dick pump they all look at him crossed 
               dwight realizes what hes holding in his hand

                                     buddy
                         a dick pump

                                     dwight
                         i mean these

               dwight holds up a pair of goggles

                                     dwight
                         these are thermogoggles

               the kids are putting on their goggles trying them out

                                     dwight
                         these can be used to track the ghosts 
                         these goggles work on the principle 
                         of body heat theyre so powerful 
                         theyll even show where body fluids 
                         of any kind have been recently even 
                         if it been wiped clean

               the kids look at each other and notice dwight has goo in his 
               face

                                     dwight
                         he may be invisible but we have the 
                         advantage of being armed with the 
                         most innovative and complex high
                         tech equipment known to man

                                     brenda
                         how are we gonna stay in touch with 
                         one another do we have walkietalkies 
                         or something

                                     dwight
                         no we have these

               dwight brings out several sets of two papercups with a string 
               attaching the two the string is only about 1015 feet long

                                     dwight
                         all the money was spent on the guns 
                         and the goggles

               he hands them out

                                     dwight
                         lets get that bastard

               alex points her gun at the group

                                     alex
                         no i wont let you do it

               alex runs out of the lab cindy tries to stop her theo steps 
               in the way

               grabs brenda by the arm brenda makes a face as if shes not 
               very impressed

               with the skeleton still gripping her arm brenda raises her 
               arm effortlessly lifting the skeleton off the ground it 
               hangs there looking worried and looking down at its feet 
               dangling

                                     brenda

               moves like shes going to jump at it the skeleton cowers

               as the skeleton tries to run brenda plucks off its head

               skeletons spine destabilizing the body like a house of 
               cards all of the bones crash down into a heap

                              lost in thought

               cindy turns around and does a slow motion imitation of an 
               astronaut

               cindy gets an idea she runs in the freezer and grabs several 
               bags of blood

               suddenly she hears a noise

               cindy stops and looks around she sees nothing

               cindy begins to open bags of blood and pours them on the 
               floor she empties out all of the blood

               suddenly the phone rings she answers

               she sees nothing behind her she hears a noise

               she turns and is slapped hard in the face by the ghost

               she raises her gun but the ghost is too quick he smacks it 
               from her hand

               new angle

               the ghost smacks cindy sending her flying into the freezer

               cindy falls hard hitting her head and dazing her for a 
               brief moment

               buddy attacks the ghost

               the ghost is strong and easily punches buddy around

               buddy is thrown into the freezer hes hurt

               cindy gets up and rushes to help buddy

               int freezer  continuous

               close on

               the temperature gauge is broken the temperature begins to 
               drop

               cindy rushes to the door through the window she sees the 
               ghost leave

                                     buddy

               cindy holds up her cup and talks into it

                                     cindy

               int upstairs hallway  night

               dwight is looking for the ghost dwight sees the ghost through 
               his goggles the ghost is playing hideandseek with dwight

                                     dwight
                              angry
                         come on you coward show yourself  
                         fight me like a man

               suddenly dwights wheelchair is rammed by another wheelchair 
               driven by the ghost

               dwight takes off the ghost follows

               dwight and the ghost zigzag down the hallway bumping and 
               cutting each other off

               slowmotion shot

               the wheels of the two chairs lock together sending them into 
               a 360 degree spin

               dwight his hair is flowing

               matching shot of the ghost

               the chair crashes into the banister it breaks the back of 
               dwights charm which dangerously hangs over the edge

               dwight gains control as the ghost chair approaches dwight 
               speeds towards the ghost

               just before the chairs pass each other dwight leaps out and 
               hangs on the side firing his gun at the ghost

               the ghost ducks and the shot misses him

               dwight is dragged painfully through the hallway smashing 
               into open doors statues cupboards finally dwight leaps 
               back into the chair

               not a moment to soon the ghost chair whips in front of 
               dwight

               dwight thinks fast he uses a broken table as a ramp he 
               catches some good air

               dwight lands slams on the brakes sending his chair tipping 
               forward dwight shows his skills by spinning his chair as it 
               balances on the front wheels

               dwight and the ghost chair now are at opposite ends of the 
               hall

               the scene plays very dramatic and in slowmotion dwight in 
               his wheelchair at one end of the hall and the ghost in his 
               wheelchair at the other end white doves begin to flutter 
               through the hallway ala a john woo movie

               one of the doves flies by in slow motion it plops right on 
               his face

               the tires of dwights wheelchair begin spinning and squealing 
               burning rubber and causing smoke to come from the tire

               the ghosts wheelchair tires burn rubber and starts barreling 
               toward dwight at full wheelchair speed dwight starts 
               rolling with all his might toward the ghost in his wheelchair 
               coming towards each other like the motorcycle scene in mi2

               angle on

               the ghosts wheelchair

               it speeds towards dwight

               angle on

               dwight in his wheelchair

               he speeds toward the ghost in his chair dwight is going so 
               fast that his hair is blowing back and bugs start splattering 
               up against his face and sunglasses

               like two speeding trains dwight and the ghost are headed 
               right towards one another

               angle on

               dwights wheelchair

               one of his tires blows out we see that it reads firestone

               dwight still races towards the ghost right when they are 
               about to collide head on dwight leaps up out of his 
               wheelchair and the ghost leaps out of his wheelchair

               the two wheelchairs impact and explode

               dwight goes to grab the ghost but he goes right through it 
               and goes crashing out of the window at the end of the hallway

                                     dwight
                         noooo

               ext hell house  night

               dwight dangling from a statue on the house exterior hes 
               slipping losing his grip

               suddenly in the window above appears hanson he extends 
               his little arm out to dwight

                                     hanson

               dwight cant bring himself to touch the little hand he looks 
               at the ground below its sure death if he falls

               hanson reaches further we see his fingers as they touch 
               dwights hand

                                     dwight
                         ahhhh

               cindy makes ready to start rubbing buddys dick buddy leans 
               back getting ready to enjoy it he puts his arms around his 
               head but then realizes that this whole thing depends on 
               cindy believing that he cant move his arms so he quickly 
               puts them back where they were before cindy realizes what 
               hes done

               cindy is still rubbing buddys crotch

                                     buddy

               buddy explodes

               cindy eyes wide as she looks down she jumps back just as 
               the goo flies towards her

               close on

               the goo it freezes in midair

               cindy knows theres no more time to waste

               she desperately scrambles for a way out she tries the door 
               but its bolted shut she looks over to see some loose nuts 
               and bolts a wire and a defibrillator she goes to work 
               piecing something together macgyverstyle

               quick cuts of her snapping a wire loose

               she magnetizes the nuts and bolts

               she turns on the defibrillator

               we pull back to reveal cindy has built with the loose scraps 
               a cat bulldozer

               cindy helps buddy out of the freezer

               int kitchen  later

               music the same gentle piano music as in hannibal

               cindy walks into the kitchen and sees shorty seated at he 
               table strapped to a chair hanson is nearby grilling 
               something on a portable grill and conversing amiably with 
               shorty

               alarmed cindy grabs a snow globe

               angle on snow globe

               cindy hides the snow globe behind her back

                                     hanson
                         ah cindy sit down dear dinners 
                         almost ready

               cindy manages a smile and nears the table

                                     hanson
                         oh and the little weapon youre 
                         hiding put it on the table

               caught cindy sheepishly places the snow globe on the table 
               and moves to sit

                                     hanson
                         come now give it up

               cindy pulls a heavy little statuette from under her shirt 
               and clunks it down next to the snow globe

               hanson shakes his head no and gestures for her to come clean 
               with what else she has

               cindy keeps pulling out more weaponry tossing it on the 
               table a beartrap a crowbar a medieval battle axe a 
               crossbow case of dynamite and a star wars lightsaber which 
               she turns on and tosses onto the pile

               cindy sits hanson goes back to his cooking

                                     cindy
                              whispering
                         shorty are you alright speak to 
                         me

               shorty is slumped and dazed drooling on himself cindy 
               notices some hypodermic needles chloroform and a rag

                                     cindy

                         thats his stuff

               with growing alarm cindy notices a cookbook on the table 
               martha stewarts easy brain recipes featuring a picture 
               of a pleasantly smiling martha stewart on the cover her 
               mouth and chin soaked in blood and gore clutching a chewed 
               brain in her hand

                                     hanson

                         pussy  just ask jesse jackson

               hanson puts down his spatula and steps to shorty

                                     hanson
                         alright everyone ready for the main 
                         course

               hanson pulls off shortys sweatband and take a can opener to 
               shortys head running it all the way around the crown as 
               cindy looks on in horror

               cindy gasps as hanson lifts off the top of shortys head 
               revealing his brain its a sad sight small and 
               underdeveloped its surrounded by smoke corroded and half 
               smoked away theres a small bandaid on it

               hanson puts the top of shortys skull on his own head hair 
               and all

                                     hanson
                              a la shorty gesturing 
                              with a little hand

                         dog you look hot

               hanson grabs a knife and goes to carve the brain

                                     cindy
                         hanson please

                                     hanson
                         dont worry cindy the brain itself 
                         feels no pain

               hanson cuts into it the brain screams in fright and shrinks 
               away from the knife compressing itself into a corner of 
               shortys skull

               hanson stabs over and over the brain gracefully avoiding 
               being cut moving from corner to corner of the skull it 
               trembles

               hanson watches and aims carefully finally sticking the knife 
               into the brain

                                     hanson
                         its such a fascinating organ

               hanson points out a section

                                     hanson
                         this part here controls intelligence 
                         watch what happens when i touch it

               hanson touches it

                                     shorty
                              suddenly smart with 
                              a british accent
                         salutations offspring the fecal 
                         matter is infirm by the by i do 
                         not wish to monopolize the 
                         conversation but i believe ive 
                         just figured out the cure for cancer 
                         its really quite simple 

               hanson takes his finger off the brain and points out another 
               section

                                     hanson
                         and this part controls a persons 
                         manners

               shorty starts to belch and fart uncontrollably wetting his 
               pants

                                     cindy
                         stop touching his brain

                                     hanson
                         um im not touching anything

                                     shorty

                                     hanson

                                     shorty
                         me grace okay  dear god 

               just as shorty bows his head the little brain plops out 
               onto the table hanson picks it up and puts it back in

                                     shorty
                         amen

               hanson now carves a little section of the brain

                                     hanson
                         this part removes the sense of humor

                                     shorty
                         i am tom green i am tom green
