               casey is stupefied

                                     casey

                         but poor steve im afraid hes 
                         out

               this implication sends casey running to the kitchen to 
               the glass doors she flips on the porch lights to see

               steve

               eyes wide sitting in the lawn chair his belly gaping 
               open a mass of blood and ripped flesh his insides lay 
               on the ground between his feet steam rising

               a scream erupts from the bottom of her soul as casey collapse 
               on the floor nearly passing out close on her face 
               pale and ghostly white she sobs

                                     man
                         final question are you ready

               she doesnt answer a long maddening silence casey reaches 
               up and clicks off the light making steve go away wishing 
               hoping

                                     casey
                         leave me alone please

                                     man
                         answer the question and i will

               casey is curled up on the floor like an infant rocking slowly 
               back and forth

                                     man
                         what door am i at

                                     casey
                         what

                                     man
                         there are two doors to your house a 
                         front door and a back one if you 
                         answer correctly  you live

               from where casey sits she can see both front and back doors  
               she deliberates with her last bit of strength she tries 
               to strategize eyeing both the front door the back door 
               trying to decide between the two

                                     casey
                         dont make me i cant i wont

                                     man
                         your call

               in the darkness casey crawls to the kitchen counter  she 
               leans up and grabs a long sharp knife

               casey looks around her she looks down the hall to the 
               front door then turns back to the kitchen glass door as 
               it suddenly

               shatters to bits

               as a lawn chair come flying through it exploding glass sprays 
               everywhere

               this incites casey like fire she springs to her feet 
               bolting out of the kitchen as a shadow moves quickly through 
               the shattered doorframe

               angle on casey

               somewhere in the house back flat against a window listening 
               to feet on cracking glass she turns and unlocks the latch 
               quietly sliding it up she can hear him move through the 
               foyer to the front door

               casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window 
               she holds the knife in one hand the phone in the other

               casey eases out the window fumbling dropping the knife 
               back in the house she starts to reach for it fuck it she 
               takes off

               ext side of house

               casey it at the back corner of the house

                                     man
                         i can hear you i know youre here

               casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the 
               side of the house going for the front yard she must pass 
               the three curtainless windows she gets to the first one and 
               peeks in

               the figure has pulled open the foyer closet searching for 
               her

               casey creeps along to the next window she looks in the 
               figure is completely on the other side of the room moving 
               toward the hall that leads to other parts of the house

               she moves further along the house squeezing by hedges 
               to the third window she peeks in to the figure

               staring back at her

               his face covered with a ghostly white mask inches from her 
               his eyes piercing through soulless casey screams bloody 
               murder as a hand

               crashes through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck 
               she beats at him trying to free herself her nails dig 
               into his arm she wrenches from side to side finally 
               breaking free as the hands disappear inside the house

               ext corner of house

               casey sails around the corner of the house eyeing the front 
               door it remains closed her eyes cover the sprawling country 
               yard when suddenly

               chains and bolts the door when

               a figure comes leaping out of the hall closet

               rushing her ramming into her side the phone flies the 
               figure is on top of her as she goes down screaming

               she looks up to see the figure darkly dressed with a pale 
               distorted face white and ghostly a mask

               her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making 
               the contact with his leg he topples over coming right 
               at her his hand finding her neck suddenly along silver 
               blade appears above her

               sidney pulls jerks twists finally she lifts her torso 
               forward knocking the figure off her sending him reeling 
               into the living room wasting no time sidney leaps to her 
               feet

               she moves to the front door unlocks it pulls it open 
               it catches on the chain shit she pushes it closed again 
               looking behind her the figure has risen knife in hand 
               sidney pulls on the chain and then  inexplicably turns 
               and

               runs up the stairs the figure right behind her

               int upstairs landing

               the figure leaps at sidney taking hold of her foot she grabs 
               madly at the wall her hands grasp a framed painting  a 
               quiet country home subdued colors done in oils  she rips 
               it from the wall swinging it behind her

               it catches the figure head on smashing against his skull 
               sending him backwards tumbling down the stairs sidney races 
               to her bedroom

               int bedroom

               she locks the door shut the pulls her closet door open 
               placing the edge right at the door knob just as

               the figure pounds against the bedroom door

               ramming it it rips open but the closet door catches it in 
               a crazy vicelike hold

               sidney grabs the desk phone its dead off the hook 
               downstairs

               the figure rushes the door several times the frame 
               splinters but wont give

               sidney is at her computer she punches at the keypad madly

                         anybody he could be here at school 
                         right now

               they move up the walk as a figure falls in step behind them 
               sporting a white ghost mask

                                     tatum
                         serial killers are smart by 
                         definition

               they minimize their risk they plan and precalculate 
               everything showing up here would be the most lamebrain 
               move he could make

               they move up the front steps toward the main doors of the 
               school as the ghost masked figure reappears standing at 
               the top of the steps sidney sees it first stopping dead 
               in her tracks

               she steps back spinning around to find

               a ghost face behind her as well both of them approaching 
               closing in on her sidney starts to scream when the two ghosts 
               bust up laughing tearing off across campus

               ext street

               in front of the school we catch up a reporter doing a live 
               remote he holds a mask in his hand

                         officials have yet to comment but 
                         this is the same type of mask worn 
                         by the killer

               just before the bell the hallway is congested with students 
               heading to class tatum is at her locker with sidney

               sidney starts to walk away but turns back angry

                                     sidney
                         im glad to know youre coping so 
                         well with life billy but some of 
                         us arent so perfect some of us are 
                         just trying to hold on

               sidney disappears through a door marked girls bathroom 
               leaving billy alone in the hallway he smacks his forehead 
               pissed at himself

               int girls bathroom

               large and spacious closed bathroom stalls line one wall 
               facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror sidney enters as 
               two girls tinkle and talk  each from their respective 
               stalls

                                     girl 1
                         she was never attacked i think she 
                         made it all up

                                     girl 2
                         why would she lie about it

                                     girl 1
                         for attention the girl has some 
                         serious issues

               sidney listens intently

               a toilet flushes sidney quickly jumps in a stall hiding 
               just as girl 1 appears from a stall she looks like that 
               voice  a snotty little twit

                                     girl 1
                         what if she did it what if sidney 
                         killed casey and steve

                                     girl 2
                         and why would she do that

                                     girl 1
                         maybe she was hot for steve and killed 
                         them both in a jealous rage

               another toilet flushes

                                     girl 2
                         why would sidney want to be with 
                         steve she has her own bubblebutt 
                         boyfriend billy

                                     girl 1
                         maybe shes a slut just like her 
                         mom

               inside the stall sidney listens her face weakening

                                     girl 2
                         youre evil

                                     girl 1
                         please its common knowledge her 
                         mother was a trollop

               girl 2 appears from her stall  another twit they both 
               stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces

                                     girl 2
                         cut some slack she watched her mom 
                         get butchered

                                     girl 1
                         and it fucked her up royally think 
                         about it it makes perfect sense 
                         her moms death leaves her distraught 
                         and hostile at a cruel and inhumane 
                         world shes disillusioned wheres 
                         god etc completely suicidal and 
                         one day she snaps she wants to kill 
                         herself but realizes teen suicide is 
                         out this year and homicide is a 
                         much healthier therapeutic expression

               from the stall sidney listens her heart pounding jaw 
               quivering

                                     girl 2
                         where do you get this shit

                                     girl 1
                         ricki lake

               the two girls exit sidney moves out of the stall catching 
               her reflection in the mirror

                                     sidney
                         pathetic

               water drips somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind whistles in 
               from the cracked transom above the bathroom door it sound 
               almost like a whisper siddneey

               sidney spins around what the she checks out the bathroom 
               the doors to the stalls are all closed she bends down and 
               scans beneath them looking for feet no one nothing

               sidney turns back to the mirror suddenly

                                     man
                              oc whisper
                         siddneey

               unmistakable this time the voice strikes sidney like a nail 
               through the eye it comes from one of the stalls she stands 
               thunderstruck eyeing the stalls thru the mirror

                                     sidney
                         is someone there

               a long morose silence and then

                                     man
                              softly simply
                         its me sidney

               sidney spins around fuck no hes here terror floods her 
               face she eyes the exit door then the row of stalls she 
               must pass to get to it

               she checks under the stalls again nothing where the fuck 
               is he she takes a step forward when

               two feet step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last 
               stall sidneys face draws tight as the stall door begins to 
               creak open she bolts forward making a break for it but 
               slips on the wet floor her feet flying out from under

               sidney reaches out grabs hold of a sink saves herself 
               from falling she glimpses a ghost mask in the mirror coming 
               for her a hand grabs her shoulder as she slams her body 
               through the exit door narrowly escaping

               int corridor  continuous

               sidney flies out of the bathroom door screaming burning 
               up the hallway not looking back a teacher hearing her 
               scream peer out from an open doorway as sidney sprints 
               by him not stopping running madly

               int principals office  continuous

               close on a redfaced principal himbry as he reads someone 
               the riot act

                                     mr himbry
                         im sickened your whole havoc
                         inducing thieving whoring generation 
                         disgusts me

               the camera swings around to reveal two ghost masked students 
               standing at attention mr himbry rips the mask off of one 
               of the students heads

                                     mr himbry
                         two students have been savagely 
                         murdered and this is how we express 
                         our compassion and sensivity

               he rips the mask off the other student

                                     mr himbry
                         we throw on a mask and dance around 
                         campus just hoping someone else gets 
                         butchered before we get bored again 
                         youre both expelled

               the ghosts doth protest

                                     ghost 1
                         aw come on mr himbry it was just 
                         a joke

                         yeah thats not fair

               a deep rooted hostility has taken over mr himbrys face  
               neither student budges scared to even breathe

                                     mr himbry
                         no its not fair fairness would be 
                         to rip your insides out and hang you 
                         from a tree so you can be exposed 
                         for the desensitized heartless little 
                         shits that you are

               suddenly the door bursts open and sidney appears hysterical

                                     sidney
                              crying

               mr himbry rushes to her arms outstretched

                                     mr himbry
                         easy child

               he pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door 
               he tries the mask on pulling it over his face looking in 
               the mirror when

               a knock at the door stops him he rips the mask off his head 
               turns to his office door and opens it to reveal

               turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted he 
               looks up and down the hall only a janitor is seen in the

               suddenly he cant remember he shifts uneasy reaching for 
               the door knob pulling the door open to reveal

               an empty closet he stands still a moment suddenly realizing 
               someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet 
               door nervously he pushes it shut to reveal

               nothing himbry shakes away his jitters realizing hes 
               spooked himself he continues to his desk pushing his office 
               door shut when

               a ghost masked figure lunges from behind it knife in hand 
               quick and easy three quick jabs to the stomach and himbry 
               goes down the ghost masked figure towering above him

               bowl then pulls open the refrigerator looks quickly 
               then remembers

               she moves through the adjoining laundry room to the

               int garage

               the kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage  
               tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch

               she finds a button and hits it brrrrmmm the electric garage 
               door starts to rise wrong switch she hits it again and it 
               closes

               she finds another switch click a small lightbulb overhead 
               comes on barely lighting the large two car garage leaving 
               pockets of shadows along the wall

               tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads 
               for it not seeing the kitchen door quietly slowly closing 
               behind her sealing her off from the rest of the house

               tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open its 
               light casts a glow across her face

               crashboom

               tatum jumps spinning around just in time to see a cat escape 
               through a large pet door thats built into the garage door  
               she smiles at her jumpiness

               tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and 
               heads back to the kitchen

               at the kitchen door she juggles the beer reaching for the 
               knob its locked

                                     tatum

               button brrrmm it begins to rise

               she moves towards the rising door beer in hand suddenly 
               crrbrrrm the garage door resets reversing direction moving 
               down closing

                                     tatum

               on the switch tatum at once gasps taken back but then

                         oh you wanna play psycho killer

                                     tatum
                         can i be the helpless victim

               the figure slowly nods again

                                     tatum
                         okay lets see no please dont 
                         kill me mr ghostface i want to be 
                         in the sequel

               tatum takes a step to move around the figure but he steps 
               too blocking her

                                     tatum
                         cut casper thats a wrap

               tatum moves again sidestepping the figure but hes faster 
               and cuts her off

               tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and 
               with the other pushes the figure hard knocking him aside

                                     tatum
                         randy  will you stop

               but as the figure intercepts lunging forward grabbing her 
               wrist hard tatum stumbles beer cans hit the floor 
               spewing

                                     tatum
                         you little shit

               tatum yanks hard releasing his hold when a flash of silver 
               catches her eye she looks down glimpsing a long sharp blade 
               as it darts forward cutting into her forearm

               tatum pulls back horrified as the moment turns deadly 
               serious

               the figure advances on her  knife out ready she staggers 
               backwards holding her bloody arm backing into the 
               refrigerator screaming

                                     tatum
                         who are you

               the figure lashes out with the knife tatum dodges it leaping 
               back against the fridge the figure advances instinctively 
               she rips the top freezer door open bashing the figure in 
               the face sending him backwards reeling

               tatum bolts to the closed garage door in a panic she 
               beats and pulls on it trying to make it lift she eyes the 
               figure hes recovering

               she goes for the pet door dropping to the floor diving for 
               it she wedges her upper body through her head shoulders 
               torso just as the

               figure pounces grabbing hold of her feet tatum goes crazy 
               screaming and kicking trying to get through

               ext garage door

               tatum is half inhalf out of the pet door she beats and 
               jerks wildly unable to see the figure on the other side

               a true fighter tatum kicks hard making direct contact with 
               the figure knocking him away

               she takes the moment to pull herself through further but 
               she stops stuck she pulls and tugs but cant move she 
               listens but hears nothing where did he go an agonizing 
               silence and then

               crrbrrrm the garage door is activated it begins to rise 
               upward taking tatum with it she screams madly

                                     tatum
                         noooooooo

               tatums arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to 
               free herself from the door but it moves too fast carrying 
               her up

               she looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage 
               rafters just as her neck hits the first beam snapping 
               instantly

               int foyer  minutes later

                         what do i have to do to prove to you 
                         im not a killer

               he makes a move toward her when from behind in a split 
               instant from the open balcony doors comes

               the ghost figure

               sidney sees the figure immediately screaming billy tries 
               to calm her oblivious to the advancing ghost

                                     sidney
                         billywatchout

               billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the 
               air it strikes down with force hitting his chest as blood 
               sprays the air

               on sidney as red crimson splatters across her face as the 
               knife is thrust in and out of billy who tries hard to put up 
               a fight but its useless he never had a chance his 
               body falls to the floor lifeless

               angle on ghost

               as he watches billys body come to a still before quietly 
               calmly turning his attention to

               sidney who stands numb scared to death and only when 
               the ghost takes a step forward does sidney break she takes 
               off like a rocket leaping over the bed and out the door

               int hallway  continuous

               sidney tears out the door and down the hall coated in billys 
               blood

               angle on the ghost

               as he catches up with her grabbing hold of her collar she 
               pulls away from him her shirt ripping down the back

               her hands find a door knob and she goes for it pulling the 
               door open moving quickly inside locking it behind her

               int dark space  continuous

               total darkness sidneys hands scour the wall for a light 
               switch the doorknob turns the lock holds as the door 
               is nearly shaken from its hinges and then

               nothing all goes silent only sidneys rapid breathing fills 
               the space around her

               sidney trembling shaking reaches above her feeling until 
               she finds a string she pulls it as a lightbulb switches 
               on overhead

               shes in a small box of a room the door is on one side a 
               small narrow staircase on the other she eyes the doorknob 
               then the staircase contemplating but its an easy 
               decision theres no fucking way shes going up to the attic

               she unlocks the door and pushes on it but it wont give 
               she pushes on it again its locked from the other side 
               shit she turns to the staircase

               dewey blushes he starts to say something when headlights 
               appear behind them they both spin as two cars loaded with 
               kids come racing right at them

               dewey grabs gale and pushes her off the road just as the 
               cars speed by oblivious to them

               in the ditch

               gale lands face up with dewey right on top of her he steals 
               a glance in her eyes before rolling off her

                                     dewey

               the window she climbs to the top holding onto the window 
               frame

               she spots gale almost immediately she screams out looking 
               for the window latch but theres not one it doesnt open 
               sidney starts beating on it trying to break it

               gale hanging tough approaches the front door unable to 
               hear sidneys screams three floors up gale reaches for the 
               door just as she hears loud horrible shrieks from just 
               inside she backs away

               int living room  continuous

               an earcurdling jamie lee curtis scream blasts through the 
               empty living room as the horror movie on tv comes to its 
               horrifying climax

               randy is now gone

               ext front yard  continuous

               gale races across the yard putting distance between her and 
               the house she moves back to the van

               int attic  continuous

               sidney has found an old tennis racket she swings a solid 
               forehand at the window

               the window sprays glass

               sidney moves quickly lifting herself up over broken glass 
               and pulling herself through the window frame

               ext side of the house

               sidney wastes no time she looks for gale screaming but 
               gale is gone

               sid lowers herself down the ledge sliding down a sloped 
               portion of the roof onto

               the masters bedroom balcony

               then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself 
               letting herself hang as low as she can then she lets go 
               freefalling the rest of the way but in a split instant

               the ghost appears

               grabbing her wrists in midair

               her body hangs dangling against the side of the house the 
               ghost begins to lift her pulling her back onto the balcony

               sidney jerks pulls twists but the hands have her 
               hoisting her up sidney screams madly yanking one last 
               time freeing herself

               she drops to the ground a good seven feet landing on her 
               back hitting hard she grabs at a pained leg and brings 
               herself upright

               int newsvan  continuous

               gale is frantic she starts the engine up and hits the 
               headlights when she discovers she cant see out of the 
               windshield

               gale rubs at the glass sure enough something is on the 
               windshield outside blocking her sight gale hits the wipers 
               as blood smears across the glass it drips down from above

               gale screams as a hand reaches in through the open window 
               she looks up to see

               randy staring at her madly

                                     randy
                         whats going on

               a sheer moment of fear as gale hits the gas plummeting the 
               car forward into a ditch she hits the brakes randy is 
               thrown forward away from the van

               gale reverses backs up hits the brakes again just as 
               kennys face comes sliding down the outside of the 
               windshield eyes wide face distorted blood everywhere

               gale hits the gas and yanks the wheel sending kennys corpse 
               flying off the top of the van

               gale spins the van around onto the road hits the gas madly 
               gaining speed just as

               sidney appears

               in the middle of the road drenched in blood very much 
               resembling a young sissy spacek

               gale swerves to miss her but she turns too sharp and the 
               van veers off the road at top speed flipping over on its 
               side sliding off into the thick foliage

               ext road  continuous

               sidney races to where the van lay on its side sidney peers 
               through the windshield gales body lay limp and bloody

               sidney cries out turning limping to the driveway she sees 
               the patrol jeep with its open door she goes for it

               int jeep

               sidney hops in reaches for the ignition no keys shit 
               just then sidneys eyes go to the front porch she watches 
               as the front door opens and a figure appears in the darkness 
               undetectable

               sidney throws the headlights illuminating the front side 
               of the house revealing

               dewey standing in the doorway

                                     sidney
                         dewey

               sidney opens the jeep door moving to him noticing his body 
               slumped knees buckled

               and then his body falls forward slowly deliberately hitting 
               the porch hard standing behind him is

               the ghost

               sidney screams from the bottom of her soul

                                     sidney
                         noooooooo

               sid jumps back inside the jeep closing the door locking 
               it she reaches over and locks the passengers door and then 
               she waits

               and watches as the ghost leans over deweys still body 
               fumbling with something then the figure stands upright in 
               his hands he holds

               the keys

               they jingle in the wind the ghost toying with her enjoying 
               this

               sidney hysterical locks eyes with the figure as he moves 
               to the door sidney leaps on it holding the lock button 
               down making it impossible to unlock her face is pressed 
               against the glass inches from the masked figure

               she uses every ounce of strength when suddenly the ghost 
               disappears dropping down below the window out of her view

               sidney moves to the center of the jeep trying hard to listen 
               over her own rapid breathing every sound amplified

               then she hears it the soft jingling of keys near the 
               passengers side door she pounces on the lock holding it 
               down

               a shadow cuts the beam of the headlights unseen by sidney 
               the lock turns on the other side sidney leaps over and holds 
               it down securing it this is beyond nerveracking sidney

               sidney with surprising strength spins around and attacks 
               the ghost

               she falls back against the dash legs out kicking wildly at

               slowly a small smile creeps across billys face

                         we all go a little mad sometimes

               randy squints confused as billy aims the gun at randy and 
               pulls the trigger the blast throws randys body against the 
               wall before sliding to a heap on the floor still

               fuck no this cant be happening billys eyes are on 
               her unmoving

               he sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to 
               his face tasting it

                                     billy

                         pigs blood in carrie

               sidney is dumbfounded slowly she takes a step back moving 
               into the dark refines of the kitchen

               billy lurches forward in a fakeout baiting her she takes 
               another step back  petrified

               close on billys face it is no longer familiar to sidney 
               there is something inhuman now about his features his 
               expression is pure evil

               she takes another step back shrinking into the dark kitchen

               the camera takes a moment to adjust to the darkness as the 
               outline of a figure appears

               standing right behind sidney

               she continues to back up moving right into the arms of

               stu stares back at her eyes wide lips curled in a subtle 
               smile as he holds a small compact cellular phone up to his 
               face

               it becomes all too clear

               she stands between them her mind racing calculating

               she bolts into the living room

               if for no other reason than to put space between her and 
               them they stand in the entryway trapping her in

               billy starts ripping the room up overturning furniture in a 
               mad fit of rage when he notices the hall closet touche  
               he smiles deliriously heading for it ripping it open as

               a ghost masked figure strikes from within with an umbrella 
               the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out billy 
               stumbles back stunned as the ghost comes at him again 
               the umbrella lodges in his chest and he goes down

               sidney rips the ghost mask off her head she looks at billy 
               disgusted throwing the mask on billys now still body a 
               movement behind her sends her reeling around to find

               alive barely he looks to sidney through pain

                                     randy

               randy manages to stand when a figure comes leaping at him 
               completely unexpected its stu barreling into him 
               they fall back into the living room sidney grabs the gun 
               next to billy and turns to the living room to find

               randy and stu rolling across the floor in a head lock 
               fighting both seriously injured sid tries to find aim 
               when a

               hand grabs hold of sidneys ankle toppling her to the 
               floor once again she finds billy on top of her

               in the living room

               randy and stu pound at each other beating and clawing

               on sidney as she fights viciously attacking with everything 
               shes got

               randy is desperately trying to pry away from stu he grabs 
               hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the 
               floor out of stus clutch

               his hands find the top of the tv the vcr he yanks on 
               it gripping it with his hands bringing it around with force 
               crashing the vcr into stus head stu drops

               he cries out bloody murder her other hand brings the gun up 
               to his face but he head buts it out the front door 
               suddenly a flash of silver appears above sidney

               billy has grasped the butcher knife he rises it high above 
               sidney ready to strike when a bullet rips through the 
               foyer striking billy knocking him back into the living room

               sidney looks up to see

               gale weathers holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises 
               above the guns chamber

               sidney sits up as gale moves to her helping her their eyes 
               meet a life truce

                         careful this is the moment when you 
                         think the killers dead but then he 
                         springs back to life for one last 
                         scare

               sidney grabs the gun from gale

                                     sidney

                         this is for my mom asshole

               she shoots him in the forehead a clean and perfect shot 
               the she aims the barrel at billy whos eyes suddenly open 
               blinking up at her blood bubbling from his lips hes not 
               yet dead their eyes lock

                                     sidney

               sidney drops the smoking gun standing silent over the bodies  
               a quiet moment when suddenly

               figure lunges at them

               both sid and gale and randy scream in epic final scare 
               proportions as mr prescott leaps forward still bound and 
               gagged

               sid catches her breath relaxing

                                     sidney
                         oh daddy

               she rushes to him untying him while gale moves to the 
               bookcase and retrieves the hidden camera

                                     gale

                                     randy
                         this is probably an inappropriate 
                         moment but you think youd want to 
                         maybe go out with me sometime 
                         like on a date

               sidney looks at him dumbfounded

                                     randy
                         maybe catch a movie

               a long moment as sidneys face goes from disbelief to 
               resignation to the slight trace of a smile

                                     sidney
                         only if its a nice meg ryan movie

               he smiles at her watching as sidney grabs hold of her 
               father holding him tight as gale weathers with camera in 
               hand gets one hell of an ending to this scary movie

                                         the end
