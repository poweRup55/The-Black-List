int classroom  same 
sidney takes a seat at the back of the room a handful of film students 
sit around on torn 
couches heavy in discussion sid goes unnoticed as she watches a 
whirlwind debate 
a snotty guy is pontificating a point 

snotty guy 
sequels are too handicapped by definition alone theyre inferior 
films 

hallie sits on a couch next to mickey 20s atheletic cool and rowdy 
arms enwrapped 

mickey 
bullshit generalization many sequels have surpassed their original 

snotty guy 
name one 

mickey 
aliens far better than the original 

another guy 
subjective 

some girl 
lifes subjective i much prefer ridley scott 

the conversation overlaps everyone arguingmaking their point about 
aliens vs alien 

hallie 
no way aliens rocked stay away from heryou bitch 

snotty guy 
ill give you that one name another 

mickey 
t2 

some girl

snotty guy 
a bigger budget does not make a better movie terminator one is 
historical

type speaks up 

artsy teacher

snotty guy 
sequels suck hello it becomes about money and no ones interested in 
quality

derek 
its more than that horror films are only as good as their villains 
how can freddie and jason possibly be scary after theyve been diluted 
through five or six 
sequels 

teacher 
whats the solution if you were making a sequel today what would you 
do differently 

the class stews on this derek turns spotting sidney in the back of 
the room she gives a 
half wave he starts for her excusing himself 

snotty guy 
the point is  i made my point sequels suck 

int corridor  same

on by threads 

sidney 
cotton there isnt one day one hour one minute when im not reminded 
of what ive done

spiritual plane can 
ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being and i wish i had in 
me what you need to

and with that cotton flips on a dime his face turns evil sidney

road 

she eyes the ghost through the rearview window the white masks turns 
as hidden eyes bore 
through her the ghost hits the gas picking up speed 

sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her she rips it open 
rustling through it 
frantically she pulls books pencils paper sid grabs a long 
yellow no2 pencil she 
grips it hard looking to the metal grate just behind the drivers 
seat the ghosts neck 
is right up against it 

sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the ghosts head 
ready to attack 

without pause sid rams the pencil through the grate into the ghosts 
neck it lodges 
there as the ghost falls forward in pain losing control of the wheel 
for a moment 

the car jumps the curb and slams against a building the ghost yanks 
the wheel over 
correcting he tries to bring it back to the road but doesnt see the 
lamp post that stands 
directly in the cars path 

the squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post slamming into 
it bringing the car 
to a crashing halt lodging it agaisnt the buildings stone exterior 
smoke rises from a 
bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling 

inside the car 
all is still in the backseat sidney rises from the floorboards she 
looks up to see the 
ghost masked figure slumped over the steering wheel out 

sid quickly pulls herself together looking about sizing up her 
options she tugs on the 
door handle it wont budge she looks to the passengers side of the 
car its flush 
against the building 

then she notices the metal grate the edge has been pried apart in the 
crash sidney reaches 
for it pulling on it bending it backwards 
creak

sid tries to stifle the noise it makes all the while eyeing the ghost 
who remains 
unconscious she creates an opening large enough for her to crawl 
through she lifts 
herself up and pulls herself through to the 
front seat 

sid falls down into the seat her eyes never leaving the ghost she lay 
crumpled up against 
the smashed passengers door the only sound is her own terrified 
breathing she watches the 
ghost masked figure his body doesnt move she contemplates her next 
move 

the only way out is through the drivers door 
after what seems an eternity she slowly reaches over with her foot and 
nudges the ghost 
no movement nothing she slides across the seat towards the ghost 
moving to his side 
she reaches with her hand and pushes on the ghosts shoulder his body 
moves slumping back 
against the back of the seat it clears space for her to pass through 
she sits up on her feet facing the ghost with her leg she reaches 
over him straddling him 
she leans against the steering wheel her arm quickly reaching for the 
door knob 
honk 

her back brushes against the horn sid tenses her face a little more 
than a foot from the 
ghost mask he doesnt move hes completely out cold sid pushes the 
car door open and starts 
to slide completely over the ghost when she stops 

she looks to the ghost close on her face as she fights with a 
decision then with a fierce 
determination sid reaches for the ghost mask she finds the edge and 
begins to peels the mask 
away when 

the ghost comes to life 

lunging forward sidney screams leaping falling out the car door 

outside the car 

bam 

sid hits the pavement hard she lifts herself up when her entire 
body is yanked violently backwards

the ghost has hold of her foot pulling her back into the car sidney 
kicks and writhes 
breaking free she hops to her feet as the ghost emerges from the car 
sidney slams the car 
door shut it catches the ghost knocking him backwards sid tears off 
down the street 
running burning up the pavement

her face in 
fearstricken close up 

on the upper level

the railing and makes 
his way around to the shining light

against the railing 
dewey surveys the second level empty seats everywhere completely 
bare 

dewey looks down to the main floorto gale who looks up to him

the railing on the 
monitor gale is in frame looking up at dewey her face fear stained 
she takes a step 
forward moving out of frame revealing 

the ghost 

who stands right behind her dewey looks down to see the ghost standing 
directly behind gale 

dewey contd 
watch out 

down below 
gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killers knife as it 
darts out of the 
darkness gale catapults just dodging it she moves like lightning up 
the aisle of seats 

up above 
dewey races for the stairs going as fast as his handicapped leg will 
allow 

down below

he eyes the exit door as it slowly closes he moves for it 

int corridor   same 
gale races down the hallway eyeing the nearest door she tears it 
open disappearing into 

int sound stage  same 
gale finds herself in the student studios she stands in a huge control 
booth that 
overlooks a dubbing stage lots of glass walls and doors it has a maze 
quality 

gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room darkness everywhere 
gale stops for a 
second listening as she main door creaks open and then footsteps are 
heard making their 
way towards her 

gale proceeds deeper into the studio she moves into a sound proof room 
and closes 
the door not seeing the 

ghost figure 

that stands behind her she turns around and screams she starts out 
but then realizes 
hes standing in the control booth shes protected by a clear large 
plexiglass window 
that wraps around the room the ghost moves out the side door heading 
her way he disappears 
out of view gale freaks she races to the door trying to secure it 
theres no lock 

at the main door 
dewey slips through quietly trying his best to be quick on his toes 
through the control 
booth window he immediately spots gale 

inside the dubbing room 
gale looks for objects to block the door with she drags a shelf of 
sound equipment towards 
the door 

outside the dubbing room 
dewey moves to the window 

dewey 
gale  gale 

she doesnt hear him the room is sound proof he beats against the 
glass still she doesnt 
turn to him 

inside the dubbing room 
gale shoves everything she can find against the door not seeing or 
hearing dewey as he 
pounds against the sound proof barrier behind her 

she also doesnt see the killer that appears behind dewey he moves on 
him swift and focused 

inside the dubbing stage 
gale cant take her eyes off the door her face is terrified if shed 
only turn around 
she would see dewey  his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled 
into him repeatedely 
with each thrust blood is splattered against the glass 

in the control booth 
dewey screams for his life caught completely off guard he falls 
forward onto the control 
panels suddenly microphone feedback tears through the studios as 
deweys cries are heard 
throughout the stage 

in the dubbing stage 
deweys death scream rips through the room 

gale turns to the window to see dewey his face smashed against it 
blood smeared across the 
glass she moves to the window her face only inches from his a moment 
as their eyes meet 
deweys life is near gone his eyes reveal it gale beats against the 
glass window 

galethrough tears

deweys body slides down out of view gale is mortified she looks to 
the killer who has 
already made his way through the control booth hes coming for her 
she races to the door 
throws the things away 

she manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through and 
shes off and running 

gale finds a door and plows through it stopping only long enough to 
lock it 

bam the ghost rams it from the other side but it holds gale surveys 
her surroundings 
shes in a storage room she eyes another door she moves through it 
and out into

sidney distracts the ghost she takes off the ghost following her she 
moves around the tree 
sprinting across the yard running smack into 

the ghost masked killer 

but sidney spins around as two ghosts appear on each side of her she 
stands thunderstruck as 
the two killers descend on her she dives between the two but they 
counter keeping her 
surrounded 

sid watches as one of the ghosts withdraws his knife she turns to the 
other 
his knife is already poised they close in on her ready to strike

himself in sids 
predicament he doesnt know where to run the two killers close in on 
him 
sidney gets to the corner of the house she stopsshe doesnt want to

mickey sandwiched in between the two ghosts theyre knives strike at 
the same time 
one through the stomach the other through the back they withdraw 
their knives 
mickeys body suspends momentarily hanging in the air then collapses 
to a heap on the ground

sid backs up moving racing toward the wings when another wall flies 
in sealing the backstage 
area off trapping her she looks in shock at

goes for it ripping it 
open to find

hand he lunges for 
debbie salt it strikes her lodging into her chest she goes back 
cotton doesnt stop 
he stabs her again and again she goes down dead

gale

gale gives him a hug close on cottons face

gale

he hugs her back she doesnt see as he rises the knife behind her 
bringing it down in 
one swift maniacal move gales body jerks a moment of shock and then 
she goes limp as 
the knife lodges in her back

sidney turns just in time to see cotton toss gales body down into the 
orchestra pit 
he turns facing sidney the bloody knife in hand

sidney
nooo

cotton moves to dereks body where the video camera lay he pulls the 
tape from it

cotton
its perfect sidney no one will ever suspect me i have proof im 
the victim

sidney
please cotton dont do this

he holds up the video cassette murder in his eye

cotton
i get my revenge and make some fast cash

sidney
its over cotton

cotton
not until youre dead

cotton lunges for her sid tears off slipping through the set door 
to

backstage
sid runs to the rear of the stage she moves in the narrow space that 
exists between the scrim 
and the back wail she races down it

she almost reaches the end when

cotton rips through the scrim

sidney ducks bypassing him she comes to the stage door its locked 
she turns seeing the 
metal ladder thats attached to the wall it leads to the catwalk 
above sid goes for it 
she climbs up the ladder with lightning speed

cotton up and running is close behind

int catwalk  same
the catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats and a large 
chandelier are stored in 
the air

sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the ending

and thats as far as ive gotten
what happens is sid and cotton fight to the finish he chases her 
through hanging flats 
then down the fly rail back to the stage sid gets finds a knife and 
stabs cotton

he stabs her back they fight continuing to stab each other until they 
both drop center stage 
they lay next to each other neither able to move their eyes slowly 
close

the end for now
