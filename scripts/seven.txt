	int  old house  day

	sunlight comes through the soot on the windows more brown than
	bright  somerset 45 stands in one corner of this small
	secondstory room  he looks over the ceiling looks down at the
	worn wooden floors looks at the peeling wallpaper

	he walks to the center of the room continues his study taking
	his time  he halts turns to one wall where the current
	wallpaper is torn away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath

	somerset goes to this wall and runs his finger across one of the
	pale red roses which decorates the older paper  he pushes the
	grime away brings the rose out more clearly

	he reaches into his suit pocket and takes out a switchblade  he
	flips the thin lethal blade free  working deliberately
	delicately somerset cuts a square around the rose then peels
	the square of dry wallpaper away from the wall  he studies it in
	his hand

	ext  old house  day

	somerset stands in front of the old home  he looks out at the
	surrounding farms and forests  he ponders something  birds
	sing

						    man os
			    is something wrong

	somerset does not respond just stares off  the man 34 wears a
	realestate brokers jacket and stands beside a for sale sign in
	the muddy lawn

						    man
			    is there something the matter

	somerset turns to face the man then looks back at the house

						    somerset
			    no  no its just that everything here
			    seems so strange

						    man
			    strange  theres nothing strange about
			    this place  the housell need a little
			    fixing up thats for sure

						    somerset
			    no  i like the house and this place

						    man
			    i was about to say  cause this place is
			    about as normal as places get

	somerset nods taking a deep breath  he smiles

						    somerset
			    thats what i mean  strange

	somerset looks back to the beautiful landscape  the man does not
	understand

	int  amtrack train  later day

	somerset is in the window seat looking out the window of the
	speeding train smoking a cigarette  he is near the back of the
	car away from the few other passengers

	outside farms fields small homes and lawns rush by  the
	panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon to be setting sun

	int  amtrack train  later day

	the train is almost full moving slower  somerset has his
	suitcase on the aisle seat beside him  he holds a hardcover book
	unopened on his lap  he still stares out the window but his
	face is tense  the train is passing an ugly swampy field  the
	sun has gone under

	though it seems impossible it ever could have gotten there a
	cars burntout skeleton sits rusting in the bracken

	ahead the city waits  the sky is full of smokestacks and huge
	industrial cranes

	int  amtrack train  later day

	the train is passing urban streets below  slums and smashed
	cars  people stand in groups in the corners  bleak

	somersets suitcase is now on the window seat  somerset has
	moved to the aisle  he is reading his book  he looks up from
	the book and rubs his eyes then looks back to continue reading
	not once looking out the window

	ext  city street  night

	somerset carries his suitcase outside the train station  the
	city demands attention cars screeching people yelling sirens
	blaring

	somerset passes a family of bewildered tourists  a weird man has
	a hand on the touristfathers suitcase

	it has become a tugging match with the weird man shouting ill
	take you to a taxi ill take you  ahead a group is gathered
	on the sidewalk near two ambulances  people clamor to get a look
	at a bloody body which lies on the street

	policeman try to hold the crowd off  ambulance attendants
	administer aid to the victim who convulses  somerset moves by
	ignoring it all  he motions for a cab  one pulls up from the
	streets stream of vehicles

	int  cab  night

	somerset throws his suitcase in and shuts the door behind him

						    cab driver
					  about the crowd
			    whats the big fuss

	somerset looks out at the crowd looks at the driver

						    somerset
			    why do you care

						    cab driver
					  under his breath
			    well excuse me all to hell

	the driver leans forward checking it out  the circle of
	spectators shifts suddenly  a man has shoved another man and
	theyre really going at it now  the swing at each other and tear
	at each others clothing  one mans flailing fist connects and
	the other mans face is instantly bloodied  the fight grows even
	more spastic  policemen try to stop it

						    cab driver
			    crazy fucks

	the driver pulls away and the cab rages down the street
	somerset watches the parade of neon passing on the avenue  he
	slumps back in the seat and closes his eyes

						    cab driver
			    where you headed

	somerset opens his eyes

						    somerset
			    far away from here

	int  somersets apartment  night

	the curtains are closed  the sounds of the city are here as they
	will be everywhere in this story  a car alarm is sounding
	shrill and clear  somersets life is packed into moving boxes
	except for some clothing in a closet and hundreds and hundreds of
	books on the shelves of one wall  somerset is lying on the bed
	dressed only in his underwear

	he reaches to the nightstand to a wooden pyramidical metronome
	he frees the metronomes weighted swingarm so it moves back and
	forth  swings to the left  tick swings to the right  tick
	tick tick tick measured and steady

	somerset situates on the bed closes his eyes  tick tick
	tick  the metronomes sound competes with the sound of the car
	alarm  somersets face tightens as he concentrates on the
	metronome  his eyes close tighter  tick tick tick  the
	swingarm moves evenly  somersets breathing deepens

	tick tick tick  the car alarm seems quieter

	tick tick tick  somerset continues his concentration  the
	metronomes sound seems louder

	tick tick tick  the sound of the car alarm fades and is
	gone  the metronome is the only sound

	somersets face relaxes as he begins to fall asleep  tick
	tick tick

	blood  a body lies on the floor under a sheet  a sawedoff
	shotgun lies not far from the body  the apartment is gloomy

	detective taylor 52 stands on the other side of the room looks
	through a notepad

						    taylor
			    neighbors heard them screaming at each
			    other for like two hours  it was nothing
			    new  but then they heard the gun go off
			    both barrels

						    somerset
			    did the wife confess

						    taylor
			    when the patrolman came she was trying
			    put his head back together  she was crying
			    too hard to say anything

	somerset beings walking around the apartment

						    somerset
			    why always like this  only after the
			    fact this sudden realization that if
			    you shoot someone or stick a knife in
			    them that person will cease to exist

						    taylor
			    crime of passion

						    somerset
			    yes  look at all the passion splattered up
			    on the wall here

						    taylor
			    this is a done deal  all but the
			    paperwork

	taylor shifts his weight impatient  somerset looks at a
	coloring book open on the coffee table  there are crayons beside
	it  somerset picks the book up flips through the pages

						    somerset
			    did their son see it happen

						    taylor
			    i dont know

	taylor closes his notebook perturbed  somerset looks at the
	pictures of cute crudely colored animals

						    taylor
			    what kind of fucking question is that
			    anyway

	taylor walks over and grabs the coloring book to get his
	attention

						    taylor
			    you know were all real glad were getting
			    rid of you somerset  you know that  i
			    mean its always these questions with
			    you did the kid see it  well who

					  points
			    hes dead  his wife killed him

	taylor throws the coloring book back to somerset and walks

						    taylor
			    anything else has nothing to do with us

	taylor leaves pushing past detective david mills 31 who is
	just entering  mills is muscular and handsome  he looks back at
	taylor then around the apartment a bit disoriented

	somerset puts down the coloring book  he stares at the floor
	showing no reaction to taylors tantrum

						    mills
			    uh lieutenant somerset

	somerset turns to see mills

	ext  city street  day

	a body bag is carried through a crowd of people outside the
	tenement building

	somerset follows the body bag out and mills follows somerset
	they walk towards the end of the filthy block past a man
	urinating on a car

						    mills
			    im a little thrown  i just got in town
			    like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me
			    here

						    somerset
			    since were just starting out i thought we
			    could go to a bar sit and talk for
			    awhile  after that well

						    mills
					  interrupting
			    actually if its all the same id like to
			    get to the precinct house asap  seeing
			    how we dont have much time for this whole
			    transition thing

	somerset keeps walking says nothing

						    mills

			    right  meet the people

						    somerset

			    we spoke on the phone  i cant help
			    wondering why here

						    mills
			    i i dont follow

						    somerset
			    all this effort youve made to get
			    transferred its the first question that
			    pops into my head

						    mills
			    im here for the same reasons as you i
			    guess  or at least the same reasons you
			    used to have for being here before
			    before you decided to quit

	somerset stops and faces mills

						    somerset
			    you just met me

						    mills
			    maybe im not understanding the question

						    somerset
			    its very simple  you worked a nice quiet
			    town but you fought to get here as if your
			    life depended on it  ive just never seen
			    it done that way before detective

						    mills
			    maybe i thought i could do more good here
			    than there  i dont know  look itd be
			    great by me if we didnt start right off
			    kicking each other in the balls  but
			    youre calling the shots lieutenant so
			    however you want it to go

						    somerset
			    let me tell you how i want this to go  i
			    want you to look and i want you to listen

						    mills
			    i wasnt standing around guarding the local
			    taco bell  ive worked homicide for five
			    and a half years

						    somerset
			    not here

						    mills
			    i realize that

						    somerset

			    favor of remembering it

	somerset turns and walks away  mills stands a moment pissed
	he follows after somerset

	insert  title card

	int  somersets apartment  early morning

	somerset lies asleep in bed  it is still dark outside  the
	phone beside the inactive metronome rings  somerset awakens
	suddenly startled  he looks towards the phone

	int  mills apartment bedroom  early morning

	it is just barely becoming light outside  mills is wide awake in
	bed beside the sleeping form of his wife tracy 30  mills looks
	tired  he listens to passing traffic  he covers his eyes with
	his forearm

	he takes his arm away and sits up frustrated sits on the edge
	of the bed  the room is a shambles filled with moving boxes

	light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
	sticking from one box

	large and noble a golden player stands in frozen motion at the
	trophys pinnacle

	mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face
	the phone rings  mills looks towards it  tracy awakens  she
	looks up with halfopened eyes a beautiful woman

						    tracy
			    what is it

	phone rings  mills reaches to touch tracys shoulder

						    mills
			    its okay

	mills leans to get the phone  tracy seems frightened

						    tracy
			    honey where are we

	ext  apartment building alleyway  early morning

	somerset and mills both wearing badges walk with officer davis
	a beefy uniformed cop  they pass police cars and head into a
	trash strewn alleyway  davis hands somerset two flashlights

						    davis
			    everythings like i found it  i didnt
			    touch anything

						    somerset
			    what time did you confirm the death

						    davis
			    like i said i didnt touch him but hes
			    had his face in a plate of spaghetti for
			    about fortyfive minutes now

	they reach a rusty side door which davis pulls open

	int  apartment building stairwell  early morning

	they enter a dark ugly stairwell

						    mills
					  to davis 
			    hold on you mean you didnt check for
			    vital signs

						    davis
			    did i stutter  believe me he aint
			    breathing unless hes started breathing
			    spaghetti sauce

						    mills
			    the point is whenever you find

						    davis
			    begging your pardon but the guys sitting
			    in pile of his own shit and piss  if he
			    aint dead he wouldve stood up by now

	mills is angry about to speak but somerset heads him off

						    somerset
					  to davis
			    thank you officer  well need to talk to
			    you again after weve looked around

						    davis
			    yes sir

	davis walks out eyeing mills  mills watches him go  the rusty
	door slams shut behind davis  its very dark  somerset turns on
	his flashlight hands the other to mills and starts upstairs

						    somerset
			    i wonder what exactly was the point of the
			    conversation you were about to get into

						    mills
			    and i wonder how many times officer davis
			    there has found a dead man who wasnt
			    really dead until davis was in the car
			    calling it in and eating a donut

						    somerset
			    drop it

						    mills
			    for now

	int  apartment building hallway  early morning

	somerset comes from the stairwell looking down the dark hall
	at the end of the hall a door is open  the light of a camera
	flash spills out from that room every few seconds

	mills and somerset move on  somerset takes out rubber gloves and
	slips them on looking at something on the floor ahead  a yellow
	recycling bin sits just outside the door  it contains many neat
	stringbound stacks of issues of readers digest

	int  apartment living room  early morning

	there are lights on in this room  lamps with dusty shades  a
	few porn mags on a table  somerset and mills cross  a couch
	against one wall is piled with yellowed once white pillows  it
	faces two small televisions both on with no sound

	int  apartment kitchen  early morning

	somerset and mills enter using their flashlights in the dark
	mills takes out a handkerchief covering his nose  eric is
	crouched on the floor putting camera equipment away

	hes wearing a medical mask over his face  he hoists his bag and
	moves past the detectives

						    eric
			    enjoy

	eric leaves  somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight

	at the stove each burner has a used pot or pan on it  food has
	been slopped there and on the adjoining countertop and sink
	used utensils are everywhere along with empty tin cans and jars
	cockroaches swarm

	the flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces soups and
	crumbs of food across the floor from the stove to a kitchen
	table  the kitchen table is covered in soiled paper plates which
	hold bits of halfeaten sandwiches potatoes beef stew donuts
	and many other junk foods

	the kitchen is tiny barely enough room for three people  the
	kitchen table is at the center of the room  an obese man is
	slumped forward in a kitchen chair  he is face down dead in a 
	plate of spaghetti

						    mills
			    christ somebody phone guiness  i think
			    weve got a worlds record here

	mills walks to the dead man leaning to study without touching

						    mills
			    who said this was murder

						    somerset
			    no one yet

						    mills
			    then why are we wasting our time  this
			    guys hearts got to be roughly the size of
			    a canned ham  if this isnt a coronary i
			    dont know what is

	somerset moves his flashlight beam down the obese corpse stops
	at the mans feet  somerset kneels

	at the obese mans pants cuff theres a tiny bit of rope
	sticking out  somerset uses a pen to lift the pants leg  rope
	is tied around the swollen purple ankle

						    mills
			    or not

	somerset stands and steps back  mills bends to take his place
	looking under the table and shining his flashlight into the
	corpses lap  the obese mans bloated hands are folded there
	bound tightly with rope

						    mills
			    still he could have tied himself up to
			    make it look like murder  i saw a guy
			    once committed suicide but wanted to
			    make sure his family could collect the life
			    insurance right

	somerset does not listen  he is focused on the corpse studies
	the back of the mans head and neck  he runs his pen against the
	back of the corpses neck combing the hair upwards

	there are small circular and semicircular bruises on the back of
	the obese mans head and neck some hidden under the hair

						    mills
			    when we found him he was lying there with
			    a knife in his back so what else could it
			    be but homicide  except i finally figured
			    out he held the knife behind him put
			    the tip of it in his own back and got real
			    close to the wall then he shoved his
			    body backwards

						    somerset
					  irritated
			    please be quiet for a while would you

	mills looks up at somerset from below  somerset remains focused
	on the bruises

						    mills
					  sarcastic
			    oh yes sir  forgive me

	mills stands and walks around to the other side of the table
	where he gets down again

						    mills
			    theres a bucket here

						    somerset
			    what

						    mills
			    theres a bucket  under the table

	somerset crouches pulls up the cheap tablecloth on his side of
	the table  a metal bucket sits under the table

						    somerset
			    what is it

	mills slides under with his flashlight angling in the confined
	space to look  he is repulsed and pulls back

						    mills
			    its vomit

	mills stands and backs away near the refrigerator not wanting
	to be anywhere near that bucket

						    mills
			    its a bucket of vomit

						    somerset
			    is there any blood in it

						    mills
			    i dont know  feel free to look for
			    yourself okay

	somerset stands stares at the obese man  he shakes his head
	perplexed  there is a knock at the door  the detectives look to
	see doctor thomas oneill 52 the medical examiner in the
	doorway  oneill is looking at the ceiling  he flicks the lighs
	switch  no light so he flicks the switch up and down

						    oneill
			    wonderful

	oneill seems a bit gone  he drops his black bag onto the floor
	beside the corpse  he begins to sort through the bag surgical
	tools clinking together

	mills turns to open the refrigerator  its nearly empty

						    mills
					  to somerset
			    you think it was poison

						    somerset
			    guessing at this point is useless

	the trash can beside the refrigerator is filled to the brim with
	empty food containers  mills begins to poke around with a pen

						    oneill
			    you girls have got forensics waiting
			    outside  i dont know if well all fit
			    though

						    mills
			    theres room  lights the problem

	somerset looks at mills then at the space limitations

						    somerset
			    still two is company here  and three
			    is certainly a crowd
					  pause
			    detective mills go help the officers
			    question the neighbors

	mills looks up not pleased

						    mills
			    id rather stay on this

	somerset is looking at the corpse

						    somerset
			    send one of the forensics in on your way
			    out

	mills does not move  he lifts his flashlight to shine the light
	on the side of somersets face  a moment  somerset looks at
	mills the light shining directly in somersets eyes  a longer
	moment  mills switches off the light and leaves

	oneill places both hands on the dead mans head and lifts the
	swollen visage from the spaghetti

						    oneill
			    he is dead

						    somerset
			    thank you doctor

	int  somersets car  day

	somerset drives with mills as the passenger  heavy city traffic
	both stare ahead in silence  mills is a bundle of nerves

						    mills
			    youve seen my files right  seen the
			    things ive done

						    somerset
			    no

						    mills
					  looking out window
			    anyway i did my time on doortodoors
			    and walking a beat  i did all that shit
			    for a long time

						    somerset
			    good

						    mills
			    the badge in my pocket says detective
			    same as yours

						    somerset
			    i made a decision because i have to
			    consider the integrity of the scene  i
			    cant worry whether you think youre
			    getting enough time on the playing field

						    mills
			    yeah well all i want is
					  pause
			    just just dont be jerking me off  thats
			    all i ask  dont jerk me off

	mills looks at somerset  somerset keeps his eyes on the road
	but nods slightly  that said mills slumps low into his seat

						    somerset
			    well be spending every waking hour
			    together till i leave  ill show you who
			    your friends are and your enemies  ill
			    help you cut through the red tape and i
			    will help you integrate as the captain
			    puts it  however
					  pauses clears throat
			    no matter how much you beg or plead
			    jerking off is something youll have to do
			    for yourself

	this throws mills  somerset has a sense of humour

						    somerset
			    is that clear

						    mills
			    okay sure  its just that with my
			    old partner you know

						    somerset
			    i just dont think we should have that sort
			    of relationship  wed start quarreling
			    over insignificant things

	mills lets out a nervous laugh feels a bit of weight off his
	shoulders

						    mills
			    whatever you say detective  beautiful

	int  autopsy room  day

	the room is large cold and clean  stainless steel and white
	tile  many pathologists work at slabs  a bone saw screams
	mills and somerset are with doctor santiago who stands over the
	obese corpse which is pretty well dissected already

						    santiago
			    hes been dead for a long time and i can
			    tell you it was not a poison

	santiago moves to make room for mills to stand beside him  mills
	moves up a little but not much looking on in disgust  santiago
	reaches into the mans belly  we do not see

						    mills
			    ah man how does somebody let himself go
			    like that  look at the blubber

	santiago moves something and there is a squashy sound

						    santiago
			    it took four orderlies and me all together
			    just to put this body on the table

						    mills
			    how did the fat fuck ever fit out the door
			    of his apartment

						    somerset
			    yes its obvious he was a shutin  not an
			    enviable life but maybe he still deserves
			    a modicum of respect in spite of that

						    santiago
			    are you looking here  first see how big
			    this stomach is  and see the strange
			    thing  stretches  and here it is
			    distended  look at the size of that
			    because of all the foods

						    mills
			    i can see what youre pointing at but

						    santiago
			    lines of distention across the stomach and
			    parts have ripped open

						    somerset
					  disbelief
			    doctor are you saying this man ate till
			    he burst

						    santiago
			    well he didnt really burst  not all the
			    way  but he was bleeding inside himself
			    and there is a hematoma on the outside on
			    the belly  very large

						    mills
			    he died by eating

						    santiago
			    yes  and theres something else here you
			    have to look at and see

	santiago goes to root through many jars on a table  somerset
	walks around the slab looking down at the obese mans propped
	up partially shaved head

						    somerset
			    these bruises on the victims head

	more round and semicircular bruises have been revealed all
	about the same diameter as a dime

						    santiago
			    i dont kow what they are yet  they

						    somerset
			    they could have been caused by a gun  the
			    barrel of a gun pressed against the back
			    of his head

	santiago picks up the jar he was looking for comes to lean and
	look at the obese mans head nodding again

						    santiago
			    if it was jammed against him hard enough
			    sure  its possible  here

	santiago gives the jar to somerset

						    santiago
			    most of the stomachs food contents are in
			    the lab now but these i found these
			    in his stomach too

	somerset holds the jar up  inside are many little pieces of blue
	plastic  they are curled slightly as if they are scrapings
	somerset hands the jar to mills  mills shakes it studying

						    mills
			    plastic

						    santiago
			    why these are in a fat mans stomach i
			    dont know

	int  apartment kitchen  day

	the room where the obese corpse was found is now lit by
	fluorescent light  two forensics a male and female are dusting
	for prints  somerset and mills are on their hands and knees
	somerset holds the jar and touches the linoleum floor

						    somerset
			    same color and texture

						    mills
					  to forensics
			    have you found any plastic scrapings near
			    the stove or sink  near the food

						    male forensic
			    what do you mean

	mills and somerset continue looking around the floor

						    mills
					  to somerset
			    this doesnt make any sense

						    somerset
			    you always have to find one singular thing
			    to focus on  theres always one thing and
			    it may be as small as a speck of dust but
			    you find it and focus till its an
			    exhausted possibility

	the forensics watch curious  somerset is near the refrigerator

						    mills
			    it could be nothing

						    somerset
			    but why would there be so many pieces in
			    his stomach if it were nothing  it must
			    have been intentional

	somerset stops  there are deep scratches here in the linoleum
	he fingers the grooves then takes a piece of the plastic from
	the jar  he holds the piece to the floor fiddles fits it
	into one of the scratches

	somerset gets off the floor and looks down  these scratches are
	in front of the refrigerator  it looks like they were caused by
	the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed
	back into place at some time

						    somerset
					  to mills
			    come here

	int  apartment kitchen  later day

	mills and somerset pull the refrigerator rocking it back and
	forth away from the wall to get a clear view behind it  they
	strain pull it a few more feet and release

	mills leans to look at the wall behind  shock

						    mills
			    holy shit

	somerset comes to look  behind the refrigerator there is a
	space on the wall where the dust has been wiped away  in that
	space the words one is gluttony  the letters have been
	smeared on in grease  a note is pinned beside them

	int  precinct house captains office  early evening

	the captains office is filled with pictures books and
	mugsheets  piles of paperwork abound yet the office is
	meticulously well kept  the captain 50 sits at his tidy desk
	he wears a white shirt and conservative tie

	hes a calm man but whenever he is not speaking without fail
	he clenches his jaw over and over causing the muscles in his
	neck and jaw to pulse  somerset and mills sit before him

						    somerset
			    the bruises were caused by the muzzle of a
			    fortyfive  so there was a gun against
			    his head and he was given a choice  eat
			    or get your brains blown out

	somerset gets up to pace

						    somerset
			    he ate his fill and was forced to continue
			    eating till his body rejected the food
			    the killer held a bucket under him and
			    then kept serving  he took his time  the
			    coroner says this might have gone on for
			    more than twelve hours  the victims
			    throat was swollen from the effort and
			    there was probably a point where he passed
			    out  thats when killer kicked him in the
			    stomach  popped him

						    mills
			    this was one sadistic motherfucker

						    captain
			    that seems obvious

	somerset picks up a photocopy of the note from behind the fridge

						    somerset
					  reads
			    dear detectives long is the way and
			    hard that out of hell leads up to light
			    its the murderers way of announcing
			    himself

						    captain
			    announcing what

						    somerset
			    there are seven deadly sins  gluttony
			    wrath greed

						    captain
			    so what  this victim

						    somerset
			     envy sloth pride and lust  seven

						    captain
			    hey so gluttony is one of the seven deadly
			    sins  but this was a fat guy  the killer
			    may have felt this was the just best way to
			    torture him
			    and writing on the walls happens all the
			    time  its like the fashionable thing to
			    do

						    somerset
			    one is gluttony

	the captain is disgruntled clenching his jaw looks at mills

						    mills

						    somerset
			    everything else was taken as close to
			    conclusion as humanly possible  also
			    this shouldnt be his first assignment

						    mills

	mills stands furious

			    he was the funniest man id ever met

						    somerset
			    really

	somerset has to think about that one for a second  he picks the
	medal up a medal for valor from the police department

						    somerset
			    well its rare these days that kind of
			    commitment

	he puts the medal down  tracy is looking at the gun strapped
	under somersets arm as somerset starts to unstrap it

						    somerset
					  about the gun
			    dont worry  i dont wear it at the dinner
			    table

						    tracy
			    no matter how often i see guns i still
			    cant get used to them

	somerset lays the gun with his jacket

						    somerset
			    same here

	tracy smiles  somerset goes to the table and transfers a small
	notebook from his breast pocket to his pants pocket  a piece of
	paper falls to the floor closer to tracy

						    tracy
			    anyway what girl wouldnt want the
			    captain of the football team as their
			    lifetime mate  here you dropped
			    something

	tracy picks it up  it is the pale paper rose  she looks at it
	as she hands it back to somerset who is selfconscious

						    tracy
			    what is that

	somerset looks at the rose then puts it away

						    somerset
			    my future

	tracy tilts her head looking at somerset

						    tracy

						    somerset

	int  mills apartment living room  later night

	a record player on a moving box plays quiet music  tracy mills
	and somerset are eating  mills has a beeper beside his plate and
	occasionally fingers it absently

						    tracy
			    why arent you married william

						    mills
			    tracy what the hell

	somerset pokes at the napkin thinking

						    somerset
			    i was close once  it just didnt happen

						    tracy
			    it surprises me  it really does

						    somerset
			    any person who spends a significant amount
			    of time with me finds me disagreeable
			    just ask your husband

						    mills
			    very true

	mills grins but he means it

						    tracy
					  to somerset
			    how long have you lived here

						    somerset
			    too long
					  drinks
			    what do you think so far

	tracy glances immediately to mills

						    mills
			    it takes time to settle in

	somerset can see it is a sore subject

						    somerset
			    well you can get numb to it pretty quickly
			    there are things in any city

	a low rumbling is heard  plates on the table begin to clatter

						    mills
			    subway train

	the dishes clatter more  coffee cups clink against their
	saucers  tracy holds her coffee cup to stop it and smiles at
	somerset to act like its nothing but she is clearly bothered

						    tracy
			    itll go away in a minute

	they wait  the rumbling grows louder knocks something over in
	the sink  somerset continues eating fiddles with his food  the
	record player skips then plays on  the clattering dies down
	mills seems uncomfortable

						    mills
			    this real estate guy this miserable
			    fuck he brought us to see this place a few
			    times  and first im thinking hes good
			    really efficient  but then i started
			    wondering why does he keep hurrying us
			    along  why will he only show us this place
			    for like five minutes at a time

	mills laughs lamely

						    tracy
			    we found out the first night

	somerset tries to stay straight but he cant help laughing

						    somerset
			    the soothing relaxing vibrating home
			    sorry

	he laughs harder covering his mouth  tracy and mills laugh

						    mills
			    oh fuck

	int  mills apartment living room  later night

	the record player plays another album  tracy brings over a pot
	of coffee and pours  mills and somerset have beers

						    tracy
			    i dont think ive ever met anyone who
			    doesnt have a television before
			    thats weird

						    mills
			    its unamerican is what it is

						    somerset
			    all television does is teach children that
			    its really cool to be stupid and eat candy
			    bars all day

						    mills
			    what about sports

						    somerset
			    what about them

	tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table

						    mills
			    you go to movies at least

						    somerset
			    i read  remember reading

						    mills
			    i just have to say i cant respect any man
			    whos never seen green acres

	somerset gives a blank stare  tracy walks across the room

						    mills
			    youve never seen the odd couple  this
			    is sick  the honeymooners

						    somerset
			    i vaguely recall a large angry man and
			    someone called norton

	tracy turns the record player down further then goes into the
	bedroom and shuts the door behind her

	somerset and mills look a the closed door  a long moment  they
	look at each other then sit for a time  somerset puts down his
	beer sighs  he looks around

	int  mills apartment living room

	the only sounds are from the city outside  the living room table
	has been cleared and its surface is now covered with various
	forms reports and 8 by 10 photographs  mills and somerset are
	both standing  mills guides somerset through the photos

						    mills
			    our guy got into office probably before
			    the building closed and security tightened
			    up  gould must have been working late

						    somerset
			    im certain  he was the biggest defense
			    lawyer around  infamous actually

						    mills
			    well his body was found monday night
			    okay  but get this the office was
			    closed all day monday  which means as
			    long as the gluttony killing was done
			    before the weekend our killer couldve
			    gotten in here on friday  he couldve
			    spent all day saturday with gould and all
			    day sunday

	mills picks up one photo and shows it to somerset  long shot it
	shows the greed murder scene  gould sits dead in the leather
	chair near the desk where the counterbalance scale sits

						    mills
			    gould was tied down nude  the killer left
			    his arms free and handed him a big sharp
			    butchers knife  see the scale here

	mills pulls another photo  close up the twoarmed scale  in
	one suspended plate is a one pound weight  in the other is a
	hunk of flesh

						    somerset
			    a pound of flesh

	mills digs comes up with a photocopy of a handscrawled note

						    somerset
					  reading note
			    one pound of flesh no more no less  no
			    cartilage no bone but only flesh  this
			    task done and he would go free

	mills takes out one photo showing the note pinned to the wall
	beside where greed is written in blood

						    mills
			    the leather chair was soaked through with
			    sweat

						    somerset
					  nods grim
			    all day saturday and all day sunday
					  pause
			    the murderer would want gould to take his
			    time  to have to sit there and decide
			    where do you make the first cut  theres a
			    gun in your face but what part of your
			    body is expendable

						    mills
			    he cut along the side of his stomach  the
			    love handle

	somersets still studying the photos

						    somerset
			    he must have left another puzzle piece

						    mills
			    look i appreciate being able to talk this
			    out but uh

						    somerset
			    this is just to satisfy my curiosity  im
			    still leaving town saturday

	mills is very tired  he rubs his eyes then walks to take one
	more photo from his briefcase  it is the photo of the framed
	picture of the falsely pretty woman with her eyes circled in
	blood

						    mills
			    goulds wife  she was away on business
			    if this means she saw anything i dont
			    know what  weve questioned her at least
			    five times

						    somerset
			    and if its a threat

						    mills
			    we put her in a safe house

	somerset nods  he puts down the photos hes holding  he begins
	spreading all the pictures out

						    somerset
			    look at these with fresh eyes  dont see
			    what the killer wants you to  dont let
			    guide you

	while he speaks somerset keeps shifting the photos for example
	covering the corpse in one with the edge of another

						    somerset
			    even if the corpse is right there its
			    almost like looking through it  editing
			    out the initial shock  look at the room

	in the photos theres the scale  the note on the wall  shelves
	of books  the modern art painting

	greed written in blood

						    somerset
			    hes preaching

						    mills
			    punishing

						    somerset
			    the sins were used in medieval sermons
			    there were seven cardinal virtues and then
			    seven deadly sins created as a learning
			    tool because they distract from true
			    worship

						    mills
			    like in the parsons tale and dante

						    somerset
			    did you read them

						    mills
			    yeah  parts of them  anyway in
			    purgatory dante and his buddy are climbing
			    up that big mountain seeing all these
			    other guys who sinned

						    somerset
			    seven terraces of purgation

						    mills
			    right  but there pride comes first not
			    gluttony  the sins are in a different
			    order

						    somerset
			    for now lets just consider the books as the
			    murderers inspiration
			    the books and sermons are about atonement
			    for sin  and these murders have been like
			    forced attrition

						    mills
			    forced what

						    somerset
			    attrition  when you regret your sins but
			    not because you love god

						    mills
			    like because someones holding a gun on
			    you

	mills runs his hands across his face walks to the fridge to get
	beer  somerset keeps looking at photos and papers

						    somerset
			    no fingerprints

						    mills
			    nothing

						    somerset
			    totally unrelated victims

	mills nods drinking from a beer

						    somerset
			    no witnesses of any kind

						    mills
			    none  which i dont understand  he had to
			    get back out

	somerset sits in a chair picks up the photo of the wife  runs
	his fingers over the eyes circled in blood

						    somerset
			    in any major city minding your own
			    business is a perfected science  theres a
			    public crime prevention course offered at
			    the precinct house once a month  the first
			    thing they teach is that you should never
			    cry help  always scream fire because
			    people dont want to get caught up in
			    anything  but a fire thats an
			    evenings entertainment  they come
			    running

	looking at the wifes photo

						    somerset
			    this is the one thing

						    mills
			    i know

						    somerset
					  holds photo up
			    what if its not that shes seen
			    something  what if shes supposed to see
			    something but she just hasnt been given a
			    chance to see it yet

						    mills
			    okay  but what

	int  safe house  night

	the room is like a hotel room  mills stands beside the woman
	from the picture mrs gould  mills shows her photos from the
	murder scene  the photos have been covered in sections to hide
	the mr goulds corpse  mrs gould is crying  somerset is on
	the other side of the room holding more photos

						    mills
			    im sorry about this mrs gould  i really
			    am

						    mrs gould

	mills helps her flip through the photos  he isnt too keen to
	put her through this

						    mills
			    i need you to look at each one carefully
			    very carefully  look for anything that
			    seems strange or out of place  anything at
			    all

						    mrs gould
			    i dont know why why now

						    mills
			    please i need you to help me if were
			    going to get who did this

	mrs gould sobs quietly wipes her tears

						    mills
			    anything anything missing or different

						    mrs gould
			    i dont see anything

						    mills
			    are you absolutely certain

						    mrs gould
			    i cant do this now please

	mills looks to somerset looks at the photos somerset holds

						    mills
			    maybe we better wait

	somerset looks at the photos in his hand  these show mr goulds
	corpse in the chair not covered in any way

						    somerset
			    it should be now  there may be something
			    were not seeing

						    mrs gould
			    wait  here

						    mills
			    what is it

	mrs gould points at the modern art painting on the wall in one
	photo  the painting is just splattered paint abstract

						    mrs gould
			    this painting

						    mills
			    what

						    mrs gould
			    why is this painting hanging upsidedown

	mills turns to look at somerset

	int  law office  night

	where the greed murder took place  somerset wearing gloves
	reaches to take the modern art painting off the wall  mills
	near watching

						    somerset
			    youre sure your men didnt move this

						    mills
			    even if they did those photos were taken
			    before forensics

	nothing on the wall behind the painting  blank space

						    mills
			    nothing

						    somerset
			    its got to be

	somerset puts the painting down resting it on its bottom edge
	the painting is backed by a thick sheet of brown papers stapled
	into the wooden frame  somerset points to where the wires eye
	screws used to be screwed into the frame and to where it has
	been rescrewed

						    somerset
			    he changed the wire to rehang it

	somerset takes out his switchblade  mills is surprised

						    mills
			    what the fuck is that

						    somerset
			    a switchblade

	somerset cuts along the edge of the brown paper to get to the
	hollow space between it and the back of the canvas  he cuts out
	the entire sheet  mills helps pull it away  nothing  empty
	mills looks at both sides of the paper then tosses it away

						    mills
			    nothing  damn it

	somerset lays the painting face up on the floor  he pokes his
	finger on the painted surface  he brings the flat of his blade
	against the painting tries to peel some of the paint

						    mills
			    the killer didnt paint the fucking thing
			    give it up

	somerset pushes the painting away frustrated

						    somerset
			    there must be something

						    mills
			    were screwed  hes fucking with us

	somerset backs away from the wall staring at the space where the
	painting hung  there is only a nail  he turns looking around
	the office then crosses

	mills puts his hands to his temple furious picks up a lamp and
	throws it to the floor venting

						    mills
			    motherfucker

	across the room somerset falls to his knees and pulls open a
	forensics kit  he takes out a fingerprint brush examining the
	bristles  mills sees this

						    mills
			    what

						    somerset
			    bear with me

	somerset goes back to the wall where the painting was  he pulls
	over a chair gets on it and starts brushing near the nail

						    mills
			    oh yeah sure  you got to be kidding

						    somerset
			    just wait

	somerset brushes with a few wider strokes  he leans close
	studies the powder residue  leans closer still  pause

						    somerset
			    call the print lab

	int  mills apartment bedroom  night

	tracy is asleep dressed with the lights still on  she stirs
	then awakens and sits up slowly  she squints from the light
	sweaty and uncomfortable  she looks around and listens  all she
	hears is traffic

						    mills
			    he just may be nuts enough

						    somerset

			    samples  we write everything down and note
			    what time things happened

						    mills
			    oh thats all

						    somerset

	somerset and mills are with doctor beardsley  victor lies inside
	an oxygen tent with tubes running into him  the room is dim

						    doctor
			    a year of immobility seems about right
			    judging by the deterioration of the muscles
			    and the spine  blood tests show a whole
			    smorgasbord of drugs in his systems from
			    crack to heroin even an antibiotic which
			    must have been administered to keep the bed
			    sores from infecting

	mills looks into the oxygen tent

						    mills
			    he hasnt said anything or tried to
			    express himself in any way

						    doctor
			    even if his brain were not mush which it

						    doctor
			    its funny to think hes experienced
			    about as much pain and suffering as anyone
			    ive encountered give or take and he
			    still has hell to look forward to

	he chuckles again engrossed in some information on a clipboard

			    it must take to keep a man bound for a
			    full year  to connect tubes to his
			    genitals  to sever his hand and use it to
			    plant fingerprints  hes methodical and
			    exacting and worst of all hes patient

						    mills
			    what does all that matter anyway  its not
			    our job to figure him out is it  all we
			    have to do is catching him

	mills comes to a halt his focus confused searching desperately
	others run upon seeing his gun  woman scream and grab up their
	children  mills cant see far down the sidewalk because of all
	the people  he moves forward

	he jumps atop a fire hydrant gripping a street sign for balance
	trying to see further down the street

	mills pov  there he is  john doe can be seen far off
	moving across the street through traffic to the opposite
	sidewalk

	on the street mills runs into traffic avoiding cars down the
	center line  angry drivers scream at him

	ahead john doe glances back ducking into an alley

	mills gets to the other sidewalk yelling for people to get out
	of the way

	ext  city alleyway  day

	mills comes to this tight alleyway  its dark with a long
	tall vertical sliver of daylight far ahead  mills runs

	charging hard onwards

	a twobyfour swings out from a hidden nook along the side of the
	alleyway  slamming mills in the face with a thwack

	mills gun hits the alley wall and clatters into a puddle

	mills hits the dirt on his back nose broken and split face
	bloodied  he cries out rolling to his side clutching his face

	the twobyfour is dropped  john does feet cross a short

	reaches mills mouth  the barrel is inserted between his lips

	the guns hammer is pulled back

	somerset holds the computer paper now crumpled in his hand  he
	waves it in mills face as mills struggles

	mills stops struggling breathing hard seething trembling

						    mills
			    by the time we clear a warrant someone else

	back halfshut

						    somerset
			    you stupid son of a

						    mills
			    no point in arguing anymore

	mills strides down the short end of the hall towards a window

						    mills
					  pointing back
			    unless you can fix that

	mills stops looking out the window  it overlooks a weedy
	overgrown courtyard where a thin vagrant lies asleep on the
	concrete  mills turns looking back to somerset

						    mills
			    how much money do we have left

	int  tenement building stairwell  early evening

	on a stairwell landing somerset watches the thin vagrant from
	the courtyard talk to a uniformed policeman who writes on a
	clipboard taking the statement

						    thin vagrant
			    so i i noticed this guy going out
			    going out a lot when those murders were
			    happening  so so i

	the vagrants clinging to the rail drunk and out of it  mills
	is down further on the stairs high strung chomping at the bit
	to get this over with

						    mills
			    so you called detective somerset right

						    thin vagrant
			    yeah i i called the detective
			    because because this guy seemed creepy
			    and and

						    mills
					  urging him on
			    and

						    thin vagrant
			    and one of the murders was over there
			    over nearby here  i i called the
			    cops

	the vagrant wipes drool from his lips  mills comes to grip him
	so he doesnt fall searching the policemens face for suspicion

						    mills
			    i told you the rest  you got it

						    policeman
					  still writing
			    yeah whatever

						    somerset
			    have him sign it

	the policeman holds the clipboard and pen out to the vagrant
	mills takes the pen and guides the vagrants hand almost signing
	it for him

						    mills
			    great  is that it

	the policeman nods  mills grips the vagrant and leads him down
	the stairs in a hurry around a bend  mills looks up to be sure
	theyre out of the policemans sight takes out a wad of cash and
	shoves it in the vagrants pocket

						    mills
			    go drink yourself happy

	mills quickly guides the vagrant on his way then turns and
	rushes up the stairs taking them two at a time

	int  john does apartment main room  early evening

	mills pushes door 6a open putting on rubber gloves  he steps in
	with somerset behind  somerset turns back to the policeman

						    somerset
					  to policeman
			    wait outside

	somerset closes the door most of the way  mills hits a switch on
	the wall and a lamp illuminates a desk  the desk is in the
	center of the room facing them  the room is bizarre with some
	areas cluttered and others barren  all the walls are painted
	black  all the large curtainless windows are painted over

	somerset puts on his gloves  mills walks to the desk

	the desktop is rather tidy  the only blatantly strange thing is
	a set of notches carved into the wooden surface three notches
	a candle has been allowed to burn down at one corner of the desk
	and the wax trail goes all the way to the floor  mills opens the
	middle desk drawer  its empty except for the holy bible

	somerset moves along shelves of books looking at the spines
	lots of thick oversized art volumes  a history of theology
	handbook of firearms  history of the world  summa theologica
	united states criminal law review

	at the desk mills opens another drawer  its filled with at
	least forty empty aspirin bottles  he opens the next drawer and
	finds a rosary and several boxes of bullets

	somerset comes to look at john does bed  no mattress its
	only a metal frame and springs with a sheet spread across it
	the sheet is sweat stained and dotted by stains of rust at many
	points where springs have worn through

	somerset walks around the bed to a narrow table not far away
	against the wall  the table contains a strange tableau like a
	mini stage handmade of cardboard and pasted communion wafers
	a human hand immersed in a jar of liquid is the centerpiece

						    somerset
					  quiet to himself
			    victor

	above this on the wall theres a clutter of pinned up articles
	about the seven deadly sins pages from art books pencil
	drawings of christ all tight together and overlapping

	mills picks up a small piece of paper from a letter holder  its
	a pink receipt from wild bills leather shop

	written custom job 50264 paid in full  mills puts the
	receipt back down on the desk

	somerset walks to a black door  opens it

	int  john does apartmen room two  early evening

	somerset enters  a ceiling light is on  bare bulb  there are
	bookshelves on three walls filled with notebooks  thousands and
	thousands of notebooks

	somerset takes one notebook down  it is a thick composition book
	with an unlabeled cover  inside the pages are filled with small
	handwritten sentences thumbnail sketches and blurry glued in
	photographs small photos seemingly cut from contact sheets
	the sketches pictures and writings takes up ever single inch

	somerset takes down another notebook and flips through the pages
	same as the first filled to the brim

	somerset crosses to another shelf and pulls another notebook
	same deal  somerset looks around

						    somerset
			    jesus

	int  john does apartment main room  early evening

	mills moves from the desk to a hall  he tries a light switch
	but it does nothing  he walks

	its dark  a rather long hall  the only light is a red glow
	seeping from under the bottom of the closed door ahead

	int  john does apartment room two  early evening

	somerset walks to a 16mm film projector  it sits facing a
	battered white screen  somerset turns the projector on backing
	away to switch off the bare bulb above

	int  john does apartment hall  early evening

	mills reaches the door at the end of the hall  he turns the knob
	and pushes the door open  hes bathed in red light

	int  john does apartment bathroom  early evening

	mills enters  he looks around slowly  stunned

	int  john does apartment room two  early evening

	the projector is clattering in the dark running a piece of film
	through  the film is spliced to run as a nonstop loop
	somerset watches the screen light strobing across him

	the screen shows a bright image of clouds drifting with strange
	superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily  its like
	a weird old hollywood version of heaven

	the images switch abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
	around a pit of molten goo where more tormented humans squirm
	like heaven its a scratched piece of film from hollywoods
	early days

						    mills os
			    somerset

	somerset is engrossed in the images

						    mills os
			    somerset come here

	somerset hears him

	int  john does apartment hallbathroom  early evening

	somerset comes down the hall

						    mills os
			    we had him damn it

	somerset reaches the bathroom where mills stands looking up at
	the wall  the room has been converted into a dark room lit by
	red bulbs with strips of film hanging from the ceiling

						    somerset
			    what are you talking about

						    mills
			    we had him

	there are hundreds of prints on the walls and hanging from drying
	wires  somerset looks around trying to understand

	pictures of john does victims alive and dead  grotesque
	photos of their pleading faces and their dead bodies  close
	shots of eyes fingers and mouths

	mills sits on the closed toilet throwing something into the
	nearby sink and resting his head in his hands

						    mills
			    the pass was a fake

	in the sink  its a laminated press pass on a neck cord

	on the walls more pictures of the crime scenes but from the
	outside looking in  long shots  police cars  ambulances
	uniformed officers putting up police barrier ribbons outside
	buildings  the coroners wagon

	somerset stares at them taking them in realizing

						    mills
			    we had him and we let him go

	in the backgrounds of the pictures somerset and mills  in
	another mills crossing the street  in another somerset and
	mills getting out of somersets car

	one photo close shot shows mills and somerset on the stairwell
	of the building where victors body was found  it is the
	picture taken by the balding almost silly looking reporter

	int  john does apartment main room  night

	a male forensic uses tongs to remove victors hand from the jar
	of liquid  he places the hand in a clear plastic evidence bag

	the forensic walks away with the hand past a female sketch
	artist who puts the finishing touches on an accurate drawing of
	the balding almost silly looking reporter who wears thick
	glasses now known as john doe

						    sketch artist
			    youre sure this is him

	mills stands over the sketch artist  two deputy detectives sara
	and billy are at work along with two other forensics searching
	photographing and dusting

						    mills
			    just put it in circulation

						    sketch artist
			    you got it  tomorrow morning this citys
			    good citizens will be on the lookout for

						    sara
			    its just we havent found any
			    fingerprints yet  not a single one

						    mills
			    you know youre right i dont believe
			    you  keep looking

	mills walks away

	int  john does apartment room two  night

	somerset and three uniformed officers are looking through the
	notebooks on the shelves  somerset squints at the notebook in
	his hand shaking his head as he reads  mills enters

	somerset looks up and closes the notebook

						    somerset
			    we could use about fifty more men here

						    mills
			    im trying alright  just tell me what
			    weve got

	somerset pauses briefly at mills abruptness

						    somerset
			    well there are at least five thousand
			    notebooks in this room and near as i can
			    tell each notebook contains two hundred
			    and fifty pages

						    mills
			    then he must write about these murders

						    somerset
					  opens notebook reads
			    what sick ridiculous puppets we are and
			    what a gross little stage we dance on
			    what fun we have dancing and fucking not
			    a care in the world  not knowing that we
			    are nothing  we are not what was
			    intended

	somerset turns a few pages

						    somerset
					  reads
			    on the subway today a man came to me to
			    start a conversation  he made small talk
			    this lonely man talking about the weather
			    and other things  i tried to be pleasant
			    and accommodating but my head began to
			    hurt from his banality  i almost didnt
			    notice it had happened but i suddenly
			    threw up all over him  he was not pleased
			    and i couldnt help laughing

	somerset closes the notebook

						    somerset
			    no dates indicated placed on the shelves
			    in no discernible order  its just his
			    mind poured out on paper  i dont think
			    its going to give us any specifics

						    mills
			    looking around ive got a bad feeling
			    these murders are his lifes work

	a phone is heard ringing in another room  mills looks

	int  john does apartment main room  night

	everyones looking around and at each other trying to find the
	source of the ringing  mills and somerset enter baffled  mills
	looks to sara  she shrugs and shakes her head

	everyone searches  phone rings

	mills gets on his hands and knees

						    mills
			    here

	mills crawls under john does bed  he comes back out with a
	rotary phone  someone throws him a microcassette recorder
	mills turns the recorder on makes sure its running then picks

			    im sorry i only

	two young punks step up to the window outside and look in at
	tracy  one flicks his tongue rapidly  tracy looks away
	somerset takes out his badge and holds it against the window
	one punk gives the finger and the other spits on the window
	they leave laughing  tracy tries to smile

						    tracy
			    perfect example

						    somerset

			    most times

						    tracy
			    i dont know why i asked you to come

			    you tell him how you feel

						    tracy

			    here thinks  upstate it was a completely
			    different environment
					  pause
			    i dont know if david told you but i teach
			    fifth grade or did

						    somerset
			    he mentioned it

	tracy seems very upset near tears

						    tracy
			    ive been going to some of the schools
			    looking for work but the conditions here
			    are horrible

						    somerset
			    you should look into private schools

						    tracy
			    i dont know

	tracy looks up wipes at her eyes

						    somerset
			    whats really bothering you

	tracy bites her lip

						    tracy
			    david and i are going to have a baby

	somerset sits back the expression of soothing concern on his
	face disappearing

						    somerset
			    oh tracy i have to tell you im not
			    the one to talk to about this

						    tracy
			    i hate this city

	somerset sighs  he takes out a cigarette but thinks better of
	it and puts it back  he looks out the window

						    somerset
			    if youre thinking
					  pause
			    i had a relationship once very much like a
			    marriage  and she was going to have our
			    child  this is a long time ago  she and i
			    had decided we were going to make the
			    choice together whether to keep the
			    baby

	tracy looks at somerset

						    somerset
			    well i got up one morning and went to
			    work just like any other day except it
			    was my first since hearing about the baby
			    and i i felt this fear and anxiety
			    washing over me  i looked around and i
			    thought how can we raise a child
			    surrounded by all this  how can a child
			    grow up here
					  pause
			    so that night i told her i didnt want us
			    to have it and over the next few weeks i
			    convinced her it was wrong  i mean i
			    wore her down slowly

						    tracy
			    i want to have children  its just

						    somerset
			    i can tell you now i know im positive
			    i made the right decision  im positive
			    but theres never a day that passes that i
			    dont wish i had decided differently

	somerset reaches and takes tracys hand

						    somerset
			    if you dont keep the baby if thats
			    what you decide then never tell him you
			    were pregnant  i mean that  never
					  pause
			    the relationship will whither and die

	tracy nods tears welling up again  somerset smiles a bit

						    somerset
			    but if you do decide to have the baby
			    then at that very moment when youre
			    absolutely sure tell david  tell him at
			    that exact second and then spoil that kid
			    every chance you get

	there are tears in somersets eyes

						    somerset
			    thats all the advice i can give you
			    tracy  i dont even know you

	he smiles again wipes his own tears

						    tracy
			    william

	somersets beeper begins beeping  he takes it out and stands
	wanting to leave  tracy gets up and kisses him on the cheek

						    tracy
			    thank you

	somerset starts to back away

						    tracy
			    keep in touch after youre gone william

	somerset and mills sit with a full pitcher of beer  the jukebox
	plays for the other customers  the walls of the bar are covered
	with trophies plaques and other victory symbols

						    somerset
			    the irony is after a day of the type of
			    work he did hed come home and read me
			    these morbid crime stories  murders in the
			    rue morgue  le fanus green tea  my
			    mother would give him hell because he was
			    keeping me up till all hours

						    mills
			    sounds like a father who wanted his son to
			    follow in his footsteps

						    somerset
			    one birthday he gave me this brand new
			    hardcover book the century of the
			    detective by jurgen thorwald  it traced
			    the history of deduction as a science and
			    it sealed my fate because it was real not
			    fiction  and that a drop of blood or a
			    piece of hair could solve a crime it was
			    incredible to me

	somerset drinks then pours more beer

						    somerset
			    you know theres not going to be a happy
			    ending to this  its not possible anymore

						    mills
			    if we get him ill be happy enough

						    somerset
			    no  face it now  stop thinking its good
			    guys against bad guys

						    mills
			    how can you say that  especially after
			    today

						    somerset
			    dont try to focus on things as black and
			    white because youll go blind  theres no
			    winning and losing here

						    mills
			    youre the oldest man i know somerset

						    somerset
			    you tell me then you walk into an
			    apartment and a man has beaten his wife to
			    death or the wife murdered the husband
			    and you have to wash the blood off their
			    children  you put the killer in jail  who
			    won

						    mills
			    you do your job

						    somerset
			    wheres the victory

						    mills
			    you follow the law and do the best you can
			    its all there

						    somerset
			    just know that in this case theres not
			    going to be any satisfaction  if we caught
			    john doe and he were the devil himself if
			    it turned out he were actually satan then
			    that might live up to our expectations  no
			    human being could do these things right
			    but this is not the devil  its just a
			    man

						    mills
			    why dont you shut the fuck up for a while
			    you bitch and complain if i thought like
			    you i would have slit my wrist already

						    somerset
			    it wasnt one thing if thats what you

						    mills
			    oh youre so much better than everyone
			    right  no ones worthy of you

						    somerset
			    wrong  i sympathize completely because if
			    you cant win then if you dont ignore
			    everything and everyone around you you
			    you become like john doe  its easier to
			    beat a child than it is to raise it
			    because it takes so much work to love  you
			    just have to make sure you dont stop to
			    think about the abuse and the damage
			    because youll risk being sad  keep
			    ignoring

						    mills
			    youre talking about people who are
			    mentally ill  youre

						    somerset
			    no im not  im talking about common

			    the next and the next and it never ends
			    in this place ignorance isnt just bliss
			    its a matter of survival

						    mills
			    listen to yourself  you say the problem
			    with people is they dont care so i dont
			    care about people  but youre already
			    here  youve been here a long time  so
			    theres a part of you that knows even if
			    everything you say is true none of it
			    matters

	lawyer mark swarr sits taking notes and talking with doe

						    captain
			    he cuts off the skin if his fingertips
			    thats why we cant find a single usable
			    print in the apartment  hes been doing it
			    for quite a while  keeps cutting before
			    the papillary line can grow back

						    mills
			    what about the trace on his bank account
			    and the guns  there must be something to
			    connect him with a past

						    captain
			    so far its all dead ends  no credit
			    history  no employment history  his bank
			    accounts only five years old and it
			    started as cash  were even trying to
			    trace his furniture but for now all we
			    know is hes independently wealth well
			    educated and totally insane  we may never
			    know how he got that way

						    somerset
			    because he is john doe by choice

						    mills
			    when do we get to question him

	desk  a nurse takes the form and hands somerset a large manila
	envelope

						    nurse

	mister causes somerset to look strangely at the nurse

						    nurse

			    nothing

	ext  hospital  day

	somerset comes down the stairs slowly tired  he holds the
	manila envelope and a small suitcase  the streets are busy with
	pedestrians and traffic

	he walks down the sidewalk

	he puts down the suitcase and opens the manila envelope to look
	inside  he sorts through the contents takes out his keys and
	puts them in his pocket

	he reaches in the envelope again and takes out the square of
	wallpaper with the pale red rose on it  there is some dried
	blood on the paper  somerset lays the envelope on the ground
	beside the suitcase

	he looks at the rose tries to scratch off the blood

	he looks up squinting from the sun at the city bustling around
	him  at the tight canyon formed by the buildings

	at the cars buses and taxis racing in the streets

	at a man talking to himself who lies on the sidewalk
	surrounded by garbage

	at the people miserable people walking past him

	somerset takes out the note from mills you were right  you were
	right about everything

	a father passes by holding his young sons hand  somerset turns
	to watch them pass  the father reaches to pick the son up and
	carry him in his arms  the boy laughs and holds tight

	the father hugs his son to him kisses him on the cheek  the boy
	returns the kiss with great affection

	somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity  he
	looks back at the two papers in his hands  he lets out a sigh

						    somerset
					  to himself
			    oh man

	he sighs again drained

	he puts the pale paper rose inside the note from mills  he folds
	them together

	he tears them both up into little pieces

	ext  precinct house  day

	cars roll by in the street  cops come and go

	somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house  the doors
	shut behind him
