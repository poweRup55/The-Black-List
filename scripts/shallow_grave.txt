introduction


typed and htmled by greg adkins



int day

a blurred image forms on a white screen a horizontal strip of 
face eyes motionless and unblinking 

david
voiceover 
take trust for instance or friendship these are the important 
things in life the things that matter that help you on your 
way if you cant trust your friends well what then

ext dawn 

a series of fastcut static scenes of empty streets 

david
voiceover
this could have been any city theyre all the same

a rapid swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow 
lanes and passageways accompanied by soundtrack and credits

the track ends outside a solid fashionable edinburgh tenement

int stairwell day

at the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement the 
door is dark heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed 
with the names of three tenants they are alex law david 
stevens and juliet miller

a man climbs the stairs and reaches the door he is cameron 
clarke thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and 
lank greasy hair he is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag 
cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands 
back shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is 
answered

cameron
hello ive come about the room

cameron enters and the door closes

int living room day

david alex and juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly 
opposite cameron who shifts uneasily in his armchair alex 
checks some items on a clipboard before speaking

alex
whats his name

david
i dont know  campbell or something

juliet
cameron

alex
cameron

juliet
yes

alex
to juliet
really

cameron
thats right

alex
to cameron
what

cameron is not sure what to say

alex
continued
well cameron are you comfortable

cameron
yes thanks

alex
good well youve seen the flat

cameron
yes

alex
and you like it

cameron
oh yes its great

alex
yes it is isnt it we alllike it and the rooms nice too 
dont you think

cameron
yes

alex
spacious quiet bright well appointed all that sort of stuff 
all that crap

cameron
well yes

alex
so tell me cameron what on earth  just tell me because i 
want to know  what on earth could make you think that we would 
want to share a flat like this with someone like you

int stairwell day

as cameron plods slowly down the stairs his shoes striking out 
against the stone steps alexs criticisms continue

alex
voiceover

i mean my first impression and theyre rarely wrong is that 
you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a 
prospective flatmate im talking here about things like 
presence charisma style and charm and i dont think were 
being unreasonable take david here for instance a chartered 
accountant he may be but at least he tries hard the point is i 
dont think youre even trying

cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs he opens the main 
door

alex
continued
and cameron  i mean this  good luck

cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him

alex
continued
do you think he was upset

int stairwell day

inside the hall of the flat david approaches the door toopen it 
freezeframe

alex
voiceover
david likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box 
marked not just shoelaces but spare shoelaces

david opens the door to the woman

woman
ive come to see about the room

int stairwell day

outside the door of the flat a young goth girl aged about 
twenty rings the doorbell

int hall day

inside the hall of the flat alex approaches the door to open it 
freezeframe

juliet
voiceover
alex is a vegetarian do you know why because he feels it 
provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous 
personality it doesnt he thinks hes the man for me he isnt 
though there was a time when well there was a time when

alex opens the door to the goth

goth
ive come about the room

int stairwell day

at the door of the flat a man aged about thrityfive rings the 
bell

int hall day

inside the hall of the flat juliet approaches the door to open 
it freezeframe

david
voiceover
like one of those stupid posters  you know a gorilla cuddling 
a hedgehog caption love hurts  thats what i think when i 
think of juliet

juliet opens the door to the man

man
ive come about the room

int living room day

in the living room each of the candidates is interviewed 
individually with the same seating arrangements as before ie 
the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair what we see 
are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews we 
do not get the responses to the questions although we may see 
some facial reaction

all of davids questions are to the woman

all of alexs questions are to the goth

all of juliets questions are to the man

david
all right just a few questions

alex
id like to ask you about your hobbies

juliet
why do you want a room here

david
do you smoke

alex
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare 
hands do you then summon hellfire

juliet
i mean what are you actually doing here what is the hidden 
agenda

david
do a little freebasemaybe from time to time

alex
or maybe just phone out for a pizza

juliet
look its a fairly straightforward question youre either 
divorced or youre not

david
ok im going to play you just a few seconds of this tape  id 
like you to name the song the lead singer and the three hit 
singles subsequently recorded by him with another band

alex
when you get up in the morning how do you decide what shade of 
black to wear

juliet
now let me get this straight this affair that youre not 
having is it not with a man or not with a woman

david
turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance  no 
this is important leveraged buyouts  a good thing or a bad 
thing

alex
with which of the following figures do you most closely identify 
joan of arc eva braun or marilyn monroe

juliet
its just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of 
emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner 
of your dreams is quite simply just that

david
did you ever kill a man

alex
and when did anyone last say to you these exact words you are 
the sunshine of my life

juliet
ok so a has left you b is ambivalent youre still seeing c but 
d is the one you yearn for what are we to make of this if i 
were you id ditch the lot theres a lot more letters in the 
alphabet of love

david
and what if i told you that i was the antichrist

int squash court evening

in a sports centre juliet sits outside a glasswalled squash 
court she is ready to play but at present is watching alex and 
david who are inside the court

int squash court evening

inside the squash court alex is about to serve

alex
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for 
personal domination

david
serve

alex
i was trying to educate you

david

alex
in the same fashion as chess

david
what

alex
chess chess is often used as well

int juliets car a mini night

alex sits in the back drinking

juliet is driving david sits beside her

alex
i wasnt trying to win

there is no response from juliet

alex
continued
i dont want to devalue your victory but i just want you to 
know i wasnt trying to win

david
victory is the same as defeat its giving in to destructive 
competitive urges

alex
you learn that in your psychotherapy group

david
discussion group alex discussion

juliet

alex
yeah he had one too many of thise urges you of all people 
should know that

alex leans close to juliet juliet brakes abruptly and as alex 
flies forward elbows him in the chest

of sordid ugly sexual liason why id be proud of that sort of 
thing

the gloom

int stairwell evening

david ascends the stairs to the flat

int living room evening

alex sits in an armchair facing out of the window juliet stands 
facing into the room david the last home appears in the 
doorway

the corpse as before

int accountants office day

david sits at his desk looking across the office

crouched over a large array of other desks young men and women 
in suits are pouring over folders and columned books no one is 
speaking except in muted tones on the telephones

david watches them he looks to his left and to his right on 
either side young men like him are toiling over accounts he 
turns and looks behind him where another array of accountants 
sit

he turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously 
given he looks at the columns of records of profit with a large 
total at the bottom

when david looks up he sees juliet seated beside his desk she 
smiles and directs his gaze with her own to the surrounding 
scene

int hugos room evening

the body in silhouette

david
voiceover
ok lets do it

int diy store day

inside a large brightly lit diy store with muzak playing in the 
background we start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked 
with potentially vicious tools

alex
voiceover
all right now listen we have to dispose of the body in such a 
way as to make it unidentifiable so that even if it is found 
then its never anything more than an unknown corpse burning 
dumping at sea and straightforward burial are all flawed either 
by fingerprints or more commonly by dental records this i 
have learned now what i suggest is that we bury him out in the 
forest but first of all we remove his hands and his feet which 
we incinerate and his teeth which we just remove its as 
simple as that

as the tracking shot ends we see davids head and shoulders as 
he looks at something off picture suddenly a springloaded 
screwdriver appears and is fired so that the tip stops a few 
millimeters from his face david winces as we see that alex is 
holding it

alex
continued
i always wondered what these were for

alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across 
the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer

alex
continued
now this is what we need and this 

alex hands the tools to david who looks at them with disgust 
alex walks on

alex
continued
now what else 
david
i dont know

alex
a spade we need a spade  i wish you would concentrate  we 
need a spade if were going to dig a pit

david
so whos going to do it

alex
dig the pit i dont know

david
no not that

alex
then what whos going to do what

david

alex turns away in disgust

on the floor

is half slid and half thrown inside the door is closed and in 
the dark interior the outline of the plastic lump is just 
visible thanks to a streetlight one of the doors opens again 
and david throws a bag of tools in he then closes and locks the 
door

int van night

in front of the van david is climbing into the passenger side 
juliet and alex are already in with the latter at the wheel

switched off but the light remains on the trio descend from the 
van

and juliet stand together alex is showing them two long stems of 
grass and one short one he encloses them in his fist and holds 
them out

alex

alex holds his hand out towards juliet who takes the tip of one 
of the stems it is one of the larger ones

reaches out and takes one of the tips it is the short straw

david

ext forest night

deeper in the forest with the headlamps still casting a little 
light throught the trees we see davids head and shoulders his 
right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a 
vicious sawing noise the sawing stops as he evidently finished 
with one extremity he shuffles back and starts sawing at 
another

alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug he 
observes david impassively the sawing stops again

david
finished

alex
but not quite

david
is that going to be deep enough

alex bends down to pick up the hammer which he holds out towards 
david

alex
dont you worry about that

david
is this necessary

alex
yes now come on all or nothing

most reluctantly david takes the hammer and looks at alex who 
gestures as if to say on you go with revulsion on his face 
he raises the hammer above his head

int davids room day

davids face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his 
pillow

he lies fully clothed on his bed looking up at the ceiling 
there is a knock at the door then juliet walks in

juliet

david
without looking at juliet
oh yes im fine thanks just fine

eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer newspapers lie 
scattered at his feet

int loft day

the loft above the flat in darkness but the trapdoor is opened 
letting in a pool of light

int hall day

david is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft 
beneath him is a stepladder juliet stands halfway up the 
ladder while alex stands on the floor beside it as david enters 
the loft alex hands up the bag of money to juliet who passes it 
on up to david

juliet

alex
yeah we dont want another stiff on our hands dont fall 
through the ceiling ok is he listening to me

juliet

alex
to himself
i dont know why we couldnt stuff it in a mattress or put it 
under the floor like any normal human being we could have hid it 
in the fridge

int loft day

david moves on into the dark cavernous loft edging his way 
across beams and pipes there are no skylights

he stops and leans against some structure the water tank he 
strains to see in the darkness

suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water 
empties from the water tank david is startled and steps forward 
tripping he reaches out as he falls striking a light switch 
briefly the loft is illuminated david blinking as he lies across 
some beams the large cavernous area the pipes the water tank 
the bag of money lying between two rafters and then the old 
brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out

david scrambles towards the trapdoor

int hugos room day

now clean and empty with no trace of recent habitation

int hospital day

in a basement corridor in the hospital pipes run along the 
ceiling above a fencedoff area is a sign saying for

of these quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues 
past

int suburban lockup garage night

in the garage there is a car gardening equipment several sacks 
of fertilizer and a trunkstyle deep freeze on the lid of which 
sit andy and tim tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to 
andy who declines

they slide off the deep freeze and open it

inside the freezer there is a man naked and bound with cord 
they lift him up he is very cold and weak

the man begins to whisper inaudibly andy moves his head so that 
he can hear the whisper he listens then nods approvingly

they push him down again and close the lid andy holds the lid 
while tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top

int charity ball night

alex david and juliet are attending a charity ball everyone is 
dressed very smartly in ball gowns and black ties with the 
addition of a significant number of kilts

neither alex nor david wears a kilt the trio seem to know a 
number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak 
to them

a middleaged podgy mustachioed master of ceremonies is 
standing on a platform in front of the band making a speech to 
the diners who are still sat at their tables

mc
ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention please first of 
all may i thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting 
our appeal to raise funds for the sick childrens unit

there is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out we move to 
the table where alex david and juliet are seated alex leans 
across to juliet

alex
you didnt tell me that this was for children i hate children 
id raise money to have the little fuckers put down

some other guests around the table cast critical glances at alex

juliet
sshh

alex
i want my money back excuse me

alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his 
fingers then indicates another bottle of champagne that already 
ists in front of him

mc
for all too often theres a complacency out of sight out of 
mind let someone else bother about these things

alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own juliet nudges 
him viciously

mc
continued
but just before the dancing id like to say a special thankyou 
to a few of the people whove worked so very hard to make this 
occassion happen

the mcs drone continues in the background while conversation 
continues back at the table

david

alex

mc

int dance floor night

the dance floor a few minutes later it is packed and rather 
chaotic sweaty dishevelled dancers sling one another around 
with the thud of flesh against flesh toes are stood on and 
jackets discarded

juliet dances with alex who plunges in with the maximum of 
violence eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among 
the other dancers

he starts to get up then rests his head back against the floor

david has not been dancing instead he remains at their table and 
at the bar drinking steadily and watching the other two

int table night

back at the table while most people are still on the dnace 
floor the trio sit drinking and alex smokes a cigar

out to point knocking over davids glass and completely losing 
interest

from some distance away cameron becomes aware of alex and 
cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from 
the table

cameron

alex

alex falls forward laughing and the other two also laugh as 
cameron walks away humiliated again

alex
continued

complete his departure juliet restrains david with a touch as 
they watch him go

int toilets night

the gents toilet brightlylit and whitetiled alex walk in and 
goes into a cubicle and closes the door we hear him whistling 
and laughing as he passes urine he keeps muttering binbag to 
himself then he flushes the toilet and opens the door as he 
does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone 
waiting for him

alex
cameron what a surprise

as alex is speaking camerons fist flies forward hitting him in 
the face and sending him flying backwards cameron enters the 
cubicle and closes the door behind him

int hall morning

the kitchen then walks to the door and opens it

energy with every sound the telephone begins to ring juliet 
looks at alex expectantly but he does not move eventually she 
gets up and answers it

int flat day

there follows a video depicting the results of alexs and 
juliets spending spree it opens with alex seated at the kitchen 
table talking to the camera absolutely deadpan

alex
hello its been a struggle but now the days of worry are over 
the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden 
sunrise and at last at long last nothing will ever be the same 
again

alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play 
button on a tape recorder the music begins

fast cuts follow occasionally interrupted by outoffocus shots 
of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is 
switched on and off

alex wearing several different suits outfits and silk pyjamas

juliet wearing several different outfits

both of them posing with small objets dart

the expensive watch on alexs wrist

juliets jewellery

juliet takes a picture of alex with a polaroid camera

himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie

alex
continued

you know im so happy i could die

darkness tv turned off

int living room day

from out in the hall the phone starts to ring nobody moves

int davids room night

david lies awake in his bed

int a flat hallway night

hearing the noise david sits up in bed then gets out reaching 
for his clothes

int stairwell night

david looks down the stairwell other neighbours in nightclothes 
or hurriedly dressed are standing at the open door of the flat 
below david descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of 
the other flat where the occupant an elderly woman lies 
groaning on the floor

a hand on davids shoulder pushes him out of the way and two 
uniformed policemen walk past followed by an ambulance man 
carrying a stretcher

david
did they take anything did they take anything

no one acknowledges his question or answers it

the ambulance men emerge carrying the woman her face bruised and 
cut everyone else begins to melt away

int stairwell night

david stands alone on the darkened stairwell

int davids room night

david lies awake in his bed

int door of the flat day

someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are 
two new security chains on the inside the door is forced against 
the chains with no success and alex calls from the other side

alex
what is this what is going on david

david approaches the door

david

david closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see alex 
grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the 
door again alex walks in

alex

david

darkness

rafters he puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag 
which he ties tightly with string

int hall day

the hall is empty and the flat is silent we see the trapdoor

int loft evening

david sits in the darkness a crack of light penetrates beside 
the trapdoor

int kitchen night

alex and juliet sit at the table eating in silence

the doorbell rings alex and juliet look at one another

alex
expecting anyone

juliet
no

alex
oh

alex resumes eating

juliet
arent you going to answer it

alex
well im not expecting anyone either

juliet glares at him

int hall night

alex approaches the door and is about to open it at the last 
moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole

int through the spyhole night

tim and andy stand outside the door

int hall night

alex slightly puzzled fixes the security chains before opening 
the door as soon as he opens it the door is kicked wide open as 
the security chains break off tim and andy enter the flat

in a whirlwind of force they drag and shove alex and juliet into 
the living room and bind them up with cord there are no words 
apart from slightly muffled cries

at the end of this andy stands in front of alex holding a 
crowbar swiftly and without warning he cracks it across alexs 
shins then andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into 
alexs mouth for a moment he does nothing then just as slowly 
again he takes the crowbar out

alex
its in the loft

int hall night

the trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can 
just be heard although not by anyone in the flat

int hall night

tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor

int loft night

it is completely dark in the loft but as the trapdoor opens a 
shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool 
around the opening

int loft night

away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform 
darkness but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness it is 
david he stands perfectly still

there is a hammer in his right hand

int loft night

tims head appears through the trapdoor cautiously he lifts 
himself through and balances on the beams

int hall night

the hall is empty but we can see the open trapdoor suddenly 
there is a single thud as might be caused by a body landing 
heavily on and across some beams in the loft

int loft night

david stands motionless in the dark exactly as before

int living room night

andy has heard the single thud he strains to hear anything else 
but does not slowly he backs away to the door of the living 
room keeping the crowbar trained on alex as he does so he looks 
back and up towards the trapdoor

int loft night

once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor 
andy emerges into the front of this crowbar in hand peering 
into the darkness carefully he stands up and moves out of the 
light and steps across the beams his foot strikes something and 
he looks down tims body lies spreadeagled beneath him he 
looks up to one side of him is the brass light switch andy 
lifts his arm reaches towards it and switches it on sparks pour 
out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a 
second long enough for andy to see davids face is only 
centimetres from his own

int hall night

alex and juliet are bound together as before there is a loud 
thud from the ceiling following by a few heavy steps then 
andys body falls headfirst through the trapdoor straight down 
to the floor below landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his 
head hanging back looking towards alex and juliet andy takes 
one agonal breath and dies blood trickles from the side of his 
mouth

tims body lands on andy

david drops himself from the hatch to the floor

david takes a large knife from a wooden block

back in the hall he kneels holding the knife beside tim 
noticing something at the top of tims neck he uses the knife to 
lift away tims tshirt a tattoo covers tims neck david looks 
at it then stands up

he walks through to the living room where alex and juliet still 
bound watch him approach he looks at them for a moment then 
extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place

ext forest night

in a scene similar to the dismemberment of hugo we see davids 
shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen he stops 
and reaches out for the hammer picks it up and raises it above 
his head

ext road dawn

the van is silhouetted against a rising sun

int back of the van dawn

the tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van

him david seems quite at ease

a thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition juliet observes 
them

int loft day

david sits still in the darkness

int newspaper office day

alex sits at his desk fidgeting about to write something but 
unable to start on the screen of his word processor is a page 
mockup with the headline cats eat pensioner as the telephone 
on his desk rings he is startled then reaches out slowly lifts 
it fractionally and replaces it

above

int living room night

alex sits watching the wicker man on televison he can hear the 
footsteps above he turns the sound up on the television so that 
he cannot hear them but he keeps looking up at the ceiling as 
though he expects to hear them or see somwthing

eventually he turns the sound back down and after a moments 
silence the footsteps start again back and forth then stop

alex looks up

without warning there is the sound of an electric drill

the blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then 
withdrawn alex is shocked other drill holes appear

int various ceilings night

holes are drilled in the ceilings

int loft night

rods of light penetrate up from the holes interrupting but not 
obliterating the darknes david sits back pleased with his work

several feet apart

david
so i just heard her cries for help and all that and when i went 
downstairs there were already those other people there so i just 
stood around really waiting  you know how people do  and 
then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs and 
thats about all i think i didnt actually see anything useful 
i dont think

mccall
did you hear anything before he cries

david
no not that i recall i was asleep

mccall
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the 
last few days

david
no nothing sorry

mccall
well if you do youll let us know

david
of course

mccall
and the other three people on the flat did they hear anything

david
there are only two other people in the flat 

mccall consults a notebook

mccall
two

david
who said there were four

mccall
we understood there were four people living here not always of 
course but now four

david
no three who said there were four

mccall
how strange and how unsatisfactory to have misleading 
information only three people here youre sure

david
yes absolutely

mccall
take a note of that mitchell only three rather than four 
write it down you can use numbers or words i have no 
preference which are you using

mitchell

mccall

tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade

david

mccall
i doubt it and these two other people did they hear anything

david
no they were asleep they didnt even wake up

mccall
yes why do you think you woke and they didnt

david
i dont know maybe im a light sleeper

uncomfortably david realizes that mitchell has noted down even 
this last trivial remark in a painful longhand and has 
underlined a short segment of it

int hall night

in the hallway of the flat mitchell stands at the open main door 
waiting to leave mccall is kneeling at the door to hugos room 
tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock david looks 
on

mccall
loks like you had a breakin up here as well

david
someone lost the key

mccall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall 
illuminates hugos room

mccall
is this where no one stays

david
yeah thats right thats it

david notices that mitchell is writing this down

int garden at front of the flat night

alex

alex

youll tell them everything

alex tsands at the top of the ladder holding the key in the 
trapdoor lock

alex

lock and im going to come up and whats important is that you 
remain calm

there is one light on juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder 
having opened the trapdoor alex stops and listens but there is 
no sound above his own breathing juliet throws up a torch which 
he catches he switches it on it shines then goes out and he 
knocks it against the ladder making it work again slowly he 
pushes the trapdoor open

int loft night

the trapdoor opens below it alex crouches on the ladder 
expecting attack at any moment he looks back down to juliet who 
returns his gaze then he slowly raises himself into the loft

he turns around quickly darting the torchlight around into 
corners and squinting in the darkness but he sees nothing

the torch goes out cursing he knocks it against a beam and it 
shines again

slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the 
loft still turning around and worried about what might be behind 
him

int hall night

juliet stands waiting braced for sounds of conflict

danger in one corner he notices davids pile of leftpossessions 
and the mat on which he has been sleeping he moves towards it

alex stands in davids corner with another sweep of the torch he 
can still see nothing he calls to juliet

a closeup of juliets face just as davids hand slams across 
her mouth gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on 
the back of her head davids mouth is right up against her ear 
as he spits a warning into it

over and lifts the lid his face breaks into a smile as he 
realizes what it holds he dips an arm into the tank raises the 
yellow bag then quickly lowers it again alex steps back from 
the water tank

int hall night

alex appears at the top of the ladder without looking he slides 
down as quickly as he can calling out as he does so

alex reaches the base of the ladder he turns around to find 
himself facing the blade of the batteryoperated drill held by 
david juliet stands off to one side

centre of alexs forehead and presses the trigger to turn the 
blade slowly as he speaks

burials there are a few policemen uniformed and plainclothes 
and a small knot of journalists kept at bay by plastic tape 
draped from tree to tree mounds of earth mark the site of the 
exhumations

alex walks past the other journalists into the woods he looks 
back towards the sight then turns to look in the opposite 
direction he finds himself at the edge of a golf course from 
the green to the graves is hardly any distance

discussion mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches alexs eye

bedside table is the polaroid photograph of alex propped up 
against a tumbler juliet reaches out and turns it away before

several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs alex 
sits at the back near the halfopen door at the other end 
three police officers face them they are a mediumranking 
uniformed officer and to one side of him mitchell and then 
mccall both of whom sit in silence

uniformed officer
all right ladies and gentlemen the releasable and printworthy 
facts of the day so far are as follows late yesterdat afternoon 
forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a 
grave which appeared to have been recently dug further 
excavation on our part has revealed two similar deeper graves 
again containing human remains

alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial 
site now enclosed in a plastic tent he continues to stare at 
it

while alex is looking the sound of laughter and uniformed 
officers subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory 
of a sound in alexs head it is the noise of the saw going back 
and forth across the victims limbs

uniformed officer
continued
as and when the corpses are removed we will endeavour to 
ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial as well as 
identification which will of course be passed on to you after 
informing where possible the next of kin

alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van

ext forest day

alex walks away from the incident room towards his car he breaks 
into a run for a few paces

the noise of the sawing continues

as he reaches his car alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys 
he is sweating and trembling he drops his keys as he bends down 
to pick them up his foot slips on the wet grass he falls to his 
knees his forehead banging against the car door he kneels for a 
moment gripping the keys his head resting against the door

the noise of the sawing stops

from behind the arm of a police constable reaches out and his 
hand rests on alexs shoulder
