	a darkness where even outlines are not discernible there is
	a dim point of light coming from a dot on the hifi which is
	playing the beach boys when we could say good night and
	still stay together wouldnt it be niiiice we could be
	married then we could be happy wouldnt it be niiiiice
	
	through it there has been the sound of banging distinct and
	rhythmic it grows louder as the music ends there are also
	whimpering sounds from a woman

	               felicias voice
	     i can it makes me nervous
	
	it continues to bang until felicia screams over the banging
	of the headboard she follows the scream with a few yelps
	silence now the sound of the phone ringing

	               lester
	     well george i invest for a lot of
	     people i make a lot of money for
	     them more than they could do for

	               jackie
	          almost immediately on the

	emotional
	
	               jackie
	     steve slutes and hes not a boy
	          a touch bitter

	     never let me see anybody i cant

	               lester contd
	          very positive
	     now listen jackie im not jealous
	     of anybody i just cant afford to

	     actor what do you think im going
	     to tell him im screwing lester
	     karpf
	
	               lester

	               jackie
	     thats not very logical lester
	
	int office  george and secretary
	
	picking up the tail end of this
	
	               secretary
	     he thinks the room is soundproofed
	     dont tell him its not
	
	               george
	     how come
	
	               secretary

	     crew back again and they can never
	     do anything right
	
	int lesters office
	
	               lester
	          trying to think of why
	     its very logical its the most
	     logical thing in the world you
	     wouldnt feel this confined if we
	     could go out with people and have
	     dinner and a little conversation
	     and so forth
	
	               jackie
	     really how about starting with
	     tonight
	
	by her tone jackie indicates shes been saying all of this
	for months lester repeating it like its just occurred to
	him genuinely upsets her shes near tears and shes not the
	kind of girl who cries easily lesters sensitive to it
	
	               lester
	     sweetheart i know its rough but
	     at this point  my business
	     involves handling money for some
	     very touchy people politics and so
	     on felicias at a very difficult
	     period in her life any divorce
	     and settlement and so forth my
	     finances would have to be looked
	     into
	
	jackie knows what hes talking about
	
	               jackie
	          quietly
	     you and your touchy investors
	
	               lester
	          finally

	there is a moment where jackie is trying to decide whether
	shell let george actually cut her hair
	
	               jackie
	          then

	george stops and takes off his shirt hes wearing a purple t
	shirt underneath he goes back to cutting jackies getting
	more and more edgy partly because of georges proximity and
	partly because of her concern over what hes doing george on
	the other hand is now less tentative more focused on the job
	at hand
	
	               jackie
	          finally

	suddenly theres a rumble in the room and east has stopped
	chanting several men have stepped to the center of the room
	one of them in a slate suit raising both hands
	
	               det younger

	     you to exit through the door here
	     on my left down the steps into
	     the street please
	
	there are whisperings and rumblings of a bomb and
	rejoinders to the effect that its a hoax nevertheless the
	exodus begins and grows to bedlam waiters who had been
	fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing
	them down the stairs even going over them to make the
	entrance
	
	outside
	
	the emergency doesnt keep autograph hounds from inhibiting
	the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that
	flows onto the street jill and johnny pope are caught up in
	the swirl of the crowd pope temporarily loses jill he looks
	around jill taps him on the shoulder
	
	               jill
	      here i am now what
	
	pope turns
	
	               pope
	     well  as i see it weve got two
	     choices we can hang around here
	     and wait for the bomb to go off or
	     we can go to my party

	outside sammys  night
	
	theres a long rolling lawn the lights are soft coming from
	the living room the music more muted jackie nevertheless
	is breathing rather heavily from the dancing george is
	looking at her intently too intently for her not to notice
	she appears not to notice
	
	               george

	               jackie
	     the lawn  it looks like it goes

	               twin two

	and shes not there only a wisp of her cigarette smoke hangs
	in the air and then it disappears
	
	george looks surprised and disappointed
	
	int kitchen
	
	several tall stringy types are eating out of the
	refrigerator with a couple of dogs eagerly watching others
	are eating hash cakes off the formica counter
	
	red dog sits in a corner sipping wine out of a measuring
	cup he smiles and looks up to jackie who has her arm on his
	shoulder strobe lights from an adjacent room can be seen
	periodically

	george a little hastily moves through the kitchen spotting
	jackie hes nearly upended by a couple tall man and woman
	at the refrigerator they grab him and kiss him and he
	shakes through them moving to jackie
	
	               george

	and he laughs george silently takes jackies hand and they
	move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds
	in the rear of the house
	
	ext bistro parking lot  johnny pope
	
	the crowd has thinned out to a trickle but popes red
	porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other

	pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to
	move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone
	else

	lighthearted about it jill gets into the front
	
	int porsche
	
	the door on the drivers side is still open and lesters feet
	are poked out it his head is pushing on the canvas top
	
	               lester
	     see nothin to it
	
	jill turns and smiles but its a mistake since lesters
	upper body is almost leaning on her as it is lester puts his
	hand behind jills head forcing her to hold the position
	almost nose to nose with lester

	arm in arm and half move half throw themselves to another
	end of the jacuzzi
	
	jackie smiles she stretches yawns
	
	               jackie

	jackie laughs the twins have gotten onto some sort of
	splashing contest with the boys water hits george and
	jackie theyre hit again they shrug george rises takes
	jackies hand they walk on around the pool beside and along
	a maze of hedgerows
	
	ext sammys  through porsche window
	
	as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier
	and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property
	
	               lester
	     whose place is this
	
	int sammys foyer
	
	by the open staircase pope is greeting sammy introducing
	jill sammys a tall jesus figure with an indian shirt that
	goes to the knees on his levis
	
	               sammy
	     sure i know jill
	
	lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still
	sitting on the staircase nursing her baby she looks up
	smiles at lester who manages a nod back doesnt take his
	eyes off the sight
	
	               pope
	          noticing
	      the bars in there les
	
	               les
	          embarrassed
	      oh fine
	
	he strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through
	the open foyer
	
	at the bar
	
	where jill and george were earlier lesters ordered a drink
	the huge black in the afro offers him a toke lester stares
	at it dumbly
	
	               lester
	          a little lamely
	          indicating drink
	      im
	
	he takes his drink and half toasts the black he stops and
	his eyes pan the room lester is virtually the only person on
	his feet everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
	sofas side by side head to feet barely talking barely
	moving in fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
	from the joints
	
	int living room  lester
	
	lester shakes his head as if to clear it he takes a drink
	and almost on cue the acid rock music hits and the strobe
	lights go on
	
	lester is momentarily alarmed as if it had something to do
	with his drink he manages to stagger out of the strobe light
	effect hangs onto a railing in the next room
	
	int kitchen  jill red dog and pope
	
	jill stands over red dog who hasnt moved an inch his
	measuring cup of wine still half filled

	     jill scraves is a 
	
	he points toward the kitchen door where lester looks like
	hes about to enter
	
	pope takes jill and they move out the back door in the
	direction of the rear grounds that jackie and george had
	taken earlier
	
	lester
	
	peers into the kitchen its filled mostly with unkempt
	beards he decides against it turns up a small staircase and
	continues up it until he finds himself in a den
	
	several people are seated on the floor quietly smoking and
	watching television they seem a shade better dressed than
	those in the kitchen
	
	lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and
	partially blocked by someone sitting directly in front of
	it he kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a
	pipe
	
	               lester
	          whispering
	      hows it going
	
	int den
	
	               man with pipe
	          quietly
	      just fine
	
	               lester
	          squinting to see

	          taking a good look at
	          lester then

	lester looks at the screen sally handled by bare arms is
	being placed on a foam rubber cushion she laughs
	
	               lester
	          dumbly
	      sally
	
	               man with pipe
	          pointing with his pipe
	          stem to a girl by

	          watching the set
	      sally
	
	lester looks at sally she looks at lester nods turns back
	to screen to watch herself lester turns from sally to see a
	television camera and the foam rubber mattress now
	abandoned lester shakes his head
	
	outside on grounds with jill and johnny pope
	
	theyre walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them
	to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the
	pool one of the twins is still in the jacuzzi

	turns toward it then back to pope still making up her mind
	angle shifts slightly to hold on light from window
	
	int poolhouse  george and jackie
	
	george has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge hes
	looking at jackie closes the refrigerator lamely it opens
	again and he closes it again

	george pops the tops of the cans hands one to jackie
	neither one of them drink theyre staring steadily at each
	other their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
	court lights which someone has turned on
	
	               george
	          finally
	      were kidding ourselves
	
	               jackie
	          staring right back

	               george

	     years old and mary told me i was

	               george

	     when shes fifty years old i cant
	     imagine not being with you
	
	george moves to her jackie is waiting for him they kiss it
	is long and lingering and deliberate george breaks away and
	goes to the poolhouse door theres no lock only an eye
	latch on the screen door he latches it tests it it gives
	slightly nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
	jackie who stands waiting
	
	               jackie
	      but what about her i dont want
	     to hurt jill
	
	george takes the coke out of her hand she lets him
	
	lester
	
	walks back in the foyer holding a drink swaying the strobe
	lights are going again in the living room
	
	suddenly he sees a girl at least half nude her huge painted
	lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights the
	vision disturbs him greatly
	
	he carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
	near her she seems to move he moves after her through the
	lights down the length of the room going as quickly as
	prudence allows finally when they reach the end of the
	living room shes disappeared then he looks out and sees her
	poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
	path that leads down to the pool
	
	he lunges toward the vision and bounces off a sliding glass
	door
	
	jill and johnny pope
	
	have made it through the entrance and popes porsche is in
	sight jill suddenly stops and looks at pope
	
	               pope
	     whats wrong
	
	               jill
	     we cant really leave that poor man
	     here alone
	
	               pope
	      hell never know the difference
	
	jill is clearly thinking about something else besides lester
	
	               jill
	      still  at least we should tell
	     him were going cmon
	
	               pope
	          going along with it
	          protesting
	     im telling you he wont know the
	     difference
	
	by the pool  lester
	
	now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
	that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move every step
	is a possible disaster
	
	               twin
	          from jacuzzi
	     hey
	
	lester looks down sees one of the twins her arm is
	outstretched her breasts dripping water visible through the
	shrubbery spotlights shes holding a joint
	
	               twin contd
	      its getting soggy
	
	lester takes it
	
	               the guy with her
	      just put it on the bench over
	     there and come on in
	
	               lester
	      in there
	
	               the guy
	     sure
	
	lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
	over to the bench he puts the joint down
	
	stares at it he looks up and theres the other twin standing
	beside him nude with her breasts visible through the towel
	loosely flung over her shoulders
	
	               twin
	          meaning joint
	     could i have that
	
	lester silently hands it to her stares at the pool and the
	other twin isnt there he looks back and the one who had
	taken the joint is gone he looks back to the pool and the
	other twin surfaces with the force of flipper beside the guy
	in the pool
	
	lester stares then he sighs and pulls off his pants almost
	falling down as he does
	
	carrying them he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi
	
	               lester
	     say 
	
	               the guy
	      what is it now man
	
	               lester
	     do you know where i can find a
	     towel
	
	               the guy
	      the poolhouse
	
	holding his trousers his tux shirt hanging half down over
	his boxer shorts lester moves on over to the poolhouse he
	tries the door the latch creaks he pulls at it again and
	the latch pops open he starts to open the door then hears
	the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
	love making the girl is quite carried away
	
	lester hesitates he listens as her sighs interspersed with
	fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity he thinks
	better of it he takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
	closes the screen door
	
	he starts to walk away then notices the window on the side
	he cant resist he moves to it he cant see anything he
	moves closer the dim dark but classical outline of a man
	mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
	can be seen lester watches the sounds are not as loud from
	this angle but gradually they can be heard as the womans
	cries grow louder lester is glued to the window
	
	               jills voice
	      there you are les les  les 
	     les were leaving
	
	the angle has broadened to show lester holding his pants not
	taking his face away from the window jill and johnny pope
	stand beside him
	
	               lester
	     shhh 
	          with genuine awe
	      now thats what i call fucking
	
	pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window
	
	as he does a light begins to flood the room it is the
	refrigerator door slowly opening due in part to the rhythmic
	impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
	table to another end table and to the refrigerator
	
	it opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
	george and jackie
	
	lester
	
	who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
	the image hits him his face freezes it is harsh and
	determined he turns slowly away from the window and walks
	past jill without looking at her
	
	               jill
	      what 
	
	she turns to the window and sees george and jackie herself
	
	               jill contd
	          watching
	     oh my god oh no oh no oh no
	
	she turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
	through the window shattering the glass everywhere
	
	               jill contd
	          screaming
	     you son of a bitch you bastard
	
	with george and jackie
	
	george has leapt up
	
	               george
	     honey whereve you been weve
	     been looking everywhere for you
	
	jackie doesnt move only stares wideeyed through the broken
	window at the screaming jill
	
	               jackie
	          softly
	     oh god
	
	an ashtray is hurled into the room smashing against the
	wall and jill can be seen now storming off with pope
	
	george with one leg in his pants rushes over to a far
	window pulls it open
	
	               george
	     jill jill jill goddammit

	          he grabs his shirt
	      wait here honey 
	
	he runs out of the door beside the pool past the jacuzzi
	and into the maze of hedgerows the twins stand motionless
	side by side in the water

	     george

	george charges out the door in time to see the red porsches

	purrs off into the night
	
	george turns and runs back into the house and through the
	strobelighting living room
	
	at the poolhouse

	into view
	
	finally she pulls up while lester is pacing back and forth

	for a moment the discussion looks like jackie is giving
	lester directions she glances uneasily up toward george
	
	george is watching them
	
	he sees that lester and jackie have their backs to him his
	arm around her shoulder hers around his waist theyre going
	through the front door
