october 1980

        the rocky horror picture show featured an ordinary
        couple brad and janet innocent victims of a flat
        tyre and a wet night caught in a bizarre horror
        movie nightmare

        shock treatment features brad and janet innocent
        members of a live tv audience drawn into a new
        and equally bizarre nightmare of soap operas
        game shows and media manipulation  the madness
        accelerates until they dont know where television
 ends and reality begins

                then just wringing your heart out
                over someething that keeps on going wrong

                i hope that youll know just what to say
                but if it should mean that the party is over

                                oliver
                        quoting kubla khan
                a stately pleasure home indeed

                                betty
                oh i adore coleridge taylor  as
                a matter of fact

betty rummages in handbag and produces battered volume of
poems  she starts to quote
the rhyme of the ancient mariner

                                betty
                it is an ancient mariner
                and he stoppeth one of three
                by the long grey beard and glittereing eye
                now wherefore stoppst thou me

oliver looks a little uneasy
