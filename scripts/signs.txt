               graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads towards 
               the house

                                     graham

               voice

                                     graham

                         the crops like that the kids were 
                         confused by it it would take the 
                         strangeness away if we knew it was

               and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor 
               with one of their two german shepherds there is a large

               becomes louder becoming a moving swirling sound texture

                         nobody move

               everyone becomes frozen standing next to the station wagon 
               three of the doors are open

               in the texture of sound just for a moment we hear something 
               that sounds like

                                     morgan
                         voices did you hear that

               everyone stares at the baby monitor in grahams hand

               he had it as he closed his door graham looks to merrill 
               over the roof of the station wagon

                                     graham
                         its probably picking up another

               the swirling texture sound floats through the air above the 
               station wagon

                                     merrill

               beat graham moves he hands the monitor over the hood 
               merrill reaches for it

               the swirling moving texture becomes loud and filled with 
               unintelligible noises

                                     morgan
                         stop

               graham and merrill freeze  both touching the monitor over 
               the roof of the station wagon

               we hear something that sounds like a voice emerge and then 
               quickly fade away

                                     morgan
                         it doesnt sound like words

               merrill concentrates on the swirling moving texture coming 
               from the baby monitor

               graham looks around at his rapt family

                                     graham

               graham looks at merrill whos now one of them beat

               morgan is the first one to move

                                     morgan
                         dont let go

               he moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper 
               where he begins to climb onto the station wagon

                                     graham
                         morgan

                                     morgan
                         it gets clearer the higher you hold 
                         it

               morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor everso gently 
               out of graham and merrills outstretched hands

                                     graham
                         morgan be careful

                                     merrill
                         i got him

               merrill climbs up over the side and joins morgan on the roof 
               merrill keeps a hand on his nephew morgan raises the monitor 
               above his head

               the red lights on the baby monitor all turn on

               the swirling texture coming from the monitor becomes something 
               more mechanical like the hum of large equipment in the 
               distance

               the voice like sounds are under a crackle but are clearer 
               and louder

               bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood

                                     graham
                         hold on

               graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood he takes 
               hold of bo all four are on the car now

               morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon merrill 
               holds him by the waist

               bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over graham and 
               the windshield graham boosts her up over his head with both 
               hands

                                     graham
                         merrill you got her

               merrill reaches out his free hand bo reaches out to him

               the sound from the monitor suddenly changes

                                     morgan
                         stop

               everyone stops exactly where they are graham holds bo over 
               his head bo reaches out to merrill merrill sits on the 
               roof with one arm out morgan stands with the baby monitor 
               raised high in the air the hess family remains very still 
               on the hood of their station wagon as they listen

               the crackling is gone the voicelike sounds are clear and 
               upfront there are two distinct tones in the mix

                                     morgan
                              soft
                         theres two of them talking

               the voicelike sounds are not words but more like grunts and 
               gurgling like someone drowning the sounds are being created 
               by inhales not exhales a sequence of these sounds in one 
               tone is followed by silence and then the second tone begins 
               another sequence like a conversation

               graham struggles to hold bo up bo struggles to keep her 
               arms out merrill struggles not to turn his face to the 
               incredible sounds above his head

               the tones escalate in volume

               morgans eyes widen as the sequence of sounds becomes shorter 
               and faster the tones become harder angrier the silences 
               almost gone

               the voicelike tones reach a loud feverish pace almost 
               violent and then we hear a click and theyre gone

               beat everyone looks up at the baby monitor the red lights 
               are off only the bland hum of normal static comes from its 
               speaker

                         they hung up

               graham brings bo down into his lap morgan takes a seat next 
               to merrill on the roof the hess family sits like mental 
               patients on the top of their station wagon

                                                                    cut to

               we are at the edge of the crops looking back at the house 
               the lights are on in the kitchen we see graham merrill and 
               the children doing dishes after dinner

               the dog is barking furiously

               our view turns to look at the barn through the crops

               isabelle the remaining german shepherd is tied to a post 
               outside the barn the dog whips back and forth frantically 
               she keeps looking in our direction

               we hear a screen door open we turn to look back at the house 
               graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of dog 
               food and a bowl of water

               we watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog when he 
               gets close graham slows he approaches the dog carefully 
               he places the two bowls close but not too close the dog has 
               no interest in them she keeps barking and glaring in our 
               direction

               graham watches her for a few moments and then turns and 
               looks directly at us from across the yard

               we pull back into the darkness of the crops

                                                                    cut to

               graham stands frozen looking across his yard isabelle the 
               dog turns in desperate circles behind him grahams eyes

               the beam of light falls on the wall of corn crops lining the 
               backyard graham steps right up to them he hesitates and 
               then steps into the field of corn crops

               breathing continues behind him

               graham turns and drops the flashlight at the same time the 
               beam of light turns off when the flashlight hits the ground

               graham is in darkness now he looks in the direction of the 
               breathing but cant see anything his own breathing is fast 
               and loud now

               graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness his hands 
               search over the ground in all directions they finally touch 
               the flashlight graham quickly fumbles with it to find the 
               on button he does

               a beam of light shoots across the ground something powdery 
               white stands five feet away

               it instantly moves into the darkness graham tries to get 
               up he stumbles backwards into the crops hes tangled in 
               crops as he struggles to rise he gets up and starts running

               leaves and stalks slap him from all directions he panics 
               he doesnt know where he is there is something coming behind 
               him

               graham makes a sudden right turn he puts his hands in front 
               of him to protect his face and eyes hes running as fast as 
               he can he hears stalks of corn breaking behind him

               another sudden turn this time left graham emerges into his 
               backyard

               graham keeps running across the yard isabelle barks 
               frantically

               when graham reaches the porch stairs he stops and turns

               there is no one behind him the wall of crops fifty feet 
               away sway in the gentle night breeze

               graham gains control of his breathing he turns and walks to 
               the screen door slowing his breathing down with each step

                                                                    cut to

               baseball bat mounted above the fireplace merrill doesnt 
               notice him either

               a seat his breathing is a slow controlled pant he runs one 
               shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks 
               his kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind

                              whispers
                         what does it matter then

               the two of them turn back to the silent screen of the 
               television its a long beat before graham speaks

                                     graham
                              whispers
                         do you know what colleens last words 
                         were before they killed her

               beat merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother

                                     graham
                              whispers
                         she said see and then her eyes 
                         glazed a bit and she said tell 
                         merrill to swing away

               merrills mouth opens a bit graham turns and chuckles at 
               his expression

                                     graham
                              whispers
                         do you know why she said that

               merrill nods no

                                     graham
                              whispers
                         because the nerve endings in her 
                         brain were firing as she died and 
                         some random memory of us at one of 
                         your baseball games popped into her

                         merrill were all on our own

               graham turns back to the television beat

               the light of the television flickers on the faces of the two 
               brothers as they sit watching in silence

                                                                    cut to

               alone on the couch alone in the room

               he looks to the television its not there

               graham moves to his feet and look around the room his eyes 
               stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in 
               the family room across the front hall and under a closet 
               door

               graham moves to the door we hear muffled television voices 
               graham opens the closet

               merrill looks up hes seated on a kitchen chair with the 
               television on a rollaway stand crammed in with him

                                     merrill
                         for the kids protection all they

                         am i felt like they were getting 
                         obsessed like you said they should 
                         be playing furry furry rabbit or 
                         tea party or something right

                         developments

                                     graham
                         what time is it

                                     merrill
                         eleven am theyre gone

               beat graham looks at the tv screen theres a daylight shot 
               of mexico city the skies are empty above it

                                     merrill
                         but theyre not really gone we just 
                         cant see them early this morning a 
                         bird flew right at the area where 
                         the lights were hovering last night

               merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen

                                     merrill
                         it stopped dead in the air and fell 
                         straight down

               merrills finger trails to the bottom of the screen

                                     merrill
                         they caught it on tape and theyve 
                         been playing it all morning they 
                         found the bird his head crushed in 
                         when you see the footage it looks 
                         like the bird flew into a wall in 
                         the sky
                              beat
                         they think they have some invisible 
                         shield thing going like an optical 
                         illusion

                                     graham
                         the bird could have had a heart attack 
                         and crushed his head when he fell

                                     merrill
                         already thought of two other birds 
                         did the same thing an hour later 
                         not as dramatic they lived but you 
                         could see they hit something

               graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different 
               eyes

                                     merrill
                         theyre still there hovering in 
                         fact some people think theres more 
                         of them now all over the place 
                         over us even
                              beat
                         and theres a theory about the crop 
                         circles now they think it could be 
                         some kind of landmark visual mapping 
                         system  so they can navigate 
                         coordinate makes sense doesnt it

                                                                    cut to

               we are inside grahams bedroom facing his bathroom door 
               which is closed the same sunfaded outline of where a large 
               cross used to hang is stained on the wall next to the door

               graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair  
               he towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window

               we look out the same window we looked out at the very 
               beginning

               the backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym a 
               single tree throws shade onto a picnic table the back of 
               the yard is lined by corn crops golden and brown six feet 
               high

               the crops go on well beyond our view graham stares at them 
               quietly watching

               beat the sound of whispering draws his attention from the 
               window

               he listens closely his children are whispering in the next 
               room

                                                                    cut to

               graham walks into the hall and looks in their room

               morgan and bo are seated on the edge of their bed they have 
               tin foil wrapped around their heads like a helmet graham 
               stares at his children

                                     morgan
                         so the aliens cant read our minds

                                     graham
                         oh

                         book

               morgan holds up the book he bought from nathans bookstore

               graham enters the room the children make space for him on 
               the bed he takes a seat between them morgan puts the book 
               on his fathers lap

                                     morgan
                         it says theyre probably very small  
                         like my height  because as their 
                         brains developed there was no use 
                         for physical development it says 
                         theyre probably vegetarians because 
                         they would have realized the benefits 
                         of such a diet

                                     graham
                         that means theyre unemployed

               morgan closes the book

               beat graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a tone

                                     morgan
                         he says there are two reasons why 
                         extraterrestrials would visit us

                                     morgan
                         to make contact in the spirit of 
                         exploration and furthering the 
                         knowledge of the universe

               graham looks at an illustration of a small bulbous headed 
               figure shaking hands with a bearded human

                                     morgan
                         or the other reason theyre 
                         hostile theyve used up the resources 
                         on their planet and are looking to 
                         harvest our planet next

               morgan turns the page there is a picture of a house a space 
               ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at it 
               beat

                                     graham
                         looks a little like our house doesnt

               bodies lying dead on the front lawn two are children

               the phone rings

               the children scream and cling to their father their screams 
               die down the phone rings again graham gets up he closes 
               the book

                         thats enough from dr bimboo for 
                         now everybody in this house needs 
                         to calm down and eat some fruit or

                         news bureau there and satellited to 
                         us a few minutes ago all initial 
                         opinions are this is genuine

               the television anchor appears flustered

                                     tv anchor
                         what you are about to see may disturb 
                         you

               merrill sits up in his chair

               the picture of the anchorman is replaced by a handheld video 
               image on the tv screen the image is of a family room where 
               a bunch of children in dress clothes crowd around a sliding 
               glass window

               the children are speaking portuguese excitedly they look at 
               the camera and point to the outside through the glass doors

               the handheld image moves over their shoulders to look out 
               through the glass into a cramped backyard there is a 
               rectangular table with party decorations and an untouched 
               birthday cake on it colorful balloons float around the 
               backyard there is no one outside

               the images pans around the dense foliage that forms a wall 
               around the yard the image zooms and searches in the darkness 
               of the branches

               the chair in the closet creaks as merrill leans forward a 
               little towards the television screen

               we hear a burst of portuguese the image pans away from the 
               glass doors back into the home we look down a narrow hall 
               to the kitchen a boy with a birthday hat is seated on the 
               kitchen counter pointing frantically out the kitchen window 
               he yells in portuguese

               the crowd of children around the glass doors start rushing 
               into the kitchen they are joined by a few adults the image 
               follows them in

               the kitchen window is blocked by heads when we first arrive

                                     merrill
                         move children vamonos

               the image finds an opening over the shoulder of the boy with 
               the birthday hat and another child

               we are now looking out the kitchen window we see a narrow 
               alley only a few feet wide created by a stone wall and a 
               small garage building on the other side of the wall is dense 
               foliage the wall ends a few feet after the garage building

               we hear the childs voice very close to us speaking in 
               portuguese the camera pans just a little as the face of the 
               little birthday boy fills the screen he talks excitedly 
               directly at us and at someone behind the image

                                     boy with hat
                         esta atras da garagem esta atras de 
                         ai is behind

               the boy gestures to the garage building the image settles 
               back on the window we stare at the narrow alley the image 
               zooms a bit searches the edge of the garage building the 
               image starts widening out

               and then we see it

               the kitchen erupts with childrens screams as a large non
               human figure moves from the garage building to behind the 
               wall its out of sight in less than a second

               merrill is frozen like a statue his mouth is open a little 
               the closet fills with the pandemonia of the kitchen on the 
               video

               the video image on the news pauses beat we see it rewind 
               we see the figure zip back behind the garage in a flicker  
               the video stops plays again

               the image zooms a bit searches the edge of the garage 
               building starts to widen out the kitchen starts to fill 
               with screams as the figure appears the image freezes

               the news has paused the videotape on the exact moment the 
               nonhuman figure is visible its halfway across the alley 
               its motion has blurred it but you can tell its shape now

               merrill hess stares stunned at the image of an upright animal 
               like creature the striations all over its body look like 
               branches exactly like branches they match the bushes where 
               it was hiding perfectly

                                                                    cut to

               int kitchen  day

               the door swings open slowly graham steps into ray reddys 
               kitchen

               cabinets are open dishes are broken chairs are turned over 
               the faucet is running full blast

               grahams eyes move across the room the kitchen table is 
               upside down and leaned up against the pantry door

               the sound of a glass jar breaking on the ground can be heard 
               inside the pantry

               graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the 
               kitchen

               he leans a little bit and listens from behind the pantry 
               door we hear the sound of breathing there are quiet movement 
               sounds the soft sound of glass being crushed as its being 
               walked on

               graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the 
               leaning table graham stands up straight and thinks it over 
               beat

               graham takes two small steps closer

               when he leans he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry 
               door there is light leaking out from beneath it there is 
               shadow being thrown from inside the pantry the shadow moves 
               back and forth under the door

                                     graham

                         in the paddy wagon
                              mouths to himself
                         paddy wagon

               the only sound in the kitchen is the sound of the faucet 
               running graham waits for a reply but none comes

                                     graham

                         your life son

               beat

               graham bends down where he stands he puts his head near the 
               wood floor he tries to look under the door all he can see 
               are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the 
               pantry hes at too severe an angle

               graham sits up hes only four feet away from the pantry 
               door he looks around not knowing what to do his eyes fall 
               on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer 
               onto the floor

               he takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to 
               the door beat he reaches with the butcher knife underneath 
               the slanted kitchen table he uses the knife like a mirror 
               to see under the door graham watches the soft reflection in 
               the flat stainless steel surface of the blade we can make 
               out broken glass and ripped open packets of rice and cereal 
               on the ground there are pockets of shadows we cant see 
               into

               graham pulls the knife out he sits there kneeling two feet 
               from the door beat

               he takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under 
               the slanted table

               he stops halfway down he loses his nerve and sits up he 
               rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the 
               counter graham starts walking across the kitchen he gets 
               to the door puts his hand on the doorknob

               he stays like that for a long time beat

               graham lets go of the doorknob  he turns and walks quickly 
               across the kitchen  he picks up the butcher knife  he 
               kneels down next to the pantry  he ducks his head under 
               the slanted kitchen table  he places his cheek to the floor 
               only inches from the bottom of the door and looks into the 
               pantry

               there is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor 
               of the pantry nothing else

               graham stares at his view of the floor somethings wrong 
               parts of it feel like a painting the painting moves

               two black eyes open  seemingly suspended in the middle of 
               the room they are sideways they look at graham

               graham yells he jolts up his head hits the slanted table 
               hard

               four long fingers and claws the exact color of the wooden 
               floor reach out and miss his face by a fraction of an inch

               graham reacts the butcher knife comes down fast and hard on 
               the protruding wood colored fingers slam

               we hear an unbearably highpitched inhale sound from inside 
               the pantry

                                                                    cut to

               ext station wagon  day

               the station wagon knocks over the ray reddy mailbox as it 
               turns sharply onto the road

               graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his 
               right

               the station wagon suddenly brakes

               two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon 
               comes to a fast stop

               beat graham gets out of the car he walks a few feet ahead 
               of the station wagon he bends down in the middle of the 
               road

               a bird lays limp on the asphalt its head is crushed

               graham gazes at the still pile of feathers beat

               graham turns and looks straight up at the blue cloudless 
               sky above him

                                     graham
                              soft

               it behind him he turns and looks into the family room

               all three are wearing foil helmets beat

                                     merrill
                         their skin changes color thats why 
                         we couldnt see him that night

               graham stares at his family huddled on the couch beat graham 
               takes in the news as he moves to the stairs he takes a seat 
               on the second to last step

               he sits obscured by the balusters beat

                                     graham
                         tell me something morgan in that 
                         book of your did they happen to 
                         detail what would happen if they 
                         were hostile

                                     morgan
                         yes they would invade us using only 
                         ground tactics hand to hand combat 
                         they wouldnt use their technology 
                         or fight an airborne battle because 
                         they would know we would eventually 
                         use nuclear weapons and the planet 
                         would be useless to them

                                     merrill

                         did they say what our chances would 
                         be if they did invade

                                     morgan
                         they said one of two things could 
                         happen one they fight and are 
                         defeated and leave to return again 
                         with full forces hundreds or even 
                         thousands of years later

               the words hang in the air graham sits quietly on the second 
               step of the stairs

                                     graham
                         what do you think about the idea 
                         that they dont like places near 
                         water and we might be safe from 
                         them near a lake or something

                         up and leave

               all four put their hands in the air beat they lower them 
               and sit in silence

                         because they seem to have trouble 
                         with pantry doors

                                                                    cut to

               ext hess house  afternoon

               we are watching the house from the crops we see graham inside 
               the house closing the window shutters in one room after 
               another

               we see a stack of wooden boards on the porch

               our view moves to the barn where isabelle is tied she is 
               not pacing she is not barking she sits staring right at 
               us she is shivering

               our view moves to the garage building where we see merrill 
               carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs 
               hes moving into the main house

               merrill walks across the yard his eyes look around carefully 
               as he moves

               part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses 
               the lawn he stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen 
               things  he picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased 
               in glass cases

               the glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs has cracked  
               he takes the ball out stares at it

               we watch from the crops as merrill puts down his pile of 
               clothes and things on the grass he looks around and finds 
               what hes looking for a rake

               merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle  
               with the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball 
               in the other he turns to face the crops

               we pull back a little into the crops part of our view is 
               obscured by stalks but we still see merrill clearly

               merrill looks around cautiously again before getting into a 
               batters stance his left leg digs into the grass in front 
               of him his weight is mostly on his back leg he looks out 
               into the distance high over the crops he throws the baseball 
               up in the air

               merrill grabs the wooden handle merrills shoulders move 
               with blinding speed the wooden rake handle slices the air 
               and misses the ball

               the ball drops at merrills feet

               we watch as merrill picks up the ball and tries again this 
               time his shoulders move even faster the wooden stick actually 
               makes a resonant sound as it cuts the air

               the ball drops at merrills feet

               we watch through the crops as merrill snatches the ball up 
               and tries a third time  this time he yells as he swings  
               he rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to 
               the eye

               the baseball drops at his feet  strike three

               merrill stands still in the yard hes breathing a little 
               heavy as he stares down at the ball

               he gently picks it up he walks back to his pile of things 
               and then suddenly turns he throws the ball in the air as he 
               does his left leg goes out his weight goes to his right 
               leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and 
               power

               the sound of the baseball hitting the wooden handle cracks 
               across the whole yard

               the ball rockets into the air we watch it fly overhead 
               sail high over the crops it becomes a tiny dot in the 
               sky

               after a long beat of silence it comes back to earth it lands 
               in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air it cleared 
               at least four or five hundred feet of crops maybe more

               we look back to merrill standing in the backyard he drops 
               the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things he 
               piles them in his arms when his arms are full he starts 
               for the porch we watch from the crops as merrill goes inside 
               the house

                                                                    cut to

               the flicker of the television falls on the childrens faces

               we hear merrill and graham coming down the hallway before we 
               see them

               they appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the 
               closet graham and merrill are holding hammers

               all four stare at the television

               on the screen is a street filled with people running with 
               suitcases and bags some people are getting trampled others 
               are standing on the street corner and yelling there is panic 
               in the air

                         they said weve never seen a baby 
                         so beautiful

               graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment merrill 
               finishes hammering

               graham goes over and picks up bo

                                     graham
                              soft

               bo nods no

                                     graham
                              soft

                         smiled they say babies that young

               graham looks at his daughter quietly he brushes the hair 
               out of her face as merrill moves to morgan and picks him up

               all four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors  
               beat

                                     graham

                                                                    cut to

               int front hall  evening

               graham puts bo down in the hallway she stands close to him 
               merrill puts down morgan the four of them stand quietly in 
               a tight group

               they hear frantic barking in the distance

                                     morgan
                         we forgot about isabelle

               isabelles barking becomes desperate and angry they listen 
               as she barks nonstop for ten seconds and then suddenly 
               stops

               the low emergency tone from the closet tv fills the silence

               beat

                                     merrill
                              whispers
                         should we turn off the lights

                                     graham
                              soft
                         they already know were here

               the first sounds of movement are heard outside creaks of 
               wood from the front porch can be heard

               there is sounds of movement from behind the locked back door

               sounds of movement against the side of the house sounds 
               from all directions

                         dad 

               the door creaks as pressure is placed against it

                         up all she kept asking about was 
                         you

               they listen as the thuds increase in number

               the first sound of shattering glass is heard from upstairs

               merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors

                                     merrill
                         theyre in the house

                         just stared at each other for the

                         soft hello morgan im you momma 
                         you look just like i dreamed

               graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back

               scratching noises begin to come from upstairs

               the group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs 
               the bedroom door handles are being rattled

               merrills eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors to the 
               ceiling of the upstairs hallway he stares at a rectangle in 
               the ceiling a tiny rope hangs from the rectangle beat

                                     merrill
                         the attic door

               merrill sprints up the stairs

               morgan and bo watch as graham follows after merrill

                                                                    cut to

               int upstairs hall  evening

               graham and merrill stare up at the ceiling there is movement 
               right above them dust falls from a ceiling light right next 
               to them

               the rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them 
               they watch as it begins to twitch and sway

               the springs in the trap door begins to groan the door starts 
               to fall open

               merrill and graham raise their arms above their head and 
               reach up the door opens a few inches merrill is taller 
               the door presses against his fingers first it gives a few 
               more inches before merrill stops it

               grahams finger are barely touching it merrills face turns 
               red with strain as something pushes down on the door

                                     merrill
                         this is a very temporary solution

               graham brings his arms down he sees his children watching 
               from the bottom of the stairs graham looks around where he 
               is there is a very small table with photos against a wall 
               a laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors nothing 
               else graham turns to merrill

                                     graham
                         how temporary

               merrills face is a deep crimson

                                     merrill
                         twentytwo seconds

               graham looks around again the same things the same 
               table the same closet graham stops and stares at the 
               closet it has a wooden folding door that opens and closed 
               on a guide rail the wooden folding door is very tall its 
               top is one foot from the ceiling

               graham goes to the closet and grabs the door he starts 
               rocking it hard pulling it out it starts to come out of 
               its guide rail graham leans back with all his weight 
               the thin wooden door rips out of place one end is still 
               attached at the hinge graham pulls it straight it reaches 
               into the middle of the landing it stands right next to 
               merrill right under the attic trapdoor its top is only a 
               few inches lower than merrills reach

                                     graham
                         let go

               merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor it 
               connects with the top of the closet door and stops the 
               trapdoor is now open almost a foot we can now see part of 
               the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to 
               the attic

               merrill and graham step away as the closet folding door holds 
               the weight of the attic door

               after a moment the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as 
               the pressure is let up the trapdoor closes beat

               it opens with force slamming the top of the standing closet 
               door with a thud

               the attic trapdoor closes again opens again with force

               thud

               the closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges 
               keeping it upright

               graham moves down the stairs merrill follows him

                                                                    cut to

               int front hall  evening

               the scratching noises fill the house

               morgan and bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach 
               under the front door the color of the fingers changes  to 
               the exact color and texture of the yellow cracked paint on 
               the door

               thud the trapdoor slams the top of the folding door upstairs

               graham and merrill arrive in the front hall graham takes 
               morgan and bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the 
               hall merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs

               another thud echoes through the house

                                                                    cut to

               int kitchen  evening

               the swinging door swings open and closed behind merrill as 
               he enters the kitchen

               graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and 
               waits by it merrill goes over and the two of them push the 
               table against the swinging door

               they take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top and 
               jam the rest underneath the table

               graham leans against the kitchen counter merrill stares at 
               the pile of furniture

                                     merrill
                         this is going to do nothing

                                     graham
                         we have to go in the basement

               graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a 
               darkened door at the bottom

                                     merrill
                         theres no way out of there

               beat graham looks at the faces of his frightened children

                                     graham
                         did i ever tell you i dislocated

                         back

               merrill looks at the boarded up back door graham turns to 
               bo and morgan who stand against the wall

                                     graham
                         he was only a year and half old

                                     merrill

                         chocolate bar your grandma said 
                         no he tried to take a bite so i 
                         grabbed it

               thud with a crack of wood from upstairs merrill turns and 
               stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen

                                     graham
                         i must have pulled his arm at an 
                         awkward angle his elbow popped right 
                         out of the socket

               the last thud comes with a sound of wood splintering the 
               closet folding door crashes to the ground in the upstairs 
               hall

               we hear creaks as the attic trapdoor opens

                                     graham
                         he didnt scream or anything his 
                         arm just flopped to his side and he

                         couldnt stop crying we need to 
                         go into the basement now

               graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs morgan 
               and bo move to their father slowly

                                     graham
                         you know what your uncle merrill did 
                         right after the doctor put his arm 
                         back in place he jumped off the 
                         table and gave me a hug he had 
                         already forgotten that i was the one 
                         who hurt him

               graham ushers the two children down the stairs he waits for 
               merrill merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks toward 
               him merrill stops and looks down the stairs

               the door starts to force its way open the table and chairs 
               begin to scrape across the kitchen floor like nails against 
               a chalk board

               we hear voicelike sounds enter the kitchen sounds made 
               from inhales not exhales

                                                                    cut to

                         the doorknob

               the basement is lined with metal shelves the shelves are 
               cluttered with all sorts of canned goods extension cords 
               cleaning supplies decorations outdoor tools merrill 
               rummages through the shelves frantically

                                     morgan
                         theyll read our minds

                                     graham

                         im already scared

               graham puts his ear to the door and listens

                                     graham
                         merrill 

                                     merrill
                         im looking

               merrill moves to another set of shelves he starts knocking 
               things to the ground

                                     morgan
                              to himself
                         theyll know our secret thoughts

               there is scratching against the door the doorknob turns 
               graham grabs it with both hands the door begins to push 
               open

                                     graham
                         merrill

                                     merrill
                         got it

               merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out 
               a pick for digging in the ground he holds it up in the air 
               it has a threefoot wooden handle

               merrill turns and rushes in grahams direction

               a single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling it is 
               the only light in the room merrill clips the light bulb 
               with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room

               the bulb shatters

               the basement is instantly black

                                     bo
                         dad

               we hear the sounds of sudden commotion voices struggling 
               at the door steps on broken glass

               click a beam of a flashlight comes on

               it illuminates morgan standing next to a rack of metal 
               shelves he turns the flashlight in his tiny hands

               the narrow beam moves across the darkness it finds merrill 
               and graham leaning up against the basement door

               morgan moves the beam down to the pick which is wedged 
               between the doorknob and the ground the pick wavers a little 
               with each push from the other side but holds

               the scratching and movement outside the door begins to lessen

               beat morgan slowly moves the beam back up to his fathers 
               face

                                     graham
                         wheres bo

               the beam searches in the darkness through the boxes between 
               the shelves it settles on a small foot hiding behind a 
               couple twentyfive pound bags of dog food bos head slowly 
               appears she squints as she looks in the light

                                     bo
                         im okay

               another beam comes on it reveals merrill at the shelves 
               with a second flashlight he looks over the contents of the 
               shelves near him beat

               his beam of light falls on a radio

               he turns the knob to on the radio lights up but no sound 
               emerges for its speakers merrill turns the channel knob 
               and checks all the stations no sound no signal he listens 
               to the light hum from the speakers

               beat

                                     merrill
                         whats happening out there

               beat

                                     graham
                              in the dark
                         i cant even imagine

               they all listen to the dead air hum from the radio speakers

                                     morgan
                         i hope theyre doing better than we 
                         are we dont even have helmets

               there is a loud bang

               both flashlight beams crisscross over the basement and come 
               to a stop on the door

               another bang the door vibrates the pick with the wooden 
               handle holds in place

               bang

               graham steps into the beam of lights he looks at the door 
               and then turns and faces the lights

                                     graham
                         theyre just making noises theyre 
                         not trying to get in
                              beat
                         why are they doing that

               graham looks at merrills corner of the darkness morgan 
               moves his beam onto merrill

                                     merrill
                         they want our attention on the door

               bang a beat of silence

                                     graham
                         theyre distracting us

                                     merrill

                                     morgan

                         good problem solvers

                                     merrill

               bang

                                     graham
                         morgan give me your flashlight

               morgan puts the flashlight on the ground and rolls it across 
               the floor the beam spins in tiny circles showing the broken 
               glass of the bulb in the middle of the floor

               the flashlight comes to a stop in grahams palm he picks it 
               up

                                     graham
                         is there an air vent in here

               merrill moves next to graham another bang from the door

               they aim their flashlights in one corner of the room the 
               brothers move in opposite directions

               graham moves his beam up and down checking the walls and the 
               ceiling as he moves

               merrill moves between shelves one at a time his flashlight 
               peers behind the stacks of canned goods

               a bang echoes through the basement door

               merrill and graham are at opposite ends of the room now

                                     graham
                         i can feel air

                                     merrill
                         me too

               the two beams of light start moving towards each other

                                     graham
                         its getting stronger

                                     merrill
                         im close

               bang

               the beams move up and down over the final wall graham and 
               merrill move closer and closer the two beams finally come 
               to a stop in the same place they shine down on morgan

               he sits on the ground against the wall he stares up at the 
               two lights

                                     morgan
                         what

               in the beam of lights you can see his hair moving gently 
               from a breeze

               graham and merrill turn their lights straight into the air 
               vent hes leaning against

               eyes are revealed in the darkness of the vent a narrow set 
               of metallic colored fingers shoot out between the holes in 
               the vent grill and grab morgan

               morgan screams the flashlights drop to the ground theres 
               a desperate scramble feet move through the beams of light

               we cant see whats happening

                                     merrill os
                         hold the vent

               someone picks up a flashlight we see glimpses of straining 
               faces morgan screaming

                                     graham
                         pull him

               the flashlight is dropped and picked up again we see it is 
               bo who is holding the light

               bo turns the light at the vent merrill is the only one there 
               he presses one of the twentyfive pound bags of dog food 
               against the metal grill he drags the second bag over with 
               his foot and slams it against the first bag he quickly moves 
               out of the light

               bo follows him with the beam she finds him dragging an 
               enormous bag of flour over to the vent he heaves it on top 
               of the pile he leaves the light again returns with another 
               giant bag of flour grunts as he throws it on top of the 
               rest

               merrill falls to the ground exhausted the pile of dog food 
               and flour completely obscure the vent a can of soup rolls 
               on the ground near merrill he slowly picks it up and puts 
               an additional eight ounces on the pile

               merrill slowly catches his breath he reaches over to his 
               side and grabs the remaining flashlight he trains the beam 
               around the room till he finds morgan

               he finds the boy in grahams lap morgan is seated with his 
               back against grahams chest using him as a chair morgans 
               face is pale he is taking very long slow heaves it sounds 
               like the air is going through a straw hes suffocating

               graham looks up into the light

                                     graham
                         we dont have his medicine

               merrill looks at his nephew turning gray

               graham pulls morgan closer to his body and talks into the 
               childs ear

                                     graham

                         feel it going in and out breathe 
                         like me breathe like me

               morgans throat is closing  his face is filled with strain 
               and panic

                                     bo
                         he cant breathe

               bo moves to merrill and curls up with him as they watch

               graham closes his eyes beat he opens his eyes and talks 
               into morgans ear

                                     graham
                         stay with me stay with me i know 
                         it hurts be strong baby itll 
                         pass

               graham closes his eyes  talks to the darkness

                                     graham
                         dont do this to me again not again

               merrill stares at his brothers desperate face

               grahams eyes open as morgans tiny fingers press down on 
               grahams hand the fingers squeeze with all the strength 
               they have

               graham looks to merrill helplessly merrills eyes fill up 
               with water

               grahams eyes close

                                     graham
                         i hate you i hate you

               grahams eyes open as he leans in close to morgans ear

                                     graham
                         the fear is feeding it dont be 
                         afraid of whats happening believe

                         pass here it comes dont be 
                         afraid here comes the air

               a thin stream of sound emits from morgans throat like the 
               sound of air leaking from a balloon

                                     graham
                         there we go we dont have to be 
                         scared at all we know itll pass  
                         we believe it dont be afraid 
                         morgan

               morgans fingers relax a little on grahams hand

               the leaking balloon sound turns back into the sound of air 
               through a straw

               merrill watches as grahams face stays pressed up against 
               his son

                                     graham
                         feel my chest breathe with me 
                         together the air is going in our 
                         lungs together were the same  
                         were the same

               merrill watches as morgans chest starts to move in sync 
               with grahams

               the sound of the straw fades as morgans breathing turns 
               into labored breaths

               grahams eyes close he starts crying he speaks to no one

                                     graham
                              soft
                         i hate you

               morgans fingers relax on grahams hand merrill watches as 
               father and son breathe together merrill and bo hold each 
               other tight

               the flashlight flickers on graham and morgans exhausted 
               faces they both stare out into the darkness of the basement 
               tears drying on their cheeks theyre both lost in their 
               thoughts

               beat

                                     merrill
                         i should save the flashlights

               beat graham nods without looking over

               merrill presses the button on his flashlight the beam of 
               light illuminating graham and morgan goes out they disappear 
               into shadows

               merrill looks down to bo who has the second flashlight in 
               her hand the beam points up at the basement ceiling above 
               her and merrill

               merrill nods to her she reaches down and presses the button

               the basement is engulfed by black

                                                               dissolve to

               int basement  morning

               we are still in black a voice is heard in the darkness 
               its murky at first then becomes clearer

                                     voice
                         jordan saudi arabia and bahrain 
                         have also confirmed

               graham opens his eyes from sleep he squints from the light

               graham looks at morgan lying limp on the ground graham turns 
               to merrill

               the two men stand under the single dangling light bulb graham 
               quietly turns and looks at morgan he moves across the room 
               towards him

               merrill watches as graham kneels down and reaches to morgans 
               side graham unclips the baby monitor from his sons belt

               graham walks back to merrill he holds it out between them 
               beat

               he turns it on

               a slight static is heard graham turns the volume all the 
               way up the static gets a little louder but doesnt change 
               there are no noises no spikes no voices just empty

               electrical static beat

               daylight filters down from the kitchen and pierces the 
               stairwell to the basement

               the basement door cracks open a few inches beat merrill 
               opens it all the way

               dust floats up in the daylight that spills down the stairs

               merrill moves up the stairs by himself he reaches the top 
               and looks around turns back down to the faces at the bottom  
               gives them the thumbs up

               graham leads bo up the stairs he carries a limp morgan in 
               his arms

                                                                    cut to

               int kitchen  morning

               the kitchen is kind of beautiful in its destruction beams 
               of daylight crisscross the room from the punched out holes 
               in the windows and boards

               the back door is wide open

               we hear sounds from the tv filtering in from the hall

               graham and bo and morgan watch as merrill walks over the 
               toppled chairs to get to the cabinets

                                     graham
                         get the syringe as well we might 
                         need to give him an epinephrine shot

               merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that 
               have fallen from the cabinets

                                                                    cut to

               int family room  morning

               shafts of sunlight stream in from one side of the family 
               room where the windows have been broken in

               graham gently lays morgan on the sofa

               we hear cheering come from the television filter through 
               the front hall and into the family room

               bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room

                                     bo
                         people are dancing

               she points at the closet

               morgan strains to look in her direction graham looks at 
               him

                                     graham
                         you want to see it

               morgan nods yes as he struggles to breathe

                                     graham
                         ill bring the tv in here

               int closet  morning

               the television shows a shot of a street corner thousands of 
               people stand in the streets a reporter stands amongst them 
               and talks into a microphone

                                     tv reporter
                         today there are no countries and no 
                         races and no differences  we are 
                         all apart of the same 

               graham unplugs the television the screen goes black

               bo moves the coats aside as graham wheels the television and 
               the television cart out into the hall

                                                                    cut to

               int family room  morning

               graham pulls the television into the family room careful 
               not to trip it on the carpet

               the glass of the television is like a mirror

               graham moves the television into position the black screen 
               reflects the family room behind graham as it turns

               the reflection of a creature silhouetted pans across the 
               television screen

               the tv stops moving graham stays frozen with his hands on 
               either side of the television cart hes slightly bent over 
               his back is to the family room

               graham straightens and turns around slowly

               morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air morgans 
               face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up

               for a moment it appears hes suspended in the air then we 
               see the outlines and we see the eyes the black eyes

               there is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the 
               middle of the family room its powdery skin has taken on 
               the shades lines and colors of the family room so perfectly 
               it almost disappears

               it blinks

               graham and bo have turned to stone bo stands frozen in the 
               front hall

               merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the 
               family room he takes two steps into the room and comes to a 
               stop next to the fireplace the inhaler and syringe in his 
               hand fall to the ground the creature is between graham and 
               merrill in the middle of the family room

               morgan is dying the last sounds of air stop in his throat

               the lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the 
               creatures skin move as the creature moves its free hand

               grahams eyes shift to the hand three of the creatures 
               fingers are missing  sliced off by a butcher knife

               the creatures hand moves to morgans face it tilts its 
               fingers and palm back the colors on the hand are already 
               changing to match its new position in the room

               a small pore opens up on its wrist a yellowish gas starts 
               to leak out of the opening

               graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of 
               the creature its large empty black eyes lock on grahams

               graham starts to hear a high pitch ringing sound  it begins 
               to engulf all sound in the room

               graham stares helplessly into the large black eyes

               we move into grahams eyes they widen we see the emotion 
               in them his mouth barely gets the words out

                                     graham
                              soft
                         hes reading my 

               the high pitched ringing sound overwhelms everything the 
               room goes bright white

                                                               dissolve to

               ext street  night

               we are blinded by a bright light the light is moving we 
               realize it is the headlights of a car that pulls to the side 
               of the road

               the car door opens graham hess steps out his coat is open 
               he is wearing a black shirt and black pants a priests white 
               collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt graham looks 
               around in a daze

               we are on a country road there are strobing red and white 
               lights filling the night air four police cars are scattered 
               amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances

               a large group of officers and workers hover around a green 
               truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees

               officer edgar paski walks up to graham he whispers something 
               into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he approaches edgar 
               looks badly shaken beat the two men look at each other

               fade and are replaced by the breathing in the room

               the breathing is joined by the hissing of gas as its being 
               released

               the creature forces poison gas out into morgans unconscious 
               face

               the room is engulfed with streams of sunlight from the broken 
               windows the light seems to catch certain things in the room 
               and make them stand out things on shelves things on tables 
               things on the wall

               the creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its 
               lines and colors dont match in position in the room

               merrills left leg goes out his torso and shoulders turn 
               with staggering speed and strength the bat slices through 
               the air of the family room contact

               in an unnatural crumpled pile his arms and legs flop 
               lifelessly to the carpet

               the creature turns to face merrill all the creature sees is 
               the blur of wood as merrill swings like a lumberjack slam 
               the creature falls to the ground

               graham takes bo by the hand and moves to morgan graham picks 
               up his sons limp body in his arms

               fire

               graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine 
               on the ground

               the creatures shoulder stops changing colors and withers 
               into a powdery white

               the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki bacon 
               cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched

               nods

               glasses of water resting on the television fall and spill 
               over the edge  right onto its face

               the creatures screams fill the family room  and then
