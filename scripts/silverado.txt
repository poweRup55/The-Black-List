               fade in

               int shack  day

               darkness quiet the camera moves through the gloom of the 
               small dirty wooden hut past a broken table over a well
               worn saddle lying on the floor now a pair of boots standing 
               empty by the rotting remains of a roughhewn bunk up to a 
               holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed the still shape 
               of a man a bedroll his only protection from the splintery 
               planks this is emmett fast asleep

               the door of the shack bursts inward as a gunman crashes in 
               for a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morning 
               light his two sixguns blasting even before the door has 
               bounced shut behind him returning the hut to darkness

               emmetts holster the gun gone

               the gun is here in emmetts hand erupting now with three 
               quick explosions the intruder flies against the far wall of 
               the hut and lands on the floor dead from outside two bullets 
               pierce the plank wall behind emmett light streaming through 
               in 45 calibre shafts

               emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor he fires once 
               over the bunk in the moment of quiet that follows we hear 
               running footsteps outside the hut emmett follows their 
               progress with the point of his gun but holds his fire 
               suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the 
               shack and the table disintegrates in a new column of light

               emmett glances upward but quickly returns his attention to 
               the side walls trying to follow that gunman now more fire 
               comes from there and more footsteps another shotgun blast 
               showers emmett with debris but he ignores it concentrating 
               on the walls

               what he sees the man outside moves quickly past a crack in 
               the wall momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the 
               light emmett fires once ahead of him stopping his progress 
               and forcing him back to the crack emmett fires his last 
               shot there and the man outside goes down hard

               the shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and blows 
               a crater in the dirt by emmetts foot the shape of a man 
               flashes across the new hole emmett looks across the room at 
               the top bunk where the barrel of his winchester protrudes a 
               few inches from the bare planks emmett throws his empty six
               gun noisily into the far corner of the hut instantly the 
               man on the roof blasts away in that direction

               emmett dives for the bunk with the tips of his fingers he 
               pulls hard on the muzzle the winchester flips full circle 
               into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above

               with an odd kind of inevitability as though seeking its 
               rightful place the winchester arcs into a shaft of light 
               where it is met by emmetts steady waiting hands before it 
               has even settled he has cocked and fired twice through a 
               hole in the roof emmett stops and lowers the carbine the 
               man on the roof falls spreadeagled through the weakened 
               ceiling debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form

               emmett listens moves silently to the door and opens it 
               carefully we follow him outside out into the bright 
               sunlight into the awesome promise of the american west

               ext shack  day

               emmett moves warily around the isolated shack there are no 
               more attackers he looks off into the distance two riderless 
               horses galloping away are the only moving things in the 
               empty landscape a third saddled horse a pinto stands 
               nervously near emmetts horse which is tied to a stake

               emmett walks to the body of the man outside and looks down 
               at him he doesnt know him he moves to the pinto and calms 
               it he examines the distinctive brand on its flank a circle 
               with two wavy lines beneath it emmett is clearly mystified 
               he rests his arms on the saddle and stares after the 
               retreating horses

               the main title begins

               ext emmett rides various shots  daynight

               emmett travels the saddled pinto in tow he moves from high 
               mountain terrain downcountry through meadow and canyon he 
               makes night camp near a rushing stream the land flattens as 
               he approaches the desert the sun beats at him as he dismounts 
               at the edge of a whitehot plain he takes a short pull from 
               his canteen and squints off across the flat empty space 
               all he can see ahead is blinding sand and blue sky

               the main title ends

               ext desert series of shots  day

               emmett is now surrounded by the white blankness moving slowly 
               under the broiling sun

               he stops his walking horses and squints out into the distance 
               seeing something we see it too but just barely a distant 
               horizontal smudge on the glaring sand

               emmett reaches the smudge it is a man barefoot and dressed 
               only in longjohns his head propped on a rock eyes closed 
               the mans skin is burned red and beginning to blister his 
               lips parched yet there is a curious ease to his repose if 
               he has lain down here to die he has done it in peace this 
               is paden

               emmett lifts padens head and puts the canteen to his lips 
               padens eyes struggle to open in the glare he takes a few 
               sips of the water his lips crack with a slight smile at the 
               taste he looks up at emmett takes another sip and tries 
               to speak emmett must lean down to hear his raspy whisper as 
               he tries again

                                     paden

               emmett settles down at his saddle and pulls a blanket over

               pintos saddle by his head

               emmett and paden who is still clad only in longjohns ride 
               toward the low adobe settlement of chimayo

               there are many soldiers on the street emmett and paden pull 
               up to the general store paden dismounts and hands his reins 
               to emmett passersby look with curiosity at the undressed 
               paden

                                     emmett

               paden nods and looks doubtfully at the store he scratches 
               himself emmett produces some money and flips paden a coin 
               paden nods

                                     paden

               emmett rides up the street leading the pinto paden starts 
               toward the store and nearly collides with a shocked woman 
               who covers the eyes of the little girl with her and crosses 
               the street paden gives an apologetic tip to his nonexistent 
               hat as he watches them go before he can turn back to the 
               store his eye is caught by something up the street he reacts 
               big

               his way out of a saloon a disreputablelooking cowboy

               padens hand slaps his side where his gun should be he 
               grimaces and looks around desperately then hurries into the 
               store

               int store  day

               the lone clerk is showing a woman customer a bolt of cloth 
               at the back of the store paden hurries in and makes a bee
               line to the display case holding handguns and ammo he spots 
               something he likes and taps the glass impatiently the clerk 
               reacts with distaste to padens appearance

                                     paden
                         excuse me there

               is untying the bays reins

               paden more agitated now glances back at the clerk then 
               moves around and opens the back of the display case he 
               extracts a shiny new colt 45 the clerk reacts with alarm 
               and moves toward paden

                                     clerk

                         what can i get for that

               the clerk gives up on putting him off and comes around the 
               display case disgruntled

               the cowboy mounts the bay

               paden hurries out into the middle of the street several 
               passersby stop to look at him a teenage girl lets out a 
               delighted shriek

               in front of the saloon the cowboy has turned the bay into 
               the middle of the street and now looks to see what all the 
               fuss is about when he makes out paden standing alone his 
               expression changes

               paden is having trouble extracting a shell from the ammo 
               box he glances up the street at the cowboy and sees that he 
               has been spotted he shakes one shell loose and drops the 
               box trying to insert the bullet in the gun

               the cowboy pulls his sixgun leans forward and spurs the 
               bay hard toward paden he raises his gun and fires at paden 
               there is general alarm in the street as the bystanders dive 
               for cover

               firing the bullets kick up the dust in front and back of 
               paden who now raises his pistol slowly a bullet tears 
               through the floppy material at his crotch the cowboy is 
               almost upon him when paden fires the cowboy is knocked off 
               the horse and hits the street dead

               emmett and paden watch the other five men head in the 
               direction of the wagon train paden looks over at emmett

               int saloonhotel  day

               at the back of the big room is a registration desk for the 
               hotel and stairs to the rooms emmett and paden are eating 
               near a table of three tough men emmett is questioning a 
               waitress and his questions are making her nervous

                                     emmett
                         hes about my size energetic

                                     waitress
                              moving away quickly
                         i dont know him i told you i aint 
                         seen nobody

               paden munching on a biscuit has noticed something out in 
               the street he gets up and walks to the entrance

               ext saloonhotel  day

               what paden sees the wagon train is moving by padens 
               attention is drawn to the seat of one of the wagons hannah 
               the lovely settler woman is there sitting beside her in a 
               husbandly manner is conrad paden is interested enough in 
               the pretty girl that he barely registers a new arrival at 
               the saloons hitching post the newcomer takes his saddle
               bags and a henry 44 rifle from his horse and comes up into 
               the saloon

               int saloonhotel  day

               the newcomer is a lithe strong black man  mal he has no 
               other weapon besides the rifle mal looks around the room 
               and walks wearily to the registration desk although there 
               is no one behind it he rings a bell for service

               at the sound of the bell several of the patrons look up and 
               spot mal for the first time the three tough men are instantly 
               displeased at the sight of the black man paden returning 
               to his meal notes their attitude and glances over at mal

               mal leaves his saddlebags at the registration desk but takes 
               the rifle as he walks across to the bar the nervous waitress 
               is working there the sight of mal only adds to her agitation

                                     waitress
                              cold
                         what do you want

                                     mal
                              friendly tired
                         i havent had a drink of whiskey or 
                         slept in a bed for ten days give me 
                         a bottle

               the waitress hesitates uncertain she places a shot glass 
               and a bottle on the bar beyond an elaborate brass nude 
               statuette whose upraised arms hold dishes full of hardboiled 
               eggs mal has leaned his rifle against the bar and must now 
               move a few steps to stand before the whiskey

               the three tough men exchange looks as mal uncorks the bottle 
               and slowly lovingly fills his shot glass he puts the bottle 
               down and regards the glass for a long moment of pleasant 
               anticipation mals hand has started for the glass when the 
               saloons proprietor appears from a back room

                                     proprietor
                              sharply
                         hey what are you doing buck

               mal draws his hand back and straightens slightly a different 
               kind of weariness comes into his face

                                     mal
                         having a drink

                                     proprietor
                         no youre not get out of here

               the proprietor shoots the waitress a withering look she 
               shrugs helplessly and hurries away at the tables two of the 
               three tough men quietly rise and separate moving toward the 
               two ends of the bar emmett and paden watch

                                     mal
                              flat
                         i havent had a drink of whiskey or 
                         slept in a bed for ten days

                                     proprietor
                         you aint getting them here

                                     mal
                              gravely
                         im real sorry to hear that

               at this the first man steps forward quickly snatches mals 
               rifle and slides it down the bar mal looks across the 
               distance at his only weapon

                                     paden
                              quietly to emmett
                         doesnt look quite fair

                                     emmett
                              watching carefully
                         which way do you mean

               the second man lurches up to the bar and pins mals arms 
               behind him the first man moves quickly cocking back his 
               arm for a punch square in mals face as the blow is 
               unleashed mal bends forward with terrific speed and force 
               pulling the second man onto his back the second mans face 
               is suddenly where mals was an instant ago and the first 
               mans punch lands hard on it mal slams the second mans 
               back against the edge of the bar he falls to the floor mal 
               blocks a blow from the first man and steps in with a flurry 
               of body blows

               back at the tough mens table the third man pushes back his 
               chair as if to rise emmett has just picked up a chicken 
               leg now he waves it ever so slightly at the third man stay 
               out of it the man looks at emmett and paden then settles 
               back into his seat

               mal sends the first man crashing down through a table with a 
               final blow he turns in time to see the second man back on 
               his feet grab mals whiskey bottle and break it against the 
               bar mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing 
               whiskey  what a waste the second man lunges with the sharp 
               glass mal lifts the heavy statuette easily with one hand 
               and uses its upraised arms to catch the mans wrist and twist 
               the bottle painfully from his grasp mals other hand hits 
               the man once in the throat and he is down

               the proprietor rises from behind the bar a sawedoff shotgun 
               in his hand mal spins swinging the statuette brutally 
               against the proprietors arm the shotgun clatters to the 
               floor as the proprietor recoils in pain crashing into a 
               shelf of glasses the fight is over

               suddenly standing in the doorway holding a leveled gun is 
               an enormously tall figure  sheriff langston dressed rather 
               elegantly in suit and bowler he dwarfs the man at his side 
               deputy kern he surveys the scene as the three injured men 
               stir back to life when he speaks it is surprisingly with 
               a british accent 

                                     langston

                         wears a fancy twogun rig

               langston takes a long time reacting to this information now 
               he slides his chair back a foot giving his gun hand a little 
               more room

                                     langston

               int cellblock  evening

               a lean young man is bouncing around his cell playing hacky 
               sack keeping a small leather bean bag from falling to the 
               floor by kicking it with his bare feet this is jake

               langston opens the door to the cellblock and speaks over his 
               shoulder to emmett and paden who have removed their guns

                                     langston
                         now i want everyone to behave himself

               at the sight of emmett jakes face lights up and then he 
               does an extraordinary thing with one long stride he is across 
               the cell and into the air he hits the bars halfway up and 
               clings like a monkey paden reacts as if he is one

                                     jake

               jake lowers himself and darts about as he talks

                                     jake
                         all i did was kiss a girl

                              skeptical

                         didnt like it and we had some words 
                         so i decided to get out of there

               jake looks at emmett as though that should make it perfectly 
               clear emmett waits

                                     jake

                         the fella tried to shoot me in the 
                         back

                                     emmett

                         dropped his gun

                         the dead one

               there is a long moment of silence in the cellblock

                                     emmett

                         the jury saw it differently

                                     paden
                              putting it all 
                              together

                         i was afraid of that

               emmett steps back and leans against the opposite wall looking 
               down at his boots

                                     jake
                         emmett cant you help me

               emmett looks up at the young man he looks sad

                                     emmett
                         jake you know the law you know 
                         what they did to me

               jake remembers it makes him gloomy

                                     emmett
                         blind pete always said youd hang

               jakes eyes flick over emmett but his expression doesnt 
               change

                                     emmett

               emmett walks out jake watches as the other two follow

               ext street  night

               emmett and paden walk along the sparsely populated sidewalk 
               they are quiet for a few moments finally 

                                     paden
                         shame about the kid seems a lively

                         him out of there

               paden stops emmett has moved a couple more steps before he 
               notices and turns back to paden

                                     paden

                              paden reacts

                         cant show up there with a story 
                         like this

               paden nods he is sympathetic

                                     paden
                         then i guess this is where we part

                                     emmett

                                     paden

                                     emmett

                                     paden
                         all right you buy me a drink

               they cross the street toward the crowded noisy saloon

                                     paden
                         you know a good smelly saloon is my 
                         favorite place in the world

               int saloonhotel  night

               this is the busiest place in town really packed emmett 
               heads for a spot at the bar but paden who is taking in the 
               scene with relish stops in his tracks staring across the 
               room

               what he sees through the moving jumble of bodies and the 
               heavy smoke padens hat with its silver band floating atop 
               an unseen head at a poker table

               paden adjusts the old gun stuck in his belt and goes in that 
               direction

               at the table a heavy game is in progress an ugly cowboy is 
               wearing padens hat paden plants himself across the table 
               from the man in seconds padens posture brings things to a 
               halt quiet ripples out across the room the ugly cowboy 
               looks up and recognizes paden

                                     paden
                         youre wearing my hat what else you 
                         got thats mine

                                     ugly cowboy
                         i dont know what youre talking 
                         about mister

               he shifts a little in his chair his right hand slides off 
               the table bystanders back away emmett watches from the 
               bar

                                     paden
                         i hope your hand isnt tickling my 
                         bonehandled colt if you stand up 
                         real slow and let me see you might 
                         live through this night

               the ugly cowboy hesitates his eyes darting he pushes his 
               chair back slowly and begins to rise as if in compliance 
               but now a bonehandled colt is in his hand clearing his 
               holster paden is quicker he snatches his gun from his belt 
               and fires

               padens eyes squinting through a cloud of gunsmoke as we 
               hear the ugly cowboys body crash to the floor in his chair 
               padens glance now darts down at an angle

               what he sees his hat lands on the saloon floor spins once 
               on its brim and settles into stillness like a tossed coin

               silence in the saloon then in a far corner the banging of 
               chairs and a door slamming padens gun points that way but 
               there is no one there only an overturned chair and an empty 
               pair of boots  padens

               paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots emmett 
               moves to the dead man unbuckles the gunbelt and pulls it 
               free of the body he picks up the bonehandled colt and puts 
               it in the holster then stops abruptly we hear the steady 
               advance of footsteps across the saloon floor emmetts eyes 
               follow the offscreen presence

               paden seated is pulling on his newlyregained boots with a 
               delighted air when a shadow surges up and engulfs him he 
               looks up

               sheriff langston towers over him

               int cellblock  night

               paden is brusquely deposited in the cell next to a surprised 
               jake by sheriff langston and deputy block

                                     paden

               deputy block eyes emmett who loiters by the door as langston

               through the bars behind block to grasp the gun with his right 
               hand now with his left he grabs a handful of blocks hair 
               and slams the deputys head hard back against the bars as

               high behind jake deputy kern comes out nightshirt flapping 
               cocking the carbine in his hands he has thumped down five 
               steps before he focuses on jake and paden he starts to raise 
               the carbine

               both men see the deputy but jakes reaction is so fast that 
               paden need only watch jake spins and before he has stopped 
               both his colts are erupting in his hands the carbine flies 
               out of kerns grasp and clatters down the steps jake 
               continues to fire  the stair at kerns foot splinters and 
               he steps backwards and up jake continues to splinter the 
               steps at kerns feet until he has made the deputy exactly 
               retrace his steps and retreat back through the door the 
               firing stops

               paden gives jake an odd look paden may have seen someone 
               this fast and good before but he cant remember it he puts

               down the street langston behind a wagon uses a british 
               twohanded grip to fire off a few rounds

               jake focuses his attention unleashing a fusillade as emmett

               penned in a natural alcove in the rock off the main floor of

               the strongbox from the wagon train sits on the tailgate of a 
               wagon next to it is a large keg of whiskey from which the

               to the box canyon hoofbeats echo into the canyon from that 
               direction the outlaws react en masse with a frightening 
               display of armed readiness

               where the trail enters the canyon from the shadows emerge 
               two galloping horses on the first is emmett who holds the

               pass under the point of his carbine

               to a wheel dawson decides not to shoot this guy yet he 
               watches as emmett runs back across the canyon to the cover 
               of some crates and crouches down behind them looking up at

               knocks them head over heels

               ext main street  night

               paden rides along the dark street drawn irresistibly toward 
               the thinking music lights and hubbub of the big saloon  
               the midnight star

               int midnight star  night

               paden comes in and looks around with some pleasure its an 
               expansive place busy now with gamblers drinkers and 
               brightlydressed saloon girls a piano player bangs away in 
               the corner paden has to smile this is the way a saloon 
               ought to be now even paden is home

               paden walks up to stand at the bar the bartender is busy at 
               the far end of the bar paden is patiently waiting to get 
               his attention when he hears a womans voice behind him on 
               his side of the bar

                                     stella os
                         what can i do you for stranger

               paden turns to face his interlocutor but at first cannot 
               find her after a moment though he looks down to see a 
               small woman in a velvet dress  stella

                                     paden

               she is already moving away toward the near end of the bar 
               he watches her disappear around the end then sees the top 
               of her head appear behind the bar down there as she moves 
               back toward him she gets taller and taller until she is 
               facing him eye to eye across the bar

                                     paden
                         bourbon

               as she reaches under the bar and produces bottle and glass 
               paden leans over and peeks behind the bar a footwide ramp 
               runs the length of it

                                     paden

               stella sets up a glass for herself and they shake hands 
               paden looks up at a carved ornamental star on the back wall 
               over the words the midnight star

                                     paden

               proprietary air as he walks to the bar he is almost there 
               before his gaze settles on paden and stella he stops in his 
               tracks and a big grin splits his face

               without warning cobb hits kelly viciously in the stomach 
               stella jumps cobb grabs the doubledover kelly by the hair 
               and the belt and propels him out of the saloon letting go 
               before kelly crashes through the swinging doors and into the 
               street cobb comes back toward the table as though nothing 
               had happened

                                     sheriff cobb

                         i see youre an understanding boss

               cobb chuckles picks up padens coffee cup and takes a sip

                                     sheriff cobb
                         nothing like that will happen between

                         youd be welcome

               she is smiling at him warmly when suddenly her eyes shift 
               her expression changes and she screams 

                                     stella
                         no kelly hell kill you

               cobb is already in motion he spins drawing his gun and 
               fires repeatedly at the swinging doors kelly has been aiming 
               over them and is blasted back into the street as the slats 
               splinter cobb holsters his gun the coffee cup is still in 
               his other hand he takes a final sip puts the cup down and 
               licks a spilled drop off his thumb

               stella is repulsed cobb fixes her with a malevolent look 
               and his tone is icy 

                                     sheriff cobb
                         thanks for warning me

               stella rushes out to the street as emmett and paden get up 
               emmett and cobb are very close for one moment

                                     sheriff cobb

               stella stands so for a moment she is taller than he she 
               stalks back into the saloon

               the stagecoach has pulled up across the street a tall lanky 
               gambler has disembarked and now walks toward the saloon 
               carrying his heavy satchel he moves through the assembled 
               people until he is standing over kellys body this is slick

               slick watches from a card table nearby with rae standing 
               beside him now his hand drops casually from the curve of 
               her rear to the vicinity of his boot

               paden and stella come up on opposite sides of the bar him 
               in front paden sees everything in the room tyrees friends 
               deputies kyle and garth are behind jake and clearly poised 
               to kill him if tyree fails

                         done enough

               as phoebe starts to move from between the men tyree grabs 
               her viciously by the arm in the instant of that movement 
               padens hand flashes out and draws tyrees colt out of its 
               holster from behind garth and kyle tense as tyree whirls on 
               paden eyes flaming but his own gun is pointed at his chest

               the situation is now totally reversed and no one can quite 
               believe it tyree cocks the gun at the poker table slick 
               lifts his pant leg revealing the handle of a custommade 
               dagger secreted in his boot

               leans against the bar toward stella

               ext rooming house  day

               a door opens on the upstairs porch and rae emerges giggling 
               and buttoning her dress a hand reaches out and pulls her 
               back inside for another squealing embrace she pushes herself 
               free and comes outside again then starts down the exterior 
               stairs she is almost to the bottom when she stops suddenly

               mal stands at the bottom of the stairs they look at each 
               other a long time conflicting emotions race across raes 
               face but the winner is cold anger

                                     mal
                         hello rae

                         daddys dead

               rae seems to sway then sits down on the stairs above mal 
               for a moment she is somewhere else but when she returns 
               her look is as hard as before

                                     mal
                         he was murdered

                                     rae

                         up and all you can think of is to 
                         get yourself killed

               now slick comes down the stairs behind rae pulling on his 
               jacket mal glares at him this is who can buy his sister 
               now

                                     slick

                         called me slick

               mal just looks at the proffered hand slick retracts it 
               without offense

                                     slick
                         i know what youre thinking mister 
                         but i think raes a special lady

               slick comes down past mal and moves off mal watches him go 
               then turns to rae

                                     mal

               carol bradleys daughter and a friend are playing on the 
               roof of the farmhouse above the noisy activity of the 
               welcoming celebration now bradley steps into the foreground

                                     bradley
                         dont fall off of there you fools

                         wasnt worth a damn until i fell off 
                         the barn on my head

               the two men turn to look at the dancing its a festive scene 
               all around tables are laden with food near a large bonfire 
               a few of the covered wagons are pulled up nearby children 
               dart about before the pickup band of musicians

               now we see here among the sodbusters whirling by with a 
               comely lass jake looking mighty slim without his double 
               gunbelt he and his partner glide by emmett who stands 
               shouting over the din with hannah and mr and mrs parker

                                     mrs parker

               mr parker twirls his wife off into the dance emmett and 
               hannah a slightly awkward couple stroll away from the music 
               this is the first time emmett has seemed less than certain

                                     emmett
                         the parkers seem like nice folks

                              stopped
                         goodbye

                         out for california soon

               hannah is silent for a moment she sits down at one of the 
               tables and looks at him for the first time there is a 
               softness in her voice

                                     hannah
                         you came all the way out here to 
                         tell me youre going to california 
                         all you had to do was go and wed 
                         never see each other again

                                     emmett
                         thats why im here

               she gives him an odd look a soft challenge to his reticence

                                     hannah
                         why

               he sits down beside her and looks at his boots

                                     emmett
                         you dont make it easy on a fellow

                                     hannah
                         didnt paden tell you that

               emmett smiles at that and looks into her lovely eyes after 
               a long moment 

                                     hannah
                         maybe you thought youd be back this 
                         way someday

                                     emmett
                         yeah that must have been it

               up on the roof of the farmhouse carol is yelling and 
               gesturing to her oblivious father below while her friend 
               stares frozen into the night

               jake is wiping his brow as he stands at the edge of the 
               dancers he looks up at carol quizzically

               only now do we hear it over the din of the music the thunder 
               of hooves out of the night streaming around the farm 
               buildings comes a horde of masked cowboys mckendricks 
               men they send up a horrible yell and begin firing their 
               weapons in the air

               their arrival is so sudden that the celebrants are frozen in 
               their places mothers hugging children to them men far from 
               their weapons there are screams

               emmett grabs a panicked child from the path of the horses 
               and moves back passing her to hannah hes trying to gauge 
               his response in the midst of all these innocents

               two cowboys have roped opposite ends of a section of fence 
               and now pull the deadly drag already thick with ravaged 
               corn through the barnyard knocking over everything in its 
               path

               jake slides through the chaos toward his gunbelt hung on a 
               peg on the barn wall

               a cowboy pulls the gate from the pigsty and the pigs squeal 
               out another cowboy begins shooting them with a henry rifle 
               on the roof carol looks in horror at the death of her prize 
               sow

               emmett is herding as many settlers as he can toward the cover 
               of the barn

               bradley edges toward the door of his farmhouse

               hobart is urging some women between two wagons a cowboy 
               rides by and kicks him viciously

               hoyt pulls up looks around then gestures to some of his 
               men two cowboys with prepared torches in their hands ride 
               up to the bonfire and swing low lighting their firebrands 
               one moves ahead toward the farmhouse reins his horse and 
               heaves the torch high in the air toward the roof on which 
               the two children perch

               in the air the tumbling flame suddenly explodes at the roar 
               of a shotgun sparks shower harmlessly to the ground

               bradley has shot it out of the air with one barrel of his 
               shotgun the blast has created a momentary shocked lull in 
               the attack bradley looks wild

               emmett watches fearful his hand is on his gun

               hoyt looks at bradley bradley swings the shotgun around 
               toward the other torchbearer

               carol screams

               emmett looks across the yard at jake who steps out from the 
               cowering homesteaders a gun in each hand emmett draws and 
               kills the man who shot bradley now all the settlers hit the 
               dirt

               jake fires from both hands repeatedly one cowboy dies and 
               another takes it in the arm the man who was shooting the 
               pigs swings his rifle around toward jake and emmett kills 
               him with one shot

               of these sheep he peers through the tumult trying to see 
               their faces his cowboys are shooting wildly into the crowd 
               now but he rides through them signalling a retreat

               emmett jumps from the top of a fence to the roof of the house 
               the henry rifle in his hand he scrambles to the peak of the 
               roof where the two children still cower bracing the rifle 
               on the chimney he takes careful aim once twice he 
               fires one cowboy dead one wounded and fleeing

               hannah runs up to the riderless horse of a fallen cowboy and 
               pulls a rifle from its scabbard she cocks it and fires off 
               at the retreating cowboys jake mounts a horse pony express
               style and rides out of the barnyard

               rushes toward her fallen father and her mother who cradles 
               the body hobart intercepts the girl trying to shield her 
               from the sight emmetts eyes meet hobarts hobart lets 
               carol go

               emmett walks through the devastation to where hannah stands 
               dazed rifle still in hand emmett puts his arm around her 
               she jumps at his touch then moves against him jake rides 
               into the barnyard and up to emmett he is flushed

                                     jake
                         theres two more out there walking 
                         home if they can walk

               emmetts gaze is caught by something across the barnyard 
               hannah follows his gaze

               mr parker stumbles out of the darkness at the side of the 
               barn sobbing hannah breaks from emmett and rushes to mr 
               parker when she is beside him she freezes staring into

               he rides down the alley as he approaches the main street 
               his foot slips and he bumps down hard into the saddle the 
               horse is barely in his control as he bounces out into the

               swann looks with interest at the pinto then reaches out and

               mckendrick turns at the sound of emmetts voice something 
               powerful flicks through his eyes but not too many people 
               would see it

               now mckendrick understands he avoids emmetts gaze and speaks 
               to swann

                                     mckendrick

                         augie

               augie hops down as emmett takes the reins emmett gives augie 
               a look and a small nod and the boy steps away

               emmett looks once again at the distinctive brand on the 
               pintos flank a circle with two wavy lines beneath it now 
               he leads the pinto around beside mckendricks horse so he 
               can see the brand on that animal mckendrick has to twist in 
               his saddle to watch emmett the brands are the same emmett 
               looks up at mckendrick things are clear between them

                                     emmett

                         have been working for you i should 
                         have known but you changed your 
                         brand ethan

                         a lot of things changed when my father 
                         died

               emmett lays the reins of the pinto across the front of 
               mckendricks saddle but they might just as well be a 
               gauntlet mckendrick picks them up he and his men move down 
               the street emmett walks over and takes augie beneath his 
               arm

               down the street hoyt rides close to mckendrick but looks 
               back over his shoulder

               paden with a grin but speaks to stella

               cobb leads paden to a table in the corner as paden sits 
               down cobb drops the pouch on the table paden glances at 
               the contents as cobb pours the drinks

                                     sheriff cobb

                                     paden

                         be is between you

               ext arroyo  outside silverado  day

               we move along the burnished barrel of the old henry 44 rifle 
               to emmetts eye sighting along its length

               now we see his target in the distance is a small cactus 
               plant emmett squeezes off a shot the cactus does not move 
               he aims again and fires quickly again nothing at the cactus

               at the cactus now were right behind the target plant emmett 
               in the distance when he fires a thin needle at the top 
               edge of the plant is blown away the bullet leaving a shallow 
               trough in the green skin he fires again and the next needle 
               disappears now there are four troughs hes been hitting 
               from the start

               emmett lowers the rifle walks back to his horse tied nearby 
               and leaves the rifle then moves away from the horse again

               he stops looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away he 
               shakes the fingers of his gun hand once then very quickly 
               he draws his colt and fires the can jumps into the air 
               while it is still moving emmett holsters the gun releasing 
               it then draws again and fires as the can jumps once more 
               emmett repeats the action six times he draws the can doesnt 
               stop moving until after the last shot

               the horrible noise echoes away as emmett holds the empty gun 
               before him from behind a rock ahead of him deputy garth 
               appears

                                     garth
                         youre empty mister

               emmett immediately begins to bolt toward his horse a lasso 
               settles around his arms and whips him viciously backwards 
               in a second he is back on his feet and running like a bull 
               toward deputy kyle who has stepped from the brush to throw 
               the rope immediately a second lasso catches emmett from the 
               other side and pulls taut a deputy on horseback charlie 
               has roped him charlie and kyle pull their ropes yanking 
               emmett onto his back

               now appearing around a bend in the arroyo is tyree a nasty 
               glint in his eye he rides hard directly toward emmett emmett 
               watches the pounding hooves approach he struggles but cant 
               move tyrees horse thunders over him one hoof catching his 
               side with a sickening thud emmett writhes in agony

               tyree turns his horse and heads back kyle pulls harder on 
               his rope tyree rides over emmett again but we cant see 
               the damage for the dust tyree walks his horse over and looks 
               down as garth kyle and charlie converge

               emmetts head is bleeding his body crumpled but he looks 
               up at them through painsquinted eyes

                                     garth
                         aint you dead yet mister

                                     tyree
                         cobb said hed be hard to kill

               they all laugh at this

                                     tyree
                              to emmett
                         guess you couldnt hear us coming
                              to the others
                         he was practicing so hard for a fight 
                         he missed the whole thing

               the others cackle garth draws his gun

                                     garth
                         so long stranger

               he starts to lower the muzzle toward emmett there is the 
               echoing crack of a shot and the gun flies from garths 
               shattered hand

               mal stands on a rock above them his rifle pointed

                                     mal
                         i dont want to kill you and you 
                         dont want to be dead drop your 
                         guns

               the other deputies exchange glances as garth bends in pain

                                     kyle
                         he cant be that good tyree

                                     tyree
                         do you want to find out

                                     charlie
                              dropping his rope
                         i think we should do like he says

               as the others start to unbuckle their holsters charlie the 
               compliant one draws on mal mal shoots him out of the saddle 
               dead the others freeze

               ext trail  base of hills  day

               mal comes into view leading a motley remuda emmett is tied 
               onto his horse unconscious the four deputies riderless 
               horses are strung along behind all their guns have been 
               tied on emmetts horse now mal releases the extra horses 
               and shoos them away he leads emmetts horse up the trail 
               into the hills

               ext cave  day

               emmett and mals horses are tied near the entrance

               int cave  day

               mal has tended to emmetts head wound and now binds a large 
               ugly bruise on his ribs emmett halfconscious writhes in 
               pain and now his eyes flicker open confused he makes a 
               futile attempt to rise

                                     emmett
                         gotta go

               emmett passes out again

               ext road  outside silverado  dusk

               the three surviving deputies gunless trudge along the road 
               garth holds his wounded hand close to his body

               int cave  dusk

               emmett lies sleeping in the flickering light of the fire 
               mal sits nearby his henry rifle lying at his feet he is 
               examining the henry that emmett had at the arroyo emmett 
               wakes up wincing

                                     emmett
                         where are we

               and looks in wonder at her manic companion who now flies 
               back onto the loft they look at each other with hungry 
               anticipation

               ext alleystreet near hollis house  night

               mal on foot makes his way cautiously through the gloom to 
               the end of the alley he looks over at the hollis home and 
               land office windows aglow now mal spots a cowboy down the 
               street smoking a cigarette as he leans against a hitching 
               post mal is peering at him uncertainly when the front door 
               of the hollis house opens and kate steps out onto the porch 
               the cowboy steps quickly back into the shadows and mal notes 
               it

               kate vigorously shakes a tablecloth over the railing and 
               turns back inside talking as she goes

                                     kate

               she closes the door behind her mal sees the cowboy called 
               red coming down the street and hurries away in the direction 
               he came from

               red comes up to the watching cowboy

               a mass of men and horses lit by the growing flames thunders 
               away into the night paden races toward the house as 
               neighbors rush about raising the alarm

               ext hollis house  night

               paden runs up to the open front door and is momentarily 
               stopped by the heat

               int land office  night

               in among the flames a bleeding kate is desperately trying to 
               drag jts inert bulk to the door paden reaches her picks 
               her up and runs out two neighbors pass him on their way to

               a chaotic scene as the firefighting is organized several

               neighbor women help paden ease kate down on a blanket

               paden rises as if to go back in but stops at 

                                     kate
                         no no they took him they took 
                         my augie

               paden reacts to this then turns as the two neighbors lay 
               jts body nearby

               int saloon  midnight star  night

               word of the fire has not reached here and normal noisy 
               activity reigns slick is dealing a threeman poker game

               rae watches him from across the room then takes a drink 
               over to him when she places it before him he looks up 
               appreciatively then goes back to his game she puts her 
               arms around him from behind and kisses his neck then slides 
               sensuously into the empty seat beside him he ignores her 
               adoring look and roaming hands but smiles as he plays

               beneath the table raes left hand roves excitingly high on 
               slicks thigh now so smooth and quick we barely see it 
               her right hand lifts his trouser leg and slips the custom
               made dagger from his boot

               slick deals a hand rae watches him thoughtfully the swinging 
               doors behind them crash open and a townsman bursts in

                                     townsman

               game who grab their chips first slick peeks at one of the 
               throwndown hands out of curiosity then rises slowly

                                     slick
                         shall we take a look

               rae nods and when she rises to take his arm her hands are 
               empty

               ext street in front of hollis house  night

               the townspeople have formed a bucket brigade in a losing 
               battle with the fire at the hollis house shouts fill the 
               air above the roar of the inferno

               stella is among the new arrivals from the saloon she is 
               stopped by the sight of kate bloody and hysterical being 
               borne away horrified by the scene stella now snaps out of 
               it and begins yelling orders to the saloon patrons to help 
               fight the blaze

               paden is only a few feet from the flames at the head of the 
               bucket line he is in shirt sleeves sweaty and sooty the 
               heat of the fire is driving the line back the townsman next 
               to paden yells to him 

                                     townsman
                         theres no way its a goner

               cobb tyree and kyle appear from the shadows cobb takes in 
               the scene and spots jt being carried across the street he 
               motions tyree over to investigate then moves toward the 
               fire

               slick and rae arrive within the light of the blaze slick 
               watches with detached interest but raes gaze quickly locks 
               on cobb moving through the chaos she sees him now with new 
               eyes

               phoebe crying watches as jts limp body is hurried off 
               on a stretcher dr skinner in attendance she turns and is 
               face to face with tyree who grasps her arms she regards 
               him with revulsion and fear then breaks from him and runs 
               off

               cobb moves up next to paden

                                     sheriff cobb
                         give it up

               paden glances at him then throws more water on but now the 
               bucket line slows to a halt the townspeople fade back a 
               little to watch the inevitable

                                     sheriff cobb
                         i hate to see this kind of thing in 
                         my town

               paden glares at cobb who is watching the fire

                                     sheriff cobb

                                     paden

                         they took the little boy cobb

               paden moves off toward a nearby hitching post where he has 
               left his gunbelt and hat cobb looks after him a moment 
               then follows they are now a short distance from the 
               onlookers paden straps on his gunbelt but his eyes are on 
               cobb as he approaches silhouetted against the flames

                                     sheriff cobb
                         youre still worried about the dog 
                         arent you

               paden ties his holster to his thigh

                                     sheriff cobb
                         you gotta calm down paden everything

                         straight

               something flicks through cobbs eyes he turns slowly and 
               looks at the scene behind him at the edge of the crowd a 
               tired stella sits on an overturned bucket watching the fire 
               she wipes her sweaty brow with the sleeve of her dress still 
               looking that way 

                                     sheriff cobb
                         i never could count on you to be 
                         reasonable
                              turns back to paden
                         dont force me to make an adjustment 
                         around here

                                     sheriff cobb
                         not a thing shes just a mutual 
                         friend
                              a beat

                         of this shes going to get hurt

               paden stares at cobb but now his eyes follow cobbs right 
               hand which swings up to padens shoulder

                                     sheriff cobb
                         im just trying to save you from 
                         yourself dont change your luck

               cobb lets his hand drop and begins to move away

                                     sheriff cobb
                         get some sleep paden thingsll 
                         look better tomorrow

               paden watches as cobb walks over to stella cobb takes a 
               handkerchief from his pocket and squats before stella he 
               starts to wipe her forehead solicitously but she takes the 
               handkerchief from his hand cobb looks back at paden as he 
               rises and moves off

               paden turns and looks into the leaping flames our eyes can 
               barely discern the change as these flames dissolve into 
               others the fire now in 

               int cave  night

               the low fire illuminates emmett who is sitting on the hay 
               he is sweating badly and seems to be concentrating on some 
               rigorous task now we see what it is  to stand up he 
               struggles to his feet wincing in pain his hand steadying 
               against the rock when he is upright he tries to clear his 
               head and finally lets go of the wall for a moment he seems 
               all right then suddenly he drops heavily back to the floor 
               the fall sends more pain shooting through his ribs hes 
               going nowhere

               ext street in front of silverado jail  night

               middle of the night all is quiet no one on the street rae 
               watches from the shadows across the street as deputy fox 
               leaves the jail and moves away rae goes toward the jail

               int saloon  midnight star  night

               the place is nearly deserted paden sits alone at a table 
               killing a bottle of the good stuff stella watches him pour 
               another drink

                                     stella
                         cant you drink any faster we need 
                         the bottles

               paden throws her a look as she takes one of the empty chairs

                                     stella
                         what is it that i cant figure

                         must be pretty good

               paden is impressed even at this late date by her acuity

                         is that what he said well he figured 
                         it okay this time

               she regards him as he looks at his glass then he looks up 
               and for one moment their eyes meet paden uncomfortable 
               quickly looks away in that second she understands her own 
               role in this and she is deeply moved they are silent 
               together

                              hand
                         only got one good hand you know

               rae steps toward mal but garth suddenly grabs her arm and 
               flings her back against the wall opposite mals cell he 
               moves close to rae and slips the big ring of keys over his 
               bandaged right hand freeing his left he looks once at mal 
               then down raes body his left hand fondles her

                                     garth
                         maybe i better check her a little 
                         closer

               mals eyes flame as garth takes rae in a lascivious embrace 
               suddenly rae dips to one side within his arms her hand comes 
               up from her boot with slicks dagger and plunges it into 
               garths back the deputy jolts back a few steps in shock 
               already pulling a sixgun from his belt with his left hand 
               he fires once into raes body she goes down

               garth is cocking the gun again with weakening fingers when 
               mals hand encircles his neck and pulls him violently back 
               against the bars garths gun clatters away down the hall

               large key ring is on the floor under garths leg and out of 
               mals reach mals anguished gaze darts from rae to the keys 
               as he begins to drag the dead weight of garths leg toward 
               the bars the key ring is dragged a few inches then slips

               fox comes through the door gun raised and takes in the 
               sight of the two bodies he looks up in surprise as slicks 
               dagger flies into his chest with a thunk fox dies

               down the line of bars mals right arm is extended into the

               paden is leaning all the way over the bar to extract a glass 
               from beneath it he straightens and walks back to the table 
               where stella still sits now however she has drawn her 
               legs up before her on the chair and is hugging her knees 
               deep in thought the saloon is now empty save for these two

               paden pours them each a drink and hands stellas to her 
               this brings her back he clinks his glass with hers and toasts

                         to my midnight star

               begin to transform all the pain is swept away in a surging 
               current of vengeful energy the music begins to build as 
               emmett moves with eerie deliberateness to arm himself he 
               picks up one of the extra gunbelts and loops it over his 
               shoulder

               mal slides into his bandolier emmett indicates the gunbelts

               quiet her worried about discovery stella throws a frustrated 
               glance toward the door  where is phoebe

               she cant wait she goes to the door and peeks out

               and moves away

               search of stella shes gone he comes back to the shed 
               before opening the door he does an odd thing he chops his 
               left forearm sharply downward and a shiny derringer slides 
               crisply into his grip from beneath his sleeve he enters 
               cautiously

               slick moves through the dim light he hears a moan and steps 
               forward he looks down at rae halfdelirious she focuses 
               on him and reacts in terror he makes the derringer disappear 
               and kneels beside her

               jake jumps off the pinto and hitches it in front of the 
               saloon as he approaches the entrance set in the cutoff 
               corner of the building he executes a fast pirouette scanning 
               down all four blocks that meet here he finds the doors locked 
               and kicks them open with a loud bang he goes inside

               tyree stops across the street from the midnight star and 
               looks at jakes horse and the open doors across the 
               intersection kyle appears at a run tyree motions him to go 
               around the back of the saloon tyree runs across the street 
               when he is on the porch of the saloon he pulls his gun and 
               begins edging toward the open doors

               its dark in here with the shutters closed tyree jumps 
               inside gun poised when kyle bangs through from the back 
               tyree almost shoots him they scan the room and advance 
               cautiously into the shadows nobody here now they back out 
               eyeing the dark stairwell

               when they are safely on the porch tyree motions for kyle to 
               go down one side of the building while he starts down the 
               other

               jake appears from beneath stellas ramp behind the bar and 
               vaults lightly over the bar in a moment he stands just inside 
               the open doorway he peeks out then turns so his back is to 
               the outside his guns still holstered

               ext midnight star  day

               jake backs quietly out onto the porch when he stops he can 
               see both tyree and kyle moving along their respective porches

                         hey

               tyree and kyle spin at the sound only then does jake draw 
               both guns and pointing them in two completely different 
               directions he shoots both men at once

               int storage shed  day

               slick has made himself comfortable next to rae who has fallen 
               into a fitful sleep now he hears something the door of the 
               shed opens and closes he waits confidently for stella to 
               appear around the intervening wall of barrels and crates

               but hes looking too low mal steps into view the big henry 
               rifle in his hand slicks eyes widen but he gets control 
               quickly and rises trying to gauge mals attitude

               mal looks from rae to slick and back to rae

                                     slick
                         im glad youre here mal ive been

                         yeah

               he looks at slick as he leans his rifle against the wall 
               slick looks at the rifle then at mal mal seems to 
               concentrate on rae and makes a move that way when he is 
               past slick slick makes the peculiar chopping gesture of 
               his left forearm that snaps the derringer into his hand

               mal has been waiting for something and is already turning 
               into slick before slick can raise his gun hand mal has 
               slicks wrist in a viselike grip mals other arm encircles 
               slicks torso and crushes him against mals body two strong 
               men strain against each other

               the cocked derringer wavers perilously toward the sleeping 
               rae suddenly mal twists slick around banging his hand 
               into the wall and the derringer fires slick lets it clatter 
               to the floor

               rae wakes with a start and watches the combatants in terror

               the mens eyes are only inches apart something flashes 
               through mals and he loosens his embrace instantly slick 
               dips to the right lifting his boot to his hand but his 
               dagger is not there

               slicks surprised look is answered by mals tight grin

                                     mal
                         looking for this

               their bodies jerk as slick gets his last surprise and goes 
               limp in mals arms he falls to the floor his own boot dagger 
               protruding from his ribcage

               mal kneels to embrace his sister

               emmett rides slowly down the street his winchester held 
               ready on his thigh his eyes continually scan the buildings 
               and alleyways he slowly rounds a corner

               way behind him off his right shoulder mckendrick has brought 
               his horse to a stop between two buildings and is carefully 
               aiming at emmetts back with his winchester now he pulls 
               the hammer back with a click

               emmett hears it and twists in the saddle as mckendrick fires 
               the shot is good but emmetts winchester takes the hit and 
               jumps in his hand he levels it at mckendrick cocks the 
               hammer and squeezes the trigger nothing he tries to work 
               the lever as mckendrick fires again emmetts rifle is 
               useless he throws it away and draws his colt firing twice

               emmetts bullets hit close to mckendrick his horse shies 
               mckendrick turns his horse and rides behind a building

               series of shots emmett chases after mckendrick along a 
               parallel street each man prepares to fire as they reach the 
               intermittent spaces between buildings mckendrick gets a 
               clear shot and fires twice emmett rides around a building 
               and speeds toward mckendricks path he comes into the open 
               ready to fire but mckendrick is heading off down an alley 
               rather than follow emmett moves to cut him off

               mckendrick has pulled up behind a barn when emmett comes 
               into view mckendrick fires twice then spurs his horse back 
               into town emmett squeezes off one carefully aimed shot 
               just missing mckendrick before he disappears

               mckendrick comes out of an alley and tears toward the 
               intersection which dusty commands from the roof of the hotel 
               porch mckendrick waves his rifle at dusty and rounds the 
               corner of the hotel

               now emmett comes out of the alley in pursuit he slows a bit 
               since mckendrick is no longer in sight as he moves down the 
               block toward the hotel intersection he looks into the loading 
               yard of the feed warehouse which forms a culdesac on his 
               left

               now dusty opens fire from the protection of the hotel sign 
               bullets kick up dirt around emmett but instead of retreating 
               he slings himself indianfashion down along the protected 
               side of his horse and rides toward the sign

               emmett aims over the mane and fires once twice through 
               the sign dusty rises hit and emmett kills him with a third 
               shot dusty crashes through the sign to fall to the street

               emmett has just straightened in his saddle and snapped open 
               the loading gate of his empty colt when mckendrick opens up 
               from where he has reappeared down the street emmett is hit 
               in the thigh

               for one long second there is perfect clarity between the 
               men emmetts eyes stare from his paincontorted countenance 
               at his adversary mckendrick hesitates only a breath to look 
               at emmett before raising the rifle and charging

               emmett wheels his horse and painfully spurs it back down the 
               block as mckendricks fire hits around him emmett turns 
               into the nearest cover  the loading yard of the feed 
               warehouse

               mckendrick rides toward the mouth of the loading yard with 
               all hes got he cant let emmett reload the glint of victory 
               is in his eyes as he draws near the loading yard

               he raises his rifle in preparation for the coming clear shot 
               at his trapped enemy as his horse begins to pass in front 
               of the loading yard we hear a terrible rumble of hoofbeats 
               on wood mckendricks expression changes to horror

               emmett has ridden onto the loading dock of the warehouse and 
               charged toward this end now he jumps his horse straight out 
               into the air over mckendricks horse the hooves of emmetts 
               horse catch mckendrick full force with a horrible sound

               emmetts horse lands on its feet but just barely from a 
               cloud of dust emmett watches mckendricks horse race on

               the back seat a blanket across his legs sits jt they 
               wait for the brothers augie drives for his recovering mother 
               stella comes out and stands by phoebe

               hannah is now standing next to paden emmett looks at them 
               as though they were a couple

                                     emmett
                              to paden

                         ive got a job

               he puts his arm against the post and his coat is drawn back 
               to reveal the shiny sheriffs badge on his vest

               emmett touches the brim of his hat and turns his horse away 
               he and jake flank the buggy and head off

               ext outside of town  morning

               emmett and jake take turns leaning down from their saddles 
               to kiss kate and augie and shake hands with jt

                                     emmett
                              to augie
                         take care of your folks

               one final look and theyre off jake turns in the saddle 
               only once 

                                     jake
                         well be back

               they spur their horses forward chasing their shadows heading 
               west

                                         the end
