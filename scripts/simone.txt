	fade in
	
	on bright outoffocus ovalshaped colors
	
	the colored shapes dart around the screen  the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope
	
	as the image comes into sharp focus we discover that we are
	inside a candy bowl  a mans fingers are frantically
	removing all the cherryflavored pieces of candy
	
	ext  studio lot  day
	
	the man performing this curious task is
	writerproducerdirector viktor taransky forties
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie  he sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage
	some distance from the rest of the film set  a breeze blows
	the tables paper cloth
	
	viktor finishes sorting  finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy he scoops them into his pocket
	
	a young headsetclad pa hurriedly approaches  he looks
	ill
	
	                    pa
	          mr taransky 
	
	viktor reads the young pas panicked expression
	
	                    viktor
	          shes walking dont tell me
	          shes walking
	              blood slowly draining
	               from his face
	          she is not walking she cant
	          walk

	           is this about the new pages 
	          i made the changes you wanted
	          youre in virtually every scene 
	
	                    nicola
	              wheeling on him
	          its not the size of the role
	          viktor
	              suddenly very cool
	          am i or am i not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set
	
	                    viktor
	              regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them
	               confused
	          its the biggest on earth  i
	          swear  its a 50foot airstream 
	          they dont make them any longer
	          than that
	
	                    nicola

	                    viktor
	          taller  what
	
	viktor looks up in horror  the trailer next to nicolas does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller
	
	                    nicola
	              walking away
	          youve insulted me for the last
	          time
	
	viktor looks to the tires  his face suddenly brightens
	
	                    viktor
	          nicola its just the tires 
	          theyre overinflated  i can fix
	          it
	
	viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen  air hisses out
	
	                    viktor
	          see its lower already
	
	nicola ignores viktor marching towards her limo with her
	publicist  abandoning the trailer viktor hurries after her
	
	                    viktor
	          i beg you  you cant do this to
	          me
	
	                    nicola
	              looking back
	          i had three other offers  i only
	          signed on to this picture out of
	          loyalty
	
	                    viktor
	          then show some  theyll shut me
	          down
	
	                    nicola
	              opening the car door
	          it wasnt working anyhow  the
	          scene with the thousand geese  i
	          dont understand this film  i
	          dont think anyone will understand
	          it  i already put out a press
	          release  citing creative
	          differences
	
	viktor stops nods resignedly  suddenly very calm
	
	                    viktor
	          you know what nicola youre
	          right
	              picking up her last piece
	               of luggage
	          here let me help you with that
	              holding the door for her
	          you ought to go  the truth is i
	          dont deserve you  this film
	          doesnt deserve you  frankly it
	          deserves much much better  the
	          reason its not working is because
	          youre not about the work
	
	nicola is stunned
	
	                    viktor
	              to the limo driver
	          to hell please
	
	the door slams and the limo roars away  viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire  the crew regards viktor
	apprehensively
	
	                    viktor
	              to the crew
	          what are you looking at  get back
	          to work
	
	the crew is uncertain what work there is to do
	
	int  bedroom  sunrise sunset  night
	
	in an ornate bedroom nicola lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting  a distraught man hal sits close by
	
	                    nicola
	              whispered
	          jack are you there

	              to hal
	          you should really go now
	
	                    nicola
	          no its alright  please let him
	          stay
	
	the nun withdraws  hal holds his face in his hands almost
	breaking down
	
	                    hal
	              a glance to heaven
	          what kind of cruel god is it that
	          would take you away from me
	
	                    nicola
	          the same one who brought me to you
	
	                    hal
	          no i cannot accept it  if
	          something like this can happen 
	          what
	              struggling to find the
	               words

	                    nicola

	           why are we here  is that what
	          youre asking jack why are we
	          here  no why  just here
	
	nicola dies peacefully

	viktor sits with leading man hal three executives and studio
	head elaine christian watching a rough assembly of the film 
	it ends with a close up of nicola anders
	
	the lights go up  the image of nicola fades off the screen
	
	                    executive 1
	          shes good  you can hardly tell
	          shes reading off a teleprompter
	
	                    viktor
	              ignoring him
	          ive analyzed the footage  weve
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can  if we rework the script
	          we can finish the film without her
	
	                    executive 2
	              forceful shake of the
	               head

	          filed at noon today  theyll sue
	          if the film is released with nicola
	          in a single frame
	
	                    viktor
	              more anxious

	                    hal
	          nicola anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role
	
	                    viktor
	              incredulous
	          its a remake hal  anders is not
	          bigger than this picture

	          to accept that  if we ever want to
	          be in the nicola anders business

	news

	          fired by the mother of your own
	          child
	
	elaine also eats some more candy  a curiously intimate
	moment between them
	
	                    elaine
	              softening a heartto

	                    viktor
	              staring off into the

	                    elaine

	any longer  he runs to the restroom

	reflection  he rehearses a courtroom speech
	
	                    viktor
	          ladies and gentlemen of the jury i
	          may be guilty of a crime but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above 
	
	three audience members enter the restroom  they approach the

	               conversation from the

	           so fake
	
	                    audience member 2
	           totally artificial
	
	viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits missing
	the end of their conversation
	
	                    audience member 1
	          were really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th century lisbon
	
	                    audience member 3
	          whos looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen
	
	all three nod in agreement and begin to urinate
	
	int  theater lobby  night
	
	viktor exits the restroom  almost all the audience members
	including lainey are waiting for him
	
	                    lainey
	              pointing out her father
	          there he is  thats my dad viktor
	          taransky
	
	viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds  they rush to shake his hand
	
	                    audience member 4
	           she is magnificent
	
	                    audience member 5
	           absolutely unreal
	
	viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments
	
	                    viktor
	          she wasnt too cartoony
	
	                    audience member 6
	           who  the nun
	
	                    audience member 7
	           or are you talking about the
	          mother
	
	                    audience member 8
	           a star like that who cares
	          about the supporting cast
	
	                    audience member 9
	           congratulations again  she
	          was not of this earth  you
	          should be very proud
	
	                    viktor
	          not of this earth  a good way of
	          putting it  and the film as a

	the group drifts away leaving lainey and viktor alone
	
	                    lainey
	          shes a miracle dad  where did
	          you find her

	          i saw her picture on the er
	          internet
	              interrogating his
	               daughters face
	          you really didnt notice anything 
	          unusual
	
	                    lainey
	          only her brilliance  to be honest
	          with what you had to work with i
	          was expecting a train wreck  you
	          really pulled it off
	
	lainey regards the makeshift poster
	
	                    lainey
	          i have a feeling mom is going to
	          take you back after this
	
	viktors head snaps around  lainey smiles
	
	                    lainey
	          back on the lot

	          taransky

	          they are alive sayer
	
	milton confirms that woodward and bernstein are still living
	
	                    max
	          so theyre probably here
	              hardly missing a beat
	          you might be able to sell this
	          disappearing act to the rest of
	          the world but im not buying it 
	          whats really behind this simone
	          woman  the public has a right to
	          know  why is she staying out of
	          sight  and why the hell is she
	          with you  i dont want you to take
	          this the wrong way viktor but
	          youre not exactly cecil b 
	          demille  more runofthemill
	
	                    viktor
	          maybe the reason shes with me is a
	          little thing called integrity
	          sayer  look it up
	
	viktor walks away
	
	                    max
	              calling after him
	          oh i know all about integrity  i
	          know even more about persistence 
	          look that one up
	
	max watches viktor depart with obvious suspicion
	
	ext  soundstage  studio lot  day
	
	a large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage
	
	closed set is the sign on the door  a surveillance camera
	panning the entrance  a security guard also keeping watch
	nods a greeting to viktor as he pulls up in his studio golf
	cart script in hand
	
	                    security guard
	          no one came in or went out just
	          like you said mr taransky
	
	                    viktor
	          good
	
	                    security guard
	          is miss simone coming today
	
	                    viktor
	          shes already here  she arrived
	          before you and shell leave long
	          after youve gone
	              admonishing guard
	          remember under no circumstances
	          are you or any other person to
	          enter the set without my express
	          permission
	
	                    security guard
	          what if it catches on fire
	
	                    viktor
	          let it burn  simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy
	
	viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage
	
	int  viktors soundstage  day
	
	the cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors  viktor takes a seat in front of the monitor
	
	                    viktor
	              to himself as he inserts
	               his hollywood harddrive 
	                simulation one
	          pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer
	
	a title appears on his computer screen
	
	                          welcome
	                             to
	                       simulation one
	
	with a satisfied smile viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to
	
	                          welcome
	                             to
	                           simone
	
	he presses enter and a face begins to build  wire upon
	wire pixel upon pixel  until a completed synthespian
	emerges  simone  she is indistinguishable from a fleshand
	blood actress
	
	simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background 
	titled visual loop 6  within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal  she looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long
	
	                    viktor
	              to the screen
	          good morning simone
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          good morning mr taransky
	
	                    viktor
	          a star is
	
	                    simone  viktor
	           digitized
	
	only now do we observe that viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard  when he speaks she speaks  simones
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	viktors voice  a scanning light on viktor allows simone to
	mimic his movements
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          you mean they buy it
	
	                    viktor
	              nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check
	          buy it  theyre paying for it 
	          and around here thats how you
	          really know they buy it
	
	viktor fondly touches a photograph of hank that is taped to
	the terminal  from the la times obituaries
	
	                    viktor
	          im only sorry hank isnt here to
	          see this
	
	viktor looks up simone mimicking his action
	
	                    simone  viktor
	              depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts
	               through simone
	          maybe he can
	
	                    viktor
	          do you have any idea what this
	          means simone  our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it
	
	                    simone  viktor
	              appearing to indulge
	               viktor with a smile
	          i am the death of real
	
	                    viktor
	              pondering the enormity of
	               the hoax
	          you are birth of what  a
	          phenomenon  a miracle  a new era
	          in show business  all i wanted to
	          do was finish the film
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          and now look what youve started 
	          and now look what youve started 
	          and now look what youve started
	
	viktors conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement  he is adjusting and refining simones voice
	
	                    viktor
	          hmm a little less streep a
	          little more bacall
	
	viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars living and
	dead that comprise simone
	
	viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to simones audio incorporating the vocal
	deliveries  20 streep 80 bacall
	
	he speaks once again as simone to test the adjustment  the
	voice patterns appear on his screen  graphic
	representations of the sound waves
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          is that better mr taransky
	
	                    viktor
	          yes  yes it is
	
	viktor snaps back to reality himself  he scrolls through the
	list of screen legends  he clicks on the image of audrey
	hepburn
	
	                    viktor
	          while i think of it id like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	           remember that thing hepburn does
	          in breakfast at tiffanys
	
	a clip of audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffanys plays on
	the screen  hepburn sitting on a fire escape looks up
	
	                    audrey hepburn
	              from the screen an
	               incomparable smile
	          hi
	
	                    viktor
	              pausing the moment
	          lets hear you say hi like
	          audrey
	
	with a cut and paste viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen simone  viktor presses play
	
	                    simone
	              imitating audreys
	               performance perfectly
	          hi
	
	                    viktor
	          perfect
	              stretching
	          god im so relaxed around you
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          you did create me
	
	                    viktor
	          no  i just helped bring someone
	          elses dream to life
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          mr taransky we both know i was
	          nothing without you  i was
	          computer code  ones and zeros
	
	                    viktor
	          youre right  youre right  of
	          course one doesnt want to boast 
	          its a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist  thats all
	          youve been waiting for an artist
	          with integrity with a vision who
	          can see
	
	viktor gets up and starts walking around the room warming to
	his theme  simone moves in a visual loop on the monitor
	nodding attentively as if shes really interested
	
	                    viktor
	          see beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood 
	          see that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake
	              voice raising in
	               excitement
	           see that if the performance is
	          genuine it doesnt matter if the
	          actor is real  once a performance
	          is committed to film the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway  only the
	          spirit the illusion remains 
	          besides whats real anymore 
	          these days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so its a gray
	          area
	
	                    simone  viktor
	              simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker
	          are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me mr taransky
	
	                    viktor
	          the only real truth is in the work
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          you know what im talking about
	
	                    viktor
	          yes  yes im going to tell the
	          truth about you why wouldnt i
	              pondering his own
	               question
	          of course with hanks tragic
	          passing the secret died with him
	              shaking the thought from
	               his head
	          i am going to tell the truth
	          after your next picture
	
	feeling uneasy at the prospect viktor changes the subject 
	he pulls out his script for eternity forever
	
	                    viktor
	          speaking of which  this is the
	          project id like you to do next
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          not eternity forever  the
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made  id
	          kill for that part
	
	                    viktor
	          i was hoping youd say that
	
	suddenly simone appears to talk on her own
	
	                    simone
	          ill do anything to please you mr
	          taransky
	
	                    viktor
	              pretending to be hard of
	               hearing
	          im sorry i didnt catch that 
	          what did you say
	
	                    simone
	          ill do anything to please you mr
	          taransky
	
	on a side monitor we discover a highlighted box marked pre
	record  viktors finger on the play button  he is
	unable to resist speaking another line
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          and i will never ever leave you
	
	simone appears to indulge viktor by blowing him a kiss 
	until we see that viktor has now highlighted a box marked
	gestures of affection  wink smile giggle sigh kiss
	flutter of eyes flick of hair puff of chest
	
	viktor comes close to the monitor  he notices something
	about simones face
	
	                    viktor
	          youre so beautiful  too
	          beautiful
	
	viktor accesses a program labeled distinguishing features
	he adds a freckle and a mole
	
	from a distance we watch him alone with simone in the vast
	empty soundstage
	
	ext  studio lot  day
	
	viktors face against the sky  as he walks we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge painted backdrop on the
	studio lot  behind a parking lot  viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning valet manager
	
	                    valet manager
	           just be a minute mr taransky 
	          we gave you a complimentary car
	          wash  theyre washing the engine
	          now
	
	viktor joins other industry movers and shakers waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella  a young talent agent
	approaches
	
	                    talent agent
	          viktor  look im sorry i didnt
	          call you back last year  i was
	          er out of the country
	              strained moment
	          but we should get together  my
	          schedules wide open
	
	                    viktor
	          sure ill call you
	
	the agents face falls  he gets in his car disconsolate
	
	suddenly hal sinclair rushes over and hugs viktor
	
	                    hal
	          viktor im so happy for us
	
	                    viktor
	          hello hal
	
	                    hal
	          the film  the chemistry  no
	          reflections on nicola but simone
	          and i  we were just so right
	          together
	
	                    viktor
	          you never were together hal
	
	                    hal
	          and still the connection was
	          undeniable
	              aside
	          i havent read eternity forever
	          but i know its brilliant  and i
	          know i would be perfect for clive
	
	                    viktor
	              correcting him
	          clyde
	
	                    hal
	          yes perfect
	              lowering his voice
	          as a matter of fact i ran into
	          simone on the lot the other day
	
	                    viktor
	              genuinely startled
	          really  she didnt mention it
	
	                    hal
	              quickly covering
	          im sure shes meeting with a lot
	          of people right now
	              under his breath
	          she is just as you described her
	          viktor indescribable  i
	          strongly sensed she thought i was
	          right for it
	
	behind his back viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
	his cell phone  the phone rings  viktor feigns surprise and
	answers
	
	                    viktor
	              answering the phone he
	               has just dialed louder
	               than necessary
	          hello simone  how are you
	          sweetheart
	
	a hush descends over the executives  hal is suddenly very
	uncomfortable  even the valets strain to eavesdrop on the
	conversation
	
	                    viktor
	              winking to hal
	          youll never guess who im with
	          you ran into him on the lot
	
	                    hal
	          it was more in passing
	
	                    viktor
	          youre so far off
	              finally chuckles
	          hal hal sinclair your co
	          star  remember now no i dont
	          think hes put on weight
	              a shrug of apology to the

	          eternity forever not the
	          right type a different
	          direction
	              covering phone to hal
	          ill try to talk her into it
	
	the other industry people make a note of the remark  a
	mortified hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave climbing
	into his car
	
	                    viktor
	              into phone
	           listen this is a bad place to

	viktor hangs up  his car pulls up  he tips extravagantly
	and drives away  the industry people get on their cell
	phones
	
	ext  studio lot  facade  day
	
	parked behind the sky facade is a curious car with shaded
	windows
	
	int  car  day
	
	inside the car max sayer and assistant milton scanner in

	viktor calmly follows retrieving the photographers camera
	and ripping out the film with a flourish  he is clearly
	relishing the attention
	
	the photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
	several dozen other shutterbugs and videorazzi

	              hesitant about broaching
	               the subject
	          this last year i was going
	          through some things
	              shaking her head at the
	               memory
	          awful awful things  but when i
	          saw simone in sunrise what she

	          now  theres too much to say 
	          these films they speak they speak
	          to the human condition  were
	          changing lives  no revealing the
	          truth now would be too cruel
	              searching for more

	          anyway when youre seeking a
	          greater truth  in the work  you
	          are not so concerned with the

	          why do you have to bring that up 
	          theres always risk  lifes a
	          risk  its worth it  besides how
	          could something so lovely be a
	          crime
	              regarding her tenderly
	          well i think weve done enough for
	          today  youve been cooped up in

	          thank you
	              turning to his daughter
	          what did you think lainey
	
	                    lainey
	          one thing bothered me
	
	                    viktor
	          i know hal is as stiff as always
	
	                    lainey
	          no not that  i was just wondering
	           in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror
	
	viktor is shocked busted  he covers it with a laugh
	
	                    viktor
	              ashenfaced
	          i wondered if youd spot that 
	          youve got a good eye lainey  im
	          proud of you
	
	elaine looks at viktor for an explanation
	
	                    viktor
	          i got them to remove the
	          reflection  the mirrors metaphor 
	           to show how her characters
	          inwardly dead
	
	                    elaine
	          thats genius viktor  was that
	          simones idea
	
	                    viktor
	              sarcastic annoyed at the
	               suggestion
	          who else  its always simones
	          idea
	
	                    lainey
	              not quite convinced
	          so that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six

	                    elaine
	          yes  to be honest i never quite
	          saw this film before  maybe its
	          the way simone is playing it  but
	          what its saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life how
	          thats the only way we can love 
	          i think its really going to mean

	          well no one could accuse you of
	          being overexposed simone  why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight
	
	                    simone
	              shrugs
	          i just think actors talk too much 
	          does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because youve
	          got a movie opening friday

	          of course the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more

	          i also have to thank my costars

	          all i have to thank the audience
	          for supporting what i do  youre
	          the only reason im here
	
	the crowd applauds wildly
	
	lainey is puzzled  she leans over to viktor
	
	                    lainey
	          why didnt she thank you
	
	                    viktor

	int  viktors soundstage  morning
	
	on the monitor simone reads the forgotten line from the
	speech
	
	                    simone
	           and of course i must thank my
	          collaborator viktor taransky
	          without whom none of this would be
	          possible
	
	viktor still in his tuxedo stares at simone on the screen 
	he holds the text of simones acceptance speech in his hands
	
	                    viktor
	              to himself
	          its written right there why
	          didnt i say it how could i
	          forget to say it

	          would abandon her own mother  ive
	          been looking into the family
	          history  heartbreaking  most
	          likely a biography to run over four
	          issues who knows maybe theres
	          a pulitzer in there somewhere

	          i liked you better before  before
	          all this  you were a loser dad
	          but at least you had integrity  i

	          clinging to simones coattails 
	          it used to be about the work and
	          now its all about her  and then
	          shes not even grateful enough to
	          thank you
	
	                    viktor
	          no that was me

	          done to you  shes taking
	          advantage mocking you  you
	          deserve better than simone

	remarks  jane enters
	
	                    jane
	          ready for your casting session
	
	viktor nods distractedly  jane shows in nicola anders
	
	                    jane
	          nicolas here for the role of
	          simones sister
	
	viktor offers nicola a seat staring at her as if he has
	never truly looked at her before  she has a quality of
	simone
	
	                    nicola
	              slightly uncomfortable by
	               viktors scrutiny
	          a lots happened since we last saw
	          each other
	
	                    viktor
	              numb
	          yes
	
	                    nicola
	          i never apologized properly for
	          what happened on sunrise
	
	she hands viktor a peace offering  a large jar of mike 
	ike candy including cherry
	
	                    viktor
	          thank you  its not important
	
	                    nicola
	          after i saw what simone did with
	          the role  you know i fired all my
	          people went into rehab took
	          acting classes changed my whole
	          look  she really inspired me
	
	viktor continues to stare
	
	                    nicola
	              referring to the script
	               in her hands
	          would you like me to read
	
	                    viktor
	          yes id like that
	
	nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down 
	she approaches viktor standing close to him playing the
	scene to him  an immediate intimacy
	
	                    nicola
	              her angry words are in
	               opposition to her amorous
	               actions
	           who do you think you are carlos
	           coming in here like this  with
	          my husband sleeping in the next
	          room  do you think i wont call
	          out  do you think i will just give
	          in to you without a fight  like
	          the last time and the time before
	          that
	              she kisses his ear
	          i wish you were dead
	              she kisses his lips
	          i wish we were both dead
	
	nicola immediately breaks character
	
	viktor is mesmerized  he has fallen back in love with
	flesh
	
	                    viktor
	              finally able to speak
	          you know youre really very good 
	          i take back what i said  i mean
	          youre really good
	
	                    nicola
	          thank you
	
	                    viktor
	              forgetting himself
	          you could play the lead
	
	                    nicola
	              confused
	          but thats simones part
	
	                    viktor
	          yes of course it is
	              gazing at her face
	          you know you have a line here  not
	          a wrinkle  actually more of a
	          dimple  ive been thinking of
	          incorporating something like that
	          in simone
	
	                    nicola
	              incredulous
	          youd cosmetically alter simone to
	          look like me
	
	                    viktor
	          no of course not youre right 
	          that would be crazy
	
	viktor sits back down and stares out of the window
	
	                    nicola
	          do you want me to do it again
	
	viktor does not reply  nicola quietly leaves

	the front page of variety is dominated by a large
	photograph of simone giving her acceptance speech via

	while the everseductive simone waits patiently onscreen for
	viktors instructions viktor is gazing at the smaller
	monitor  the home video of elaine
	
	viktor freezes the tape  elaine appears particularly
	beautiful

	elaine takes a seat on the sofa  viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her  close
	
	they both knock back their wine in one long gulp both
	apparently in need of courage
	
	                    elaine
	              trying to make
	               conversation

	                    viktor

	          impossible
	
	                    elaine
	              instantly regretting the
	               remark

	                    viktor

	          couldnt let you do that  make
	          that kind of sacrifice
	              meeting his gaze

	          in the back clawed and slept my
	          way to where i am  it goes with
	          the territory  but for some

	          way to say it  theres a goodness
	          to her
	
	                    viktor
	          no there isnt  theres nothing
	          to her

	                    viktor
	          no i will end my relationship with
	          her  totally
	
	                    elaine
	          but you dont understand  shell
	          always be there  at some party
	          on some magazine cover some song
	          on the radio up on some screen
	
	                    viktor
	              desperate
	          no  shell never work again 
	          retire never make a movie or a
	          record or appear ever again
	
	                    elaine
	              confused
	          of course she will  her public
	          will demand it
	
	                    viktor
	          not if i dont let her
	
	                    elaine
	          you
	
	viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage
	
	                    viktor
	          im going to tell you a secret now
	          elaine
	              mustering all his nerve
	          simone is not a real person  i
	          invented her
	
	                    elaine
	              misinterpreting his
	               remark
	          every actor is an invention
	          viktor  dont embarrass yourself 
	          no ones denying that you
	          discovered simone  but its like
	          finding a diamond in the desert 
	          anyone can trip over it but its
	          not the finder who sparkles
	
	                    viktor
	              agitated
	           no no i didnt trip over her 
	          you dont understand 
	
	                    elaine
	              ignoring him
	           you just got lucky that shes
	          loyal enough to stay with you 
	          maybe shes staying out of pity
	          who knows  she certainly doesnt
	          need you  some people even say
	          youre holding her back
	
	                    viktor
	              wounded
	          who says that  
	              shaking off the insult
	           never mind  you have to listen
	          to me elaine  simone is thin air
	          pixels molded by me from a
	          mathematical equation  i inherited
	          it from a madman  i can show
	          you 
	
	                    elaine
	          how much wine have you had
	
	                    viktor
	           shes a figment of my own
	          imagination  i viktor taransky
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax
	          the greatest sleightofhand
	          sleightofmouth sleightof
	          sleight in entertainment history
	          and still no one appreciates me
	          recognizes what ive done  even
	          you
	
	                    elaine
	              rolling her eyes
	          youre drunker than i thought  are
	          you doing that again
	
	                    viktor
	          no  whatever talent simone has
	          comes from me  me  me  i swear
	          as god is my judge  you dont know
	          what ive been through  tens of
	          thousands of mindnumbing hours in
	          front of that screen nights
	          without end and look what its
	          cost me
	              producing his spectacles
	          why do you think ive been wearing
	          these  i may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight and why  to
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being  a human
	          soul
	              a final explanation
	          dont you see  i made simone
	
	a pause  his words hang in the air
	
	                    elaine
	          you made simone
	              a trace of pity
	          viktor she made you
	
	elaine gets up and walks out leaving the distraught viktor
	alone in his house
	
	int  viktors office  day
	
	a hungover viktor enters his office  suddenly he stops and
	confronts the standee of simone
	
	                    viktor
	          you bitch  ill destroy you
	
	jane stares in shock  she discreetly exits
	
	int  viktors soundstage  day
	
	viktor sits in front of his monitor smiling venomously at
	simone  he begins to digitally disrobe simone
	
	montage
	
	a  peering through a gap in the drapes of his malibu house
	    viktor watches max dig through his trash  max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film
	
	    max holds the end up to the light  his eyes pop
	
	b  the echo headline screams simones hard core past and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked simone in a
	    compromising position
	
	    viktor hovering at a supermarket checkout line
	    overhears two women discussing the article
	
	                    woman 1
	          disgusting
	
	                    woman 2
	              sympathetic
	          she must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that so
	          depraved
	
	                    woman 1
	          im still naming my baby after her
	
	                    woman 2
	          youre having a boy
	
	                    woman 1
	          so
	
	    viktor blanches  it is not the reaction hed hoped for
	
	c  inside a theater viktor hovers by the door smirking
	
	    on screen we hear a farmyard scene  simone in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours grunting like a pig and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables
	
	    the audience is shocked then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause
	
	    viktor enraged exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    i am pig  starring simone
	
	d  a pretentious film critic talks to camera a film poster
	    behind him
	
	                    film critic
	          for simone to do something as brave
	          as i am pig at this point in her
	          career with so much to lose  all
	          i can say is i am pig i am
	          oscar
	
	e  in his soundstage viktor moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to simone
	
	f  simone appears on a morning talk show  as usual remote
	    on a tv screen  however her squeakyclean image has
	    gone  hair unkempt bloated chainsmoking and drinking
	    during the interview  the hosts are smiling weakly
	
	                    host
	          simone thats a rather
	          controversial position
	
	                    simone
	          i just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range  so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves  we could fit it
	          inbetween recess and american
	          history
	
	another clip
	
	                    simone
	          if theres a hole in the ozone
	          layer why cant i see it
	
	another clip
	
	                    simone
	          immigration  god isnt it
	          crowded enough
	
	                    hosts
	          just as we always knew  simones
	          not like other celebrities  she
	          speaks her mind
	
	g  viktor driving along a city street suddenly slams on his
	    brakes almost causing an accident  he stares numbly up
	    at a twentyfoot high smiling photo of simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of time magazine  it
	    reads simone woman of the year
	
	                    viktor
	              to himself
	          shes trying to kill me
	
	realizing what hes said a thought comes into his eyes
	
	ext  cemetery  day
	
	an inscription on a headstone reads
	
	                         hank aleno
	                remembered virtually forever
	
	viktor kneels at hanks grave  he places a bunch of flowers
	there
	
	                    viktor
	              referring to the flowers
	          theyre plastic hank  i know
	          thats the way youd want it
	              glancing to a simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall
	          she killed you hank  now shes
	          killing me  shes a serial killer
	              ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               simone is watching him
	          but i dont know how to stop her 
	          shes taken on a life of her own 
	          i cant just come clean  make
	          some confession  ive defrauded
	          millions  theyd turn on me  and
	          i cant put the genie back in the
	          bottle  if she stopped working 
	          dropped out of sight theyd never
	          let it rest  ive tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more
	              more desperate
	          what am i going to do hank
	
	a thought occurs to viktor  he slowly rises from behind
	hanks headstone revealing a forest of headstones
	
	                    viktor
	          dont say another word hank  you
	          are truly a genius
	
	int  viktors soundstage  dusk
	
	a sad but resolute viktor sits in front of his monitor
	simones face full screen
	
	he speaks into the voice synthesizer simones face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks  the final time
	he puts his words in her mouth
	
	                    simone  viktor
	          whats the matter viktor  you
	          look so sad  dont you love me
	          anymore its over isnt it
	
	he switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice
	
	                    viktor
	          its the only way simone  if its
	          any consolation youre going to
	          live on in the publics heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time  theres no
	          love like posthumous love
	
	on the screen simone is on the verge of tears
	
	                    viktor
	          i know what youre thinking  its
	          a phoneybaloney world  the women
	          are surgically enhanced the
	          athletes are on steroids the
	          singers are lipsyncing if theyre
	          even singing at all the news is
	          entertainment the politicians are
	          bought and paid for  were living
	          one big lie  so why shouldnt you
	          live too  youre more authentic
	          than the people who adore you
	              a trace of despair
	          and thats the problem  youre
	          looking at the real fraud  i told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth it
	          wouldnt matter to me  and it
	          does  it wasnt that the artists
	          had no respect for the art  they
	          had no respect for me  someone
	          like you you have so much love
	          showered on you  i just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face  im
	          sorry simone  here ive been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist but i was really trying
	          to convince them that i exist 
	          its not that you arent human
	          simone its that i am
	
	viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked plague  ver
	81  he places the disc in the machine
	
	viktor sees that simone is crying  he touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own
	
	viktor hesitates  a moment of doubt  then presses
	enter  the image of simones face gradually begins to
	deconstruct  pixel by pixel  as the virus takes hold 
	the pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen

	                    viktor
	              resigned smile
	          why stop at one character when you
	          can have a whole cast
	
	                    elaine
	          exactly  now that you have the
	          studio behind you we can really do

	viktor shrugs resignedly savoring his freedom
	
	                    elaine
	              holding viktor close
	          i was thinking  what about you
	          and simone moving back in with
	          me and lainey
	
	                    viktor
	              meeting her gaze
	          that sounds wonderful
	              to lainey
	          how do you feel about all this
	          lainey
	
	                    lainey
	              beaming
	          about you and mom
	
	                    viktor
	              reluctant admission
	          me and simone  what i did
	
	                    lainey
	              sweet smile

	once again his daughters words have a ghastly ring of truth 
	viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters
	
	he recognizes max and milton amongst the mob  max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
	window 
	
	will pay  for exclusive  viktor looks away
	
	                    elaine
	              kissing him on the cheek

	          not a death sentence
	
	                    viktor
	              still staring out of the

	int  frank brand tv studio  day
	
	frank brand conducts a remote interview with simone who
	appears as usual on a television monitor
	
	                    frank brand
	           simone the question on
	          everyones mind is simply why
	
	                    simone
	          frank you know as well as i do
	          living in a fish bowl the
	          insatiable appetite of the media
	
	frank nods sympathetically
	
	                    simone
	          with everything that was going on
	          in my life i just needed to drop
	          out of sight for a while  i
	          needed time  viktor bought me that
	          time  i owe him so much
	
	                    frank brand
	          we all do
	              quickly returning to
	               simone
	          but now i understand youre eager
	          to get back to work  and not the
	          kind of work that were all
	          expecting
	
	                    simone
	              smiles coyly
	          thats true  i can reveal that i
	          am considering a career in
	          politics
	
	                    frank brand
	          and what may i ask brought this on
	
	simone holds up a beautiful baby boy to camera
	
	                    simone
	          i suppose this little man had
	          something to do with it  viktor
	          and i are both concerned about what
	          kind of world our new son chip is
	          going to grow up in
	              turning lovingly to
	               viktor

	on frank brands monitor the camera pulls back to reveal
