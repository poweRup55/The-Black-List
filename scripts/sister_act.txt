     int girls room

     christine is now in the deserted st annes girls room 
     she is standing on tiptoes looking in the mirror  she has 
     taken her hair out of its neat barrettes she is combing it 
     out  she applies lipstick

     christine reaches into her schoolbag she pulls out a 
     stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on  she 
     unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse  
     she sprays herself with dime store cologne

     ext hallway

     christine opens the girls room door she looks both ways  
     no one is around she saunters down the hall

     angle on a door marked broom closet
     christine opens this door  she looks into the closet 
     there is a very nervous thirteenyearold boy waiting for 
     her inside

                               christine
               hi jimmy

     christine slips inside the closet and closes the door 
     behind her

     angle on sister immaculata

     striding down the hall with a bloodthirsty look in her 
     eye and a nastylooking wooden ruler in her hand  she 
     flings open the broom closet door

     angle on christine and jimmy

     in the broom closet  jimmys face is covered with 
     lipstick  christines hair is awry  the couple has 
     clearly been making out

                               sister immaculata
                             outraged
               miss christine carter  again  dont 
               you know what happens to girls like you  
               dont you know what they become

     int christys apartment  angle on a large tattered 
     posternight today

     taped over a crack on a wall  the poster shows a 
     glittering christy van cartier  singing star of a fifth
     rate vegas lounge  christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster  she has clearly lived up or 
     down to all of sister immaculatas expectations

     the camera pans through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs a neon sign flashes outside the window 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises  a dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere

     we hear the movement of bed springs as someone sits up in 
     the dark

                               christys voice
               come on vince  hold me a minute

                               vinces voice

                               vinces voice
               the best

     vince larocca stands at the mirror adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair  vince is a powerful charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat  vinces hold over christy is 
     obvious if unfortunate he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute ruthless and dangerous the next

                               vince
                             half to christy half 
                             to the mirror

                             starting to fall for

                               vince
                             looking deep into her 
                             eyes
               he said that if i got a divorce id burn 
               in hell  for all eternity

     animal she is caught between tears and rage

     gown  michelle and tina wear matching gowns and wigs  the 
     band begins a doowop vamp

               over there the one with the wavy hair

     as they sing their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style

     page 7

     a lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number  while christy does her best her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other ronelles

     the lounge itself is practically empty except for a few 
     drunken shriners and a couple of college kids  police 
     lieutenant eddie mulcahy sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on christy  an easygoing charmer eddie gives 
     her a wink but she responds with an upyours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues

     int dressing room  later

     a small cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation  christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror and the ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away  clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear

                               christy
               screw this dump  its a roach motel 
               with sequins  every guy i meet is either 
               married a cop or a lush from des 
               moines

                               michelle
               but what about us

                               tina

               the moves

               this rathole  youre holding me back 
               just like vince  i should be headlining

     a pockfaced weasel of a man named joey opens the door and 
     leans into the room

                               christy

     joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near christy

     to an executive suite  she tries the knob but finds the 
     door locked  pulling a key from her purse she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices  she 
     tosses the key onto the receptionists desk

                               joey
               christy

     hurls it as high and as far as she can to the opposite end 
     of the room

               come on christy  theres no place to 
               go

     christy steadies herself against a xerox machine  she 
     accidentally activates the machine which lights up and 
     starts humming

     angle on willy as he hears the xerox machine  he quickly 
     moves toward the sound

     willy reaches the xerox machine the area is deserted  he 
     starts moving quickly down the aisle   a chair the kind on 
     casters comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways 
     the chair hits willy and he falls

     christy runs out of the cubicle willy is on the floor 
     struggling to get up  as christy sprints away willy 
     shoots at her  he misses but a glass partition shatters

     christy runs for an open elevator but it has been 
     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to 
     close she runs even faster  a bullet whistles past her 
     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator  she reaches 
     for the doors a moment too late and the elevator is gone

     christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs 
     into a stairwell as two more bullets bite pieces out of the 
     door

     int stairwell

     taking the stairs three at a time christy is flying 
     still clutching the mink  the thugs are gaining on her  a 
     bullet hits metal and ricochets off several walls and 
     steps

     at the next landing christy opens the door and ducks into 
     a corridor

     int corridor

     exhausted but powered by adrenaline christy sprints past 
     doors to the end of the hall still with the mink  joey 
     appears from the stairwell just as christy ducks into a 
     supply room

     int supply room

     christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a 
     pile of dirty linen  joey opens the door just as christy 
     dives head first into the laundry chute

     int laundry chute

     christy lying atop the mink flies through the chute like 
     a subway train through a tunnel

     int basement

     the chute spits christy out like a bullet into a huge bin 
     of dirty linen  two workers glance around as they load 
     large washing machines with laundry  christy climbs out of 
     the bin and dashes for a door  working in a hotel the 
     workers have seen everything

     joey flies through the chute

     int basement

     joey suddenly flies into the bin  he climbs out with his 
     gun in sight

                               joey
               which way

     the workers point to the door and joey rushes across the 
     room  one of the workers is now wearing the mink coat

     ext street  night

     joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street  he 
     looks in every direction but the nearby streets have 
     swallowed christy into safety for the moment

     page 19

     int stained class window  day

     jesus delivers the sermon on the mount in vibrant red 
     blue and green stained glass  an organ plays a hymn  
     badly  notes are missed skipped over and mutilated

     pan down to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient st katherines convent  the organ isnt 
     getting any better and we see it is being played by sister 
     alma a seventyyearold nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid  apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning because 
     sister alma doesnt seem to realize how badly shes 
     playing

     as the last nun in the procession enters the chapel she 
     closes the door behind her  across the lobby the front 
     door opens and eddie enters with a very reluctant christy

                               christy
                             to eddie
               i hate you  i totally hate you

                               eddie
               safest place in the world  you think 
               vince would look for you here

     as christy looks around the lobby various religious 
     artifacts loom at her we see them from her terrified p0v 
     angle on a crucifix casting an ominous shadow a stack of 
     hymnals and a large framed sunday schoolstyle portrait 
     of st katherine  christy shudders

                               christy
               nuns eddie  there are nuns here 
               everywhere  its crawling with em

                               eddie
               its a convent  all you have to do is 
               shut up behave yourself and get along

                               christy
               with nuns  with rulers  no way  im 
               gonna go back work things out with 
               vince

     christy turns to head back to the entrance but eddie 
     catches her arm

                               eddie
               vince has put out a contract on you  a 
               hundred grand  youve seen him in 
               action

     christy searches his eyes for a lie but realizes hes 
     telling the truth

                               christy
               but but vince loves me  how could 
               he i mean five years

     page 20

                               eddie
               and one bullet  thats all its gonna 
               take

                               christy
                             suddenly scared
               but vince has contacts all over the 
               place  this is san francisco  theyll 
               be looking for me

                               eddie
               everywhere but this little holeinthe
               wall convent  nobody knows youre here 
               but me  were trying to get a quick 
               court date  a month maybe two tops 
               ill spring you as soon as i can

                               christy
                             panicking
               i cant stay here  ill crack up 
               eddie what am i gonna do

                               eddie
               pray
                             smiling

     from inside the chapel the choir begins to sing a hymn 
     horribly  the voices dont blend and individual notes are 
     real migraine material  christy looks aghast  eddie urges 
     her into a corridor and she follows

     int mother superiors office

     the office is bare and austere  mother superior sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded  like all the nuns at the 
     convent she wears the traditional fulllength habit and 
     wimple

     mother superior is in total command of all she surveys 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules  control is her passion within the walls of the 
     convent she has created a world she can trust because its 
     a world she controls

               but mother superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment  bishop george 
               ohara stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news

                               mother superior
               absolutely not  i am very sorry but 
               no

                               ohara
               we can save this young womans life and 
               imprison a parasite  all in one 
               gesture

     page 21

                               mother superior
               but shes been exposed to the underside 
               of life  she is the underside of life

                               ohara
               and therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation

                               mother superior
               were a small convent bishop  surely 
               there are more appropriate shelters

                               ohara
               your small convent is in danger of 
               closing reverend mother  the las vegas 
               police department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation

                               mother superior
               but bishop

                               ohara
               st katherines is a benedictine order 
               you have taken a vow of hospitality  to 
               all in need

                               mother superior
               i lied

                               ohara
               i know
                             smiling

     mother superiors jaw locks  she realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can  there is a knock at the door and eddie and christy 
     enter

                               ohara
               welcome lieutenant  everything is in 
               order

                               eddie
               aces  bishop  maybe a cup of coffee 
               down at the corner

     the thought of being left alone with mother superior 
     panics christy like a child left in the principals 
     office

                               christy
               hey youre not leaving me alone

                               ohara
                             reassuringly
               youre never alone in this house my 
               child

     eddie touches her gently on the arm

                               ohara
                             opening the door to

     ext the convent  a few seconds later

     eddie and bishop 0hara are leaving by the convents 
     front door  as they exit they hear the choir singing 
     horribly they both wince at the sound and then chuckle

                               mother superior
               i joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago  at that time the world knew some 
               measure of peace  and hope  our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality to families 
               to children to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise  and as the years have 
               passed i have watched that promise 
               destroyed  drugs  gangs
                             staring at christys 
                             outfit spandex  and 
                             so i have made this 
                             convent an oasis a 
                             retreat from horror 
                             and now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls

                               christy

     int convent dining hall

     a large whitewashed gothic room with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier  there is a long central wooden 
     table with rough wooden benches

     the convents population is standing around the table in 
     silence  there are about thirty nuns in all

     mother superior moves to the head of the table with 
     christy following her  she motions for christy to stand at 
     her right

               mary clarence

     angle on sister mary robert the nun standing beside 
     christy  sister mary robert is naive and mouse like but 
     very sweet  she has only been at the convent a few years 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice  she sneaks a look 
     at christy  her eyes widen and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands

                               mother superior
               mary clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent  she 
               is eager for a more disciplined life and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways

     everyone sits including christy  sister mary patrick a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table waves her hand mary 
     patrick is extremely cheerful a truly upbeat person

               a blessing  like for lunch

                             blessing
               for what we are about to receive

     so far so good  mother superior has one eye open

                               christy
               may the lord prepare us and watch 
               us and walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and to the republic for

               you might also enjoy a ritual fast

     ext convent vegetable garden  day

     the vegetable patch is located behind the convent on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls  various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed

     several nuns are working in the patch weeding and raking 
     they wear large ungainly straw hats over their wimples

     christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat  she is 
     hacking at the dirt with great disinterest  she picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching  she starts to gnaw on the carrot  
     she becomes aware that someone is watching her  she looks 
     up

     sister mary robert is watching christy eat the carrot 
     breaking her fast  christy drops the carrot on the ground 
     as if it burned her  mary robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over

     tasks  christy decides that she will try and make sister 
     mary  robert talk  she picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at mary robert  mary robert jumps  she waggles a finger 
     at christy scolding her  mary robert resumes hoeing

     nearer to mary robert  very gently she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift mary roberts skirt and gooses her

     mary robert vips very loudly  all the other nuns turn 
     and stare at mary robert scolding her  christy waggles 
     her finger at mary robert scolding her

     their doors for the night

     mother superior glides down the hall followed by a dusty 
     bedraggled christy  christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread

     small window in her cell  she leans her head against the

               here  no electricity  cold water bare 
               feet  those were nuns  it was hell on 
               earth but i loved it  this place is a 
               hilton

     int bathing room

     a stone room that is very medievallooking  one wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions  in each stall is 
     a nun standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water  we see only the nuns heads 
     and shoulders

     still sleepy christy leans against the wall of her stall 
     her eyes closed  lost in thought she begins singing 
     softly to herself

               my boyfriends back
               and youre gonna be in trouble

                               a few other nuns
                             very softly
               heyla heyla

     christy looks up from her reverie she looks around  the 
     other nuns are bathing their eyes down  there is no sign 
     of singing  christy decides to try a test

                               christy
               my boyfriends back
               hes gonna save my reputation

                               a few of the nuns
                             still very softly
               heyla heyla

                               christy

     the nuns giggle

                               christy
               where did that come from

                               mary patrick

                               mary patrick
               1961  62  mary clarence thats when 
               many of us took final vows  its the 
               last secular music we recall

                               christy

                             cutting off the song
               thats enough  weve got to get to 
               chapel

     mary lazarus leaves the bathing room and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves  christy looks around

                               christy
               anybody got conditioner

     int chapel  a few minutes later

     bishop ohara is leading the sunday mass  he stands in 
     the pulpit  the choir nuns stand in a fencedin area to 
     his left  the remaining nuns including christy and mother 
     superior sit in the first few pews

                               ohara
               we are a small congregation this 
               morning  too many mornings  something 
               has gone terribly wrong   where is 
               faith  where is celebration  where is 
               everyone  still rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present  our 
               choirmistress sister mary lazarus has 
               informed me that our choir while always 
               superior has been toiling especially 
               hard on this weeks selection  sister

     mary lazarus raises her hand and the choir begins 
     singing they sing a traditional hymn let thy thoughts be 
     guided as always their singing is dreadful they have no 
     tempo or pitch and the hymn becomes an offkey drone

     as the hymn continues the camera pans over the chapel 
     aside from the nuns it is almost empty only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance

     angle on christy

     sitting with the other nuns  she is clearly about to fall 
     asleep  then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note and christy jerks awake  she immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer she looks like a somewhat demented sunday 
     school calendar

                               mother superior 0s
               mary clarence

     mother superior has returned with mary patrick  everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion that no one has 
     noticed their entrance

                               christy
                             thinking on her feet
               because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast  and dont forget fiber

     int mother superiors office  later that day

     mother superior is seated behind her desk she is very 
     angry  christy sits across from her

                               mother superior
               a balloon and a banana  tell me mary 
               clarence what were you thinking

                               christy
               those girls were asking questions  
               theyve got it rough  i wish somebody 
               had talked to me about that stuff when 
               was their age  i wish somebody would 
               talk to me about it now

                               mother superior
               this is a convent not a clinic  we 
               offer moral guidance not hardware

                               christy
               have you been out in those streets  do 
               you know what those kids are up against  
               you should help them

                               mother superior
               we are nuns  we seek solutions through 
               prayer

     page 42

                               christy
               sometimes its not enough

                               mother superior
               you are correct  sometimes prayer alone 
               cannot help a situation  such as your 
               own for example  how do you feel about 
               physical labor

                               christy
               it never solves anything

                               mother superior
               do your recall the words of saint peter 
               in ecciesiastes 127  he spoke unto a 
               wastrel youth  he said take up thy 
               task and know ye the path of 
               contentment

                               christy
               in english

                               mother superior
               how to put it ah of course mary 
               clarence  no pain no gain

     mother superior smiles in a rather evil manner

     willy heads for the fax machine  vince regains his 
     composure and picks up his own phone he pushes a button

     int convent crafts room

     this is a large open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself  
     several nuns sit at a table diligently handpainting 
     christmas cards and making christmas tree ornaments

     on the other side of the room is a large freestanding 
     loom which resembles a grand piano  the loom is wooden a 
     tapestry is halfcompleted  mary patrick is seated at the 
     loom which is a complicated mechanism  christy stands 
     beside her

                               mary patrick

     crafts room  an hour later

     angle on the wall hanging which has progressed 
     considerably

     angle on christy leaning against the wall thumbing 
     through a magazine

     angle on mary patrick hard at work at the loom

                               mary patrick
               shuttle beat shed  and watch your 
               heddles

                               christy
               i love my heddles  show me again

     mother superior appears

                               mother superior
               mary clarence  how is your weaving 
               progressing

                               mary patrick
               oh shes doing just fine reverend 
               mother 

     page 45

                               christy
               really catching on

                               mother superior
               good  mary patrick i need you in the 
               office  mary clarence carry on

     mother superior gestures to the loom  christy sits at the 
     loom and waves as mother superior and mary patrick exit

     christy stares at the loom a look of horror crosses her 
     face  she has not been paying attention to mary patricks 
     instructions  she cracks her knuckles as if she were 
     about to play the piano  she grabs two parts of the loom 
     at random  she moves these parts

     angle on the loom  as a result of christys movements 
     the loom collapses piece by piece  the tapestry unravels 
     the many skeins of wool snap and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor as christy watches aghast

     int corridor

     mother superior is striding down the hall she is livid 
     christy trails behind her trying to keep up

                               christy
               im sorry im not a weaver

                               mother superior
               months of work and the loom absolutely 
               ruined

                               christy
               look this isnt my kind of thing  i 
               wasnt cut out to make little tapestries 
               or knit little sweaters i dont do that  
               im a star

     mother superior stops dead in her tracks she turns and 
     stares at christy  then she smiles in a rather 
     frightening manner

     montage  christy

     aon her hands and knees scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway

     bcrawling along between the pews in the chapel oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag

     ccrawling along the convent roof cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel  she discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters

     page 46

     dsewing she is repairing a hole in a habit  the camera 
     pulls back  christy is sitting in a small stone room 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits linen and other 
     mending

     int mother superiors office

     christy is on the phone in the darkened office  she keeps 
     checking the door to make sure no one is listening

                               christy

               mulcahy

     christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically  intercut between christy and eddie

                               christy
               eddie youve got to get me out of here

               but its a nightmare  mother superior 
               is out to get me  she hates my guts she 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture

     in the distance christy hears the choir practicing they 
     sound even worse than usual

                               christy
                             holding the phone 
                             out
               do you hear that  that choir  eddie 
               in here thats what they call music

               dont call again  its not safe  ill 
               be in touch

     as the line goes dead mother superior enters  christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver she 
     sings as she works

                               christy
               the hills are alive with the sound of 
               music

     still singing christy breezes out of the room  mother 
     superior looks mystified

     int christys cell  midnight

     christy is lying flat out on her bed in her habit 
     utterly exhausted by the weeks hard labor  there is a 
     meek scratching at her door

                               christy
                             without moving
               yeah

     sister mary robert enters very shyly  she barely looks 
     up

                               christy
               what  what does she want now  i did 
               the dishes  i oiled the pews  i dusted

                               mary robert
                             not speaking above a 
                             whisper

     mary robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread  christy takes it

                             until almost 
                             whispering
               mary robert  im mary robert

               she said that  reverend mother

     mary robert nods solemnly  suddenly from the streets 
     outside the convent we hear a blast of hot dance music 
     and the sound of laughter and carefree conversation

                               christy
               well then theres only one thing to do

               experience right in life  in order to 
               make a responsible decision  this is 
               going to be very painful for me  you

     wall  she speaks to the crucifix and listens as if jesus 
     is advising her

     on the steps sipping beers and smoking  among the 
     teenagers are the girls from christys christian youth

     falls silent

     the club is alive with activity the bar is crowded 
     couples are making out at small tables and the dance floor 
     is packed  the atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party with people of all 
     ages and races  the music percolates and christy starts 
     to move to it  she and mary robert find a table in the 
     corner and signal a nearby waitress

                               christy
               a couple of bowls of chili
                             holding up the beer
               and another round of these

     the waitress looks at the two women strangely the club 
     has never hosted nuns before

                               mary robert
                             to the waitress 
                             confidentially

               nun

                               christy

               and she wants to be a nun

     the waitress leaves shaking her head  christy and mary 
     robert watch the action at the club

     across the room mike the bartender stares at the nuns 
     especially christy he tries to place her

                               mary robert
               who are all these people

     from across the room mike the bartender continues to 
     study christys face  he takes out a copy of vinces fax 
     photo and stares at it  he covers christys hair in the 
     photo with his hands creating a wimple  there is no 
     question in his mind the two are the same  mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron

     there is a live band on a small stage at one end of the 
     club  they start playing a hot dance number and the club 
     really begins to cook as the dance floor fills  christy 
     and mary robert both still seated start to move with the 
     music

     a very goodlooking local dude comes over to the nuns 
     table  he is clearly amused at their presence

     she grabs another dude and heads for the dance floor

     as the music percolates christy and mary robert dance  
     christy is very hot and mary robert picks up on her moves  
     the club patrons are delighted and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down

     club patrons cheer shouting hallelujah and amen

     ext street  night

     christy and mary robert are walking back to the convent 
     they are both in very good spirits

               those people are wonderful  why dont

               from the other sisters  sometimes 
               well sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson

                               christy
               honey

     as the two women laugh together they dont notice the car 
     that begins to follow them creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out

     page 55

                               mary robert
               i cant wait to tell reverend mother 
               about all my experiences  ive learned 
               so much

                               christy

               her everything  i mean nothing really 
               happened  we just took a walk

     the cars bright lights suddenly switch on and the nuns 
     turn startled  the car hurtles toward them  they scream 
     and christy grabs mary robert and throws her out of the 
     cars path the two women land on a pile of garbage bags

     struggling to her feet christy sees the car go into 
     reverse and then pull forward again  she sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the cars driver mike the 
     bartender leans out the window

                               christy
                             to mary robert
               run

     christy shoves mary robert towards an alley  as she does 
     so the gun goes off with a red flash  the shot misses the 
     two women and shatters a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them

     ext alley

     running up the alley christy and mary robert hear mikes 
     footsteps chasing them growing louder as he gains on them

                               mary robert
               mary clarence 

                               christy
               keep moving

     christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape and shoves mary 
     robert up the ladder ahead of her

                               christy
               climb  now

     as christy and mary robert climb the fire escape another 
     gunshot echoes in the alley ricocheting off the fire 
     escape

     the nuns climb higher up the building  mike pursues 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings but 
     not finding any openings  he takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground

     at the fourth floor landing christys heel gets stuck in 
     the grating  she pulls frantically at the laces

     mike arrives at the landing just as christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun  mikes hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape and the gun flies loose rattling 
     down the metal steps to the landing below  christy shoves 
     mary robert into the open window of an apartment and 
     follows her in

     int tenement apartment

     christy and mary robert leap into the bedroom of an 
     hispanic couple their arms wrapped around each other in 
     bed  at the womens entrance the couple looks up stunned 
     to see two nuns in their bedroom

                               mary robert
               oh my lord

     intconvent corridor  day

     christy sits alone outside mother superiors office 
     listening to the loud ticking of the clock on the wall she 
     seems small and vulnerable like a child sent to the 
     principals office

     the door opens and eddie emerges from the office

                               christy
               whatd she say

                               eddie
               you blew it  big time  she doesnt 
               want you back

                               christy
               does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there

                               eddie
               shes counting on it  shes concerned 
               for your safety but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you or a carnival

                               christy
               so what am i supposed to do in the 
               meantime

                               eddie
               go in and talk to her  it cant hurt 
                             urging her
               go

     reluctantly christy rises and approaches the door  she 
     looks at eddie who motions her to go in  she finally 
     does

     int mother superiors office

     mother superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     christy enters  christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy

                               christy
               so hi there

               to each other

     page 58

     mother superior glances up from her work  she is 
     justifiably outraged

                               mother superior
               mary roberts life was in danger your 
               behavior was inexcusable

               you present an ongoing threat both to 
               this convent and to yourself

     mary lazarus cuts off this chitchat thrusting a hymnal at 
     christy

     random keys and they even have trouble with the words  no 
     one looks up from their hymnals  sister alma the organist 
     with the hearing aid is plodding along

     the nuns has to nudge sister alma to stop her playing

     room eyeballing each member of the choir

               with all due respect lets have a 
               look at this

     christy goes over to the piano  she examines the sheet 
     music for let they thoughts he guided  she sits at the 
     piano beside sister alma  christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano accompanying herself

                               christy
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed

     christys singing voice is as usual not very good  she 
     stops singing  for perhaps the first time in her life she 
     has really heard herself

                               christy
               man  i sound like you guys

                             standing
               mary robert

     mary robert jumps startled by the attention 

                               mary robert
               what

                               christy

               never really sing  you whisper nothing 
               comes out

     sister alma plays the note  christy points the baton at 
     mary robert  mary robert whispers the note

                               christy
               louder  like youre onstage

     mary robert sings a little louder

                               christy
               like people are eating and theres 
               silverware and you want them to hear 
               you

     mary robert sings louder still

                               christy
               think about that guy you were dancing 
               with

     mary robert finally lets out her full voice which is huge 
     and glorious  after singing a single perfect note she 
     stops abruptly she has scared herself

                               mary robert
               oh my

                               christy
               sister alma  a c

     sister alma plays the note and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it but the results arent much better than before christy 
     uses her pitchpipe she circulates among the nuns giving 
     each her note urging them closer to pitch

                               christy
               middle section hold that note for dear 
               life  sopranos an a  sister alma

     sister alma hits the note  christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections then gets a third note going 
     with the altos using her pitchpipe

     for one moment the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord  they are elated

                               mary patrick

                             disconcerted
               that was exciting

                               christy

               blend  youve got to listen to each

               because were

                               all the nuns
               going to the chapel
               and were gonna get married

                               mary patrick
               going to the chapel of love

     the nuns have really gotten into the song with christy 
     encouraging them verbally  they are sounding better and 
     better

     sister mary frederick a member of the choir steps into 
     the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden piercing 
     whistle  the nuns immediately stop singing and a moment 
     later mother superior enters

     the room is quiet except for the sound of the washer
     dryer the nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks

                               nuns
                             in unison
               good morning reverend mother

                               mother superior
               good morning sisters

     mother superior takes one more glance around then leaves

     now that the coast is clear the singing begins again 
     quietly to the rhythm of the machine

                               nuns
               going to the chapel

     int chapel

     bishop ohara is leading the sunday mass

                               bishop ohara
               welcome this sunday morning 0 ye few 
               and faithful

     page 68

     as usual the chapel is almost empty except for the nuns 
     the choir is in place behind the pulpit

                               bishop ohara
               the choir i am told has elected a new 
               director  sister mary clarence who 
               will lead them in hymn 127

     christy nods to the bishop and signals to sister alma 
     who begins the accompaniment

                               choir
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed

     they sound fantastic  their voices blend with a heavenly 
     harmony as they sing the slow melodic hymn  mother 
     superior is startled by this new sound

     ext street

     lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with 
     curiosity as the beautiful music drifts out to the street  
     a few other heads turn but with only mild reactions

     int chapel

     at the end of the first verse christy signals the choir 
     to stop  theres a hush in the chapel as christy glances 
     at the vacant pews  then she turns to sister alma and 
     nods sister alma strikes a bold stirring chord

     several of the nuns blink  bishop ohara glances at the 
     organ with surprise  mother superior sits up with a 
     stiffened back and a severe expression

     as the chord grows in force christy gives the choir a 
     beat

                               christy
               one two three

     the choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn 
     christy strides up and down in front of the choir 
     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem with a 
     passionate callandresponse format

                               choir
               let thy thoughts be guided

                               christy

                               choir

                               christy and choir 
               let thy spirit take wing and fly

     spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church

     everyone turns to look  windows open and people glance 
     out the street takes on a new movement

     int chapel

     the choir really lets loose flow

                               christy and choir
               let thy thoughts be strengthened
               let thy prayers be heard
               let our lord rejoice in your praise
               let his goodness lift you to a higher 
               place
               and let love and peace fill your days

     lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the 
     chapel  bishop ohara sees them and beckons them to come 
     in

                               christy
               sister alma

     sister alma inspired by christy and the choir burns up 
     the organ with a solo  more people from the street begin 
     to enter tentative curious drawn by the music

     at the end of the solo christy makes a gesture to the 
     choir and each member produces a tambourine  the chapel 
     is full of energy music and life

     page 70

     mary robert sings really letting the power of her voice 
     ring out  she is astonishingly good

                               mary robert
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed

               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed
               let thy soul take wing and fly

     the new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to 
     the music and after a few beats the nuns join in  mother 
     superior is aghast

     the choir builds to a huge gospel finish all keeping 
     their eyes on christy

                               choir
               let thy spirit

                               christy

               let thy spirit

                               christy

               let thy spirit

                               christy and choir
               let thy spirit take wing and flyi

     after the final note everyone in the chapel is 
     exhilarated  everyone except mother superior  christy 
     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen 
     or more including lawanda and her friends  christy looks 
     happier than she has in years

     int corridor  day

     the members of the choir are all gathered outside mother 
     superiors office leaning close to the door and listening 
     to her harangue christy  they are surprised to find 
     themselves joined suddenly by bishop ohara and part to 
     let him through  he leans down to the keyhole and listens

     int office

               and what next  popcorn  curtain calls

               the joint

                               mother superior

               can wake this place up

               lazarus will resume her leadership of
               the choir

     ohara enters  the other members of the choir are in 
     behind him like sardines

     the nuns are out in force painting the walls of the 
     convent mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright 
     shining suns  the camera pans to christy who is adding 
     her own original touch to the mural using cans of spray 
     paint  christys section includes an image of a nun in a 
     miniskirt and spike heels accompanied by neon letters that 
     read st kate  people gather in the street watching the 
     nuns activities  the convent begins to crackle with 
     energy and life

     a drug deal is going on in a house up the street but the 
     dealers give only a curious glance to the action at the 
     convent

     int mother superiors window

     from the window of her office mother superior watches the 
     painters and feels her control slipping away

     ext street  later

     christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of 
     the street  they get lots of attention each step of the 
     way  as each nun raps the other nuns make rhythmic boom
     box noises

               plan

     the parade goes on the crowd gathers and a general air 
     of jubilance prevails

     int rehearsal room  day

     the rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir 
     is separated into several groups  christy has got the 
     whole thing running like a disciplined broadway cast

     mary patrick leads one group in the corner as they 
     practice synchronized movements with tambourines  colorful 
     streamers are tied to the tambourines and they make 
     colorful patterns in the air

     sister alma pounds the piano with newfound energy as mary 
     robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes 
     theyve only dreamed of in the past

     christy and mary lazarus have corralled the rest of the 
     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps somewhat 
     like the temptations in skirts  mary lazarus keeps the 
     beat with a yardstick

                               christy

               want to see anybody counting  make it

     ext crack house  night

     one of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as 
     a car suddenly pulls up to the curb  he starts toward the 
     car as the driver rolls down the window but before he gets 
     there christy and several nuns surround the car

     page 75

                               christy

               you just had an unhappy childhood and 
               maybe a learning disability  you just 
               need someone to pray for you

                               mary patrick

               misery to your friends and neighbors 
               well pray to find you some honest work

                               christy
               and we know that even though most 
               people would call you a leech and a 
               parasite the lowest slug of humanity we 
               know that deep down inside youre 
               probably even worse  and so you truly 
               need our prayers

                               driver
               what is this  outta my way

     the nuns give him room and the driver zips off down the 
     street  a small crowd has begun to gather and it is 
     growing by the moment murmuring encouragement for the 
     nuns  christy turns to the dealer as other cars drive 
     slowly past

                               christy
               yes prayer is the answer and prayers 
               free  were going to give free prayers to 
               everyone who drives up to this house

     page 76

     the dealers eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his 
     pocket  mary patrick steps forward

                               mary patrick
               are you going to shoot us all tough 
               guy

                               mary lazarus
               is it worth it  a lot of witnesses 
               here

                               christy
                             to the crowd
               can i get a witness

     the dealer glances at the surly crowd then gives the nuns 
     a disgusted look  he puts the gun away

                               dealer
               so ill find another neighborhood to do 
               my business  you can t stop me

                               christy
               if we can stop you here they can stop 
               you there

     the dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger 
     the crowd applauds and cheers

     the picture suddenly becomes grainy and we hear the voice 
     of a news reporter

                               news reporter v0
               it was a truly remarkable scene as the 
               nuns from st katherines literally drove 
               the crack dealers from the neighborhood 
               led by the feisty sister mary clarence

     camera pulls back and we see a tv screen with an image of 
     the nuns and neighbors still celebrating  on top of the tv 
     are several framed photographs of vince laflocca his wife 
     and children

     int vince laroccas living room  night

     connie larocca vinces wife watches the tv news story 
     and calls to vince in the kitchen

                               connie
               vinnie get in here  you gotta see 
               this

     carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer vince 
     appears from the kitchen and glances at the tv screen to 
     see a shot of the convent  he looks at connie and makes a 
     sour face

     page 77

                               vince
               what  nuns  you got me in here to see 
               nuns  isnt there a ball game on or 
               something

     vince turns away from the tv just as a closeup of christy 
     appears on the screen

                               connie
               look  shes adorable

     vince leaves the room and we see christy again as she 
     leads the choir

     int eddies apartment  night

     eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and 
     watching the news on tv at the same time  he pours himself 
     a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce

                               news reporter
               this tiny convent has experienced an 
               amazing turnaround  the sisters have 
               revitalized and taken back their 
               neighborhood all due to the energy and 
               talent of the convent choir a group led 
               by this gifted young nun  tell us mary 
               clarence1 what makes you so special

                             trying to appear 
                             modest and nunlike
               oh im not special bob  its just 
               hard work and prayer

     eddie all but spits out his wine  his eyes are wide as he 
     watches christy being interviewed  in one stride he grabs 
     his hat and coat and is out the door on the run

     ext convent  day

     the sunday morning bell is chiming as crowds of people 
     stream into the convent  the entire neighborhood looks 
     cleaner and the people walk with a spring in their step 
     three local tv stations have remote news crews on the scene 
     doing followups on the story

     int chapel hallway

     last in line christy follows the other choir members down 
     a hallway toward the chapel  suddenly a hand reaches out 
     and grabs her and a second hand covers her mouth as she is 
     pulled into an empty cell

     int cell

     shocked and terrified christy struggles to free herself 
     but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is eddie

     page 78

     eddie releases her and she falls onto the bed

                               christy
               eddie  you scared the hell out of me

               this sundays hymn is inspired by the 
               lesson of mary magdalene  you know the 
               one  mary magdalene was a young lady 
               with a past  she was no stranger to sin

               everybody  many condemned her  the 
               whole neighborhood  but one man refused 
               to do so  one man said hey now wait a 
               minute  listen to the story

     sister alma starts playing a doowop vamp  mary patrick 
     and mary robert step forward from the choir standing 
     beside christy the way the ronelles used to do

     the full choir sings backup while christy mary patrick 
     and mary robert perform intricate girl group choreography

                               choir
               doo lang doolang doo lang

               wish he was mine
               that handsome guy over there
               the one with the wavy hair

     sister alma is surrounded by several street kids who play 
     guitar bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir

     lawanda and her friends sit in a pew moving joyously to 
     the music

     eddie stands in the back of the chapel watching a christy 
     he has never seen before  christy is now glowing with 
     happiness and confidence

     as the song continues we see the chapel is packed to the 
     rafters  a tin bucket is passed around as a collection 
     plate and it overflows with money

     ext convent

     church services are over and happy people stream out of 
     the convent but they dont hurry home  standing in 
     groups they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day 
     there is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the 
     block

     eddie comes down the steps glances back at the convent 
     smiles to himself then crosses the street to his car

     christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that 
     is filled with money

                               mary patrick
               this is so exhilarating  all week long 
               i cant wait till sunday when we sing

                               mary robert
               id rather sing than do anything

                               mary patrick
               its better than ice cream

                               mary robert
               its better than springtime

                               christy
               its better than sex

     everyone looks at christy with astonishment

                               christy
                             catching herself
               i imagine

     everyones attention suddenly turns to bishop ohara as he 
     approaches

                               ohara
               better and better sisters you are 
               truly an inspiration  and i bear 
               gladsome tidings

     the choir gathers around ohara with curiosity

                               ohara
               ive kept the cardinal informed of your 
               progress in the neighborhood  he has 
               been most impressed  and he has invited 
               you to attend a special evening mass at 
               st matthews cathedral on sunday night1 
               to sing for the council of cardinals

     the choir reacts with an excited buzz  the council of 
     cardinals what shall we sing etc

     mother superior appears from the center aisle

                               mother superior
               that is indeed glorious news bishop we 
               will be honored to appear
                             more

                               mother superior contd
               and on such an occasion i feel a 
               completely traditional program will be 
               best

                               christy
               what do you mean

                               mother superior
               the council of cardinals is perhaps the 
               most esteemed body in the entire catholic 
               church  they command the utmost respect  
               your more secular entertainment would 
               be wholly out of place

                               mary patrick
               but reverend mother  everyone loves 
               our new style

                               mary robert
               its brought people back to the church

                               christy
               isnt that why we were asked to sing for 
               those cardinals

                               mother superior
               i believe this can be settled by a 
               simple vote

                               christy
               a vote

                               mother superior
               of course  mary clarence a convent is 
               not a totalitarian state  most major 
               decisions are made by the membership as a 
               whole  a membership that i am certain 
               will vote in a rational and pious manner  
               all those in favor of allowing mary 
               clarence to select a program

     all the nuns look at one another  then slowly one by 
     one they all raise their hands

     mother superior is pure steel at this moment her 
     expression betrays no emotion  christy on the other hand 
     is quite confused

                               christy
               but wait a minute

                               mother superior
               the majority has spoken

     page 84

                               bishop ohara
               reverend mother as always you are a 
               true leader  gracious and understanding

                               mary robert
               it will be wonderful reverend mother 
               youll see

                               mary lazarus
                             gesturing to christy
               shes a pro

                               christy
               what

                               mother superior
               i am certain the presentation will be a 
               great success  congratulations mary 
               clarence  and congratulations to you 
               all

     the nuns cheer and cluster around christy chattering 
     about the upcoming concert as mother superior strides off

     int mother superiors office  day

     seated at her desk mother superior glances up as christy 
     enters

                               christy

                               mother superior

     mother superior continues with her paperwork as christy 
     picks up the phone

                               christy

     mother superior is a very interested eavesdropper

     christy hangs up the phone  she looks at mother superior

                               christy
               hey  your prayers have been answered  
               im leaving  in just a couple of days

               bishop ohara  privately  i have asked 
               to be relocated as soon as possible

               but  why

                               mother superior
               i must go where i can be of use

                               christy
               but  theres so much more to do right 
               here  and look if its about me i 
               mean im gone

                               mother superior

               i have been here thirty years  and yet 
               it would seem i know nothing

                               christy
               but everything thats happening is good  
               you can be a part of it

                               mother superior
               a part of what  mary clarence it is 
               one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into 
               town and declare a holiday  you have 
               raised the sisters expectations you 
               have excited and confused them  they 
               imagine this neighborhood to be some sort 
               of delightful ongoing block party

                             more

               simple  there will be disappointments  
               rude shocks  and you will have vanished  
               how fortunate

                               christy
               okay so i just got things started  but 
               you could build on that  you could keep 
               it going

                               mother superior
               i am sorry mary clarence  i seem to 
               have misplaced my tambourine  good day

     choices

     ext convent  night

     the moon casts shafts of silver light down to the 
     courtyard of the convent  most of the lights in the 
     neighborhood are out at this late hour

     carried by christy  three more candles appear carried by

     the freezer opens and light spills out  christy removes 
     several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the 
     nuns

                               mary patrick

     file folder on tates desk and walks away

     tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside  bored 
     looks at his watch then flips the file folder open and 
     glances at its contents  routine money vouchers for 
     equipment supplies etc  tate is about to close the 
     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye

                               tate
               what the hell is this

     he examines a money voucher for a generous donation to st 
     katherines convent in san francisco  it only takes a 
     moment to put two and two together and tate scrambles for 
     his phone and dials a number

     int corridor

     henry parker waits for the elevator  when it opens hes 
     surprised to see eddie step out

                               parker
               tate said you were gone

                               eddie

               of course  where are the keys

               said youd sign them in the morning

     eddie nods and moves on as parker enters the elevator 
     after a few steps eddie suddenly looks disturbed  he 
     picks up his pace  a little panicky he begins to jog 
     toward the squad room

     int vinces office

     vince is on the telephone  he signals joey and willy and 
     they move quickly toward him

     vince begins to write down the address

     int squad room

     tate is hunched over the telephone talking quietly with 
     his back to the rest of the room  the voucher for st 
     katherines is in his hand as eddie moves quickly toward 
     him

     tate hangs up the phone and boom  eddie hits him from 
     behind like a linebacker drilling him to the floor  other 
     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and 
     alarm  eddie pins tate to the wall and snatches the 
     voucher from his hand

                               eddie
               youre the leak you sonofabitch

     clarkson and another detective restrain eddie before he 
     can hit tate

               get him out of here  downstairs in the 
               cell  i want his ass locked up now

     nobody dares even question eddie at this moment and two 
     detectives drag tate away  eddie grabs tates phone and 
     dials long distance

     everyone makes a final check of their appearance and then 
     the group leaves the room to head for the bus  mary robert 
     and mary patrick are the last to leave except for christy

     christy and eddie hurry down the steps to the side 
     entrance and she almost trips on her choral robes  eddie 
     opens the door and starts outside but christy stops in her 
     tracks

                               christy
               i cant go with you

     eddie jerks her hand and christy follows him reluctantly 
     to the car

     eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street  as the car 
     cruises through an intersection christy looks back at the 
     bus with confusion and sadness  she sees the other nuns 
     rushing back into the convent to look for her

     int rehearsal room

     several members of the choir rush into the room with panic 
     in their eyes

               right behind me

     the horn on the school bus blows loudly down in the 
     street

     illuminates a grimy dimestore christmas tree ornament 
     hanging from a room deodorizer  the ornament is a glittery 
     angel it sparkles in the light

     christy leaves the bathroom still not quite sure

     office  a bored mechanic is watching a small portable tv 
     on the tv is an episode of the flying nun  sally field 
     in full habit is soaring along

     suddenly christy hears the loud roar of a motorcycle 
     starting up over by one of the gas pumps  the biker turns 
     and looks at christy  he has long hair and a beard and 
     moustache and he looks well a bit like jesus

     to follow

     ext st matthews cathedral  day

     we see a network truck parked in front of the landmark 
     cathedral

     int chapel

     there is a sense of chaos in the chapel as technicians set 
     up television equipment and mother superior leads the 
     choir as it rehearses  near the back of the chapel bishop 
     ohara looks concerned over the performance of the choir a 
     cardinal walks up to bishop ohara

                               cardinal
               is this the choir youve been speaking 
               so highly of bishop

               theyre just a bit nervous  theyll be 
               fine

     the choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn 
     mary patrick is close to tears

                               mary patrick
               we sound terrible   we need mary

               her whereabouts are unknown and we must 
               proceed without her  pull yourselves 
               together

     clapping his hands briskly the floor director suddenly 
     steps forward from behind the tv cameras and hustles the 
     choir away from the altar

                               floor director
               okay sisters we have to move on now

               throw a spot on the pulpit  lets get a
