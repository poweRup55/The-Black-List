               over a black screen

               we hear the tinkling of an oldfashioned music box its 
               playing the familiar childhood melody of old macdonald had 
               a farm a small childs voice sings with the tune

               theres something a little eerie and dissonant about it

               in the background we hear the sound of farm animals a 
               cow mooing a horse neighing and so on

               fade in

               int old barn  night

               its night many yesterdays ago were not sure exactly when 
               but we can tell were in the past

               a little boy six years old is sitting next to some bales 
               of hay

               an oldfashioned oilburning lantern is next to him casting 
               flickering shadows on the walls

               and now we see where the tune is coming from the boy staring 
               into a rustic handcarved music box

               the boy hears something

               turning off the music he scuttles behind some bales of hay 
               to hide

               the barn door creaks slowly open

               someone  we cant see who  enters wearing large black 
               boots hes pushing a big container on wheels

               somethings inside the container  we cant see what 
               because its covered by a ratty old tarp its pushed 
               closer its wheels squeaking

               hold on the boy

               in his hiding place worried very worried

               the container stops  right in front of the bales of hay

               inches from the boys face and then 

               black boots throws back the tarp revealing a tangled 
               intriguing contraption of pipes and valves and funnels

               the boy

               peers through the bales of hay not sure what the mans doing 
               but whatever it is its horrific something red and sticky 
               gushes through the valves and pipes going into the funnel 
               sticking into the plastic sac the boy pulls back in fright 
               snapping a piece off the music box causing it to play 
               again the boy is terrified

               black boots turns toward the source of the music

               a look of sheer horror in the boys eyes

               the boys trembling hands scramble to cover the music box

               to stop it to quiet it somehow

               black boots

                advances closer closer  the boy tries to crawl away 
               deserting the music box still playing

               a gloved hand reaches out grabbing his ankle

               the boy struggles

               a lantern falls immediately setting fire to the surrounding 
               straw

               a horrible scream of rage  as the black boots catch fire

               the man writhes screaming a human fireball

               the fire spreads everywhere

               the boy terrified tries to scramble out through a loose 
               plank in the barn wall

               the fire rages on the screaming continues

                                                              smash cut to

               as she grabs the steering wheel

               swerves wildly knocking over a signpost

               moves sloooowly upwards towards her breasts

               ray looks down and sees the smashed wooden sign stuck in 
               the radiator grille he eases it out 

               the sign reads no trespassing  j macdonald

               we stay with ray as he walks deeper into

               lit by the moon and shafts of the car headlights its eerie 
               quiet scary

                                     ray
                              singing to himself

                         ran over a cow  ei ei ohhhhh 

               looking for a place to pee ray turns a corner surrounded by 
               a wall of corn

               he unzips his fly and swaying relieves himself in a wide 
               arc

               for the first time he casually turns to his left to see 

               a scary figure

               silhouetted against the moonlight standing next to him 

                                     ray
                              startled

                but its only a harmless scarecrow arms outstretched on 
               a pole ray suddenly looks down realizes hes pissing on 
               himself and his cape

                                     ray
                         dammit

               int car

               karen is still sitting in the car bopping to music on the 
               cd player she preens herself tucks her breasts into her 
               leopard costume awaiting rays return

               ext corn field  night

               ray appraises the scarecrow  tentatively pokes him its 
               made of straw

                                     ray
                         fuckin scarecrow

               he takes a piece of straw puts it in his mouth he turns 
               around going back to the car moving past the corn field

               suddenly ray halts  something pulls him backwards we 
               hear a ripping sound ray slowly turns around to see 

               his cape  caught on a piece of wire he shudders pulls it 
               off

               ray takes another step forward  did he just hear something 
               in the cornfield with him  or was it his imagination

               int car

               karens a little anxious ray should have been back by now

               she leans out the window trying to look past the open car 
               hood

                                     karen
                              calls out

               no answer karen turns the music off she peers out the 
               window the open hood obscuring her view

               still no sign of ray

               flap flap flap  several nightjar birds flutter out of the 
               cornfield unsettling her  karen contd

                         ray

               still no sign of ray karens starting to get very worried

               somethings not right and then 

               a figure wearing the cape and scream mask pops up next to 
               her  scaring the shit out of her karen freaks

                                     karen
                         geez  that wasnt funny

               the masked figure with the cape just stands outside the car 
               looking at her

                                     karen
                         okay ray im freezing get in the 
                         car

               the masked figure stands there unmoving by her open window 
               just staring a feeling of unease washes over karen maybe 
               this figure isnt ray at all

                                     karen
                         ray

               and then the masked figure raises his arm  and we see a 
               shiny longbladed knife clenched in his fist

               the figure brings the blade down plunging it through the 
               open window  and into karens chest

               karen screams she looks down at the blade and the blood on 
               her bare skin beat

                                     karen
                          owwww that hurt

               the masked figure pulls out the retractable knife blade 
               and takes off his mask it is indeed ray always the joker

               he squeezes the knife handle by way of demonstration a 
               little fake blood comes out of the blade

                                     ray
                         fake blood cool huh

               karen is like totally unamused she wipes herself off 
               glaring

                                     ray
                         oh come on karen

               ray starts stabbing himself in the chest to demonstrate 

                                     ray
                         its a retractable blade you couldnt 
                         cut yourself if you wanted to look

                suddenly another blade protrudes from rays chest a real 
               one a longhandled farm scythe has swung around  hitting 
               him in the back the cold blade ripping through him

               a thin stream of blood drips from his surprised lips

               this definitely aint a trick

               karen screams and screams some more in the darkness we 
               cant see whos wielding the scythe the blade is pulled 
               out ray slumps to the ground dead

               on two boots

                the killers boots black farm boots the blade of the 
               scythe dangles down next to them the boots begin walking 
               around to the other side of the car

               in the car

               karen freaks realizing shes next she quickly locks the 
               car doors

               silence

               the killer seems to have vanished but her windows still 
               halfopen

               karen reaches out for the electric window button she pushes 
               it the window closes closes closes

               whoosh the blade of the scythe swings in at the last second 
               getting caught between the glass and the frame inches from 
               karens face

               as the unseen killer pulls out the scythe and the window 
               automatically closes  karen sees her chance 

               she climbs into the drivers seat hitting the radio 

               the music comes back on loud

               karen turns the ignition key the engine turns over 
               immediately she just might escape 

               on the tires

               they spin in the ditch trying to get traction

               and then  the front tires grab the dirt karens about to 
               free the car when 

               whoosh the blade of the scythe plunges into the rubber 
               deflating the front tire with a rush of air

               karens pov  through the windshield

               obscured by the raised hood she sees the scythe being raised 
               up  and coming down  straight into the engine

               theres some sparks  and a snap of wires being severed

               and the engine dies ditto the music

               silence except for karens hyperventilation

               and then  a final realization comes over karen she 
               looks up remembering shes in a convertible 

               and the top is made of canvas and then 

                the scythe sweeps down in a deadly arc tearing through 
               the top of the car almost slicing her ear off

               a gash opens on her bare arm

               karen screams

               she kicks open the car door  and stumbles into 

               ext corn field  night

               karen runs for her life

               and runs some more

               and someone  or somethings  following her

               ext edge of cornfield  night

               out of breath karen sees a light up ahead

               an old farmhouse people a telephone safety

               ext farm house  night

               she frantically bangs on the door trying to force it open 

                                     karen
                              hysterical

               no answer no ones home

               hurt and bleeding karen turns to her right  and sees 

               an old barn a place to hide

               ext barn  night

               with as much stealth as she can karen pushes open the old 
               creaky barn door she leaves a bloody handprint on the door 

               int barn  night

               its deathly quiet moonlight shining on bales of hay 
               glinting on farm implements

               silence

               then  from outside a cow moos 

               then a loud chuffing sound a horse

               and then  a few chickens begin to cluck

                                     karen
                         shhh shhhh 

               the animals seems to be jittery nervous

               the horse whinnies loudly the cow moos again

               karen puts her hands to her ears trying to block out the 
               unholy chorus 

               she backs away 

               a figure is behind her

               she backs into it and swings around to see 

               a scarecrow burlap skin jagged stitched mouth cold eyes 
               cold and alive

               scarecrows pov looking through the burlap at karen

               the scarecrow raises a gleaming scythe high in the air

               it swings down 

               karen screams for the very last time

                                                                    cut to

               can aiming the camcorder through the clear pane of glass at 
               the top of the door

               he looks up at the angled flipscreen hoping to catch a 
               glimpse of the action but all he sees is a flashing battery

               she spits on the ground walking away

               mac releases his hold on jeremiah

                                     keith

               the preacher nods to billy bob who gently takes the shovel 
               from mac he spits on his palms rubs them together

               as the first pile of dirt hits the coffin 

               ext farm near the graveside  later

               the funerals over as the others walk down the hill jeremiah 
               is shaking hands with the preacher 

                                     jeremiah

                         cant say the same about the law

               as he says this the preacher gets in his car  which we 
               now see is a sheriffs squad car he yanks off his clerical 
               collar as if its been strangling him puts down his bible

               he reaches on the seat and just as swiftly puts a sheriffs 
               hat on his head he eyes the other band members

                                     preacher
                         keep an eye on your guests we dont 
                         want no pot smoking musicians spoiling

                                     jeremiah

                         workin on any big cases

                                     preacher
                         nah things are dead quiet

               as the sheriffs car pulls out jeremiah watches  his eyes 
               are now on the barn some distance away

               macs there pushing open the barn door jeremiah smiles 
               slightly

               int barn  afternoon

               the barn door creaks open

               exploring mac enters the barn by himself its a big run 
               down structure that has seen better harvests

               hanging up is an impressive array of scythes axes hoes 
               and sickles simple functional farm implements  but the 
               light gives their blades a sudden edge of menace

               the afternoon sunlight filters through the wooden slats 
               hitting a pile of straw dust rising up from it

               then mac notices something 

               somebodys legs

                clad in dirty jeans old shoes stretched out and partly 
               hidden behind a barn stall someones sitting there quietly 
               biding their time

               mac moves closer

               and closer until he sees 

               a raggedy old scarecrow propped up against the stall

               harmless

               mac bends over to check it out unaware that theres 
               somebody else in the barn with him

               a scythe

                hanging on the wall is removed from its place

                                     mac
                          is still looking at the old 
                         scarecrow when 

               whoosh  the deadly blade comes sweeping down slicing the 
               air near him mac spins around to see 

               ian scythe in hand stoned doing kung fu moves

                                     ian

               beat mac stares the color drained from his face

                                     ian

                                     jeremiah
                         hes sitting right behind you  on 
                         the mantle

               everyone turns around

               a decorative cremation urn is indeed sitting on the mantle

               jeremiah picks it up he holds the urn tenderly in his hands 

                                     jeremiah
                         my daddy was a man of vision people 
                         always fear what they dont 
                         understand

               jeremiah looks down at the urn hes silent for a moment 

                                     jeremiah
                         he lived for this land and he died 
                         for it rest in peace daddy

               slowly jeremiah lifts the lid off the urn no one wants to 
               look inside finally carl leans over and 

               sneezes scattering ashes

                         sorry

               an awkward beat then

               jeremiah laughs slaps carl on the back 

                                     jeremiah

               macs in a restless sleep on top of the bed the wind has 
               blown the letters around the room he wakes suddenly

               disoriented he runs his hand on the wall above his head 
               feeling the rough texture of stained wallpaper

               from outside theres the soft strains of tinkling music 
               from a childs music box barely discernible over the wind 
               but eerie

               mac sits up in bed looks out the window to 

               the old barn

               thats where the sound is coming from

               as mac stares

               theres a soft flicker of light from inside the barn the 
               flicker grows stronger are those flames coming out under 
               the barn doors

               knock knock

               he grins passing it to ian and carl 

               ian glances out the bus window did he just see a figure 
               pass by

               int barn  night

               close on the row of hanging farm implements inside the barn

               a gloved hand reaches out  and selects the scythe pulling 
               it off its hook we get the feeling its not going to be 
               used for harvesting corn tonight

               ext small farmhouse  night

               a modest farm house in the vicinity of the macdonald farm

               it belongs to jesse the old woman we saw at the funeral

               jesses outside standing by a bonfire engaged in a pagan 
               ritual of protection

               she throws a straw doll into the fire the flames quickly 
               turn it to ash

               she sprinkles some sort of spice on the fire it flares up 
               wildly with the force of a photographic flash

               and as it does 

               a figure is suddenly visible standing on the other side 
               of the bonfire

               the intruder wears a grotesque burlapstitched mask over its 
               head dressed in farmers overalls and boots that weve 
               seen before  a hellish human scarecrow

                and in its hand the long curved blade of a scythe

               the blade of the reaper

               jesse starts backing away her eyes fixed tight on the 
               scarecrow a look of fear and possibly recognition on her 
               face 

                and she turns and runs into the house 

               int small farmhouse living room  continuous

               breathing sharply jesse slams the front door locking it 
               and leaning against it safe only for a moment because 

               crash  the blade of the scythe rips through the wood 
               inches from her face

               jesse screams she runs towards the kitchen as the sound of 
               splintering wood rings out and 

               int kitchen

               jesse frantically searches drawers for a weapon a knife

               int living room

               the front window pane breaks open  a hand reaches in to 
               open the latch jesse runs  the scarecrow is now inside

               on the walls of the house straw dolls symbols and other 
               handmade articles of protection the scarecrow slices at 
               them with the scythe cutting them to shreds

               then the scarecrow stops listening trying to determine 
               where its prey has gone

               ext back of farmhouse  night

               the scarecrow comes out the back door

               moonlight except for the crickets and soft clucking of 
               chickens its quiet

               the scarecrow looks around where did she go

               int chicken house

               its a long structure with hundreds upon hundreds of chickens  
               a real chicken nightmare

               jesse crouches inside the structure terrified trying not 
               to make a sound through the small slats we can see the 
               scarecrow walking slowly past

               ext back of farmhouse  continuous

               the scarecrow pauses then starts to head away towards the 
               cornfield shes fooled him

               int chicken house

               jesse relaxes ever so slightly as the scarecrow moves away

               her foot touches one of the chickens it starts clucking 

               ext back of farmhouse

               the scarecrow whips its head around hearing 

               int chicken house

               jesse cringes praying shes still safe

               crash the scarecrows inside 

               the chickens freak going crazy flapping their wings

               the scarecrows boots trample on eggs smashing them a chaos 
               of chickens and feathers trampled eggs and crazy pecking

               still crouching jesse desperately raises her hands to ward 
               off the blade 

               she screams 

               the blade sticky through the mist of chicken blood and 
               feathers slices the air in a shiny arc 

               and comes to rest with a sickening thump in jesses chest

               as her blood drains out  the blade swings again and again 

               ext farm  sunrise

               the red and orange flare of the rising sun

               int bus  sunrise

               branch thats poked through the fence the tractors parked 
               nearby

               mac has his shirt off sweating in the sun

               he reaches down to the pile of tools nearby picks up a sharp 
               axe about to swing it

               jeremiah grabs the axe handle suddenly

                                     jeremiah
                         not that

               mac glances at the handle jethro macdonald is burned into 
               the handle

               jeremiah takes out another axe 

                                     jeremiah
                         try this one

               mac takes it and with a sure hand chops off the branch

               jeremiah watches proudly

               even mac seems a little pleased with himself

                                     jeremiah

               shot he hoists it up affixing to a pole

               piece of wood trying to fit a stem onto the figure

               dirtbike suddenly in a cloud of dust

               on the side of the road

               he sees a scarecrow perched on two pieces of wood in front 
               of the cornfield it wasnt there before was it

               burlapstitched face overalls straw and

               keith squints at it it cant be

               getting off his bike he moves closer to the scarecrow as 
               we follow his gaze

               for on the scarecrows feet are keiths nikes

                                     keith

               keith whips out his 38 special shouts into the cornfield 
               pointing his gun wildly

               his pistol 

                                     keith
                         why dont you come on out hillbilly 
                         and well talk about it

                         yeah didnt think so fuckin 
                         redneck

               keith tucks the gun in his belt he starts to remove his 
               three hundred dollar nikes from the scarecrow

               he pulls on the right shoe its not coming off so easily

               he tugs on it again

               and again finally he succeeds in pulling it off  revealing  
               a human foot

                                     keith
                         what the f

               keith reaches up toward the burlap scarecrow mask

               he yanks it off 

               its a human face

               although keith doesnt recognize her we do its karen one 
               of the teenagers who was murdered earlier

               keith turns around to scream into the night  when he comes 
               face to face with 

               another scarecrow now standing behind him and this ones 
               quite alive it holds a scythe in its hand

                                     keith
                         yaaaaaaaaaa

               as the blade of the scythe goes into keiths thigh like 
               butter

               keith staggers backwards falls unable to walk he tries to 
               crawl backwards and away

               the scarecrow watches almost studying its prey

               and in his terror and pain keith remembers his pistol

               he might just survive this after all

               he removes it from his belt summoning all his courage

               the scarecrow calmly watches as keith raises the pistol 
               shakily aiming at the burlap face

                                     keith
                         you should have asked the wizard for 
                         some brains asshole

               triumphant keith squeezes the trigger and 

               click huh

               keith pulls the trigger again and again

               click click click nothing

               the scarecrow  dramatically opens its gloved fist all of 
               keiths bullets slowly hit the ground

               somehow someone has previously removed them from keiths 
               gun

               the scarecrow hacks keith again with the scythe the gun 
               clatters to the dirt

               blood spurting keith begins crawling away if he can just 
               somehow get to his dirt bike

               taking its time the scarecrow advances closer closer

               raises the scythe one last time

                                                                    cut to

               ians hand slowly getting closer poking through the 
               front of the harvester

               getting even closer to the sharp blades

               then just as he touches the blade 

               whoomph

               the combine harvester engine starts up

               ian withdraws his hand  just in the nick of time as the 
               harvester roars to life the blade draws a thin gash of blood 
               on his wrist

               mixing board it goes on and one of the bands songs starts 
               playing through a loud speaker

               of the guitar as his weapon

               the bands song continues in the background punctuating the

               int barn  late afternoon

               suzies alone in the barn looking for signs of carl

               through the mess suzie sees  carls camcorder lying on 
               its side

               she picks it up switches it on she rewinds then presses 
               play

               on the camcorder screen a blur of images shot from a low 
               angle some kind of struggle going on drowned out to the 
               sound of blaring rock music things getting knocked over

               we can see carls feet  and someone elses in a pair of 
               black farm boots

                                     suzie

               suzie  fastforwards  to see

               on the camcorder screen

               a gloved hand reaches toward the ground and pulls open what 
               looks like a trap door in the barn floor thats all  then 
               the camcorder goes to static

               suzie looks around zeroing in on the exact location

               she brushes the hay away  revealing  the edge of a hidden 
               trap door she pulls the metal ring it opens  and as she 
               looks down into it

               reverse angle  looking up at suzie

               her face peering over the edge tentatively looking into 
               darkness shes not thrilled about this new development

                                     suzie

               she hears a steady drip drip drip coming from somewhere

               whatever it is it doesnt sound good she cant help herself 
               shes got to look steeling herself she slowly shines her 
               flashlight revealing 

               rusty old irrigation pipes  part of some bigger primitive 
               contraption like the contraption we saw before the fire

               more tangled now and rusty but with the clear plastic sacs 
               and clear pipes still ready for use

               suzie leans back pressing against a lever the machine chokes 
               to life driven by the thunderous sound of a powerful pump

               int barn  continuous

               candy hears the strange noise growing unnerved 

                                     candy
                         suzie

               int secret basement  continuous

               suzie transfixed by the sight of the macabre machine coming 
               to life liquid gushing through the pipes and valves

               thats not water

               its blood

               suzie jerks the torchlight to the source of the thunderous 
               sound above her she throws herself back dropping her torch

               blackness  and the chaos of the machine rattling sucking 
               and pumping and suzie gasping for breath in the dark

               suzies in extreme shock shes gasping breathless into the  
               dark 

                                     suzie
                         please help me

               she scrambles around on all fours trying to find the torch

               shes got it in her shaking hands with the beam still off

               she forces herself to shine the torch up to the source of 
               the pipes and sees 

               keiths dead body arms outstretched like a scarecrow

               we catch a brief glimpse

               a network of pipes and feeds are inserted into keiths body 

               right next to him in the same manner is carl

               they see jeremiahs flashlight  still lit but hanging 
               on an old halfrotted scarecrow just rags and straw

               jeremiahs gone

                                     suzie

               mac removes the flashlight from the old scarecrow sweeping 
               the area training his gun on the empty rows of corn

               and then suddenly theyre bathed in blinding light they 
               shield their eyes momentarily disoriented and blinded

               two old powerful lights at the top of the steel structure 
               have switched on

               suddenly theres a whirring whooshing sound coming from 
               among the rows of corn  the band members duck in fear

               theyre drenched as the sprinklers come on suzie ian 
               rod and mac try to escape the onslaught within seconds 
               theyre getting sprayed

               but somethings wrong  water sparkles red in the light

               suzie feels the sticky warm sensation on her hand

               suddenly her hands and face are covered in red its not 
               just water

                                     suzie
                         oh my god its

               a moment of stunned silence

                          its blood

               candy screams the group is freaked they flee from the field 
               in panic  desperate to try to wipe the blood off

               the combine harvester parked nearby suddenly roars to life

                                     suzie
                         what the hells that

                         run

               ian turns tail and sprints for his life  in one direction 
               alone suzie is frozen like a deer in the headlights

               the harvester is bearing down on them and 

               mac pushes suzie into the cornfield out of harms way just 
               in time mac tries to get away himself but he cant

               the harvester bearing down on him and 

               mac dives off the path into the cornfield the harvester 
               close behind hes on the ground now and 

               macs pov the harvester

               no answer

               then all is quiet

               ext a row of corn  same time

               candy now alone stumbles blindly along the rows of corn

               she just might make it lightning flares in the sky

               up ahead camouflaged by corn she sees a car a 
               convertible with the top slashed been sitting there for 
               days

               the windows are dusty  maybe the keys are in it

               candy scrambles closer whips open the front door and sees 

               nothing its empty she scoots inside frantically looking 
               for the keys she hears someone coming and slinks down 
               hiding

               ext another part of the cornfield  night

               ian is lost in the maze of corn separated from the group

               has he escaped suddenly  to his right  the headlights 
               come on  and the harvester revs up again  coming straight 
               for him

               ian runs for his life coming to the end of the corn row 
               and falls against  a barbed wire fence he clambers over 
               the fence cutting himself on barbed wire as he does so

               on the harvester

               coming closer

               on ian

               struggling trying to untangle himself hes not going to 
               make it

               the harvester looms over him he swings around bleeding and 
               caught on the fence

                                     ian
                         fuck you in hell

               blam blam

               ian fires the shotgun the harvester keeps on coming

               as the huge rotating motors pull him and the fence into the 
               whirling blades

                                     ian
                         aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

               hes chopped meat

               on the corn

               as ians blood is sprayed over the stalks more bloody 
               irrigation 

               ext still another part of the cornfield  night

               suzie blindly continues on  and comes face to face with 

               the scarecrow she gasps  and then sees  the scarecrows 
               hands across the pole  moving its the killer and suzies 
               had enough of this shit 

                                     suzie
                         eat this

               she kicks the scarecrow between the legs and thrusts her 
               knife straight into the scarecrows chest all in one fluid 
               move

               and she sees

               blood coming from the wound she pulls the knife out

               and hears a low moaning she whips off the scarecrows burlap 
               mask to reveal 

               billy bob duct tape over his mouth unable to talk

               someones tied him up dressed him up as the scarecrow

               as his wide dying eyes stare into hers suzie realizes shes 
               made a mistake 

                                     suzie
                         noooooo im sorry 

               suzie backs away and  sensing something whirls around to 
               see 

               another scarecrow not fastened to a pole but standing in 
               front of her

               an old hat farm overalls and a scary crossstitched burlap 
               bag over its face its the killer

               before she can react the scarecrows gloved hand comes 
               sweeping down a long sharp farm sickle in its hand it 
               takes a chunk out of suzies shoulder

               the scarecrow swings a second time suzie avoids the blow 
               anticipating and dropping back she stabs the scarecrow in 
               the leg

               it buys her a few seconds as she turns and runs for 
               her life shes a strong runner but its a long and scary 
               road

               ext farm road  night

               the sound of rustling in the rows of corn and 

               rod scratched bleeding comes crawling out 

                he just manages to stand on his feet on the edge of the 
               road as an old farmtruck heads in his direction headlights 
               glaring 

               he waves his arms flagging the truck down

               ext farmhouse  night  moments later

               she raises the scythe about to strike 

               and then  the harvester starts up again suzie doesnt 
               know what to do she doesnt have to think too long the 
               next moment 

               crash the wall of the barn cracks the harvester is ploughing 
               right into the barn

                                     mac
                         suzie come on

               they rush to the barn door its locked from the outside

               theyre trapped

               crash the harvester headlights blazing is chewing wood 
               coming through the wall 

                                     mac
                         this way

                                     mac
                         trust me  now

               mac grabs one of the burning kerosene lamps just as they 
               climb down the ladder 

               crash the harvester has entered the barn wood flying 
               everywhere 

               int secret basement barn  moments later

               mac and suzie are now down under the barn mac slides the 
               bolt on the trap door locking them down there

               at least theyre safe for the moment

               but

               the silhouettes of keith and carl  still there cast 
               weird shadows on the walls

                                     suzie
                         no mac please i

                         dont look

               above them they can hear the harvester  being turned off

               silence

               mac shines the kerosene light around and then 

               the trap door starts shaking someones trying to pull it 
               open the padlock seems to hold

               but then  the highpitched whine of a powerdriven chainsaw

               the trap door rattles  and a chainsaw blade jabs through

               someone or something is cutting through the trap door 
               to get to them

               the blade of the chainsaw is carving the trap door into 
               pieces

                                     suzie
                         mac

               a section of the trapdoor falls in suzies transfixed by 
               the macabre figure of the scarecrow she can see in the gap

               mac has found a large hole in the wall behind a series of 
               pipes big enough to fit through theres no other option 
               the only way out

                                     mac
                         over here hurry

               mac grabs suzie and together they climb through the hole 
               into 

               int underground tunnel  continuous

               dank and strange theres puddles everywhere dripping 
               from the irrigation pipes blood streaks the wall

               its not a place youd want to be

               they cast a glance over their shoulders is someone following 
               them they can hear loud hammering  perhaps someone shouting 
               mac like a wounded animal

               they move faster as the tunnel twists and turns

                finally coming to a bolted door they unbolt the door 
               mac holds the kerosene lamp high revealing theyre now in 

               int an old caveshack  night  continuous

               an old stone shack built over the mouth of a natural cavern 
               the pipes on the cave roof feed up through the roof into the 
               irrigation system

               were obviously in the scarecrows domain

               mac bolts the door behind them suzie looks around

                                     suzie
                         jesus

               that could be a bed a bottle of moonshine

               hanging up are strange totems and talismans made of corn 
               husks other objects hard to see in the shadows

               something about it bespeaks insanity

               there are objects on an old table souvenirs from all the 
               murders

               keiths shoes jesses straw dolls

               mac notices a knife a weapon

               he examines it runs a finger along the bloodied edge

                                     suzie
                         mac lets get out of here

                         im part of it

               mac sees the old music box he opens it up

                                     suzie
                         mac 

               and for the first time we see inside it

               a circle of handcarved figures of farm animals cow pig 
               horse in a circle in the center is an empty slot

               something is missing

                                     mac
                         get out of here

               he reaches in his pocket takes out the wooden scarecrow 
               figure and clicks it into place

               the music box begins to play

               an eerie rendition of old macdonald had a farm as it 
               does the carved animals weirdly revolve around the 
               main figure mac cant take his eyes off it

                                     suzie
                         mac

               and then

               at the mouth of the cave

               a man silhouetted by woods and moonlight appears

               its jeremiah unarmed he stares at them a strange look on 
               his face

                                     mac
                         jeremiah

               jeremiah sees the music box in suzies hands  and takes a 
               step toward her mac just stands there

               suzie freaks grabs the knife off the table in front of mac

                                     suzie
                              raising her kitchen 
                              knife

               jeremiah moves closer  and closer suzie holds her knife 
               out

                                     jeremiah

                                     suzie
                         i said stay back

               jeremiah lunges as suzies about to strike mac grabs her 
               wrist taking the knife away

                                     mac
                         no

               jeremiah reaches out taking the music box from suzie

               jeremiah looks up pleased as if waiting for something

               the music box winds down stopping

               and then from outside the sound of footsteps

               someone else walks into the room

               the scarecrow

               burlap stitched mask overalls gloves

               and in his right hand  a familiar axe

               he looks at mac and suzie then jeremiah

               mac and suzie stare with a mixture of horror and amazement

               the scarecrow takes one menacing step forward

               and then 

                                     jeremiah
                         you see theyre here i didnt mess

                                     suzie
                              incredulous
                         daddy

                                     mac
                              softly to himself
                         oh my god jethro

               jethro takes another menacing step towards them the real 
               old macdonald

                                     mac
                         the trap door thats how he escaped 
                         the fire

                                     suzie
                              amazed to jeremiah
                         youve been hiding him all these 
                         years helping him irrigate the 
                         land with blood

                                     jeremiah

                         make a good omlette you got to 
                         break a few eggs

               jethros hands tighten around the axe

               and  thwak

               jethro brings down the axe embedding it not in mac  but 
               in an old wooden table in front of him on the handle he can 
               see jethro macdonald

               a silent communication passes from jethro to jeremiah

                                     jeremiah
                              to mac

               jeremiah gives a slight nod toward suzie the intent is clear 
               kill her

                                     jeremiah
                         its time to make amends

               mac struggles to remember hes torn conflicted 

               then  suddenly 

               quick flash image  memory  from scene one

               young mac hiding in the barn

               the music box

               jethro in the shadows

               but now we reveal other things

               blood drip drip dripping from jethros contraption 
               pushing through pipes and plastic sacs

               flash image

               several dead bodies nearby murdered farmhands and transients 
               prepared for jethros blood harvest and attached to his 
               machine

               then another series of images flood through macs memory

               as young six yearold mac tries to get away his ankle is 
               grabbed by jethro

               terrified trying to escape young mac reaches out  grabs 
               the lantern and throws it at jethro

               it explodes engulfing jethro in flames turning him into 
               a human fireball mac scrambles away 

                                                                   back to

               int caveshack  night present day

               jethro pulls off a glove his hand is horribly burned we 
               can only imagine what his face must look like

                                     jeremiah
                          but its alright boy

                         he forgives you isnt that right 
                         daddy

               jethro grabs macs hand puts it on the axe handle

               and then with a rasping evil voice 

                                     jethro
                         pick it up

               mac looks at his family sees eagerness

               mac looks at suzie sees cold fear

                                     jeremiah
                         if you dont do it he will

               mac hesitates

               mac reaches out touching the handle he feels the wood 
               almost caressing it maybe hes a macdonald after all  

                                     jeremiah
                         thats right

               mac makes his decision he cant help himself he steps 
               towards suzie her eyes grow wide with terror he tenderly 
               touches her hair his hand moves around to the back of her 
               neck pure tenderness

               and then 

                suzie sees the knife in macs other hand

                                     suzie
                              terrified
                         no mac pplease

                                     mac
                         cant help it suze family sticks 
                         together

               locking eyes with suzie mac plunges the knife into her 
               abdomen

               in total disbelief suzie looks down at the knife the 
               blood her hands encircle his feeling the knife handle

               and then she looks back into macs eyes they stare at 
               each other

               as mac continues to pull the knife up up gutting 
               her

               blood seeps through her clothing

               suzies eyes glaze over almost as if shes accepting her 
               fate

               mac lowers her to the ground dead never taking his eyes 
               off her

               he pulls the knife out releasing suzies lifeless body

               mac stands up faces jeremiah and jethro if you could see 
               through the scarred tissue you might see a smile on jethros 
               lips

               mac almost in a trance walks over to the wooden table

               he picks up an open bottle of moonshine

               mac takes a huge swig to steady his nerves

                                     jethro
                         welcome home boy

               mac puts down the bottle of moonshine wipes his mouth

               beat

               he turns towards jeremiah and jethro 

                                     mac
                         actually i was just yankin your 
                         chain

               mac holds up the knife with a slight grin he pushes down 
               on the retractable blade its the fake knife from the opening 
               sequence kept as a souvenir by jethro

               then

               for dead quiet business  and life has never been better

               ext farm  same time

               the dead body of the real estate agent is lowered into the 
               back of an old pickup truck

               then the axe  with the initials j macdonald carved on 
               it  is put back in the mahogany case

               we pull back to reveal 

               jeremiah macdonald alive and well

               sort of

               hes survived the fire but like his father his face is 
               horribly burned and scarred hes wearing overalls and gloves

               in the back of the truck is an assortment of deadly farm 
               implements scythes knives etc and the music box 
               slightly blackened from the fire jeremiah slots the small 
               carved figure into place the music of old macdonald mixes 
               with the indie rock dead quiet track

               he pauses to look at the surrounding cornfields they could 
               use a little nourishment

                                     jeremiah
                         well daddy its harvest time

               jeremiah puts on the scarecrow mask he then reaches down 
               and uproots the for sale sign tossing it away

               jeremiah starts up the truck ready to carry on the family 
               tradition

               it is indeed harvest time

               hold on the pickup as it pulls away traveling down the 
               dirt road and into the farmland night

               lets leave him there

               for now
