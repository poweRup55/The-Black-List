				 annie
		    its silly really  i mean

		    the associate publisher and 
		    then one day we both ordered 
		    sandwiches from the same place 
		    and he got my lettuce and 
		    tomato sandwich on whole wheat 
		    which of course he was allergic 
		    to and i got his lettuce and 
		    tomato on white

				 barbara
			   utterly without irony
		    how amazing

				 annie
		    it is isnt it you make 
		    millions of decisions that mean

		    decide to order takeout and it 
		    changes your life

				 barbara
		    destiny takes a hand

		    oh please  destinys just 
		    something weve invented 
		    because we cant stand the fact

		    accidental

				 barbara
		    then how do you explain that 
		    you both ordered exactly the 
		    same sandwich except for the 
		    bread how many people in this 
		    world like lettuce and tomato 
		    without something else like 
		    tuna

		    i was in atlantic city with my

		    you this a million times but 
		    i dont care  and then he held 
		    my hand  i was scared  all 
		    sorts of thing were going 
		    through my head  but after a 
		    while i forgot about them  at 
		    one point i looked down at our 
		    hands and i couldnt tell

		    mom

				 barbara
		    of course it took several years

				 dr marcia fieldstone vo

		    good dad  you can tell a lot 
		    from a persons voice  but 
		    something must be missing if 
		    jonah feels that youre still 
		    under a cloud

				 jonah
		    tell her how you dont sleep at 
		    night

				 sam
		    how do you know that

				 mailman
		    if youre having trouble

		    drinking a glass of water from 
		    the other side

				 jonah
		    i thought that was for hiccups

				 mailman
		    does it work for hiccups

				 jonah
		    for hiccups a spoonful of 
		    sugar you hold it in your 
		    mouth for a minute

				 mailman
		    really

	the mailman starts back toward the mail truck

	sam and jonah start toward the door

	int houseboat  night

	sam is in the kitchen making dinner  jonah is sitting 
	at the table reading the letters from the stack they 
	found by the door

				 sam
		    just out of curiosity how did 
		    they get our address

				 jonah
		    they called and asked for it
			   reading
		    dear sleepless in seattle  
		    you are the most attractive man 
		    ive ever laid ears on

	jonah rolls his eyes tosses the letter into a pile of 
	rejects opens another

				 sam
		    how did they get our phone 
		    number

				 jonah
		    you have to give them your 
		    phone number or they wont let 
		    you go on the air

	sam nods as if this makes perfect sense

				 jonah
			   continues reading
		    dear sleepless in seattle i 
		    am an swf
			   to sam
		    what is that

				 sam
		    thank god  something you dont 
		    know  its a single white 
		    female

				 jonah
		    this is no good  shes looking 
		    for someone french  or greek
			   puzzled he throws the 
			    letter into the reject 
			    pile opens another
		    dear sleepless in seattle i 
		    live in tulsa where is that 
		    

				 sam
		    oklahoma  do you know where

		    im not going to think about 
		    what theyre not teaching you 
		    in school  i am not going to 
		    think about it
			      beat
		    generally speaking i think we

		    dont live somewhere near here 
		    

				 jonah
		    shes willing to fly anywhere

				 sam
		    she looks like my third grade

		    grade teacher  hold it wait 
		    a minute sheismy third 
		    grade teacher

				 jonah
		    dad youre not taking this 
		    seriously

				 sam
		    this is not how you do it
			   referring to the 
			    hamburger
		    you want this on an english 
		    muffin or a bun

				 jonah
		    english muffin  how do you do 
		    it

				 sam
		    you see someone you like you 
		    get a feeling about them you 
		    ask them if they want to have a 
		    drink or 

				 jonah
		     a slice of pizza 

				 sam
		    but not dinner necessarily on 
		    the first date because by the 
		    time youre halfway through 
		    dinner you might be sorry you 
		    asked them to dinner whereas if 
		    its just a drink if you like 
		    them you can always ask them 
		    for dinner but if you dont you 
		    can go home if you see what i 
		    mean

	and another burma shave

	and annie continues to run and now we see shes running 
	across a map of the united states  its a little like 
	the one we saw in the beginning of the movie  its 
	like the famous map of the united states by saul 
	steinberg but instead of being about new york this one 
	is about seattle

	in the distance at the very edge of the map we see two 
	indistinct figures  a map and a young boy  they start 
	to wave at her very slowly

				 sams voice vo
		    i dont think i could really 
		    describe it

				 dr marcia fieldstone vo
		    why not

				 sams voice vo
		    and if i could describe it it 
		    probably wouldnt be on a radio 
		    show
			   he laughs to himself
		    but what the hell  its not 
		    one specific thing  its more 
		    of a feeling  
			      continuing
		    you touch her for the first 
		    time and suddenly youre 
		    home  its almost like 
		    magic

	as annie strides purposefully across the library and 
	enters

	int annies brother toms office  day

	annie bursts into toms office and walks over to his 
	desk  we barely has time to look up

				 annie
		    i think im going crazy tom  
		    i really do  are you happily 
		    married

				 tom
			   completely panicked by 
			    the question
		    what

				 annie
		    i mean why did you get 
		    married was it all fireworks 
		    and trumpets and 

				 tom
			   regaining composure
		    i got married because betsy 
		    said we had to break up or get 
		    married  so we get married

				 annie
		    but when you met her did you 
		    believe she was the only person 
		    for you that in some mystical 
		    cosmic way it was fated

				 tom
		    annie when you meet someone 
		    and youre attracted to them 
		    it just means that your 
		    subconscious is attracted to 
		    their subconscious 
		    subconsciously  so what we 
		    think of as chemistry is just 
		    two neuroses knowing that they 
		    are a perfect match

				 annie
		    i dont even know him  but 
		    im having all these fantasies 
		    about a man ive never met 
		    who lives in seattle

				 tom
		    it rains nine months of the 
		    year in seattle

				 annie
		    i know i know  i do not want 
		    to move to seattle  but what i 
		    really dont want to do is end 
		    up always wondering what might 
		    have happened and knowing i 
		    could have done something  
		    what do you think
			   tom opens his mouth to 
			    say something but 
			    before anything comes 
			    out annie fills the 
			    void
		    its just cold feet isnt it 
		    everyone panics before they get 
		    married didnt you

				 tom
		    yes i did

				 annie
		    thank you tom  i feel so much 
		    better just having blown this 
		    off
