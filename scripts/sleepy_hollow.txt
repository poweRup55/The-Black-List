                                     1799

     two constables clamor around a corner lanterns held high listening
     they disappear down an alleyway

     ext  city waterfront  night

     elsewhere piers border the hudson  the bell is louder here  the two
     constables arrive searching pistols drawn

               i have found something 

     ichabod drags a bloated male corpse out from the water  he backs away

                             ichabod contd
                which was lately a man

     int  city watchhouse jail  night

     in a dank cavernous room the distinguished high constable lifts a
     blanket off the corpse in a wheelbarrow manned by constable two
     constable one and ichabod are near watching

                             high constable
               burn it

                             constable one
               yes sir

     constable two wheels the corpse down a ramp to another room

                             ichabod
               just a moment if i may we do not
               yet know the cause of death

                             high constable
               when you find em in the river
               cause of death is drowning

                             ichabod
               possibly so if there is water in the
               lungs but by pathology we might
               determine whether or not he was dead
               when he went into the river

                             high constable
               cut him up  are we heathens  let him
               rest in peace  in one piece as
               according to god and the new york
               department of health

     ichabod is about to protest but stops himself frustrated

     two thuggish constables  different ones  bring in a bleeding
     semiconscious man

                             high constable contd
               what happened to him

                             thuggish constable
               nothing sir  arrested for burglary

     the constables throw him against the bars of the slammer while one of
     them opens the cage door  with their leather truncheons the cops beat
     their prisoner into the cage and lock him in

                             high constable
               good work 

     ichabod hurries to follow his two constables and the corpse

     ext  city watchhouse  day

     the metropolis thrives horsedrawn vehicles plodding men women and
     children merchants and tradesmen everywhere

     men are held in chains and gibbets in front of the watchhouse

     int  city watchhouse jail  day

     we enter midway into a audition scene a row of city officials are
     auditioning applicants mostly obvious cranks and eccentrics with
     devices for crime fighting and crime solving  the applicants are
     crowded together to one side waiting their turn  ichabod holding
     only papers and books is among them

     on stage at this moment is an inventor demonstrating his invention
     of which more in a moment  facing the stage is the burgomaster
     flanked by the high constable who has a list of names and various
     magistrates and aldermen

     the inventor is demonstrating a combination wallet and mousetrap

                             inventor
                and in a few weeks the plague of
               pickpockets will be a thing of the
               past

     he shows how to set the trapspring

                             inventor contd
               give me a dozen constables in
               gentlemans dress 

     he pockets the wallettrap

                             inventor contd
                mixing with the crowds where
               pickpockets are rife

     he produces a fake handonastick and does the business

                             inventor contd
               a stealthy hand dips into the
               gentlemans pocket and  

     there is the sound of the trap snapping shut and the inventor
     withdraws the fake hand with its fingers chopped off  the officials
     wince impressed

                             burgomaster
               thank you  we will take your device
               under consideration mr
               vanderbilt next

     a spotty man starts dragging a mansized cage contraption to center
     stage while ichabod tries to get the attention of the officials

                             ichabod
               gentlemen   the millennium is
               almost upon us  in a few months we
               will be living in the nineteenth
               century  

                             high constable
               wait your turn constable crane 

                             ichabod
               these devices are unworthy of a
               modern civilization 

                             burgomaster
               quiet   next i say

                             spotty man
               thank you sir

     he turns proudly to his mansize cage whose front hinges down for
     ingress

     the floor of the cage is a steel plate  a writting board for signing
     confessions is attached to the inside of the cage

                             spotty man contd
               the tomkins selflocking
               confessional is cheap at the price
               and will last for years with just an
               occasional wipe with a damp cloth 
               when the villain steps on the floor
               plate 

     ichabod dropping books and papers around his feet is feverishly
     writing on a blank page his traveling inkpot is hung around his
     neck

                             ichabod
                     pointing to the spotty
                     man
               arrest that man

                             high constable
                     jaw dropped
               arrest 

                             ichabod
               i accuse him of murder

                             spotty man
               what the devil are you talking
               about you loon

     ichabod takes two steps toward him and gives him a violent shove in
     the chest  the spotty man staggers back into his cage which self
     locks and at the same time a head clamp descends from the top
     gripping the spotty mans head  his arms flail about as he yells
     ichabod slaps his page on the writing board offers his pen

                             ichabod
               sign here

                             spotty man
                     groaning and pointing
               the release handle 

                             ichabod
               not till you confess 

     uproar around him ichabod waits as the prisoner signs the paper then
     pulls the release handle

                             ichabod contd
                     waving the confession
               i have here a confession to the
               murder of a man i fished out of the
               river last night

                             high constable
                     furious
               stand down

                             ichabod
               i stand up for sense and justice
               our jails overflow with men and
               women convicted on confessions worth
               no more than this one

     the high constable bangs a gavel until he gets some silence for the
     burgomaster  meanwhile the spotty man is rescued by his friends

                             burgomaster
               constable this is a song we have
               heard from you more than once but
               never before with this discordant
               accompaniment  i have two courses
               open to me  first i can let you
               cool your heels in the cells until
               you learn respect for the dignity of
               my office 

                             ichabod
               i beg pardon  i only meant well  why
               am i the only one who sees that to
               solve crimes to detect the guilty
               we must use our brains   to
               recognize vital clues using upto
               date scientific 

                             burgomaster
                     interrupting
               which brings me to the second
               course  constable crane there is a
               town upstate two days journey to
               the north in the hudson highlands

                             burgomaster

               mostly dutch  three persons have
               been murdered there all within a
               fortnight each found with their
               head lopped off

                             ichabod
               lopped off

                             burgomaster
               clean as dandelion heads
               apparently  now these ideas of
               yours they have never been put to
               the test 

                             ichabod
               i have never been allowed to put
               them to the test

                             burgomaster
               just so granted  so you take your
               experimentations to sleepy hollow

               justice  will you do this

                             ichabod
                     swallowing doubt
               i shall gladly

                             burgomaster
               and remember  it is you ichabod
               crane who is now put to the test

     the burgomaster smiles encouragingly

     intext  ichabods home 2nd floor  day title sequence begins

     piles of books and papers jars of chemicals magnifying glasses
     chalkboards covered with scrawl and anatomy charts above a small bed

     at the window ichabod holds a bird cage with a red cardinal inside
     he opens the cage and the bird flies free 

                             ichabod
               such a day for such a sad farewell
               this is goodbye my sweet 

     ichabod watches it go sad then looks down  a coach halts in the
     street below  the forlorn driver looks up

     ext  new york city streets  day

     ichabods coach leaves city limits forgoing civilization following
     a dirt road to forested wilderness

     ext  new york forests  night

     coach lanterns light the way as the coach lumbers along caressed by
     tight foliage  a wolf is heard howling  ichabod looks out unnerved
     shuts the windows curtain

     ext  upstate forests  day

     the coach moves through sun dappled forest 

     int  ichabods coach  day

     ichabod checks the contents of a leather satchel in his lap  he pauses
     a moment studying the palm of his hand

     ichabod touches the strange scars on both his palms evenly dispersed
     tiny dots of tissue  many scars  after a moment he returns to looking
     through his satchel

     ext  sleepy hollow the long straight road  late day

     ichabod stands between two massive stone pillars  hes unsure turning
     to watch his coach leave him behind

     ichabod picks up his bags and heads between the pillars starting up a
     long straight road  he does not notice in the tree limbs above three
     dead ravens hung by twine

     ext  sleepy hollow town square  dusk

     ichabod walks on passing a church and graveyard  the road ahead is
     bordered by rows of businesses and twostory homes

     ichabod enters the town square proper  and elderly woman stands in a
     doorway watching ichabod  ichabod tips his hat  the woman backs away
     shuts her door

     ichabod continues  he looks up a man closes the shutters of a
     secondstory window

     as ichabod continues he sees that there are two or three riflemen
     placed at vantage points on the roofs and also when he looks back a
     rifleman up on the church tower  the whole village is like a western
     town waiting for an attack

     ext  wooden bunker  dusk

     a strange wooden bunker like a small fortress with a huge bell
     mounted on top sits in a field  several dirt farmers are gathered
     all with rifles

     ichabod stops as he walks looking at this 

     a boy young masbath aged 10 comes to the designated rifleman
     jonathan masbath with food and drink ie a picnic tied up in cloth
     and a stone bottle of beer  masbath senior takes the picnic and gives
     young masbath an affectionate pat  he smiles confidently

                             masbath senior
               dont worry son

     one farmer comes to lead young masbath away as jonathan heads into the
     bunker taking several rifles

     in front of the bunker across a field other dirt farmers light torch
     posts in a line along the forest edge

     ichabod ponders this as he trudges along 

     ext  van tassel house  dusk

     ahead on a hill the grand van tassel manor house windows aglow

     title sequence ends

     ext  van tassel house front door  night

     ichabod puts down his bags a suitcase and a leather boxbag but
     keeps his satchel

     jackolanterns glow on the porch

     a kissing couple are lustfully busy in a dark corner of the porch  the
     woman is a pretty servant sarah  the man we will know as doctor
     lancaster

     ichabod almost blunders into them causing a little panic and
     embarrassment in which ichabod shares and as he mumbles apologies
     and opens the door a shaft of light identifies the couple for our
     further reference

     the open door reveals the main hall and foyer 

     theres a harvest party in progress  people are gathered  quiet music
     is heard from elsewhere

     int  van tassel house sitting room  night

     ichabod opens a door  men and women eat and drink talking quietly in
     groups  ichabod looks around daunted tentatively makes his way 

     ichabod bumps into a few people excusing himself  he mops his sweaty
     brow finds a pretty girl

                             ichabod
               pardon my intrusion i seek baltus
               van tassel but 

                             girl
               in the parlor sir further on

     ichabod thanks her continues 

     ahead children young men and ladies in a circle taunt a blindfolded
     young woman spun around by the handsome barrelchested man brom van
     brunt  brom releases the woman  everyone quiets avoiding her
     searching hands

     the blindfolded woman circles slowly chanting a refrain that makes
     the children and even some of the younger women shiver with
     pleasurable fright  they giggle nervously and hush each other up

                             blindfolded woman
               the pickety witch the pickety
               witch whos got a kiss for thepickety witch

     she makes a lunge grabbing empty air just missing brom everyone
     moans humorously  doctor lancaster slips back into the party and
     sarah likewise

     ichabod is trying to pass through to reach the farther door and on
     the next refrain finds himself caught by the blindfolded woman

     everyone stays quiet thats the game but of course everyone is also
     puzzled not knowing ichabod  the woman touches ichabods face which
     embarrasses ichabod and displeases brom

                             child
               a kiss a kiss

                             woman
               she has to guess first

     the woman is wifely and as she puts her arm through doctor
     lancasters arm we realize she is his wife

                             blindfolded woman
               is it theodore

     theres a general laugh at that

                             ichabod
               pardon maam  i am only a stranger

                             blindfolded woman

     she kisses him laughingly and takes the blindfold off the reveal a
     stunning beauty katrina van tassel  she smiles  ichabod tries to
     compose himself stricken by the sight of her

                             ichabod

               it is only to raise the spirits
               during this dark time that i and my
               good wife are giving this little
               party 

     lady van tassel stands behind him a mix of homespun wife and well
     kept lady  brom releases ichabod  children hide behind katrina
     ichabods relieved to have a proper focal point  others from the party
     gather

                             baltus contd
               young sir you are welcome even if
               you are selling something

     the pleasantry relaxes the atmosphere around ichabod

                             ichabod
               thank you sir  i am constable
               ichabod crane sent to you from new
               york with authority to investigate
               murder in sleepy hollow

     this has quite an effect  a man we will know as magistrate philipse
     looks up sharply  a man we will know as reverend steenwyck grunts
     skeptically  a man we have already seen doctor lancaster exchanges a
     surprised look with another man notary hardenbrook

                             steenwyck
                     rudely
               well what use is a constable

     lady van tassel gives the clergyman a reproachful look

                             lady van tassel
               then sleepy hollow is grateful to
               you constable crane  i hope you
               will honor this house by remaining
               with us until 

                             brom
               until youve made the arrest

     to ichabods surprise this gets a nervous laugh  baltus frowns at brom
     katrina looks at ichabod with renewed interest

                             baltus
                     to his wife
               well spoke
                     to ichabod
               come sir  well get you settled
                     to the musicians
               play on

     baltus catches the eyes of philipse then of lancaster nodding as if
     to say see you in a minute

     as he leads ichabod out he murmurs to steenwyck who nods and passes
     the murmur to hardenbrook

     the fiddlers strike up the music  katrina watches ichabods exit  brom
     watches katrinas interest with displeasure

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  night

     we hear the music from downstairs  ichabod is unpacking  arranging
     his scientific books  his medical case revealing a few mysterious
     instruments of detections is open on the bed  sarah is just
     delivering a pitcher of water to the washstand

                             ichabod
               thank you  please tell mr van
               tassel i will be down in a moment

                             sarah
               i will sir
                     then  as she leaves
               thank god you are here

     ichabod is a bit surprised by her emotion  then he pours the water and
     douses his face

     int  van tassel house parlor  night

     five men wait grimly for ichabod silent in the presence of sarah who
     is placing a pipe cradle by baltus  lady van tassel is pouring the men
     a drink  the music from the party is faintly audible  lancaster is 50
     dour always sweaty  philipse is youngest a drinker eyes bloodshot
     augmenting his glass with a shot from his private flask  reverend
     steenwyck has a disdainful sour expression  hardenbrook is oldest
     ancient nervous one eye pale and blind

                             hardenbrook
               all the way from new york

                             doctor lancaster
               a waste of time

                             steenwyck
                     to baltus
               what can he do

                     calmingly
               gentlemen gentlemen 

     sarah leaving passes doctor lancaster who secretly trails his hand
     against sarahs buttock not quite secretly enough for the vigilance
     of lady van tassel who by the merest flick of an eye shows us that
     she has noticed

     sarah leaves just as ichabod appears in the doorway sarah closing the
     door behind him

                             baltus contd
                     to ichabod

                             baltus
               i dont understand you

                             ichabod
               i say is there any one person
               suspect in these acts

     the men stir in their seats  their looks say i told you so 
     useless  etc

                             baltus
               constable how much have your
               superiors explained to you

                             ichabod
               only that the three were slain in
               open ground and their heads found
               severed from their bodies 

                             steenwyck
               the heads were not found severed
               the heads were not found at all

                             ichabod
               the heads aregone

               horseman  taken back to hell

                             baltus
               perhaps you had better sit down

     baltus gestures for ichabod to sit  baltus lights his pipe and pours a
     glass for ichabod  the men help themselves to food and drink

                             baltus contd
               the horseman was a hessian
               mercenary sent to our shores by
               german princes to keep americans
               under the yoke of england  but
               unlike his compatriots who came for
               money the horseman came for love
               of carnage and he was not like the
               others

     annihilates  blood gushes  bones crack

               to look upon him made your blood run
               cold for he had filed down his
               teeth to sharp points to add to
               the ferocity of his appearance 

     the horseman lets out a war cry  jagged teeth  grotesque

     the horseman glances back bounding through drawing his sword when
     suddenly he halts 

     hes happened upon two young girls gathering firewood  the girls stand
     frozen at the sight of him for a long silent moment till one girl
     drops the firewood and runs

     the second girl remains holding the horsemans gaze

     the horseman and the girl hold each others gaze for a long beat

     the horseman puts his finger to his lips warning her to stay quiet

     the girl takes one of her pieces of dry wood and deliberately breaks
     it making a noise like a pistol shot

     there is a responding shout from a soldier back in the trees  the
     horseman turns to the sound

     soldiers move forward from the forest behind spreading out

     the second girl flees  the horseman hefts his sword turning as
     soldiers surround  one soldier aims his rifle 

     the horseman reaches over his shoulder grasps a sheathed knife and
     throws

               sword  to this day the western

                             baltus vo

     buried the horseman in a treeless clearing

     daredevil appears limping from the trees and puts his nose down to
     the turned earth

                             baltus
               and so it has been for twenty years
               but now the hessian wakes  he is
               on the rampage cutting off heads
               where he finds them

     ichabod sits back shakes off the reverie of the tale  he takes a gulp
     from his glass

                             ichabod
               are you saying   is that what
               you believe

                             hardenbrook
               seeing is believing

     baltus puts a calming hand on senile hardenbrooks shoulder

                             doctor lancaster
               no one knows why the hessian has
               chosen this time to return from the
               grave

                             steenwyck
               satan has called forth one of his
               own

     steenwyck stands and from a side table picks up the hefty baltus
     family bible

                             steenwyck contd
               they tell me you have brought books
               and trappings of scientific
               investigation  this is the only
               book i recommend you study

     he drops the bible on the table in front of ichabod making him jump
     ichabod gingerly lifts the front cover  revealing a page of ink
     writing which he will remember later  then he snaps out of all this
     nonsense

                             ichabod
               reverend steenwyck gentlemen 
               murder needs no ghost come from the
               grave  which of you have laid eyes
               on this headless horsemen

     pause

                             hardenbrook
               others have  many others

     ichabod allows himself a skeptical smile

                             baltus
               you will see him too if he comes
               again  the men of the village are
               posted to watch for him

                             ichabod
               we have murders in new york without
               benefit of ghouls and goblins

                             baltus
               you are a long way from new york
               sir

                             ichabod
               a century at least  the assassin is
               a man of flesh and blood and i will
               discover him

                             steenwyck
               how do you propose to do so

                             ichabod
               by discovering his reason  it is
               what we call the motive this
               mystery will not resist
               investigation by a rational man

     ichabods natural clumsiness however causes him to sweep his empty
     glass off the table rather ruining the effect of the rational man in
     command of the situation

     int  van tassel house katrinas room  night

     katrina is sitting in front of her mirror  lady van tassel is brushing
     out katrinas hair counting the strokes

               york  how i should love the opera 
               and theaters  to go dancing is
               it wonderful

                             ichabod
               i have never been

                             katrina
               but there is an art museum   a
               concert hall

                             ichabod
               i dont know

                             katrina
                     disappointed
               then you have nothing to teach me

                             ichabod
               perhaps i have  do you believe the
               van garretts and the widow winship
               were murdered by a headless
               horseman

                             katrina
               not everyone here believes it is the
               horseman

                             ichabod
                     relieved
               good

                             katrina
               some say it is the witch of the
               western woods who has made a pact
               with lucifer

                             ichabod
                     exasperated
               there are no witches or galloping
               ghosts either  is everyone in this
               village in thrall to superstition

                             katrina
               why are you so frightened of magic
               not all magic is black  there are
               ancient truths in these woods which
               have been forgotten in your city
               parks

                             ichabod
               if they are truths they are not
               magic  and if magic not truth

                             katrina
               you are foolish  when there is fever
               in the house it is well known that
               willowherb roots and a crows foot
               must be boiled in the milk of a pure
               white goat with special charms
               uttered over the fire and the
               fever abates

                             ichabod
               next time try the herb without the
               rest  and now i must ask you 
               excuse me 

                             katrina
               gladly  i should not have interrupted
               our towns savior  good night  and
               as to your first question that big
               brute you were asking about has
               proposed to me

                             ichabod
               i i im happy that 

                             katrina
               proposed to me several times

     this ambiguous statement accompanied by a faint smile confuses
     ichabod into silence as she closes the door behind her  he turns with
     relief to the next business  the bible  he opens the front cover  on
     the endpaper is a family tree going back a hundred years in variously
     faded inks and handwritings

     ichabod studies it and we see what he learns that katrina was born in
     1777 to baltuss first wife who died in 1797 that lady van tassel
     is baltuss second wife her maiden name is unimportant because
     false then he suddenly notices something even more interesting
     the family tree has a van garrett in it  the husband of baltuss
     fathers sister

                             ichabod
                     mutters
               van garrett 

     ichabod looks thoughtful  he starts copying out details into his
     ledger

     a very faint rumbling disturbs him for a moment  he looks up  silence
     now  he continues working

     ext  sleepy hollow  night

     the empty street

     then the low sinister sound of rumbling is heard again

     ext  wooden bunker  field  intercut  night

     the distant sound of the ground rumbling is heard  at the wooden
     bunker jonathan looks out fearful 

     the torches burn bright along the forest line  several deer stampede
     out sprinting across the field

     jonathan watches the forest  a horrible silent stillness has fallen
     then jonathans eyes widen 

     a thick fog creeps from the woods

     as fog overtakes each torch mist snakes up snuffing each flame one
     by one by one all along the forest edge 

     jonathan sticks his rifle out from the bunker sights the gun along
     the treeline

                             jonathan
               come out devil come 

     ext  sleepy hollow forests overview  night

     silhouetted treetops  the sounds of jonathans rifle firing are heard
     echoing  several gunshots then silence 

     ext  sleepy hollow forest  night

     jonathan flees through the forest glances back terrified  thunderous
     hoofbeats are heard from behind

     deep in the forest we glimpse the source of the hoofbeats a huge
     form on a huge black horse already gone

     jonathan pushes through thorny bushes  jagged branches bloody his
     hands and cheeks 

     he bursts from the brier patch and tumbles to a trail

     in the forest behind the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush
     hoofbeats deafening  a spur digs into the snorting steeds already
     bleeding flank

     the pursuers gloved hand draws a sword blade ringing

     on the trail jonathan runs onward  the shrill whistle of a sword
     swing is heard as the pursuer blurs past 

     jonathan is still running when his head lolls back at an impossible
     angle his head tumbles off his shoulders 

     jonathans headless body hits the dirt

     ext  sleepy hollow  day early morning

     people going about their business calmly  a woman shakes out a blanket
     from an upper window  the murder has obviously not been discovered
     yet

     no one notices that the wooden bunker is deserted and now has a gap
     of shattered timber

     extint  livery stable  day early morning

     the stables belong to killian a dashingly rustic man father of a
     young family  ichabod likes him though he does not think much of the
     horse killian is offering him an old nag  ichabod has a big satchel

                             ichabod
               mr killian i was thinking about
               the old widow 

                             killian
               old widow

               who told you she was old  she was
               comely  widowed young and dead
               before the bloom was off her

     ichabod is surprised  before he can react further a distant gunshot
     is heard  a signal followed by the distant sight of a man on
     horseback hurrying and shouting waving his rifle  its clear that
     masbaths murder has been discovered  killian and ichabod watch the
     rider coming telling the news as he comes

                             rider
                     shouting
               murder murder  the horseman has
               killed again

     ext  sleepy hollow farmland  day

     riders are galloping across the fields toward the murder site

     baltus a dullardly man called van ripper who was the original rider
     who found the body followed by brom and a gig driven fast by
     philipse and doctor lancaster and various villagers

     way behind trying to keep up on gunpowder comes ichabod

     ext  forest masbath murder site  morning

     baltus takes charge of posting armed villagers to keep an eye out
     toward the forest

                             baltus
               mr miller  ride back for the
               coffin cart  the rest of you keep
               a sharp lookout
                     to glen
               no  not at me glen im not going
               to cut my own head off   look out
               to the woods

     ichabod hasnt quite arrived  the others are watching as doctor
     lancaster turns over the headless corpse of masbath  he straightens
     the body reverently  everyone is shocked and spooked looking
     fearfully around  behind them  a sound  everyone reacts but its
     ichabod arriving

                             brom
                     laughs
               a fine looking animal crane

     ichabod dismounts ignoring brom  the great detective is trying to
     cover up his jitters  new york was never like this

                             doctor lancaster
               the fourth victim jonathan masbath

                             ichabod
               and the head 

                             philipse
               taken

                             ichabod
               taken

     doctor lancaster seems unprofessionally jittery  he grasps philipse by
     the arm  philipse shakes him off and pulls out a flask  ichabod
     notices this  their behavior seems to him to be an odd moment  then he
     turns his attention back to the matter at hand

                             ichabod contd
               interesting very interesting

                             baltus
               what is

                             ichabod
               in headless corpse cases of this
               sort the head is removed to
               prevent identification of the body

                             baltus
                     puzzled
               but we know this is jonathan
               masbath 

                             ichabod
               exactly  so why was the head
               removed

     they all wait for enlightenment

                             baltus
               why

                             ichabod
               i dont know

     they all watch ichabod to see what he will do  philipse takes nips
     from his flask  but ichabod isnt sure  he isnt too keen on looking
     at the corpse  then he realizes

                             ichabod contd
               you have moved the body

                             doctor lancaster
               i did

                             ichabod
                     furious
               you must never move the body

                             doctor lancaster
               why not

                             ichabod
               because

     despite themselves they are impressed  ichabod takes heart

     ichabod finds a huge deep hoofprint  he kneels pulls his satchel off
     his shoulder takes out a bowl bottle of water and a bag of powder

     the others watch finding this bizarre as ichabod begins mixing the
     water and powder making plaster

                             brom
               what is that potion

                             ichabod
               you are the blacksmith brom  ever
               shoe a horse with a hoof this large

     ichabod fills the print with runny plaster

                             brom
                     grudging the point
               its big

     ichabod shoulders his satchel walks all around studies the ground
     kicks away leaves and then lopes around puzzlingly  the watchers are
     astonished by his antics as he leaps from hoofprint to hoofprint

                             doctor lancaster
                     to philipse
               the mans a fool

                             phillipse
                     drunk
               hes a fool and were damn fools 
               but death will make us all equal

     doctor lancaster impatiently hushes him and turns away

                             ichabod
               the stride is gigantic 

     ichabod stops turns following back to way he came 

                             ichabod contd
               the attacker rode masbath down 
               turned his horse came back 
                     stops leaping
               came back to claim the head

     he pauses to sum up

                             ichabod contd
               to sum up  head taken  big horse
                     beat
               did this man have any enemies

                             philipse
               well someone didnt like him

     but ichabod has already latched on to something

                             ichabod
               van ripper show me where the neck
               rested

     van ripper points  ichabod opens his satchel takes out a bottle of
     green powder

     he uncorks the bottle sprinkles a thin layer of powder on the dirt
     waiting

     a reaction causes the powder to bubble a little

                             ichabod contd
               a chemical reaction it shows there
               was just a smear of blood no more

                             van ripper
               i didnt see none

     ichabods puzzled

     ichabod swallows queasy trying not to let it show

     ichabod takes odd spectacles from his satchel wireframed with many
     lenses magnification spectacles  he fumbles putting them on
     examines the gross neck wound

     ichabod takes an instrument from his satchel a delicate scissor
     mechanism tool that tapes off into tiny jaws  he uses it hand
     shaking to pick at the flesh

     pov through ichabods magnifying spectacles a creepy crawly bug is
     feeding on the wound  ichabod freaks leaps up

                             ichabod
                     recovering faking
               interesting 

                             baltus
               what is it   what is it

     squinting sidelong at the ground ichabod uses his foot to squash and
     grind the bug which is too small to be visible

     he looks at baltus his eyes huge in his spectacles

                             ichabod
               the wound was cauterized in the very
               instant as though the blade itself
               were red hot and yet no
               blistering no scorched flesh

     they all look worried

                             philipse
               the devils fire

     ichabod looks worried too

     ext  cemetery  day

     the town is gathered for jonathan masbaths funeral  steenwyck stands

               sorry for your loss young mister
               masbath

     ichabod moves away watched disconsolately by masbath

     ichabod finds his sleeve furtively plucked by philipse

                             philipse
               constable 

                             ichabod
               mr philipse 

     philipse looks around anxiously to see if theyre observed

                             philipse
               something you should know  jonathan
               masbath was not the fourth victim
               but the fifth

                             ichabod
               the fifth

                             philipse
               aye  five victims in four graves

                             ichabod
               but who 

     philipse sees that steenwyck has noticed the encounter  he breaks off
     and scuttles away

     ichabod turns his gaze toward 

     the fresh grave of jonathan masbath and three more graves almost as
     recent the van garretts are just receiving their brand new
     headstones and widow winships grave is marked for the present by a
     simple wooden cross with her name on it

     ichabod sees killian and nods to him

                             ichabod contd
               mr killian i will need the help
               you offered

     int  stable  day

     ichabod lifts the lid of a large feed bin half full of horse feed
     young masbath is curled up inside like a mouse in a nest  homeless

                             ichabod
               find a place in the van tassels
               servant quarters  wake me before
               dawn  i hope you have a strong
               stomach

     ichabod walks away disgruntled

                             young masbath
               thank you sir

     ext  cemetery  nightdawn

     the lid of a muddy coffin is wrenched open  the coffin contains a
     headless corpse  just the one

     whats happening

     the coffin is on the ground next to the hole marked by the headstone
     of peter van garrett

     killian holds a lantern and a spade  ichabod holding a handkerchief
     to his face looks into the open coffin  he nods  ichabod in
     shirtsleeves and sweating has a spade too  young masbath is watching
     uneasily  this is why young masbath would need a strong stomach he
     gags almost pukes

     at ichabods nod killian replaces the lid  killian has two men with
     him  there are two more coffins and two more piles of dirt one coffin
     for dirk van garrett and one for widow winship

     ichabod moves to the second coffin  it contains a headless corpse
     just the one  ichabod nods and the lid is replaced

     the third coffin  the widows  is being opened by one of the men
     ichabod takes a lantern and looks expectantly as the lid comes off
     the widows headless corpse is alone in the coffin

     ichabod pauses  nods  as the lid is about to be replaced  he stops it

                             ichabod
               wait

     ichabod takes out a small penknife and cuts through the shroud  he
     reveals the belly  he stares at it  was she pregnant  its impossible
     to tell  but there is the wound of a sword stab in the stomach

     suddenly there is a screech which seems to come from the corpse
     giving heart attacks all around  but now we see a ghost holding a
     lantern  its reverend steenwyck who has discovered them and is
     shrieking in outrage

                             steenwyck
               sacrilege  sacrilege

     ichabod recovers

                             ichabod
               science science reverend
               steenwyck  someone in sleepy hollow
               is using the horseman story for his
               own murderous purpose and i intend
               to dig it out

     steenwyck froths looks terrified and backs off

     int  doctors residence medical room  day

     ichabod and killian helped by young masbath carry the widows muddy
     coffin inside  doctor lancaster watches in horror sweating profusely
     freaked out

                             doctor lancaster
               this is most irregular constable

                             ichabod
               i should hope so  but in this case
               necessary

     the coffin is put down

                             ichabod contd
               i will need to operate

                             doctor lancaster
               operate  shes dead

                             ichabod
                     thrown
               when we say operate we mean of
               course er ill need the operating
               table  lay her out please
                     to young masbath
               go on nothing to be afraid of

     when killian and young masbath lay out the corpse ichabod gulps water
     and studies the pages of his ledger

                             ichabod contd
               there is a common thread between
               these victims

                             doctor lancaster
               and whats that

                             ichabod
                     closing the ledger
               i dont know

     he goes to examine the corpse  young masbath retreats to a corner ill
     at ease

                             ichabod contd
               once more the neck wound
               cauterized  the sword thrust to the
               stomach the same perhaps by
               chemical means  but to what purpose

     ichabod gingerly feels the corpses stomach  the doctor watches  we
     get the feeling he knows something

                             doctor lancaster
               to what is your purpose is the
               question

     ichabod takes a rolled velvet cloth from his satchel unrolls it it
     holds surgical instruments some particularly strange ribspeaders
     and curved clamps

                             doctor lancaster contd
               what manner of instruments are
               those

                             ichabod
               some of my own design

     ichabod picks through his instruments unsure  he looks to the corpse
     a long moment  he looks at young masbath

                             ichabod contd
               step outside  thank you for your
               help mr killian  and if you do
               not mind doctor my concentration
               suffers when i am observed

     ichabod watches killian young masbath and lancaster go  he quickly
     returns to his satchel pulling out a book human anatomy  he searches
     the pages 

     he flips through drawings of anatomy then sets the book open nearby
     so he can refer to it  he picks up a knife stands at the corpse
     taking a deep uncertain breath

     ichabod cuts into the widows belly but stops looking horrified at
     what hes done  he leans close to study the book again worried  he
     makes another incision he looks down at it queasy

     ext  doctors residence  day

     young masbath sits waiting

     doctor lancaster stands with philipse hung over steenwyck and
     hardenbrook speaking agitatedly  other people have gathered in the
     background

     the door to the doctors residence opens and ichabod steps out  he is
     bloodied shaken futilely wiping at the mess with a bloodcovered
     cloth looking up 

     all attention goes to ichabod  everyones horrified

                             ichabod
               i am finished

                             steenwyck
               what in gods name have you done to
               her
                     pointing
               magistrate philipse you are the
               word of law here put him in irons

     philipse and ichabod exchange a look  philipse nips from his flask

                             philipse
               and what did you find out
               constable

                             ichabod
               that there are not four victims but
               five  the widow winship was with
               child

     the small crowd murmurs shocked  doctor lancaster recovers furious

                             doctor lancaster
               what of it  she should have been
               left to make her peace with god and
               not cut to bits by the constabulary

     ichabod is shaken for a moment remembering the similar charge made
     against him in new york

                             ichabod
               the sword was thrust into the womb
               and no farther  a symbolic murder
               we are dealing with a madman

     ext  long straight road covered bridge  later night

     pale moonlight  ichabod rides gunpowder across the covered bridge
     they are an ungainly pair

     following the road ichabod is lost in thought  the clopping of
     hoofbeats is heard on the bridge behind

     ichabod turns to look  hoofbeats stop  no one can be seen in the dark
     mouth of the bridge  crickets chirp

                             ichabod
               whos there

     ichabod faces forward continuing to the forest

     he hums a tune to himself tone deaf  after a moment a horse is heard
     snorting hoofbeats resume  ichabod stops gunpowder

     there is someone back there on horseback coming out from the
     darkness of the bridge slowly 

                             ichabod contd
               who are you

     the figure comes into moonlight on a black horse smoke seeming to
     rise from him a dark figure cloaked  headless

     ichabod panics kicking gunpowder to flee  the figure takes off to
     follow

     ichabod whips gunpowders reins gasping moving faster  the figure
     behind also picks up speed

     ext  sleepy hollow forest  night

     gunpowder carries ichabod into the forest  the headless figure is
     right behind cloak flowing 

     the headless figure is heard letting out a hellish cry of rage
     ichabod glances fearfully over his shoulder 

     a horrible face with flaming eyes and mouth rushes forward 

     it smashes into ichabod  sends him sprawling to the ground in an
     explosion of red hot ash and cinders 

     ichabod rolls shaken looking behind  the trail is empty  hoofbeats
     are heard  several horses

     ichabod stands  he looks down at the remnants of a broken jacko
     lantern and smoldering ball of paper on the trail

     the figure rides to a halt throws off a cloak and headless
     disguise its brom  glenn and theodore ride up laughing

     brom also laughs but when he looks back the smile leaves his face
     he takes grim satisfaction in what hes done

     ichabods face is haunted running with the sweat of fear  he is
     still trembling from the experience

                             female voice vo
               ichabod  ichabod

     and suddenly we are pitched into ichabods dream

     ichabods dream  ext  cottage  day

                             female voice vo
               ichabod  ichabod 

     a woman is in the doorway holding out her arms  she seems to be
     katrina as ichabod first saw her blindfolded

     a young boy aged about seven runs toward her with a little bunch of
     wildflowers

     ichabods dream  young ichabods kitchen  night

     the blindfolded woman is playing the pickety witch game with ichabod
     he is laughing  scared as she grabs the air looking for him  he is
     holding the wildflowers he picked  she seizes him kisses him and
     takes off the blindfold  its not katrina but his mother a kind and
     lovely face  he gives his mother the flowers  she puts one of the
     flowers in her hair laughing  but the others  she throws on the
     fire   and she crouches at the hearthstone beckoning him still
     nice he comes to her not scared

     as the flowers burn they give off smoky fumes which the mother
     inhales like perfume closing her eyes in a trance  he watches
     fascinated as she picks up a twig and starts drawing pictures 
     strange designs  in the layer of ash on the hearthstone

     suddenly ichabod turns his head to the door which is opening 
     spooky because no one is entering  then he sees at floor level the
     family cat has come through the door  a black cat with a white paw

     ichabods mother is awakened by this just in time as father a grim
     parson all in black enters

     ichabod looks up frightened at the face of his father

     ichabods dream  young ichabods bedroom  night

     the cat is on ichabods bed watching mother who is entertaining
     ichabod with the birdincage spinning disc toy which we will get to
     know

     ichabod is tucked up in bed astonished and happy  the bird and cage
     blur together

     lightning flashes outside a window thunder booms the storm bursts
     open the window

     the cat leaps off the bed caught in lightning flash the toy drops
     tangled on the bed  ichabod covers his face scared his mother hugs
     him

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  night

     ichabod is startled awake frightened sweating

     int  van tassel house kitchen  night

     ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger  he sits studies notes
     then notices a light down the hall

     int  van tassel house sewing room  night

     ichabod enters  opposite an elaborate loom katrina reads by
     candlelight

     she looks up and selfconsciously closes her book which we see is a
     childs version of the knights of the round table  she covers it on
     her lap

                             ichabod
               oh pardon my intrusion i saw a
               light 

                             katrina
               it is no intrusion i come here to
               read when i am wakeful

                             ichabod
               to read books which you must
               hide 

                             katrina
               they were my mothers books my
               father frowned at them then and
               would frown at me now  he believes
               tales of romance caused the brain
               fever that killed my mother  she
               died two years ago come midwinter

     ichabod nods

                             ichabod
               i saw it written in the front of the
               bible

                             katrina
               the nurse who cared for her during
               her sickness is now lady van tassel

                             ichabod
               there was something else too  why
               did no one think to mention that van
               garretts are kith and kin to the van
               tassels

                             katrina
               why because there is hardly a
               household in sleepy hollow that is
               not connected to every other by
               blood or marriage  i have more
               cousins than fingers and toes to
               count them on

     a cock crows  ichabod goes to the window to look at the edge of dawn

                             ichabod
               i see

                             katrina
               this land was van garrett land
               given to my father when i was in
               swaddling clothes

                             ichabod
               given by the dead van garrett

                             katrina
                     nods
               the van garretts were the richest
               family round these parts even then
               when my father brought us to sleepy
               hollow van garrett set him up with
               an acre and a brokendown cottage
               and a dozen of van garrett hens  my
               father prospered and built us a new
               house  i owe my happiness to him  i
               remember living poor in the cottage
               should i show you

                             ichabod
               yes  i would like to see where you
               were as poor as i am

     katrina stands up revealing a book that had been on the floor hidden
     by her skirt  she picks up the book and gives it to ichabod

                             katrina
               take this  it is my gift for you

     ichabod looks at the title page a compendium of spells charms and
     devices of the spirit world

                             ichabod
                     troubled
               but i have no use for 

                             katrina
               are you so certain of everything

     ichabod sees that katrinas name is written on the endpaper and in a
     different hand her mothers name elizabeth van tassel

                             ichabod
               it was your mothers 

                             katrina
               keep it close to your heart  it is
               sure protection against harm

                             ichabod
                     smiles
               are you so certain of everything

     their eyes meet and hold for a moment  ichabod accepts the book by
     placing it on the desk

     ext  fields  day early morning

     ichabod and katrina make a pretty picture on horseback riding slowly
     toward the cottage

     ext  sleepy hollow farmland  day early morning

     ichabod and katrina riding come upon the ruin of a cottage  there is
     almost nothing left but the hearth and a part of a chimney

     ichabod dismounts and helps katrina down from her horse taking her
     hand

     before he lets go she notices the little scars on his palm  she takes
     both his hands and looks at them

                             katrina
               these are strange what are
               they 

                             ichabod
               i wish i knew  i had them since i
               can remember

     katrina holds his hands a moment longer their eyes meet then she
     lets go and enters the ruin

     ichabods attention is caught by a red cardinal on a branch like the
     bird he had in new york

     he reflects a moment then turns to watch katrina crouching by the
     hearth  she has put a flower in her hair

                             katrina
               i used to play by this hearth  it
               was my first drawing school and my
               mother was my teacher

     unwittingly katrina is mimicking ichabods dream  she picks up a twig
     and starts drawing on the hearth stone  like ichabods mother in his
     dream

     ichabods blood runs cold but she is unaware of him  then he notices
     that a few small wildflowers are growing in the old fireplace  ichabod
     feels short of breath he leans against the stones for support

                             katrina contd
               oh look  id forgotten this   see
                carved into the fireback the
               archer

     using her fingers she cleans off the dirt around a simple carving of a
     man with a bow and arrow

                             katrina contd
               this was from long before we lived
               here

     she turns to show ichabod and notices him looking strange

                             katrina contd
               are you all right

     ichabod nods recovering saying nothing

     katrina is reassured  suddenly her attention is caught as ichabods
     was by the cardinal bird

                             katrina contd
                     pointing
               oh look  a cardinal  my favorite  i
               would love to have a tame one but i
               wouldnt have the heart to cage him

     ichabod unslings his satchel

                             ichabod
               then i have something for you

     he has a paper disk with a bird on one side and an empty cage on the
     other pierced by a looped string on which the disk can twist and
     spin  he demonstrates like a magician  this is the very toy given to
     him by his mother

                             ichabod contd
               a cardinal on one side and an empty
               cage

     katrina watches intently  ichabod spins the disk

                             ichabod contd
               and now 

     the bird appears to be inside the cage

     katrina is astonished and delighted

                             katrina
               you can do magic  teach me

                             ichabod
               it is no magic  it is optics

     ichabod gives her the toy and shows her how to spin it

                             ichabod contd
               separate pictures which become one
               picture in the spinning like the
               truth which i must spin here 

     katrina spins the disk the bird appears in the cage

     ext  philipse house  night

     a moving pov is checking out the village house  through lighted
     windows figures of men are seen pacing apparently arguing

     philipse is packing his bags moving out while three men steenwyck
     doctor lancaster and hardenbrook are in agitated conference  their
     raised voices make an undecipherable hubbub  the povs horse makes a
     horsey snuffling sound  is it daredevil

     steenwyck comes right to the window as if he has seen something but
     he merely closes the shutters

     the reverse shows that it is ichabod who has been spying

     ichabod backs off and mounts gunpowder looking thoughtful then
     determined

     ext  road outside village  night

     a mounted man is approaching on a heavily loaded pack horse philipse
     making his getaway from sleepy hollow  as he reaches the foreground
     ichabod on gunpowder intercepts him grabbing the bridle of the pack
     horse

                             philipse
               what are you doing  let go

                             ichabod
               what are you running from
               magistrate philipse

                             philipse
               damn you crane 

                             ichabod
               youll raise the village

     philipse calms down

                             ichabod contd
               you had a mind to help me

                             philipse
               yes  and i put myself in mortal
               dread of 

                             ichabod
               of what

                             philipse
               powers against which there is no
               defense

                             ichabod
               how did you know the widow was
               expecting a child

                             philipse
               she told me

                             ichabod
               then i deduce you are the father

                             philipse
               i hope your deductions serve you
               better in your contest against the
               hessian  i am not the father

                             ichabod
               did she tell you the name of the
               childs father

                             philipse
               yes  she did  she came to me for
               advice  as the town magistrate 

     ichabod hears sounds of sheep in agitation at some distance but he
     holds philipse to his story

                             philipse contd
                to protect the rights of her
               child  i was bound by my oath of
               office to keep the secret 

                             ichabod
               do you believe the father killed
               her

                             philipse
                     stares at him in
                     surprise
               the horseman killed her   you damn
               fool do you suppose the horseman
               stops to impregnate our women

                             ichabod
               the horseman  how often do i have to
               tell you there is no horseman  there
               never was a horseman   and there
               never will be a horseman

     ichabod grabs him fiercely pulling on the amulet philipse wears
     around his neck

                             philipse
               let go   it is my talisman that
               protects me from the horseman

                             ichabod
               you a magistrate   and your head
               full of such nonsense  now tell me
               the name of 

     a flock of sheep comes streaming and bleating across the path

     the horses go crazy braying and rearing  a sound is heard distant
     thundering hoofbeats  wind kicks up

     philipse looks to the forest  a flock of birds alights

                             philipse
               oh my oh my oh my oh my 

     philipse runs away  hoofbeats louder closer  ichabod faces the
     forest

     the forest explodes open foliage bending to make way as the headless
     horseman gallops into view atop daredevil

     ichabods stunned  he looks down to draw his flintlock pistol but the
     horseman roars by before he can raise it  a blast of air knocks
     ichabod off his horse

     after this everything happens very quickly 

     the horseman chases philipse

     philipse looks over his shoulder

     the horseman draws his sword

     philipse gathers his courage and stops turning  he raises his iron
     key talisman before him  the horseman is closing 

                             ichabod
               philipse

     philipse holds the talisman up trying to be fearless  the horseman
     swings his sword upon the talisman  clank 

     philipses severed head spins  his body falls and folds

     the two pieces of philipses talisman an iron key fly through the
     air toward ichabod who has only just managed to find his feet and
     find his fallen pistol

     the horseman turns daredevil in a wide circle 

     daredevil completes the turn letting out a screechy cry as the
     horseman rides straight toward ichabod 

     before ichabod has time to take aim the horseman is upon him and past
     him   heading toward philipses corpse leans effortlessly to
     skewer philipses head with his sword

     with the head as his prize the horseman races away

     ichabod turns watches the horseman head to the forest

     ichabod stands stricken  he faints

     int  van tassel house ichabods bedroom  day

     ichabod gasps awake  a knocking is heard

                             baltuss voice os
               constable crane 

     ichabod looks at his hand balled into a fist  he opens his hand 
     holds both halves of philipses iron key talisman

     int  van tassel house upstairs hall 3rd floor  day

     young masbath is seated by ichabods closed door  katrina is backing
     up baltus who knocks again

                             baltus
               has he not come out at all

     young masbath shakes his head

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  day

     baltus enters  katrina and masbath follow him cautiously visiting
     the sick ichabod sits up in bed stunned spaced out

                             ichabod
               it was a headless horseman

                             baltus
               you must not excite yourself

                             ichabod
               but it was headless horseman

                             baltus
               of course it was

                             ichabod
               no you must believe me it was
               horseman  a dead one  headless

                             baltus
               i know i know 

                             ichabod
               you dont know because you werent
               there  but its all true

                             baltus
               of course it is  i told you
               everyone told you

                             ichabod
                     wildly
               i saw him

     his eyes roll up and he faints  katrina and masbath look helplessly at
     each other

                             young masbath
               i suppose its back to the city
               then

     katrinas reaction is mixed  glad that ichabod will be safe sorry
     if he leaves

     ichabods dream  forest  day

     a million white milkweed seedlings are floating in sunlight  young
     ichabods laughter is heard

     now we see that his mother is blowing the seedlings for his delight
     she gives him a milkweed pod and shows him how to do it for himself
     ichabod breaks the pod and releases another million  but when he looks
     around to share the delight his mother has gone and he sees her
     disappearing among the trees  he goes to follow her

     ichabods dream  forest glade  day

     ichabod cant see his mother anywhere 

     then he sees her standing in the middle of a circle of beautiful
     toadstoolsmushrooms growing in the glade

     ichabod watches as his mother turns inside the mushroom circle almost
     dancing  he smiles  then he sees his mother stoop to pick a mushroom
     she eats it  she looks happy  she drops a small piece of the mushroom

     ichabod sees it fall

     he runs forward and picks it up before she sees him  ichabod eats it
     his mother sees him takes his hands in hers and dances around in a
     circle

     as ichabod whizzes around laughing his pov becomes the encircling
     trees whizzing around and suddenly he seems to be surrounded by
     menacing headless figures dressed all in black

     ichabod falls over dizzy and when he looks up he sees that the
     headless figures have become his father watching his mother
     heedlessly dancing his face like thunder  his mother has loosened her
     clothes and is virtually barebreasted

     his fathers eyes begin to glow like live coals as ichabod cowers away
     from him

     ichabods dream  ichabods house  night

     ichabods eyes are spying through a crack in the kitchen door

     when we see him properly he is wearing a nightshirt  then we see his
     pov into the kitchen

     ichabods dream  young ichabods kitchen  night

     mother is seated her head down  father paces chastising mother
     angrily his fist balled up in rage

     father continues berating mother  he picks up his bible off the table
     waving it then grabs mother by the shoulders forcing her to the
     floor 

     father forces mother to her knees  mother is afraid clasping her
     hands in front of her as father forces her to pray  father starts
     reading from the bible  in ichabods dream this is the same bible
     from baltuss house

     ichabods dream  young ichabods stairwell  night

     ichabod watches afraid  he backs away returning upstairs

     ichabods dream  young ichabods bedroom  night

     a window is thrown crashing open thunder booming young ichabod
     sits up in his bed  he goes to close the window rain pouring in  he
     looks down 

     ichabods dream  ext  young ichabods house  night

     below in front of the home a man drags mother toward a coach  two
     men stand watching faces hidden under hat brims  mother looks back
     eyes pleading struggling 

     mother looks up to young ichabod

     the two men looks up to young ichabod one is father and the third
     man is a cotton matherish man with a villainous face

     young ichabod reaches helplessly toward mother

     mother is forced into the coach

     the third man speaks to father then walks to the coach  he gets onto
     the coach as the coach starts away

     father watches rain flowing down his stony features  lighting
     flashes and we see the family cat watching with glowing eyes

     int  van tassel house  day

     ichabods eyes as he opens them  he wakes breathing heavily

     after a beat he flings back the bedclothes and springs out of bed
     energized by a new determination

               case without parallel in the annals

               a basket of eggs many a day

                             ichabod

               the van garretts

                             young masbath
                     surprised

               coach house

     ichabod halts his horse surprised

                             young masbath contd
               its nothing  there were many
               servants all dismissed now of
               course
                     beat  they ride on
               but there was something happened one
               night a week before the murder  an
               argument upstairs between father and
               son and my father was later sent
               for by mr van garrett

                             ichabod
               an argument between father and son
                     to himself
                     thoughtfully
               after which the elder van garrett
               summoned his servant masbath 

     young masbath halts his horse and looks around

                             young masbath
               listen

                             ichabod
               i hear nothing

               nor i  no birds  no crickets 

     everything has gone quiet

                             young masbath contd
                its all gone so quiet 

     ichabod notes this nervously

                             ichabod
               youre right

     he gees up the horses  they break into a gallop  a moving pov watches
     them gallop by

     ext  western woods and cave entrance  day

     ichabod and masbath reach a hill crest  they stop uneasy

     below there is a cave with a rock archway  an illfitting door covers
     the mouth  the chimney spews smoke

     ichabod and masbath share a fearful look

     elsewhere someone watches a moving pov watches ichabod and masbath
     as they ride to the cave following 

     ichabod and young masbath dismount tying their horses then heading
     to the cave  they arrive at the cave door  ichabod hesitantly knocks

     int  cave home  day

     the door is ajar ichabod and young masbath step in walls are hung
     with skins and skeletons  across the cave a crone sits facing away
     motionless

     ichabod and young masbath look to each other fearful

                             ichabod
               pardon my intrusion 

     the crone with gray hair and gray features sits disinterested
     behind ichabod edges slowly forward 

                             crone
               you are from the hollow

                             ichabod
               in a way yes  i um 

     ichabod is distracted by gourd bowls of dead insects leaves and
     acorns knives scissors and yellowed bones

                             ichabod contd
               i should like to say um i make
               no assumptions about your
               occupation no your ways witch 
               which  which are nothing to me 
               um whatever you are each to his
               own  um 

     the crone places something on a table beside her a dead bird a
     bright red cardinal

     ichabod backs away but masbath comes to stand beside him

                             young masbath
               do you know of the horseman
               maam   the hessian

     the crone draws her finger across her neck

                             young masbath contd
               thatll be him miss

     around her neck is a cord on which is threaded a carved stone a
     mystic bauble  ichabod notices it  the crone stands faces them tall
      points to ichabod

                             crone

                     to young masbath
               go out child  keep away  no matter
               what you hear keep away

     she takes a candle and heads deeper into the cave 

     int  cave home lower cave  day

     the crone enters through a passage ichabod follows terrified bent
     under the low ceiling

                             ichabod
               um what might he hear that he must
               keep away from 

                             crone
               sit there

     ichabod sits on a crooked stool  the crone kneels with her back to
     him grasps two metal cuffs with chains attached slides these onto
     her wrists testing them 

                             crone contd
               he rides to the hollow and back  i
               hear him  i smell the blood on him

                             ichabod
               do do you  well im here to find
               him and er make him stop 

                             crone
               you want to see into the netherworld
                i can show you 

     the crone gathers straw in a pile on the floor then gathers bowls
     putting grass and powder on the pile withering over it  she takes a
     jar from a table

                             ichabod
               what what are you doing

     the crone shakes one jar pulls the lid off and upends it  a baby bat
     squirms dazed  the crone grips the bat uses a knife to cut off its
     head soaks the straw with blood

                             crone
               do not move or speak  when the other
               comes i will hold him

     using her candle the crone lights the straw pile

                             ichabod

                     bends to inhale smoke
               he comes now

     ichabod would like to leave now

     ext  cave home  day

     young masbath waits  wind picks up kicking leaves sending them in
     swirls  masbath holds himself against the chill

     int  cave home lower cave  day

     the crone slumps forward to the floor suddenly immobile still with
     her back to ichabod  wind howls through a holewindow

     ichabod looks around uncertain stands

                             ichabod
               excuse me maam 

     the crone remains motionless  the wind intensifies  candles blow out
     ichabod inches closer

               do you hear me 

     int  cave home lower cave  day

     the crone suddenly jumps erect spinning  a halfhuman halfdemon
     creature black clawed hands reaching 

     ichabod cries out leaping backward 

     chains on the restraining cuffs around the creatures hands go taut
     yanking the creature back

     ichabod knocks over a table of bones hits the floor  the creature is
     chained but still wants ichabod  it shrieks

     the creatures face still seethes from transformation

               you seek the warrior bathed in blood
                the headless horseman

               place  do you hear 

     ichabod nods quaking aghast  he glances to the exit

     the chain bolt gives more coming loose 

     ichabod flees toward the door  the creature howls leaping the chain
     bolt breaks 

     ichabod cries out as he is tackled to the floor 

     int  cave home lower cave  day

     it is only the crone lying on him she has returned to human form
     semiconscious  ichabod desperately shoves her off 

     ext  cave home  day

     ichabod sprints out from the cave past young masbath

     ichabod scrambles onto gunpowder riding glancing back  young masbath
     follows

     ext  western woods area two farther on  later day

     ichabod and young masbath ride side by side

                             ichabod
               without difficulty i rather fear
               and climb down to the horsemans
               resting place  she said

                             ichabod
               his grave

     a snapping branch is heard  ichabod turns to look back 

                             ichabod contd
                     whispers to masbath
               quicken pace

     ichabod rides faster  young masbath keeps up 

     farther on they charge over a hill  ichabod halts gunpowder climbs
     clumsily off handing the reins to masbath

                             ichabod contd
               ride on

     young masbath obeys  ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into
     forest growth backtracking 

     ext  western woods area three  day

     inside the forest ichabod moves through underbrush keeping low  a
     horse is heard snorting

     ichabod forges on pushes through branches fearful 

     he comes up behind a figure in a gray cloak on horseback raising his
     pistol cocking the hammer 

                             ichabod
               halt and turn  i have a pistol
               aimed

     the figure stops pushes off the cloak hood  it is katrina

                             katrina
               it is me

                             ichabod
                     lowers gun shaken
               katrina i might have killed you
               why have you come

                             katrina
               because no one else would go with
               you

     she smiles a little  ichabod is heartened

                             ichabod
               i am now twice the man

     ichabod takes her hand

                             ichabod contd
               it is your white magic

     she is about to turn this moment into a kiss  but 

                             young masbath os
               pardon my intrusion 

     ichabod and katrina look to see masbath has backtracked

                             young masbath
               i think youd better come and look
               at this 

     ichabod and katrina move to follow young masbath

     ext  western woods tree of the dead  dusk

     ichabod masbath and katrina come into a clearing slowing their
     horses looking up in wonder at 

     the monstrously huge tree of the dead at the clearings center

     its branches reach far and wide knotted and gross like agony
     captured in wood sculpture

                             young masbath
               the tree of the dead

                             katrina
               it does announce itself

     ichabod dismounts crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will
     not grow  young masbath and katrina dismount behind  they all walk
     toward the tree 

     ichabod stares up into the endless dead canopy of branches

     theres a vertical wound in the bark like a terrible suture now
     healed and scarred  ichabod approaches 

     he feels the mushy scar picking at its scabs till sap begins to run
     red sap  ichabod fingers it sniffs it

                             ichabod
               blood

                             katrina
               the tree bleeds  how can it be

     ichabod goes to where katrina and masbath wait with the horses digs
     in a saddle bag for a hand axe

                             young masbath
               what is it

                             ichabod
               stay here

     at the trunk ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the
     suture  it sounds hollow  he begins to chop 

     he chops into the suture pulls away loose bark  the tree drips more
     blood and a goo  ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture

                             katrina
               what are you doing

                             ichabod
               just keep where you are

     young masbath moves closer  ichabod keeps chopping then grips a
     large loose flap trying to pull it away  its not easy  ichabod
     struggles

     katrina follows young masbaths slow advance

     ichabods pulling  the flap suddenly gives revealing a blood
     soaked wideeyed gapmouthed human head

     ichabod recoils  behind him katrina stifles a scream

     ichabod backs off back of his hand to his mouth

     it is philipses head hanging off the trunk flap held by roots grown
     around and into the flesh

     four other severed decaying heads are held by ingrown roots within
     the dewy innards

     one of the heads is jonathan masbaths  before young masbath sees it
     katrina hides his face in her bosom and comforts him

                             katrina
               my god 

                             ichabod
               he he tries to take the heads back
               with him  they will not pass 

                             katrina
               we must leave this place

     ichabod looks to the branches towering above

                             ichabod
               this is a gateway between two
               worlds 

     ichabod studies the ground circling the trunk around the other
     side ichabod gets to his knees 

     hes found the horsemans sword the grave marker jutting out from
     the ground rusted twenty years worth gripped by the tree trunk and
     vines

                             ichabod contd
                     touching the ground
               climb down to the horsemans resting
               place 
                     looks to masbath
               bring the shovel

     now he sees katrina hugging the boy

                             ichabod contd
               forgive me i 

     young masbath courageously recovers himself wiping his eyes and nose
     on the back of his sleeve

                             young masbath
               yes sir  the shovel two
               shovels and the rifle i suggest

     ext  western woods tree of the dead  dusk

     lantern light

     young masbaths crouched rifle across his knees  he watches the tree
     looking up 

     high branches swarm with bats

     behind masbath ichabod and katrina dig up the shallow grave

                             katrina
               this ground has been disturbed the
               soil is loose

     ichabod throws down his shovel

     young masbath comes to the grave  ichabod pulls at thick burlap cloth
     heavy with dirt straining as it comes away 

     ichabod drops the burlap looking down disbelieving 

                             ichabod
               look 

     we see roots have gripped the horsemans bones and tattered uniform
     the skeleton is all there  except the skull

                             katrina
               the skull is gone  what does it
               mean

     ichabod jumps out from the grave snapping his fingers

                             ichabod
                     energized
               it means my dear miss van tassel
               it means  yes  what exactly does
               it mean   it means unless i am
               mistaken it definitely means
               something  what that something is
               only time will tell  but i sense
               that we are very close to the answer
               here if only we had one more
               clue 

     ichabod is unaware that the ground is writhing around him

                             katrina os
               ichabod 

     ichabod turns looks 

     katrina and young masbath back away because the roots in the grave
     are alive entwining around remains

     ichabod spins to the twisted tree 

     the vertical suture seethes pulling inward sucking philipses head
     back in and closing bubbling

     ichabod bounds over the grave dirt pile hastening katrina and young
     masbath along as he flees across the field

     at the tree the suture swells

     ichabod katrina and young masbath pass where their freaking horses
     are tied to a fallen trunk heading for cover

     a rumbling is heard from the tree  its wound suddenly bursts wide
     spitting smoldering cinders

     at the tree line ichabod katrina and young masbath take cover
     looking back

     ext  western woods tree of the dead effect  dusk

     from the tree wound a glow brightens till suddenly the headless
     horseman and daredevil explode into existence they hit the ground
     running

     ext  western woods tree of the dead  dusk

     ichabod watches the horseman ride away bolts of lighting striking the
     ground behind

     the horseman disappears into the forest

                             ichabod

     the horseman rips past on daredevil 

     ext  western woods area three  night

     ichabod rides as fast as gunpowder is able 

     ext  western woods area two farther on  night

     trees are silhouetted against the sky  as daredevils hoofbeats get
     louder branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch  as
     hoofbeats roar past the trees relax

     ext  western woods area two farther on  night

     ichabod ducks under foliage as he pursues  he sees 

     through the forest ahead the skys lit up  distant fire

     ext  western woods cave home  night

     the crones cave vomits flame

     ichabod arrives on gunpowder horrified struggling for control as
     gunpowder rears trying to see through black smoke 

     embers swirl everywhere  ichabod dismounts moving closer to the cave
      suddenly he slips 

     ichabod falls down a bloody rock landing very close to the crones
     headless body  ichabod recoils crawling away looking to the carnage
     in terror 

     the corpse lies near the cave entrance  the jagged skin of the neck
     wound still bleeds  the ground and dead leaves around the corpse are
     thick with blood  ichabod crawls back to the crone terrified because
     he has seen a clue

     the cord around the crones neck has been cut and the carved bauble is
     missing along with the crones head

     ichabod hears a horse neighing in the trees and the sound of the
     horse crashing through the undergrowth departing but he can see
     nothing

     ext  forest  night

     brom theodore and glen are on patrol  brom with his new rifle  they
     can hear the same horse crashing invisibly through branches the sound
     of hooves  they cant tell where the sound is coming from  they look
     around nervously

                             brom
               split up  he wont get away

     the three of them gallop off in three directions

     when they clear the frame there is a sound of deep rumbling the sound
     we heard before jonathan masbath was murdered

     int  killians home kitchen  night

     small home  killian thomas and beth killians wife have finished
     supper  beth clears plates as killian picks his teeth with a knife

     the same rumbling sound is faintly heard

     the glasses on the table shiver audibly  killian notices  then the
     phenomenon stops  killian continues picking his teeth

     thomas gets down from his chair  he goes to the fireplace to light a
     tallow wick which he takes to the next room

     int  killians home white room  night

     thomas plops on the floor and lights his magic lantern a lantern with
     an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions and
     monsters

     thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures
     shadows are cast

     he roars for them imagining them real and having a grand time

     int  killians home kitchen  night

     beth comes for dishes

                             beth

               for it

     spinning anew quickly around and around

     int  killians home kitchen  night

     with a roar the fire flares  killian looks in the leaping flames
     he seems to see  as we also seem to see  the illusion of demonic
     faces molded out of flames

     behind killian the door splinters inward  the horseman steps in a
     battle axe in each hand  wind blasts 

     the door to the other room slams  killian grabs a chair and hurls
     it

     spear thrust through a smoldering sack of rotten flesh  the horseman
     pulls broms knife blade first from his chest and turns upon brom

               after us

     brom shakes himself free and 

     fires  the bullet rips through the horsemans stomach to reveal
     putrid innards

     the horseman turns and strides back  no more nice guy

                             ichabod contd

     handle in the other scythe 

     the horseman flatfoot kicks brom sending him down

     brom picks up ichabods sickle and swings it 

     the blade embeds in the horseman down to the hilt

                             ichabod contd
               we cannot win this

     brom yanks ichabod to his feet and grabs his scythes

     as they flee ichabod grabs a woodsplitting axe from the stump where
     its imbedded

     behind the horseman manages to extract the sickle drops it

     brom and ichabod head toward the covered bridge that leads across to

     limps

     behind the horseman picks up the pace closing fast 

     inside the bridge ichabod and brom are halfway across  footsteps are
     heard pounding  ichabod glances back 

     the horseman is not behind them  ichabod and brom looks up  the
     pounding footsteps are on the roof passing over 

     ahead at the mouth of the covered bridge the horseman leaps down
     spinning in midair lands crouched

     ichabod and brom halt  the horseman rises

     ichabod releases brom and moves forward gripping his wood axe in both
     hands swinging the axe downward 

     the horseman swings his axe  splinters ichabods axe handle

     the horseman axe in one hand sword in the other turns upon brom
     and in pulling brom aside out of the path of the sword ichabod
     recieves a swordthrust in the shoulder which makes him screem out

     the horseman lifts his sword arm throwing ichabod and withdrawing the
     sword in one motion ichabod tumbles

     brom moves forward with scythes  the horseman sets upon him with
     incredible ferocity  battling brom back striking so hard and fast
     its hard for brom to keep blocking

     ichabod tries to get up but falls looking up 

     ichabods pov

     the horseman knocks one of broms scythes away takes another swing 
     sends brom spinning in a spray of blood 

     the horseman stands over broms body chopping with his sword  our
     point of view grows blurry 

     a blurry horseman approaches the pov

     ichabod is at the horsemans mercy

     then another angle  the horseman ignores ichabod strides past him
     ichabod takes a step back and collapses

     observes

               remarkable  a wound like this should
               have killed him but it needs no
               stitch and theres hardly loss of
               blood

     trust lancaster  katrina comes to the bedside with her beaker  ichabod
     sees her  he is in pain feverish

               brom or me if brom had not
               attacked him 

                             baltus

                             ichabod

               sake of killing he choses his
               victims

     she holds the beaker to ichabods lips  he drains it and falls back on
     the pillow closing his eyes

     baltus turns at a sound from the door

     lady van tassel has entered quietly  she comes to him anxiously and
     grips his hand

                             lady van tassel
               what is it baltus

                             baltus

               troubled my love 

     they hold hands lovingly staring at ichabod who has fallen asleep

     ichabods dream  church  night

     empty church  young ichabod enters carries a lantern past pews  he
     hears a sound moving behind a pew to hide

     ahead across the church a red door opens father and the
     villainous third man come out shutting the door speaking quietly
     the third man holds a piece of parchment paper  father is ever
     emotionless

     ichabod watches them ducking down to keep hidden 

     father and the third man walk to leave down the aisle passing close
     to ichabod without seeing him  they exit leaving young ichabod alone
     in the silent church

     young ichabod rises begins moving fearfully forward follow as he
     crosses through the church going to the red door opening it 

     ichabods dream  church beyond the red door  morning

     young ichabod enters  the room contains torture devices iron cuffs
     thumb screws knifes and needles  there is a spiked chair fitted with
     sharp spikes adorned with straps for holding down the accused

     young ichabod backs away terrified then sees 

     a shaft of light cuts across a large sarcophaguslike iron maiden 
     where mothers eyes can be seen through the slit in the iron maidens
     face  open eyes  dead eyes

     young ichabod lets out a strangled cry runs to the iron maiden
     trying to pull it open clawing at the lock 

     finally young ichabod backs away choking on misery  he looks around
     in despair  he falls to his knees at the spiked chair places his
     hands on the spikes pressing 

     as he sobs blood runs down from his hands  he looks down and sees the
     cat is there looking up at him  the cat reaches up to rub its head
     against his face

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  night

     ichabod sobbing has jerked up out of the dream straight into
     katrinas embrace

     she is sitting on the bed holding him calming him  she notices blood
     on his palms

     she takes a plain linen handkerchief from her cuff and dabs at the
     blood

                             katrina
               hush hush you were dreaming

     ichabod falls back on the pillow

                             ichabod
               yes thing i had forgotten and
               would like not to remember

                             katrina
               perhaps the remembering is the hard
               road to peace of mind what ails
               you ichabod

                             ichabod
               i was well it was the world that
               was ill but since i came here 

                             katrina
               you were not a happy man when you
               came  i think your wound was deeper
               than the wound you received from the
               horseman 
                     she puts her hand on
                     his forehead
               but your fever is broken and though
               i cannot cure the world i would make
               you live happy in it tell me what
               you dreamed

                             ichabod

               good and evil sometimes wear each
               others clothes  she was an

               condemned murdered by my

               by a bibleblack tyrant behind a
               mask of righteousness  i was seven
               when i lost my faith

                             katrina
               what do you believe in ichabod

                             ichabod
               sense and reason cause and
               consequence an ordered universe 
               oh lord i should not have come to
               this place where my rational mind
               has been so controverted by the
               spirit world 

                             katrina
               is there nothing you will take from
               sleepy hollow that was worth the
               coming here

     their eyes meet

                             ichabod
               no not nothing  a kiss and how
               rare a thing a kiss from a lovely
               woman before she saw my face or knew
               my name

                             katrina
               yes without sense or reason 

     they hold still perhaps about to kiss

                             katrina contd
               it was a kiss on account

     but ichabod breaks the moment

                             ichabod
               oh  god forgive me  i talk of
               kisses and you have lost your brave
               man brom 

                             katrina
               i have shed my tears for brom and
               yet my heart is not broken  do you
               think me wicked

                             ichabod
               no but perhaps there is a little
               bit of the witch in you katrina

                             katrina
               why do you say that

                             ichabod
               because you have bewitched me

     this time their held look turns into a passionate embrace 

     ext  van tassel house porch  night

     young masbath slowly opens the door to peer out  he walks out onto the
     porch watching as 

     across the lawn a cloaked figure walks carrying a lantern  the
     figure heads onto the long straight road into the forest lantern
     light dissipating

     young masbath steps off the porch in cautious pursuit

     ext  the hollow  early morning

     dawn light is visible over fogshrouded forests

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  morning

     ichabod awakes rolls finds lady van tassel at his bedside with food
     and drink  ichabod covers himself with his sheets

                             lady van tassel
               you slept like the dead

                             ichabod
               you are too kind to me i do not
               look to be served by the lady of the
               house

                             lady van tassel
                     smiles
               nor would you be but that the
               servant girl has vanished

                             ichabod
               sarah

                             lady van tassel
               run away like many more  people
               are leaving in fear without
               ceremony

                             ichabod
               where is 

                             lady van tassel
               she watched over you till dawn  now
               it is her turn to sleep

     young masbath enters as lady van tassel goes out

     ichabod looks at his palms which are stained with dried blood

                             ichabod
               help me  i am fit for another day i
               think

     the scene incorporates young masbath pouring water for ichabod to wash
     himself and helping him into his clothes

                             young masbath
               where are we going

                             ichabod
               to the notarys office

                             young masbath
               why

                             ichabod
               because that is where i expect to
               find deposited the last will and
               testament of the elder van
               garrett 

                             young masbath
               you have thought of something 

                             ichabod
                of something you said young
               masbath the widow winship came
               many a day with a basket of eggs to
               van garrett who i understand had
               hens to spare i begin to see  it
               was van garretts child that the
               widow was carrying  and what news
               have you

                             young masbath
               i heard someone leaving last night
               looked like they headed to town but
               i lost them in the woods

                             ichabod
               you didnt see who

                             young masbath
               all i saw was their lantern

     ichabod ponders troubled as masbath brings him a shirt

                             ichabod
               the horseman does the killing but i
               believe at the bidding of a mortal
               someone of flesh and blood

                             young masbath
               what   what makes you say that

                             ichabod
               the witch the crone when i
               happened upon her corpse she lay in
               a pool of blood  blood poured hard
               from her neck  the wound was not
               cauterized

                             young masbath
               then she was not killed by the
               hessian  someone only tried to make
               it seem so

                             ichabod
                     nods
               it was the settling of a private
               score  but the horseman cuts heads
               to a different drum  the crone
               pointed us to what drives the
               hessian  his skull has been stolen
               from his grave  the person who stole
               it has power over the hessian  here
               is why the headless one has returned
               through the gate of the tree of the
               dead  he chops heads until his own
               is restored to him

                             young masbath
               but what person 

                             ichabod
               a person who stands to gain by these
               murders

     ext  town square church  day

     wagons horses and townspeople swarm  a crowd empties the towns
     general store  provisions are passed along man to man and loaded
     onto wheelbarrows

     ichabod and young masbath ride passing many angry faces

     all up and down the long straight road home owners board up windows
     with lumber

     ichabod and young masbath stop tying their horses in front of the
     notary ichabod looks off 

     down the road people head to the church  much activity 

                             ichabod
               sanctuary  or so they hope

     people carry supplies into the church within the bordering wrought
     iron fence  others work to build and erect massive wooden crosses

     in the crowd here reverend steenwyck spots ichabod and young masbath
     pushes past people shouting 

                             steenwyck
               there he is  there 

     people begin to pay attention to steenwyck as he climbs atop a crate
     pointing toward ichabod 

                             steenwyck contd
                     to everyone
               the desecrater of christian burial
               twice he met the horseman and kept
               his head  how is it so 

     at the notary ichabod tries to ignore heads inside as a clod of
     earth hits him on the shoulder

     in the churchyard steenwyck continues his rant

                             steenwyck contd
               the devil protects his own

     int  notary public hardenbrooks offices  day

     a small untidy room with piles of dusty documents in great disorder
     the notary hardenbrook looks at ichabod with his one good eye  young
     masbath stands near

                             ichabod
               i take it mr hardenbrook that
               wills and testaments are held here
               on public record

     hardenbrook is in a funk trying to act calm  he passes a document
     across the desk

                             hardenbrook
               i believe this is what you wish to
               see  take it and go

     ichabod scans the will of peter van garrett

                             hardenbrook contd
               van garrett senior left his estate
               to his next of kin that is to say
               to his only son  however the son
               being murdered in the same
               instant 

                             ichabod
               the next of kin after the son would
               be the eldest of the line from van
               garretts fathers sister none
               other than the baltus van tassel
               something else no one thought to
               mention

                             hardenbrook
               well you have found your way to it
               and i hope you will leave now before
               my windows are boken

     the crowd murmurs outside like angry bees  ichabod flourishes the
     will

                             ichabod
               i am not ready to leave

     hardenbrook starts moaning and wringing his hands

                             ichabod contd
               a brick through your window is not
               what puts you in terror hardenbrook
                there is something else i saw
               your fear and steenwycks and the
               doctors when you met at philipses
               house philipse paid with his
               head and you fear for your own

                             hardenbrook
               yes its true   but we did not
               know it was a murdering plot when we
               were drawn in

                             ichabod
               drawn in by whom

                             hardenbrook
               mercy upon me   we meant no harm
               to come to her

                             ichabod
               no harm to come to whom

                             hardenbrook
                     babbling
               but the marriage made her next of
               kin

               he means old van garrett secretly
               married the widow winship

                             ichabod
                     getting it
               of course  and van garrett made a
               new will leaving everything to her
               and his unborn child so she stood
               between baltus and the legacy  where
               is the will

                             hardenbrook
               i cannot be seen to help you  the
               horseman will come for me  

                             ichabod

               last will and testament of 

     hardenbrook digs into a mountain of documents hurling handfuls into
     the air and flings the second will at ichabod  young masbath
     nervously checks the door

                             hardenbrook
               go then  i am a dead man

     he starts to sob

                             young masbath
               sir 

                             ichabod
                     reading
               young masbath i know why your
               father died  that night when van
               garrett quarreled with his son
               jonathan masbath was summoned
               upstairs to witness the new will
               here is your fathers signature  it
               was his death warrant

     young masbath takes the document and looks at it tearfully

                             ichabod contd
               but the secret was not safe  mrs
               killian the midwife was forewarned
               the baby was coming  and so she
               too had to die

     one of the other hurled documents has fluttered down fortuitously in
     front of ichabod  he picks it up

                             ichabod contd
               the marriage certificate  parson
               steenwyck married them  doctor
               lancaster confirmed the widow was
               pregnant  she told the secret to
               magistrate philipse  notary
               hardenbrook concealed the
               documents 

     hardenbrook snivels and moans and wrings his hands

                             ichabod contd
               and you all kept silence  why 
               for some nameless dread of the man
               who stood to gain by it  baltus
               van tassel

     int  van tassel house stairs  day

     ichabod and young masbath start up the stairs noticing

     int  van tassel house parlor  day

     baltus alone with a glass of liquor is brooding over an oak coffer
     of silver coins running coins through his fingers

     int  van tassel house stairs  day

     ichabod continues with young masbath speaking quietly

                             young masbath
               i think there is some error in your
               reasoning 

                             ichabod
                     politely
               really  do give me the benefit of
               your 

                             young masbath
               all these murders just so that
               baltus van tassel should inherit yet
               more land and property

                             ichabod
               precisely  men murder for profit
               possibly you dont know new york 

     suddenly he sees his bedroom door is ajar

     int  van tassel house ichabods bedroom  day

     ichabods entry surprises katrina sitting at ichabods desk
     reading his ledger

                             ichabod
               katrina why are you in my room

                             katrina

               interest

     ichabod and young masbath exchange a glance

                             ichabod
               well perhaps

                             katrina

                             katrina
                     smiles
               i dont know  perhaps he looked in
               your ledger and did not like what he
               saw 

     she leaves the ledger open on the desk  ichabod steps over to look
     young masbath cranes his neck to look  it is a page of doodles with
     the name katrina written several times and a sketch of katrina
     embarrassed ichabod closes the ledger

                             katrina contd
               he believes townfolk and country do
               not mix

     ichabod opens the drawer in the desk and puts away the document he
     took from the notary

     he is nervous because he knows they point to complicity by katrinas
     father  young masbath watching understands this ichabod locks the
     drawer and pockets the key

                             katrina contd
               what have you there

                             ichabod

               then i will leave you to your
               thoughts  sleep well

     katrina leaves  ichabod is troubled

     then  to add to his troubles  he suddenly sees a huge spider
     scuttling under his bed  he doesnt like spiders even small ones  he
     gives a yelp

                             young masbath
               its only a spider

                             ichabod

                             young masbath contd
               look 

     under the bed is revealed a strange pentagram drawn in chalk

                             young masbath contd
               the evil eye

                             ichabod

                             young masbath

                             ichabod
               the evil eye

     the spider is sitting on the pentagram

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  later night

     lights a candle  then he goes to wake young masbath

     ichabod and younng masbath come out of the room

     int  van tassel house second floor hallway  night

     lantern light moves far ahead  ichabod and young masbath follow
     fearful keeping hidden

     ext  forest by van tassel house farther on hillside  night

     ichabod and young masbath stop on a hillside

                             ichabod
               wait here

     ichabod advances up the hill peers forward to see 

     ext  forest clearing by van tassel house  night

     the lantern sits on a rock  on a blanket a seminaked man and semi
     naked woman are in the midst of rough sex

     ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush

     the couple keeps coupling the man on top  his grunts and gasps are
     particularly desperate  hes all over the woman who lays back it is
     lady van tassel

     ichabod swallows

     lady van tassel pulls down the mans shirt exposes his flesh  she
     raises a small sharp knife behind his back

     ichabods eyes widen  hes about to shout a warning but 

     lady van tassel brings the blade to her own hand slicing deep into
     her palm  blood flows  she rubs her cut hand over her partners
     arching back smearing blood

     lady van tassel caresses the mans chest neck face trailing blood
     the man lifts his head in ecstasy sucking the womans bloody fingers
      its reverend steenwyck

     ichabod backs away having seen more than enough

     ext  forest by van tassel estate hillside  night

     ichabod returns to young masbaths side

                             young masbath
               what was there

                             ichabod
               something i wish i had not seen  a
               beast with two backs

                             young masbath

               bewitched woods

     int  van tassel house ichabods room  night

     ichabod and young masbath enter

     ichabod sees that his desk drawer is slightly open

     he opens the drawer knowing the worst

     the documents have been taken

     masbath suddenly sniffs the air  he signals to ichabod alert  he
     shiffs again and in the grate is the source of the smell the
     documents burned to ashes

     ichabod in despondency brings his finger to his head rubbing his
     temples

     int  van tassel house kitchen  day

                             lady van tassel
               she will not see you

     she is talking to ichabod  her hand is loosely bandaged

                             ichabod
               did she say anything

                             lady van tassel
               only that she will not come down

                             ichabod

     ichabod turns to go

                             lady van tassel
               constable you have not asked me how
               i hurt my hand since yesterday 
               which would have been polite  in
               fact you have been as careful not to
               look at it as not to mention it

     she strips off the bandage to show a roughly sewn cut

                             ichabod
               yes  im sorry how did you 

     lady van tassel grabs ichabod by the wrist tight 

                             lady van tassel
                     whispering close

               what you saw promise me 

     ichabod tries to pull away but she grips tighter  the front door is
     heard slamming  ichabod is panicky

                             lady van tassel contd
               reverend steenwyck has power over
               me

               he knows something terrible against
               my dear husband  what you
               witnessed was the price of
               steenwycks silence

                             ichabod
               what does steenwyck know

                             lady van tassel
               later  later 

     she pulls away just as baltus enters

                             baltus
               the town is in a ferment  horror
               piled on tragedy  hardenbrook is
               dead  strangled

     baltus goes straight to a flagon on the side table and lifts it to his
     lips  ichabod stares at baltuss strong hands gripping the neck of the
     flagon

                             lady van tassel
               oh   that harmless old man

                             baltus

                             ichabod
               hanged himself

                             baltus
               reverend steenwyck has called a
               meeting at the church  tonight

                     to ichabod
               he will speak against you  if you
               are wise you will be gone from here
               steenwycks congregation is already
               halfway to being a mob

                             ichabod
               i will go when i have done what i
               came to do

     lady van tassel comes to calm her husband  baltus notices her wound

                             baltus
               what is this

                             lady van tassel
               i was careless with the kitchen

                             baltus
               the wound looks angry 

                             lady van tassel

               arrowroot flowers  i know where
               ill find some  will you ride with
               me

     ichabod slips silently out of the room

     int  van tassel house stairs  day

     ichabod goes up the stairs

     int  van tassel house second floor  day

     ichabod knocks quietly at katrinas door  no answer  he quietly opens
     the door

     int  van tassel house katrinas room  day

     katrinas bed has been slept in but its empty and she is not there

     but in the grate there is the telltale heap of charred paper and ash
     recognizable as ichabods documents

     a sound at the door makes him whip around  it is young masbath

                             young masbath
               i saw her riding away towards the
               old pasture

     int  windmill  day

     a small pile of straw burns  gloved hands unfold a paper filled with
     hair clippings which are sprinkled on the fire

     a cloaked figure kneels at the pile  this person removes a human skull
     from a cloth bag

     the skull is placed at center in the flames  its teeth are sharp cut
     to points  the horsemans skull

     int  van tassel estate  fields  day

     ichabod rides gunpowder approaching the ruined cottage  he finds
     katrina crouched over the hearthstone  her horse grazes  she hears his
     horse and turns

                             ichabod
               katrina 

     ichabod dismounts  katrina had made a small fire  she is doing
     magic mumbling  she turns to look at ichabod in anger and tears

                             ichabod contd
                     sympathetically
               you took the papers and burned
               them 

                             katrina
               so that you would not have them to
               accuse my father 

                             ichabod
               i i accuse no one but if there
               is guilt i cannot alter it no matter
               how much it grieves me and no
               spells of yours can alter it
               either 

                             katrina
               if you knew my father you would not
               have such harsh thoughts about him
                no nor if you felt anything for
               me

                             ichabod
                     in torment
               i am pinioned by a chain of
               reasoning  why else did his four
               friends conspire to conceal 

                             katrina
               you are the constable not i  so
               find another chain of reasoning and
               let me be

                             ichabod
               i cannot  not the one or the
               other  i am heartsick with it

                             katrina
               i think you have no heart  and i
               had a mind once to give you mine

     katrina mounts her horse which rears up  she is momentarily like a
     female warrior her eyes ablaze with anger and tears

                             ichabod
                     cries out
               yes  i think you loved me that day
               when you followed me into the
               western woods   to have braved
               such peril

                             katrina
                     scornfully
               what peril was there for me if it
               was my own father who controlled the
               headless horseman  goodbye
               ichabod crane  i curse the day you
               came to sleepy hollow

     ichabod watches her gallop away and hides his anguished face for
     comfort in gunpowders neck

     ext  field and copse  evening

     a distant bell is tolling as baltus waits on his horse watching
     where lady van tassel can be glimpsed among the spaced trees gathering
     arrowroot flowers

                             baltus
                     calls out
               come  hurry up  the meeting bell has
               started toning

     he looks anxiously toward the vinage then back to the trees where
     to his horror he sees the headless horseman moves slowly toward lady
     van tassel calmly unsheathing his sword

     ext  sleepy hollow church  night

     people are entering the church while the bell tolls them in watched
     grimly by steenwyck

     ext  sleepy hollow town square church  night

     more people are heading toward the church  in the shadows ichabod
     hatted and cloaked to make himself look anonymous also watches the
     people going by and sees katrina among them

     baltus comes charging through the town square on his horse

                             baltus
               the horseman 

     baltus is barely hanging on  he stops falling off his horse
     scrambling toward katrina who is not far from ichabod

                             baltus contd
               save me

                             baltus
               he killed her 

     baltus grasps katrina deathly afraid

                             baltus contd
               the horseman has killed your
               stepmother

     hoofbeats are heard the screechy cry of daredevil  baltus looks 

     the horseman rides into view giving chase 

     instant mayhem  the few people in the churchyard flee heading for
     the church 

     baltus runs toward the church 

                             katrina
               father

     katrina chases after baltus  ichabod now sees that his case is
     falling apart  he and young masbath start running to the church

     int  church  night

     the gatherers in the pews react to the commotion shouting some
     running to the windows to the doors 

     ext  church  night

     baltus pushes through the iron gate across the churchyard bounding
     up the stairs katrina following him

     the horseman rides behind 

     ichabod with masbath follow into the churchyard  ichabod glances
     back 

                             ichabod
                     to young masbath
               i know what you are thinking

                             young masbath
               it seems baltus van tassel is not
               the one who controls the horseman

     as the horseman reaches the open gate daredevil rears up violently
     snorting unwilling to enter

     int  church  night

     baltus makes his way into the church shoving people aside

     men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at the boarded
     windows  women herd children into a cellar

     baltus searches for a hiding place moves toward the back 

     katrina moves through following baltus 

     at the front of the church ichabod squeezes in just as the front
     doors are forced shut  ichabod surveys the madness 

     ichabod runs to a window looking out between boards 

     ext  church  night

     at the church yard gates the horseman grabs daredevils reins tries
     to move forward again  same result  daredevil freaks

     the horseman gives his axe an underhand toss to the ground inside
     the gate 

     the axe instantly begins to degrade  like dust in the rain

     the horseman steers away keeping outside the fence

     int  church  night

     ichabod comes away from the window looking to the mass of panicked
     citizens  he sees katrina pushing up the aisle shes heading toward
     baltus

     katrina turns to ichabod her face aflame with accusation

     ichabod is humbled desperate to make it up  but katrina runs toward
      the altar where she prostrates herself evidently in a paroxysm of
     despair

     rifles boom loudly as men at the windows begin firing 

     ext  church  night

     the horseman circles under fire

     great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church

     men fire down from the belfry

     parts of the horseman and daredevil splatter red as slugs hit without
     effect

     at the other side of the church 

     the horseman circles heading to the town square 

     int  church  night

     riflemen shout to each other running to the opposite windows to
     follow the horseman

     young masbath grabs a rifle leaps to join the brigade

     baltus is trying to force his way to one of the cellar doors when
     steenwyck grips him angrily shoves him 

                             steenwyck
               youll kill us all 

     baltus stumbles back topples pews

                             steenwyck contd

     off one iron post which is pointed on top like an arrow head

     int  church  night

     baltus holds everyone away with the pistol enraged 

                             baltus
               the next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet

     doctor lancaster who so far has just been one of the crowd now
     pushes his way between steenwyck and baltus

                             doctor lancaster
               enough have died already
                     to steenwyck
                     meaningfully
               it is time to confess our sins and
               ask god to forgive our trespasses

                             steenwyck
               dont be a fool  i warn you doctor
               lancaster  

                             baltus
                     to doctor lancaster
               what is it that you know

                             doctor lancaster
                     to baltus
               your four friends played you false
               we were devilishly possessed by one
               who 

     thats as far as he gets before steenwyck wrenches a heavy ornate
     cross from the wall and smashes his skull with a blow of tremendous
     force with the cross

     baltus fires  blasts a bloody hole in steenwycks stomach 

     everyone backs farther away as steenwyck falls  steenwyck lays
     gasping eyes huge  he tries crawl 

     katrina rises to her feet and stands staring wideeyed at the horror
     ichabod moves toward her

     steenwyck lays still with a bloody gurgle face down  baltus looks to
     all the horrified people around him

                             baltus
               there is conspiracy here  and i will
               seek it out

     crash   the iron post comes spearing through a window trailing
     rope 

     crack  skewers baltus from behind its bloodied point bursting out
     through his breastbone 

     baltus gasps stunned he drops the gun looks down to clutch the
     post  blood streams out of his mouth

     ichabod catches katrina as she swoons  horrorstruck he hugs her and
     thus notices that hanging on a ribbon around her neck is the little
     carved bauble taken from the neck of the dead crone  almost at the
     same time ichabod sees that on the flagstones where katrina was lying
     there is now a drawing done in chalk identical to the evil eye
     drawing he found under his bed

                             ichabod
                     gasps
               the evil eye again

     at that moment a piece of white chalk falls from katrinas senseless
     hand

                             ichabod contd
               oh god it was you

     the full horrible implication of this hits ichabod just as

     the rope tied to the post suddenly yanks baltus backward with
     incredibleforce  slams him into the window 

     ext  church  night

     baltus crashes backward through the window hits the ground
     dragged

               her

     her neck

     ichabod stands watching her alone with his grief and his appalling
     secret

                             ichabod

               but who will look for the truth when
               you have gone

                             ichabod

     the cart is being pulled at a walking pace by a single horse  the cart
     man walking holding the bridle

     the cart man pauses seeing a rider approaching traveling in the same
     direction as ichabods coach

     ichabod realizes that the rider is katrina  he looks from the coach

     recognizes the drawing of the supposed evil eye identical to
     the two we have seen before  but what gets ichabods real attention is
     the bold headline

     the headline over the picture is for the protection of a loved one
     against evil spirits

     shrieks with laughter

     along the treeline the horseman breaks into the open hell on
     horseback  full speed ahead

               have you come back to arrest him
               after all

     ichabod thinks fast moving to the windmill leading katrina and young
     masbath along with him

                             ichabod
               quickly 

     behind wind tosses lady van tassels dress and hair  she holds the
     horsemans skull high

                             lady van tassel
               mind your hat constable

     young masbath scurries up the ladder and in

     katrinas next  ichabod looks behind the horseman is almost upon
     them

     ichabod follows katrina pulling himself up  the horseman arrives
     dismounting moving forward

     ichabod leaps up lifts the heavy trap door on its hinges slams it
     the door is pounded from outside buckling

                             young masbath
               it wont hold

     ichabod goes to a large grindstone against a wall  he struggles to
     roll it 

     young masbath helps him roll it to the trapdoor  it falls on top with
     a thud  masbath jumps back as the horsemans sword jabs up through the
     grindstones center hole

     the sword withdraws  pounding begins anew

     ext  windmill  night

     the horseman chops at the door with his axe

     int  windmill  night

     pounding continues katrina and young masbath back away  ichabod holds
     his lantern up desperate for ideas searching

     above to the right is the high milling platform where grain is
     ground and bagged and a ladder leading to it  to the left is the
     crooked open staircase

     ichabod picks up a bailing hook a plan forming  he gives his lantern
     to katrina and points

                             ichabod
               get up these stairs  open the door
               to the roof and wait

     katrina and young masbath obey heading left  ichabod crosses to the
     right starts climbing the ladder to the milling platform 

     on the platform ichabod grasps a wooden lever pulling it

     the entire windmill creaks and groans as massive gears and
     counterwheels above begin to turn

     ext  windmill  night

     the windmills rotors slowly begin spinning

     under the windmill the horseman keeps chopping 

     his axe exposes grindstone throwing sparks

     int  windmill  night

     katrina looks down from the stairway  the pounding on the trap door
     causes the grindstone to jump

                             katrina
               ichabod 

                             ichabod
               keep climbing  i will follow 
                     under his breath
               hopefully

     ichabod drags large bags of grain lining them up at the edge of the
     milling platform

     above young masbath throws open the door to the roof

     below ichabod uses the bailing hook to cut holes into the grain bags
     so that milled grain spills out and falls to the floor creating
     clouds of grain dust

     ichabod grabs one open bag dumps it

     he slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system pushes it so it
     swings in circles grain flooding out 

     more and more dust rises filling the air 

     ext  windmill roof  night

     masbath and katrina come out  rotors spin behind them

     int  windmill  night

     the grindstone blocking the trap door falls through as wood splinters
     and gives  a moment then the horseman climbs in

                             katrina
                     looking in from above
               behind you

     ichabod looks down sees the horseman then looks to the staircase
     adjacent from the high platform  he runs 

     he leaps across the space between the platform and stairs 

     ichabod grasps the outer rail of the staircase hanging on pulls
     himself up onto the stairs 

     below the horseman moves through clouds of billowing dust runs and
     leaps incredibly high 

     the horseman grasps a hanging chain swinging his momentum carrying
     him in a wide arc 

     above ichabod runs upstairs to the roof door

     the horsemans weight swings him toward the stairwell 

     he releases the chain airborne momentarily 

     the horseman lands high up on the stairwell

     solids  he is made whole once more the same evil human face we saw
     in baltuss stories

     the horseman looks to ichabod and katrina touches his restored face
     daredevil rides up screeching  the horseman replaces his sword
     climbs into the saddle

     he rides toward katrina and ichabod but he does not want them  they
     are so exhausted they fall down  young masbath comes to stand with
     them

     the horseman leans to grab lady van tassels unconscious form pulls
     her up across daredevils back

     the horseman rides away with her

     ichabod and katrina watch him go  they look at each other then kiss
     gratefully  ichabod looks to young masbath 

                             ichabod contd
               how are you young masbath

                             young masbath
               weary sir

     ichabod holds out his arm  masbath comes over  they embrace  katrina
     touches the burned bullet hole in ichabods clothing

                             katrina
               i thought i had lost you

     ichabod reaches into his clothing takes out a book he kept in an
     inner pocket close to his heart 

     the book of spells with a bullet lodged in it

     katrina wraps her arms around ichabod

     ext  western woods tree of the dead  night

     hoofbeats

     the horseman enters the clearing holding on to lady van tassel
     ahead the tree of the dead awaits

     lady van tassel is awakening 

     the horseman grips lady van tassels hair pulling her face up closer
     to his just as she opens her eyes 

     lady van tassel screams 

     as the horseman brings his face to meet hers about to engage in a
     kiss his jagged teeth open wide

     ahead the twisted trees wound opens deep and glowing as daredevil
     picks up speed

     ext  western woods tree of the dead  night

     daredevil jumps in the air just as a lightning bolt blasts down from
     the sky striking the horseman 

     for an instant horseman and horse are transformed skeletons of
     light entering the tree

     silence and smoke

     at the tree lady van tassels hand sticks out from the tightshut
     suture

     the sewn wound on her palm seeps blood as her fingers curl

     ext  new york city street ichabods home  day

     a coach pulls up to ichabods home  ichabod is the driver

     he gets off goes and opens the coach door  he helps katrina down
     next young masbath sticks his head out

     katrina holds young masbaths hand  ichabod comes to hold katrinas
     hand

     a stray cat watches them 

     young masbath looks entranced at the bustling metropolis

                             young masbath
               oh my

                             katrina
                     equally impressed
               and cobbled streets

                             ichabod

                but the ancient ones endure

     large snowflakes begin to fall upon the scene

     ichabod puts an arm around katrina and the other arm around masbath

     the cat is black with one white paw the cat from ichabods dreams 
     the cat turns to look at the trio

     ecu  the cats eyes are human intelligent kindly they are
     ichabods mothers eyes

     ichabod katrina and young masbath enter ichabods house as the snow
     continues to fall
