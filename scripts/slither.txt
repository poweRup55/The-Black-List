  she is a demure woman somewhat awkward in her speaking
  but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
  class
  
                      starla
            when darwin said fittest he
            didnt necessarily mean the
            strongest or the most intelligent
            or any one trait  he merely meant
            those organisms most wellsuited
            to their environment
  
  the boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks 
  kylie strutemyer a pretty student notices a boy beside
  her drawing starla only without her clothes she hits
  him he chuckles
  
                      starla
            we humans think were more fit
            more evolved because were smarter 
            but were neophytes weve been

  ammunition old hunters with faces like prunes stand
  outside angells tavern getting drunk a man with few
  teeth has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
  truck skinning the carcass its innards spilling loose

  sidewalk listening and staring in shock

  hunters on the sidewalk looking and pointing at something
  up in the sky

  large man is sitting on a desk the photo trembles

  the kitchen where a large doe is hopping around a
  dishwasher stands on the counter yelping with fear
  
  int diner kitchen  moments later

  toward it

  in a telephone cord
  
  the cord is plugged into the wall trapping the doe in
  place wally margaret and trevor attempt to dive for
  the cord but cant avoid the does crazy flying hooves

  the cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe
  breathing heavily becomes still bill scoops close past
  her and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall
  
  bill smiles then the doe runs forward almost knocking
  bill over and streaks out the back door
  
  bill wally margaret and trevor move up to the doorway
  and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond
  dragging the telephone tied to her leg

  a crowd of workers lounging around a glasscutting table
  laughing at something
  
  some of them nod at grant and he nods back but hes
  completely outside their circle

                      starla
            hes teaching environmental science
            grant probably wants to borrow

            days
  
  starla nods
  
  int grant master bathroom  later
  
  starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
  hair she uses long slow strokes as if stalling
  
                      grant os
            sugarplum you coming into bed
  
  starla turns toward the door she doesnt say anything
  for a moment
  
                      starla
            just a second
  
  starla sets her brush down on the counter she arranges
  it neatly beside the others and walks into the bedroom
  
  int grant bedroom  moments later
  
  grant turns off the tv as starla gets into bed with him 
  its almost completely dark in here
  
  grant crawls on top of starla he kisses her and grabs
  her in a way not meant to be rough but is utterly without
  grace
  
  after doing this for a few moments starla starts to push
  him off her
                      starla
            grant no  im sorry im just 
            im not in the mood
  grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy
                      grant

                      starla

                      grant

  through starlas nightgown grant pretends to flick one
  of her nipples
  
                      grant
            flip
  
            then the other
  
                      grant
            flip
  
                      starla
            thats disrespectful
  
  grant peeved gets off of her he sits on the edge of
  the bed for a moment in silence starla looks afraid
  
                      grant

            seems to me that moods as rare as
            winnin the goddamn lotto

  them on
  
                      starla
            where are you going

  gutierrez  staring at him from across the bar smoking
  a cigarette grant stares at her trying to figure out
  who she is she slides off her stool
  
  she sashays toward him she props herself on the stool

  grant finishes his drink and gets up to go
  
                      brenda

                      grant
            starla she gets real worried bout
            me i stay out too late loves me
            too much that one
  
  he glances around to see if people have heard and stumbles
  out
  
  ext shaded creek  later
  
  grant sits on a boulder beside a creek looking miserable
  downing a six pack
  
  he throws an empty can into the creek when he glances
  down and sees particles flowing down the river
  
  grant slides off the boulder he kneels and examines the
  particles they shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
  between the trees
  
  grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
  coming
  
  he sees a gap on the edge of the creek where water
  splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill
  
  he approaches the spot and comes upon a small crater on
  the side of the creek the meteorite is inside the crater
  but its cracked into pieces the rock seems almost
  organic like a shell the shimmery specks are part of
  the shell itself flecking off into the creek and rushing
  downstream
  
  grant crouches he touches the meteorite and feels some
  sort of goo inside it its sticky
  
  he notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
  crater itself and into the woods
  
  grant curiously slowly follows the slimy trail
  
  he comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers something
  is rustling the flowers ever so slightly he moves in
  closer
  
  a gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
  the flowers the organism is a mound a few inches high
  gross and veiny yet as colorful as the flowers around
  it a small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
  and expands lightly i guess its not worth keeping secret
  that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina
  
                      grant
            what the…
  
  grant is a little freakedout by this thing even
  frightened he looks around for someone else
  
                      grant
            hey anybody round here lo
  
  no one answers grant looks down at the organism unsure 
  he picks up a tree branch
  
  grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
  the branch
  
  nothing happens
  
  he does it again the thing pulses a little and surges
  toward grant
  
  grand pokes it again
  
  a small thin quill  a spore  emerges from the cavity
  in the center of the organism the spore is quivering
  and as it trembles upward little bulbed spurs pop up as
  well
  
  grant slowly bends down to look at it when 
  
  the spore suddenly shoots out it strikes grant in the
  stomach
  
                      grant
            ow fuck
  
  grant yanks up his shirt looking at a wound on his
  abdomen he watches as the spore quivers and disappears
  inside him
  
  he clutches his stomach screams in agony he falls back
  into the colorful flowers his body convulses
  
  match cut to
  
  cat scan shot  int grants body
  
  we see the insides of grants body as if sliced in half 
  we zoom in on the little spore which is jittering up
  through his body and into his neck
  
  the spore keys into the base of grants cerebellum and
  his entire brain crackles with a white electrical energy
  
  back to scene
  
  grant freezes in place his fingers contorted up in front
  of him silent hes utterly still a wax corpse
  
  a hippie camping couple run into the area looking for
  the source of the screams the man looks down at the
  frozen grant
  
                      camper
            over here
  
  the camper crouches down beside him
  
                      camper
            hey man you all right
            dude oh shit
  
  the camper turns from grant to his girlfriend
  
                      camper
            i think hes d 
  
  grant gasps suddenly sitting up and grabbing the man
  like a drowning man popping up above water the camper
  yelps and jumps back grant sweats and heaves trying to
  speak but hardly can 
  
                      grant
            its taking my brain
  
                      camper
            buddy
  
  grants eyes glaze over and he eases off he heaves
  there momentarily confused his eyes dart around as if
  seeing his surroundings for the first time grant stands
  
                      camper
            you all right man

  the wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous and is
  starting to puff up into a veiny little spout a fuzzy
  bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout

  bread and some cheese he starts putting the meat on 
  but he cant stop piling more and more on until he has 
  a little sandwich tower
  
  he looks at it something seems off about it he removes
  the cheese better and then the bread even better

  brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a
  veiny bluemossencrusted yellow spout huge and pulsing
  
                      brenda
            grant what  
  
  grant grabs her she tries to push his arms away
  
                      brenda
            no no we 
  
  brenda gets up trying to run away but grant grabs her
  necklace yanking her back the necklace snaps and falls
  into the creek beside them
  
  grant pins brendas wrists against the rock she struggles
  to get free
  
  brendas eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing
  tentaclelike tubule emerge from grants wound she
  screams
  
  grant shoves his hand over her mouth shutting her up 
  hes extremely strong she watches as the tubule twitches
  feeling its way like a blind snake
  
  the tubule comes to rest on her abdomen tears stream
  down from brendas eyes it pushes into her flesh
  
  brenda goes into convulsions something  a fluid 
  pumps through the tubule and into brenda
  
  grant watches brenda without emotion as her body spasms
  there beside him
  
  then she falls back unconscious the tubule retracts
  into grants torso
  
  ext wheelsy saddle lodge back porch  night
  
  starla is leaning over a wooden rail looking at the lights
  of the town below she turns to see bill lean on the
  rail beside her she looks genuinely happy
  
                      starla
            hey bill
  
  starla catches herself and looks around to see if grant
  is watching

            bluffs when the fog is just right

  starla nods she looks at bill and mouths
  
                      starla

  bill watches grant and starla head off as he downs the
  rest of his beer wally walks up beside him
  
                      wally
            surprised youre able to lift a
            mug after carrying that torch for

            hey wally glad youre here

                      bill

  they both laugh
  
  int grant bedroom  later
  
  starla lies on her side awake shes staring at the
  dirt on grants pants which are hung over a valet grant
  holds her from behind sleeping peacefully
  
  fade to
  
  int wheelsy police station  day
  
  the front door of the precinct opens and a confused
  mexican man walks inside he is trying to keep from
  crying three halfnaked children follow him clutching
  onto his clothes the man walks slowly through the office
  looking around for help
  
  margaret sees him from her desk
  
                      margaret
            sir may i help  
  
                      brendas husband

            has happened to her
  
  ext stop sign  day
  
  starla in her car with groceries comes to a stop sign 
  she looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
  its covered with flyers for missing pets
  
  int grant foyer  moments later
  
  starla enters with a shopping bag the lights are off 
  creepy music plays
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  no answer starla tries to turn on the lights but nothing 
  happens 
                      starla 
            damn fuse
  
  she passes the door to the garage noticing the lock
  
  int grant kitchen  moments later
  
  starla sets down the bags on the counter looks around
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  again no ones here she sees a potted flower on the
  counter a green inchworm is crawling up the stem little
  by little she stares at it as if its a portent
  
  she hears a moan coming from upstairs
  
  int grant bedroom  moments later
  
  starla moves slowly into this dark room looking for her
  husband it seems no one is here
  
                      starla
            grant where are y  
  
  starla turns when grant pops into frame starla
  startled screams grant is sick and trembling but
  worse hes been transforming there are small pustules
  all over his face
  
                      starla
            grant oh my god what happened

            i had a reaction to a bee sting 
            he gave me a prescription said i
            should be fine in a couple days
  
  starla stares at him mute and horrified
  
                      grant
            dont look at me like that baby 
            please im gonna go get my
            prescription filled
  
  grant grabs his keys off the dresser puts them in his
  pocket trying to pretend he doesnt hurt
  
                      starla
            ill get if for you
  
                      grant
            no no heh ill be right back
  
  he moves outside the door leaving starla shellshocked
  
  int grant garage  day
  
  its too dark to see much in here but we do see grant
  putting meat into a garbage bag
  
  ext grant house  day
  
  grant looks around to make sure no ones looking as he
  places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk closes
  it
  
  ext old barn  evening
  
  grant moves through the forest in massive pain dragging
  the garbage bag
  
  grant comes upon the old wooden barn
  
  int old barn  night
  
  grant enters it is almost completely dark he hears
  weeping chains rattle
  
  grant peers over at brenda mostly in silhouette sitting
  on the nest he has made shes chained up and moans
  through a mouth gag grant walks to her her body is
  horribly pearshaped and misshapen like some tumorous
  pregnancy grant pulls her gag away
  
                      brenda
            grant grant im hungry im so
            fuckin hungry i think im gonna
            die
  
                      grant
            brought you munchies
  
  grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
  animals out in front of her
  
                      grant
            been saving for a rainy day
  
  closeup brendas face still mostly in darkness she
  stares at the meat simultaneously excited and repulsed
  
  she looks up at grant
  
                      brenda
            grant im sorry if i did something
            wrong i think i gotta  i think
            i should go to a hospital
  
  grant doesnt respond brendas eyes trail back down to
  the meat
  
  brendas hand reaches out and grabs a maggotinfested
  pork chop pulling it toward her
  
  we hear but can barely see brenda chowing down on the
  raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn
  
  int grants truck  later
  
  grant gets into his pickup he trembles and yelps as his
  body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
  even more
  
  int grant foyer  night
  
  theres a hard knocking on starlas door she swings it
  open to see bill and wally standing there worried
  
  wally tries to see inside
  
                      wally
            grant around
  
                      starla
            no he went to the pharmacy
  
                      wally
            pharmacy
  
                      starla
            hes got a rash
  
  bill and wally exchange a glance  maybe this means
  something starla can see trevor and margaret across
  the street talking to another neighbor
  
                      bill
            starla you know brenda gutierrez
  
  starla shakes her head
  
                      bill
            maybe shes ever called the house
            or  
  
                      starla
            no what…
  
                      bill
            she disappeared friday night we
            got reason to believe foul play
            might be involved
  
                      wally
            some kids found her necklace near
            tipper creek as well as what might
            be her blood on a rock
  
                      bill
            the problem starla is the last
            person anyone saw her talking to
            was grant
  
  starla looks at him surprised
  
                      bill
            the deer cheer and wally and me
            we also saw him that night with
            mud all over his slacks
  
  bill hands her his card
  
                      bill
            have him call me right away okay
  
  starla nods distraught bill tries to smile kindly before
  he and wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors
  homes
  
  starla closes the door behind her distraught panicked
  
  she looks at the foyer door leading into the garage 
  her eyes fall down to the floor where she sees what
  appears to be blood drop stains near the door
  
  she gains courage and moves off toward 
  
  int grant closet  moments later
  
  starla throws open this door she looks at old unused
  sports equipment she grabs an aluminum baseball bat
  
  int grant foyer  moments later
  
  starla holds the aluminum bat standing in front of the
  door to the garage she hesitates a moment but then
  she swings the bat at the lock on the door
  
  she swings it again grunting
  
  and again
  
  finally the lock is knocked off the wooden door
  
  starla pushes away the useless lock letting it fall to
  the floor
  
  starla steels herself and slowly pushes open the door
  into the dark garage as she does the horrendous stench
  hits her terrified she covers her face with her hand
  and enters
  
  int grant garage  night
  
  starla sees whats there not only a huge stockpile of
  rotten meat but a dozen dead pets they are neatly
  divided into various categories and labeled pork ground
  beef cats dogs the walls and doorway have been heavily
  insulated so the smell doesnt sink into the home she
  looks on the floor and sees poor dead roscoe the beagle
  his tongue dangling out
  
  starla starts to cry
  
  she moves quickly back inside
  
  int grant living room  moments later
  
  starla runs to the front picture window and looks out
  onto the street she cant see any of the cops
  
  she turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone 
  she looks at the card bill gave her and dials the number 
  the phone rings and
  
                      sherry os
            youve reached chief pardy at the
            wheelsy police department please
            leave a message and your call will
            be returned as soon as possible
  
  theres a beep starla tries to speak through her sobs 
  pacing 
                      starla 
            bill its starla
  
  as starla passes the large picture window she doesnt
  see grant staring in at her his face now that of some
  diseased cephalopod
  
                      starla
            its  i think you better come
            over right away  i think grants
            sick he 
  
  starla turns to see the monstrous grant through the window
  she just stops they stare at each other for a moment
  and then grant lets out a furious wail
  starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house
  grant disappears from the window
  int grant foyer  night
  
  as starla runs through here she looks behind her at the
  front door to make sure grant isnt following
  
  int grant hall  night
  she runs past a wall of family photos
  
  int grant family room  night
  
  starla sees the door on the rear of the house leading to
  the backyard
  
  she arrives at it and flings it open 
  
  grant is there
  
  he lunges onto her starla screams and drops the cordless
  phone just as it starts ringing grant crawls on top of
  her body starla reaches for the ringing phone but he
  pins her hands above her head he looks into her eyes 
  hes crying his voice and breath are sick and raspy
  
                      grant
            whyd you betray me sugarplum
  
                      starla
            grant no
  
                      grant
            i loved you i loved 
  
                      starla
            grant youre sick
  
  grant is about to cry
  
                      grant
            i wanted you by my side but you 
            i cant trust you now
  
  starlas weeping confused grant rips his shirt open 
  starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
  
  now enormous yellow spore on grants chest the tubule
  feels over starlas blouse and then slips beneath it 
  it starts to poke into her skin
  
                      starla
            noooo
  
  starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her she
  slams the table into grants head this hurts and
  surprises him sufficiently to let starla get out from
  under him
  
  starla grabs the cordless phone which is no longer
  ringing and scurries behind the couch she dials 911
  
  grant thrusts the couch aside
  
  starla crawls away again when grant attacks her from
  behind he wraps his arm around her neck pulling her
  back he looks down at her with his sick angry eyes as
  his arm  now apparently jointless  curls around her
  like a snake
  
  starla gasps for air her face turns purple she hears
  a slamming on the door
  
                      bill os
            starla starla are you in
            there
  
  starla tries to speak but she cannot suddenly we hear
  the front door open
  
                      bill os
            starla
  
  starla with barely an ounce of life left in her sees
  bill wally trevor and margaret burst into the living
  room
  
  they are surprised to say the least to see this diseased
  humanoid strangling starla from behind
  
                      trevor
            fuck
  
  the cops freaked out pull their guns grant makes a
  screeching sound at them they shoot at grant nicking
  him
  
  grant jumps away from starla back into the shadows
  screeching in anger and pain starla falls to the floor
  
  grant slips out the back door and away
  
  the cops stare gapejawed and frozen with shock what
  the hell was that
  
  starla rubs her neck coughing
  
  bill pardy runs toward the back door
  
  ext grant home  night
  
  bill runs out into the backyard wally runs up behind
  him they look around at the trees surrounding the area 
  grant is nowhere to be seen
  
  we crane up and away from them as we
  
  fade to black

            amen amen
  
  bill looks around the church he spots starla in the
  very back of church head down distraught guilty
  
  he also sees a group of old crones nearby pointing at
  starla and whispering about her
  
  ext church parking lot  moments later
  starlas high heels clack on the pavement as she moves
  quickly to her car
  
                      bill os

            in three days

            see theres the blood musta slit
            its neck
  
  margaret walks backward showing the trail of blood in
  the crushed grass
  
                      margaret
            so he drags the cow backwards here 
            only he prolly didnt know bout

  weeds holding a dogs head in his hand
  
                      trevor
            he knocked thisns head clear
            over here

  bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them
  
                      margaret
            so the dogs attacked somehow he
            slew em all and he stole off
            with the cow into the forest
  
  trevor heads toward them bill looks off into the dark
  forest on the edge of the ranch

            hes gotta be in the forest all
            three ranches run alongside it

            shut up
  
  ext strutemyer ranch  moments later
  
  the posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle
  graze finding places to hide the sun sets behind them
  
  fade to
  
  ext strutemyer ranch  night
  
  darkness has crept over the ranch and the beautiful
  pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister
  
  the wind blows hard whistling through the long weeds
  
  a rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
  clinks on its halfbent perch
  
  a piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof flapping
  incessantly against the wooden wall
  
  trevor and jack the redneck and the good ol boy and
  margaret and the older cop are hidden around the ranch
  waiting watching or dozing
  
  int strutemyer barn  night
  
  inside the barn the wind is only slightly quieter and
  its darker bill starla and wally are here bill
  peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
  trough he looks at starla her head tilts to the side
  as she nods off when her head falls all the way she
  snaps back up and catches bill gazing at her
  
  bill nods and smiles she doesnt smile back shes
  embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
  wants to be
  
  they sit there for a moment in the dark
  
                      bill
            hey starla remember that time
            when you were a kid and you came
            knocking on my window in the middle
            of the night
  
  wally looks at them

            and she was gonna need a bodyguard 
            invited me along

  grudgingly enjoys the story
  
                      bill

  ext strutemyer ranch  night
  
  jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
  cow killer the burning ember of the cigarette is blown
  off by the wind jack searches for it in the dry grass
  trying to catch it before it starts a fire he crawls
  forward slapping the ground when he glances up and
  sees
  
  a large shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
  edge of the forest
  
  int strutemyer barn  night
  
  bill starla and wally see grant grant emerging from the
  forest he has transformed into something much more
  monstrous a giant gangrenous sluglike beast a clump
  of cells and tumorlike protuberances he has various
  tentaclelikearms growing out of him like overgrown
  eyes on a potato as opposed to just having the disease
  he now seems to be the disease itself
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  ext strutemyer ranch  night
  
  jack and trevor watch in amazement as grant slithers across
  the field his large dark watery eyes searching out
  prey jack turns to trevor pissed and whispers
  
                      jack
            you said squid
  
                      trevor
            it got worse
  
  the redneck and the good ol boy watch too mouths dropped
  
  the diseased grant slithers through the grass just a few
  feet beside margaret and the older cop they duck below
  the grass looking as if theyre going to have heart
  attacks
  
  grant approaches a cow the cow makes a little moo of
  protest when he gets too close and steps back
  
  the grantcreature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
  the cows neck piercing it the cow stumbles choking 
  blood spurts from her neck and she topples over
  
  int strutemyer barn  night
  
  bill and wally stare out the window motionless
  
                      wally
            what we gonna do now bill cuffs
            wont even fit on im
  
  starla musters courage she stands and moves out of the
  barn
  
                      bill
            starla where you…
  
  ext strutemyer ranch  night
  
  grant wraps a feeler around the cows horns and starts
  dragging it back in the direction of the forest
  
  int strutemyer barn  night
  
  bill motions through the barn window to margaret
  
  ext strutemyer ranch  night
  
  margaret motions to trevor
  
  trevor motions to the recruits
  
  and starla moves slowly in toward grant
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  grant turns and looks at her with his halfhuman eyes 
  his breathing is loud raspy and sick he sees in a
  wide circle around him the nervous posse standing up
  their guns at the ready
  
  starla moves even closer bill and wally are coming in
  close behind her
  
                      starla
            grant its okay
  
  as starla and the posse get closer grant looks almost
  scared his eyes dart around from cop to cop
  
                      starla
            youre just sick is all but well
            take you to get help right now 
            ill stay by your side grant
            just like i swore i would for
            better or worse remember
  
  grants huge milky eyes betray that he does
  
                      starla
            okay
  
  the posse inch in closer tightening the circle
  
  grant lets out a piercing screech of protest all of the
  posse stop terrified
  
  everything is quiet and still except for grants gross
  breathing deep in out
  
                      starla
            okay grant its gonna be all
            right
  
  grant screeches again a warning he looks from starla
  to bill with hurt jealous eyes and growls
  
  then grants eyes close to halfmast and he turns away 
  his tentacle tightens around the cows horns and he again
  drags it toward the forest
  
  while bill tries to decide what to do the good ol boy
  nervously blocks grants path he aims his pistol at
  him
  
                      good ol boy
            you stop right there you son of a
            bitch i dont care what kinda
            leprosy you got we need to find
            that girl now you can make this
            peaceful or you can make it hard
  
  pause grant and the good ol boy stare at each other
  
  and then grant snaps out a tentaclearm whipping it up
  the front of the mans body and back
  
  the front of the good ol boys whole body is split neatly
  in half for a split second he remains alive the two
  different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
  as his organs spill out from inside him and then he
  topples over
  
                      bill
            fire fire
  
  the posse shoot at grant starla covers her head
  
  grant is struck he screeches in pain he lets go of the
  cow he slithers with incredible speed off toward the
  forest
  
  bill and the other posse members take off after him like
  hounds on the heel of their prey they shoot madly
  
  starla watches as the posse follows grant into the woods
  
  starla stands alone and worried a moment and then she
  darts off after them
  
  int kylies bathroom  night
  
  kylie is running a bath she hears gunshots echo in the
  distance
  
  she peers out a little window above the tub trying to
  see where the shots are coming from
  
  ext forest  night
  
  the posse run through this very dark forest after grant
  leaping over brush and rocks theyre nervous but also
  excited as the primordial hunting urge takes over their
  eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust
  
  theyre able to follow grant only by catching glimpses 
  a flash of flesh between trees a tentacle disappearing
  around brush
  
                      wally
            there he is over there
  
  they fire at the creature taking chunks out of trees
  but missing hes too fast
  
  ext creek  night
  
  grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek
  and into the plentiful trees beyond he rustles thick
  fronds as he moves up alongside the creek
  
  the posse run up the creek itself splashing trying to
  peer through the leaves to get a shot at grant
  
  jack carrying his revolver trips and falls in the creek 
  he cuts his knee on a sharp rock he stands and keeps
  going
  
  they come to 
  
  ext forest clearing  night
  
  the posse come up out of the creek theyve completely
  lost track of the diseased manbeast
  
  they stop outofbreath and looking around they whisper
  
                      trevor
            whered he go
  
                      margaret
            we aint never gonna find that
            girl now
  
  the redneck is weeping with rage
  
                      redneck
            ill kill that asshole what he did
            to charlie
  
  bill sees starla run up behind them he waves her back
  
                      bill
            starla get the hell out of here
  
  starla takes a couple steps back but doesnt leave she
  watches there half in shadows as the posse creep around
  searching for some trail of grant
  
  margaret looks down into the bubbling creek she sees
  its turning red she looks up the trail of red which
  is rippling downhill in the water the red flow starts
  somewhere near a boulder
  
  bill and wally are searching in front of the boulder 
  margaret sees but they dont grant pulling himself up
  on a tree branch and rising behind them blood from a
  shotgun wound is dripping into the creek grant pissed
  lifts a tentacle
  
                      margaret
            bill
  
  bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him he
  falls back the tentacle slashes inches from his face
  
  bill blasts his shotgun up at grant but grant is already
  slithering swiftly back into the thick brush
  
  the posse squeeze themselves though the brush following
  
  ext old barn  night
  
  the posse emerge on the other side of the brush only to
  be confronted by a terrible odor they cover their noses
  and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust
  
                      trevor
            what the hells that smell
  
                      wally
            its something dead
  
  the posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where grant
  had brought brenda
  
                      jack
            its coming from in there aint
            it
  
  margaret looks at bill
  
                      margaret
            think hes inside
  
  bill takes the lead carefully approaching the barn
  
  the posse follows their weapons drawn the closer they
  get to the barn the more unbearable the smell becomes 
  only bill intent on the task in front of him doesnt
  react to the stench at all
  
  bill leans his ear in close to the front door and listens 
  through the door he can hear a quiet sobbing bill and
  wally exchange a look
  
  bill steps back he and wally aim their shotguns at the
  door bill nods to margaret and gestures for her to
  open it starla watches all this from the rear
  
  margaret swings open the door
  
  int old barn  night
  
  bill and wally move cautiously but quickly inside but
  they stop suddenly in disgust and horror
  
                      bill
            oh
  
  its brenda and she doesnt look good her weepy little
  head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb which is
  what her body has become this enormous ball of flesh is
  nine or ten feet tall vestigial fingers protrude from
  the sides she is utterly immobile her flesh sloshes
  slightly and constantly a thousand snakes seem to be
  slithering beneath her thin tight bruised skin the
  woman is in great pain she sobs her mouth and chin
  are stained with blood
  
  the posse and starla enter behind bill and wally and are
  equally astounded
  
                      older cop
            oh shit
  
  they see the source of the awful stench
  
  brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
  horses and forest critters they are mostly skeletal as
  they have been largely devoured theyre swarming with
  flies the stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
  with the bottom of their shirts
  
  the sobbing brenda looks desperately at bill and wally
  
                      brenda
            somethings wrong with me
  
                      wally
            uh yeah
  
  bill and wally get in a little closer
  
                      bill
            brenda um
  
                      brenda
            i didnt want no one to be seeing
            me like this
  
  as the posse inch closer brendas whole body suddenly
  lurches forward a bit  like whatevers inside her is
  trying to get out and to the posse brenda screams in
  agony
  
  the posse jump back they stare as she recomposes herself
  
                      brenda
            how are my boys bill are they 
            all right 
                      bill 
            boys are fine brenda uh whats 
  
            whats happening here exactly
  
                      brenda
            im so fucking hungry bill im
            so hungry i just never knew
            anybody could be so hungry
  
  brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her daddy
  into giving her candy this is creepy as hell
  
                      brenda
            would you mind handing me a piece
            of that possum there at your feet 
            little bit
  
  trevor gags and runs out of the barn
  
  ext old barn  night
  
  trevor vomits into some bushes
  
  int old barn  night
  
  bill eyes poor brenda
  
                      bill
            i think we best get you to a
            hospital right quick
  
                      wally
            what the fuck they gonna do with
            her in a hospital bill
  
  again brenda screams her body lurches forward
  
                      older cop
            whys she doing that
  
                      redneck
            her tumors is moving
  
                      jack
            bill get her to stop that shit
  
                      brenda
            it hurts
  
  her body lurches forward again she sobs
  
                      brenda
            help me help
  
  and then again starla notices that brendas skin is
  starting to split and tear on her side
  
                      starla
            bill
  
                      brenda
            little fuckers are tearing me
            aparrrr 
  
  brenda screams like a woman giving a thousand evil births
  at once and her body rips open in one part and then in
  quick succession another and another bill looks out
  one of the windows grant is peering in at them smiling
  
                      bill
            he led us here
  
  and then brendas body bursts open completely like a
  water balloon hitting cement and thousands of little
  slithering eyeless parasites with slippery blackred skin
  like slugs spill forth the horrid creatures eight inches
  long and a few inches thick swarm over the posse
  completely covering them before they can react
  
  ext old barn  night
  
  trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
  barn the parasites are especially drawn to the posses
  heads because there are so many the weight of the beasts
  knocks most of them down
  
  trevor runs but the things make it out the doorway
  covering him like lava in one million bc and he buckles
  
  int old barn  night
  
  a parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into wallys mouth 
  he gags on it his eyes flip back up into his head and
  his body starts to spasm
  
  jack tries to pull one away from his face but its too
  slippery and it disappears inside his mouth his body
  too convulses and he spits up blood
  
  bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
  the redneck and the older cop as well whites of their
  eyes bodies convulsing spewing blood bill sees the
  things oozing up margarets neck
  
                      bill
            margaret cover your mouth
  
  bill sees trevor outside the door in the dirt trying to
  slap the parasites off bill yells to everyone
  
                      bill
            dont let em in your mouths
  
  one starts to get in bills mouth as he speaks but he
  slaps it aside margaret pulls her shirt over her face
  
  starla shrieks she puts her hand over her mouth as the
  parasites rush up her shes knocked over and falls
  back onto the floor
  
  a parasite slithers between starlas lips  when
  suddenly a knife thrusts down pinning the creature to
  the dirt stopping it from oozing further into starla
  
  bill is holding the knife in one hand his other hand
  firmly over his mouth bill swats more incoming parasites
  away from starlas mouth he covers her mouth with his
  free hand he lies on top of her mushing their bodies
  and faces as closely together as possible so the things
  dont get into them the parasites swarm all over them
  flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
  their way inside their mouths but bill holds tight to
  himself and starla
  
  eventually the parasites give up on bill and starla and
  begin to slither away bill watches as they crawl off
  the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound
  
  eventually theyre gone bill takes his hand from
  starlas mouth starla looks around
  
  she sees margaret lift her face from the ground shivering
  holding her shirt over her mouth they gaze out the front
  door of the barn
  
  ext old barn  night
  
  trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands he spits
  violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist
  
                      trevor
            they wanted us to eat em why
            would they want that
  
  int old barn  night
  
  bill is trying to make sense of it all he gazes down at
  brendas body her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
  spread out over the floor split open like an enormous
  bloody tiger rug
  
  he looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
  positions their mouths and lips covered in blood still
  lightly convulsing
  
  he gazes out into the forest to see the parasites rushing
  away like an ugly wormy army shaking the brush as they
  head off in different directions
  
  cut to
  
  ext strutemyers ranch  night
  
  parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
  the ranch the strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby
  
  int kylies bathroom  night
  
  kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath her head is back
  her eyes shut shes enjoying the warm water the tub
  faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm
  
  ext strutemyers farmhouse  night
  
  the parasites squirm up the side of the house sticking
  to the wood siding
  
  int kylies bathroom  night
  
  kylie glances out the window beside the tub at the starry
  sky and crescent moon beautiful and still
  
  theres a knock on the bathroom door kylie turns toward
  the door  as she does a parasite crawls across the
  window behind her streaking a moist slimy trail
  
                      kylies mom
            kylie youre gonna turn into a
            plum in there

  int strutemyers hallway  night
  
  kylies mom is at the bathroom door

  os kylie grunts in vague agreement
  kylies mom trots down the hall to another door
  she knocks once then opens the door to 
  int strutemyer girls bedroom  night
  
  kylies younger sisters lie in single beds reading
  
  goosebumps by bedlamps clipped to the headboards
  
                      kylies mom
            time to turn in ladies

  the girls sigh in lazy protest but still turn off their
  reading lamps
  
                      kylies mom

  through the window we see kylies mom start to close the
  door
  
                      kylies mom
            sleep tight dont let the bed
            bugs bite
  
  numerous parasites slither into frame up the side of the
  house approaching the girls bedroom window which is
  open a few inches for air
  
  int strutemyer girls bedroom  night
  
  kylies mom shuts their door completely the girls turn
  on their sides and close their eyes to sleep
  
  and the parasites pour in through the cracked window 
  they slither over the walls their slimy blackred bodies
  contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper
  
  int kylies bathroom  night
  
  the door cracks open and a parasite enters it slithers
  silently over the linoleum tiles
  
  it arrives at the base of the tub and crawls up the side
  
  kylie continues relaxing her eyes closed she doesnt
  see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet
  
  kylie hears a soft splashing and peers down she spots
  the creature swimming toward her between her knees
  
  kylie shrieks and scrambles up to get out of the tub as
  she clamors out she slips and falls to the floor
  
  the parasite squirms up kylies wet naked back kylie
  shrieks again jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
  off
  
                      kylie
            mom
  
  the parasite winds toward her lips kylie goes to grab
  it with both hands but it slips through them the thing
  slides into kylies mouth as she looks down at it
  
  kylie snatches the very end of the parasites tail her
  long teddybearspotted fingernails pinch it there
  digging into the parasites flesh barely stopping it
  from sliding completely into her mouth it wildly flaps
  its tail like a docked trout desperate to enter her
  
  kylie falls to her knees her eyes roll back in her head
  and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
  very tip of the parasites tail
  
  we track in to a closeup of kylies face a slight white
  electricaltelepathic charge can be seen sparking inside
  her mouth
  
   flash to
  
  kylies vision
  
  we are rushing through some amoebic landscape past
  microbes and cytoplasm and cells and to
  
  kylies vision  series of images  creatures pov
  
  perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth its
  eyesight is not like our own its in grainy black and
  white and amber outlines various images flash in quick
  succession including the following
  
  we are on top of an alien animal pinning it down it
  howls beneath us as we tear into its flesh feasting
  
  all around us diseased monstrous beasts feed on more
  alien animals they lunge toward them and pin them down
  ripping them apart like some national geographic
  documentary shot in hell
  
  in fast motion unfamiliar plant life around us grows
  sick and withers dying out
  
  a group of diseased monstrous beasts cry out in uniform
  pain they buckle to their knees now theyre dying
  
  the diseased beasts feed on their own appendages
  
  back to scene
  
  kylie tries to regain control of her mind her eyes fight
  against flipping back in her head tears pour down her
  face she pulls the parasite out just a bit
  
  but then it slams back into her and there are more sparks
  inside her mouth 
  
  kylies vision  series of images  mangled insect pov
  
  we are climbing up through a creamy gelatinous yellow
  an opening slit widens in front of us and we see grant
  slowly bending to look at us the forest behind him
  
  kylies vision  series of images  grants pov
  we watch starla soaping herself in the shower
  we make love to starla our hands on her face
  we sit over a convulsing brenda impregnating her with
  
            our tubule
  we see the posse members coming in toward us
  
  back to scene
  
  with a last desperate effort kylie yanks at the exhausted
  worm pulling it fully from her mouth it flaps in her
  fingers kylie spits up blood
  
  kylie tosses the parasite away from her though slightly
  crippled the little bastard writhes back toward her
  
  kylie spots her curling iron on the counter its plugged
  in the red light is on she grabs it and swings it
  into the wormy thing
  
  the parasite squeaks and trembles with pain smoke rises
  from it as kylie digs the curling iron in deeper burning
  it and finally killing it
  
  kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it 
  the dead parasite is stuck to it dangling from the metal
  
                      kylie
            mom
  
  kylie drops the iron she quickly steps into her clothes
  lying on the floor she runs out of the bathroom and
  into 
  
  int strutemyers hallway  night
  
  kylie runs to the stairway
                      kylie
            mom mom
  
  kylie stops dozens of the things are slithering up the
  stairs and up the handrail towards her
  
  os kylie hears her sisters screams she looks in their
  direction running toward their room
                      kylie
            emily jenna
  
  kylie tosses open her sisters door
  
  int strutemyer girls bedroom  night
  
  kylies youngest sister is on her knees on the bed a
  parasite sticking out of her mouth her eyes are rolled
  back her arms flail spastically the slithering beast
  wags its tail as it disappears down her throat
  
  kylies other sister is backing into a corner with
  parasites crawling up her body shes screaming bloody
  hell trying to slap them off
  
  kylie runs toward her to help kylie slaps the parasites
  off her sister but theres too many and theyre too
  fast they slide into her sisters mouth
  
                      kylie
            no nooo
  
  her sisters eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
  disappears completely and she starts spitting up blood
  
  kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her 
  theres a clear path toward a window kylie runs to the
  window and shoves it open as the things approach her
  she crawls out 
  
  ext strutemyers farmhouse awning  night
  
  kylie steps onto this shingled angled canopy over the
  front porch she turns to see the parasites slithering
  out towards her she looks down its probably too far
  to jump but she has no choice
  
  so she jumps down onto 
  
  ext strutemyers front lawn  night
  
  kylie lands hard tumbling over
  
  she glances back at the front of the house
  
  through the kitchen window she sees her mom and dad eyes
  rolled back convulsing spitting up blood
  
  more parasites are crawling towards kylie through the
  grass
  
  she spots her familys old luv pickup truck on the driveway
  in front of her she breaks for it
  
  she throws open the front door and jumps inside
  
  the things approach crawling in after her kylie tries
  to slam the door shut but it wont many things are stuck
  in the door jamb
  
  they squeak in a chorus of pain trying to wriggle toward
  her
  
  so she slams the door again and again and she slices
  the little bastards in half
  
  int pickup truck  night
  
  kylie makes sure none are inside
  she feels for the keys in the ignition there arent
            any
  
  the creatures crawl up and over all the pickups windows
  trying to get in slithery shadows cover over kylie
  leaving her in almost complete darkness
  kylie crouches down in on herself and wails
  
  int old barn  night
  
  starla trevor and margaret stand wideeyed and shaken 
  all three seem to be in some mild state of shock
  
  bill suppressing his desperation is trying to make
  contact on his police radio

  starla sees wallys body on the floor his skin is white
  and corpselike his mouth is streaked with blood starla
  crouches beside him and takes his pulse her hands are
  visibly shaking

  starla looks at margaret and nods

  bill nods makes a feeble attempt at a smile he jogs
  off into the forest
  
  ext forest clearing  moments later
  
  bill runs into the small glade and looks around trying
  to remember which way he came from
  
  he gazes between some greenery some distance away and
  spies a longlashed deer munching on foliage a couple
  more deer and a fawn are eating as well bill looks at
  them a moment peaceful perhaps a sign of some hope
  
  and then a parasite crawls up the deers neck and slithers
  into its mouth parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
  of the deer behind it the deer buck and flounce and
  scratch trying to get the things off of them
  
  bill runs away as fast as he can

  wallys lips then she stands and heads toward the creek
  
  she doesnt see wally open his eyes behind her he sits
  up and stares over at starla with milky eyes as she kneels
  down beside the water
  
  starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek re
  wetting it

  of her standing between trees almost completely covered
  in darkness

  parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone
  
                      margaret

  jack opens his mouth and gleeks too  shooting the stream
  glob forward and onto her neck margaret screams again
  grabbing onto her neck
  
  margaret tries to speak but she struggles just to breathe
  as her neck puffs up impeding her thorax

            meat
  
  the older cop buries his fingers into her neck the puffy
  flesh comes off easily its soft almost creamy he
  stuffs the flesh into his mouth eating it
  
  as margaret topples over dying the other posse members
  turn to look at a very freakedout trevor the redneck
  opens his mouth at him when

  starla blasts wally blowing open a big crater into his
  face
  
  wally falls to his knees starla and trevor look on in
  shock as they see
  
  a slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
  face  out of the wallys brain
  
  the little thing squirms down wallys body and slithers
  off quickly into the woods wally falls over dead
  
  the sick posse look at starla surprised infuriated
  
  and then they leap at her
  
  starla tries to shoot them but shes out of ammo
  
  she and trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their
  legs can take them
  
  ext treethick forest  night
  
  trevor and starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees
  rooted closely together panicked breathing heavy

  in he turns to see the two little girls closing in
  
  one opens her mouth and gleeks  it shoots out and lands
  on the car right beside bills hand
  
  the other little girl opens her mouth to gleek as bill
  jumps into the drivers seat he slams the door shut
  just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
  him
  
  bill is grossedout by this but he doesnt have much
  time he goes to reload his shotgun when he remembers
  
                      bill

  bill jams the car forward knocking the sisters off the
  hood then he slams on the brakes
  
  he looks back and sees the two little girls running toward
  the car again
  
  and he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also
  running toward the car kylie is screaming and crying
  
                      kylie
            go go please
  
  but instead of pulling forward on the gravel road bill
  turns up and onto the ranch itself  back towards the
  running diseased
  
                      bill
            my friends are still in the forest
  
  bill speeds the police car over the dirt field trying to
  avoid approaching ranchers some leap at the car holding
  on and getting tossed aside bill zooms back toward the
  trees
  
  just as bill gets a little headway on the diseased the
  car gets stuck in some mud the wheels spin spraying
  mud as the infected approach
  
  int treethick forest  night
  
  starla looks back to see jack right behind her
  
  ext strutemyers ranch  night
  
  the infected arrive at the car bill just lets his foot
  off the gas and sits there letting the ranchers leap
  onto the car kylie looks at bill panicked by his choice
  to do nothing
  
                      bill
            we need their weight
  
  bill slams down the gas again and the car zooms forward 
  the diseased get knocked off

            dumbshits
  
  bill rushes toward the trees of the forest
  
  int forest  night
  
  starla keeps running when she trips and falls she looks
  down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing
  now long fallen and curling on the forest floor starla
  forces herself up as jack closes in
  
  jack grabs onto her blouse screeching furiously when
  he hears something and looks over to see
  
  bills police car cruising over the forest floor directly
  toward him jack frightened lets go of starla hes
  about to get hit when 
  
  the police car suddenly stops jammed between two trees
  inches from jack
  
  jack smiles and moves toward bill  but starla rises
  behind him holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed
  wire fence 
  
  she thrusts it forward hard and it pops out the front
  of jacks neck
  
  jack turns to look at starla and topples over into the
  leaves
  
  bill backs the car out from between the trees he sees
  the older cop and redneck coming in toward them

  the car slows and comes to a stop
  
  ext road toward wheelsy  moments later
  
  bill starla kylie and trevor step slowly out of the
  car they look around the deserted road
  
  the wideopen night is shrouded in darkness quiet 
  they can see the lights of wheelsy down the road in front
  of them
  
  bill speaks into the radio again as he gets his leather
  satchel of weaponry out of the trunk trevor grabs ammo
  from the satchel to reload his pistol
  
                      bill

  and bill are in the lead
  
                      bill

            day i knew it was just to see

            handsome and he had that big ol

  starla looks at bill who seems struck
  
                      bill
            when you wanted to run away i
            called your dad

                      starla
            anyway grant rolls in one day i
            fill his tank with like an eighth
            agallon as usual and he notices
            my lips all swollen up and starts
            asking me how it happened i dont
            know why i chose then why grant 
            i guess i saw an opportunity and
            i told him everything first time

            straightaway into the garage and
            beat my father half to death you

            but that was the closest thing to

                      starla
            grant asked me to marry him a few
            weeks later i felt safe with

  ext wheelsy city limit  night
  
  a slithering parasite squirms over a paintchipped sign
  that reads welcome to wheelsy south carolina the wheels
  of the future featuring earlysixties graphics of a
  utopian future
  
  the camera moves down to the road where hundreds of
  slithering parasites squirm into the city they divide
  off in thin lines heading toward the various homes
  
  we move up to a window on a small house through which we
  can see an overweight woman in spasms with a slithering
  thing in her mouth
  
  we pan to the window of the home next door where we can
  see a family gathered around a corpse feasting on his
  goopy flesh
  
  ext road toward wheelsy  night
  
                      starla
            whats that
  
  our foursome look up to see a buick century parked at a
  haphazard angle in the middle of the road the drivers
  side door is open the headlights are still on
  
  they look at each other bill takes his flashlight off
  his belt and aims it in front of him they all slowly
  approach the car in the darkness
  
  bill aims his flashlight into the buick the keys are
  still there but no ones inside
  
  trevor looks at the grill of the car its dented
  
                      trevor
            they musta hit a deer probably
            got out to see if its okay
  
  bill and the others look around
  
  bill hears a lapping sound behind him he turns aiming
  the flashlight downward
  
  a diseased deer is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
  wound of a dead man the sick creature is mostly hairless
  and pink and covered in veins bulbous black eyes hang
  on the sides of its head like a goldfishs
  
  the diseased deer glances up at bill and growls a low
  growl
  
                      bill
            fuck me
  
  the deer springs upward bringing his hoofs into bills
  chest bill is knocked violently to the gravel dropping
  his shotgun and satchel the deer rears back and brings
  his hoofs down into bill again they crack bills head
  against the hard road
  
  kylie trevor and starla see diseased deer coming in at
  them from different directions the deer screech like
  dying rabbits
  
                      trevor
            bambirats
  
  trevor aims his pistol at a deer jumping toward him he
  shoots misses the deer knocks him down the deer stomps
  his feet rearing up and down on trevors ribs almost
  like a little dance the deer tears at trevors sleeve
  with decidedly carnivorous teeth forcing him into letting
  go of his gun
  
  kylie screams she dives into a small space beneath a
  rock overhang on the side of the road she watches whats
  going on from there
  
  starla sees the buick a few yards away she glances beside
  her to see the largest diseased deer of all a horned
  buck careening toward her
  
  she dashes toward the buick as fast as she can
  
  a tumorous doe leaps onto bill biting into his shoulder
  and tearing at his flesh so now he has two deer on him 
  bill is bleeding dizzy and disoriented but hes able
  to turn just a bit to see the barrel of his shotgun
  above him he tries to scoot himself back as hes being
  battered he reaches up for the shotgun but the tips of
  his fingers barely graze the muzzle
  
  starla arrives at the buick and starts to crawl into the
  front seat
  
  but the horned buck is upon her he bites into starlas
  ankle she screams
  
  he yanks back on her half pulling her onto the road 
  but starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
  might and pulls against the horned bucks massive power
  
  the deer on trevor starts pulling him off dragging him
  down the road as he hollers
  
  kylie underneath the rock overhang watches bill try to
  scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun its just
  a little too far away she works up her nerve and slowly
  starts to crawl out toward him
  
  as starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
  her ankle and her hand on the steering wheel shes able
  to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition
  the engine starts she reaches one hand down to the
  floorboard pressing on the gas
  
  the buick lurches forward wrenching her away from the
  horned bucks mouth
  
  bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle its too
  far away but then he sees kylie at the butt of the
  rifle she reaches out and pushes it just a little into
  bills hand bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat
  and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him
  knocking the beast back
  
  the deer tries to stumble forward again but its whole
  head and neck have been knocked askew it topples over
  dead
  
  bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands he stuffs
  the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg 
  the deer looks at him blood is running down bills face
  and he looks halfcrazed bill glances down and sees the
  telephone wire wrapped around her ankle
  
  bill pulls the trigger destroying her
  
  he stands looking around for the deer with trevor it
  has dragged him a fair distance down the street bill
  shoots once missing it and again hitting it straight
  on
  
  kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
  through the fields toward them
  
  starla pulls herself into the drivers seat and backs up
  
  alongside her friends throws open the passenger door 
                      starla 
            get in 
  
  int buick century  moments later
  
  bill fumbles for the radio controls
  
                      bill
            shelby
  
  trevor looks out the window watching the deer fade away
  behind them
  
                      trevor
            when i buy my zoo im leaving
            them things the hell out

  ext main street  night
  
  shelby sick and bloated speaks into his radio as he
  moves down the street with a hoard of the infected
  
                      shelby
            already on our way
  
  back to buick
  
  kylie turns her head and glances out the window and
  screams starla bill and trevor turn to see 
  
  an suv barreling straight towards them
  
  it slams hard into the side of the buick
  
  and smashes the car back across a short lot and through
  the glass storefront of a flower store
  
  int flower store  night
  
  the buick and suv are destroyed amidst the ruins of this
  store shattered vases and flowers surround them glass
  fragments dangle from the window frame some fall and
  clink to the floor
  
  starla lifts her battered head from the wheel she looks
  beside her to see bill and trevor seemingly unconscious
  
  she looks back at kylie the impact has killed her her
  neck is bent at an ungodly angle bone juts up out of
  her skin
  
  starla looks out her rear window and sees the suv door
  open and the diseased driver stumble out his body is
  battered and broken but still he lumbers toward her 
  he tries to speak but his jaw is broken and only a mumbly
  moan comes out
  
  starla struggles to get out of the car eventually she
  does and she falls to the floor amidst the broken glass
  from the shattered window and the water all over the
  floor from the broken vases
  
  she sees the moaning driver limping toward her hes
  still trying to speak but hes unintelligible
  
  the driver gets close ready to grab her starla sees a
  metal bar she grabs it and slams it into the diseased
  mans shin
  
  he topples over
  
  she crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
  bar down into his head again and again shouting and
  crying with fury
  
  starla looks down at the man who is very dead 
  
  starla looks up to see dozens of diseased townsfolk coming
  at her from down the street between buildings they
  see starla there
  
                      diseased townsfolk
            starrrrrlaaaaaa
  
  bill and trevor limp up behind starla pulling her toward
  a door on the back wall
  
                      bill
            come on
  
  int flower store storage area  moments later
  
  bill closes and locks the door behind them
  
  ext flower store  night
  
  the diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all
  sides they screech
  
  int flower store storage area  night
  
                      trevor
            what the hell are we going to do
  
                      bill
            just block the doors any way you
            can
  
  bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench
  
  trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
  shelving
  
  starla looks doubtful of this whole activity but still
  she helps
  
  the storeroom has two doors they start nailing anything
  over them they can
  
  trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
  crack in the upper corner of the room
  
                      trevor
            goddamn snakes
  
  trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
  wildly at them blasting up the whole room
  
  bill and starla see slithering parasites coming in from
  other cracks in the room as well they also blast at
  them dust is all around they can hardly see
  
  bill runs out of ammo he grabs a handheld black and
  decker electric circular saw and turns it on he starts
  jamming it into the parasites cutting them up and putting
  big slices in the floor they squeak with pain
  
  ext flower store  night
  
  the diseased townsfolk wail and slap their hands on the
  walls almost rhythmically like some tribal ritual 
  some push on the doors
  
  int flower store storage area  night
  
  bill hears something pop behind him he turns to see a
  little hole in one of the doors three diseased fingers
  slip inside trying to pull away more
  
  bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers
  
  an arm pops through the door bill slams the circular
  saw into that blood spurts bone grinds
  
  a mans eye peeks through another crack bill jams the
  circular saw through the crack and into the mans face
  
  ext flower store  night
  
  the facesawed man backs away from the hole clutching
  his bleeding eye
  
  int flower store storage area  night
  
  bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
  across from him he runs over to the space when the
  circular saw stops turning bill turns to see hes
  accidentally unplugged it
  
  ext flower store  night
  
  the diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
  the building now putting all their efforts into tearing
  down one door some have even climbed onto the roof above
  it curling off the gutter and roofing overhead
  
  int flower store storage area  night
  
  bill grabs his leather satchel and starts to reload his
  shotgun starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
  almost torn down one of the doors
  
                      starla
            this is stupid
  
  starla goes to the other door and starts tearing away
  the planks they nailed there
  
                      bill
            what are you doing
  
                      starla
            we cant make it just get away
            when you get the chance
  
                      bill
            what
  
                      starla
            he wants me bill im going to
            get him to take me to him see if
            you can follow me and kill him
  
                      bill
            no starla no
  
  another full metal plate is pushed off the door 
  a diseased mans face peeks through trevor swirls to see
  it the man gleeks hitting trevor on his chest trevor
  looks down in shock
  
  and the whole door and part of the wall bursts open the
  diseased pour inside and around trevor gleeking all over
  him splattering his body with the burning liquid trevor
  starts to puff up swelling becoming soft they grab
  him
  
                      bill
            nooo
  
  bill grabs trevor by the wrist and tries to pull him
  away from them but trevor screams in agony the liquid
  has made his flesh too soft his entire body splits apart
  like wet tissue his organs spilling out in front of them
  
  bill stares down in shock still holding trevors arm
  
  starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door 
  she throws it open none of the diseased are on this
  side of the building anymore she moves outside
  
  ext flower store  night
  
  bill follows her two diseased people appear screeching
  and running toward them bill shoots them both and he
  makes a break for it running as fast as he can across
  the street
  
  he turns expecting to see starla right behind him but
  she has stayed behind staring quietly at the ground 
  starla has tears in her eyes she motions with her head
  for bill to go bill is confused
  
  the diseased townsfolk come up around starla from the
  sides of the flower store no one paying attention to
  bill they encircle her slowly some screech angrily
  at her shes too disgusted or fearful to even look in
  their eyes they breathe with sick raspy breath
  
        diseased woman                diseased kid
starlaaaaaaa                 starlaaaa
  
  and they wail in a cacophony of simultaneous voices all
  the deep angers fears frustrations and jealousies they
  inherited from grant grant such as

  calf tasting her
  
                      starla
            we need to talk
  
  a diseased man grabs the side of her neck and face

  the diseased townsfolk grab starla enveloping her and
  start dragging her away
  
  a few townsfolk remain behind they look around for bill
  
                      smashedface man
            pardy where are you pardy
  
  but hes nowhere to be seen they screech angrily
  
  ext main street  night
  
  bill runs as fast as he can across the street here  the
  same direction the hoard took starla but down a block
  
  ext side of movie theater  night
  
  bill falls against the side of this building hiding in a
  dark crevice down the way he can see numerous dead
  bodies and a woman chased down and tackled by some
  infected townsfolk
  
  some diseased townsfolk wander by bill looking for him 
  bill crouches down so he isnt seen
  
        diseased woman                shelby
pardy pardy pardy          come on out pardy
  
                      pastor

  bill waits for them to pass when theyre gone bill
  looks up toward the next street  he can see the hoard
  moving starla across that street
  
  he makes sure no ones looking and follows her
  
  ext grant street  later
  
  one of the diseased pushes starla too hard and she falls
  to her hands and knees they keep pushing her she
  stumbles back to her feet and moves on shes almost
  hyperventilating
  
  ext grant home  moments later
  
  here the diseased townsfolk around starla stop she
  looks up to see that theyve led her onto her own front
  yard starla gazes up at her home
  
  the diseased have done a little remodeling part of the
  front wall has been torn away replaced with some primitive
  thatched woodwork the front doorway has also been
  partially destroyed because of the sloppy reconstruction
  the roof is cavedin and sloping
  
  diseased people sit in meerkatlike poses on all sides of
  the grants home watching out for trouble
  
  ext house across from the grant home  night
  
  bill out of breath arrives across the street he can
  see starla standing with the diseased he hides behind
  some shrubs
  
  ext grant home  night
  
  the diseased push starla up between them violently to
  the front door
  
  starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house 
  its pitch black inside she looks back at the rotting
  faces behind her and then slowly enters
  
  int grant foyer  night
  
  starla balks at the smell she looks beside her at the
  garage the wall has been torn out and this has become
  grants feeding area with rotten meat including some
  bodies in a pile
  
  starla steps slowly forward looking around
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here
  
  ext house across from the grant home  night
  
  bill looks at the diseased surrounding the grant home 
  they seem impossible to get through
  
  bill eyes the house next door maybe twentyfive feet
  from the grants he makes sure no ones paying attention
  for a moment and he darts across the street to a parked
  car the diseased dont see him bill gazes down the
  street beside him
  
  the sun is just barely beginning to rise they dont
  have much time to move in the darkness
  
  bill makes a break for the house next door
  
  int grant kitchen  night
  
  starla walks into the kitchen cooking supplies and
  condiments are scattered over the floor she spots a
  meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils
  
  she glances out the rear window diseased people are
  guarding the backyard looking away from the home
  
  she grabs the meat thermometer she snaps the thermometer
  part off the top discards it and shoves the long metal
  spike into the seam of her skirt
  
  suddenly starla hears every woman in the world the song
  she and grant danced to earlier starting to play through
  tinny speakers
  
  starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling she
  can see a tiny piece of grant in the bedroom above her
  
                      starla
            grant we should talk
  
  ext neighbors backyard  night
  
  bill has made his way into the backyard he looks over
  at the grant home some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
  could conceivably see or hear him he tries the back
  door but its locked
  
  bill notices a window slightly open he starts to push
  it up it squeaks loudly
  
  he peers over at the diseased they dont hear he throws
  the window up further and crawls inside the home
  
  int grant foyer  night
  
  starla stands at the base of the stairwell the song is
  louder
  
                      starla
            grant
  
  she starts to ascend the stairs they creak beneath her
  feet
  
  int neighbors house  night
  
  bill peeks out the window careful not to be seen by the
  diseased humans around grants bill can see starla in
  the home next door walking up the stairs
  
  bill runs toward the stairwell here
  
  int grant upstairs hallway  night
  
  starla looks down the hall most of the walls have been
  torn away
  
  between wooden beams starla can see grants cumbersome
  mass his back to her in what was once the bedroom
  
  in front of him the song ends on the cd player it starts
  into the next song on the album grant uses one of his
  crusty tentacles to push the back button
  
  every woman in the world starts over
  
  starla walks toward him
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  grant keeps his back to her starla takes in the room 
  photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls
  photos from their wedding and vacations and family
  parties
  
                      starla
            hey grant
  
  starla walks around grant giving him a decent berth
  
                      starla
            you did some real interesting
            decorating here
  
  grant watches her from the corner of his sad purulent
  eye
  
                      starla
            hey
  
  starla walks by a window
  
                      starla
            look the suns starting to come
            up
  
  starla starts to open the drapes
  
  int neighbors upstairs hall  night
  
  bill happens to look through the neighbors kids bedroom
  and to the home across the way where starla is pulling
  the drapes away from the window she sees bill there
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  grant screeches angrily at starla she quickly closes
  the drapes not letting on she saw bill
  
                      starla
            sorry i didnt  i didnt know
            you wanted it dark
  
  int kids bedroom  night
  
  bill walks into this young boys bedroom filled with
  airplanes and sports memorabilia
  
  he peeks around the window frame at the grant bedroom
  window now closed to him he makes sure his shotgun is
  loaded
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
  with the photos
  
                      starla
            you like these memories huh grant
  
  grant looks away from her starla moves toward him almost
  seductively
  
                      starla
            you like being called grant dont
            you
  
  grant is silent she gets closer
  
                      starla

            you like being grant like when
            we danced and when you made
            love to me here on the bed 
            remember that
  
  grant looks embarrassed starla becomes more brazen
  
                      starla
            i know youve been alone grant 
            almost forever from here to there
            to there to here theres never
            been another one for you
  
  starla almost looks as if shes about to cry out of
  compassion for him
  
                      starla
            grant grant i could help you 
            be with you the way you want

  she touches his tentacle with her fingers he moves it
  back and growls a little
  
  starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again she
  sets them on his tentacle once more he glares at her
  distrustfully breathing his deep sick breath
  
                      starla
            you dont trust me i know thats
            why i brought you someone grant
  
  starla looks into his eyes
  
                      starla
            its bill hes in the house next
            door just look
  
  int kids bedroom  night
  
  bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
  him in fact theyre all looking up at him bill is
  confused
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  grant looks at starla with sad eyes perhaps touched 
  starla smiles nervously expectantly
  
                      starla
            see i brought him here for you 
            as an offering to prove i love
            you more than him
  
  grant wraps his tentacle around starla starla though
  obviously disgusted touches his face with her hand
  
  int neighbors house  night
  
  the diseased townsfolk break down the door moving into
  the downstairs below bill
  
  int kids bedroom  night
  
  bill hears them approaching he shatters the window and
  crawls onto a small mockbalcony outside
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  starla moves slowly in toward grant as if to kiss him 
  grant looks well joyful
  
  and then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
  jabs it into grants eye
  
  grant screeches blind and bucking starla slams the
  spike into his other eye
  
  and she stabs him again shoving the spike into his
  forehead where it stays
  
  starla leaps to the window she throws open the drapes
  
                      starla
            now bill kill the motherfucker
  
  ext neighbors mock balcony  night
  
  bill raises his shotgun and blasts as starla jumps away
  from the window
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  the window shatters and the shot strikes grant he
  screeches swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the
  room in fury
  
  one tentacle slams starla against the wall probably
  breaking a rib or two another tentacle smashes the cd
  player squelching the song
  
  ext neighbors mock balcony  night
  
  the diseased townsfolk enter the kids bedroom rushing
  toward bill on the balcony but bill wont stop he
  blasts the shotgun again
  
  int grant bedroom  night
  
  grant is struck in the head he starts slithering out of
  the bedroom feeling his way out
  
  ext neighbors mock balcony  night
  
  bill is out of shells he drops his shotgun he grabs
  the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag
  
  int grant bathroom  night
  
  starla clutching her ribs and barely able to move pulls
  herself up on the window
  
  bill tosses her the grenade she tries to catch it but
  misses it it lands on the carpet she see grants
  tentacles slipping away she tries to move but shes
  hurt bad bleeding
  
  ext neighbors mock balcony  night
  
  the diseased gleek at bill but bill throws himself
  forward letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade 
  
  ext grant home  night
  
  bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes he
  grabs a 38 and stands beside the window on grants house
  through the window he sees grant barreling down the stairs
  bill shoots grant with the 38 shattering the glass
  he unloads the clip into him
  the diseased townsfolk surround bill grabbing him grant
  
  using the others eyes to see snaps his tentacle forward
  wrapping it around bills neck raising him up grant
  screeches
  
  int grant foyer  night
  
  starla appears at the top of the stairs clutching her
  bloody side she has the pin in one hand and the grenade
  in the other
  
  with all her remaining effort she lobs the grenade behind
  grant
  
                      grant
            er…
  
  it explodes
  
  ext grant home  night
  grants exploding flesh sends bill flying backwards
  
  int grant hallway  night
  starla is thrown back
  
  ext grant home  night
  around the house the diseaseds eyes gaze lifelessly
  upward as they each plummet to the grass
  fade to
  
  ext grant home  morning
  
  bill unwraps whats left of the tentacle from his bruised
  neck and looks around at the dead diseased grants
  splattered flesh is around him
  
  bill hears a quiet rattling sound he looks around him 
  and then sees down at his feet what is actually a
  distorted piece of grants cerebellum sticking out of a
  new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quilllike spore 
  it quivers and trembles upward its little bulbed spurs
  popping out
  
  int grant hallway  morning
  
  starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke
  most of the second floor has been blown away her mutated
  husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs
  
  ext grant home  moments later
  
  starla comes around the side of the house holding a paper
  towel roll to the slice on her ribs she sees bill
  standing there she smiles
  
                      starla
            hey
  
  bill smiles too

  bag is slung over bills shoulder everything around
  them is dead the victims who were being feasted on as
  well as the various diseased the torture is over but
  no life remains
  
  ext main street  moments later
  
  bill finds an abandoned nissan maxima in the middle of
  the street with the keys still in it

  ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant and out
  onto 
  
  ext road beyond wheelsy  day
  
  the sun is bright and beautiful glistening on the car 
  bill and starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
  they head up this long barren road outside the city
  
  ext cluster of stores  moments later
  
  bill and starla pass through a small block of stores
  
  starla gazes out the window to see people  real actual
  healthy human beings men and women and children  going
  about their daily chores tears come to her eyes
  
  bill grabs starlas hand she clenches his tightly
  
                      starla

            and food at this gas station up

  cashier rings it up staring at them because of their
  wounds
  
                      cashier

  starla glances down his arm pulls up his shirt and
  starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
  stomach she turns away looking around confused
  
  bill pays smiles at the cashier

  starla really cant bring herself to look at it as she
  reaches across it and toward the door handle

  the pavement
