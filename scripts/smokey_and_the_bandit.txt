               dickey crosses to a trucker couple polishing up their chromed 
               rig

                                     dickey

                         bandit

                         aint seen him

                                     wife
                              immediately
                         over there behind his rig

               the husband shoots his old lady a jealous look dickey rejoins 
               kyle and they head toward bandit larues truck

               new angle  moving

               as they come to the only battered beatenup eighteenwheeler 
               at the entire truck roadeo it looks like it hasnt been 
               washed since it left the showroom

               on one side of the truck is a faded and peeling mural of a 
               stagecoach being held up a teamster and a shotgun guard 
               have their hands high in the air and a bandit on horseback 
               has a sixgun pointed at them

               an elaborate cb radio antenna grows out of the cab beside 
               the drivers door

               angle  kyle and dickey  from behind

               as they round the truck and stop in their tracks

               reverse angle  what they see

               a hammock is stretched from the cab of the truck to an oak 
               tree a man wearing a faded denim western shirt open with 
               the sleeves rolled up levis and silvertoed cowboy boots is 
               lying in the hammock a cowboy hat covers his face

               closer angle

               as shadows fall across the figure the man slowly tips back 
               his hat and we see hes in his thirties boyishly handsome 
               with a cocky smile bandit larue

               full shot

               and for the first time we get a look at kyle and dickey 
               kyle is wearing sunglasses and diamond rings on every finger 
               his smile is as tasteless as the suit he wears

               dickey is in his early twenties blonde blueeyed and scared 
               to death of his old man

               bandit looks at them for a moment then casually pulls the 
               hat back over his face

                                     kyle
                         aw aint you glad to see me bandit

               theres a long pause interrupted by kyles hacking cough

               bandit gets up and begins untying the hammock from the tree 
               kyle crosses to him

               skips and jumps to merle haggards live version of okie 
               from muskogee loud

               instantly the other bikers are on their feet a trucker 
               stands to help cledus and is immediately coldcocked

               moving angle  hand held

               cledus sees hes in the middle of a powder keg  with no 
               way out he backs up toward the pool table grabs a cue

                                     owner
                              yelling

               cledus swings the pool cue the bikers split up move around 
               him he cant watch them all then like clockwork they all 
               rush him three from the front two from the side one over 
               the top of the pool table

               cledus nails one of them with a pool cue to the nuts the 
               biker screams and doubles over a biker flies over the pool 
               table and crashes into cledus from behind  knocking the 
               pool cue away another biker rushes in but gets cledus 
               frye boot in the gut for his trouble

               but then the other two nail cledus from each side and its 
               over theyve got him cledus tries to shake himself loose 
               but the first biker picks himself up from the jukebox 
               strolls over and lets him have it twice in the groin cledus 
               doubles over onto the ground

               another angle

               as the three bikers pick cledus up and toss him into the 
               air over to the other three bikers they catch him and toss 
               him back again

               cledus they swing him back and forth one two three then 
               they toss him out the window

               outside the truck stop  day

               landing face down in the gravel with a thud wait and fred 
               is tossed out after him

               patrolman have already started toward the rear of bandit ii 
               the weight station worker jumps up to unlatch bandit iis 
               back doors

                                     highway patrolman

               the highway patrolman and the weight station worker dive for 
               cover as bandit i blasts past them doing at least 90

               roars around the weight station shack on two wheels  tires 
               screaming

               the parking area onto the highway

               back to scene

               nobody notices cledus drive off as bandit i continues 
               screaming around the weight station  tires smoking

               bandit sees cledus has safely returned to the highway and 
               whips around the weight station shack for the final time and 
               hits the highway on ramp doing 100

               the two georgia highway patrol cars race past bandit ii 
               cledus gives them a small wave they dont notice

               bandit i  moving  late afternoon

               as the cobra comes racing up to the rear of a long line of 
               slowmoving traffic bandit moves out to pass and sees

               pickup truck

               coming straight at him

               bandit i

               swerves onto the shoulder

               the pickup truck

               does the same

               bandit i and the pickup truck

               bandit i swerves back onto the highway so does the pickup 
               and it looks like a headon for sure

               at the last instant bandit swerves back onto the shoulder 
               the pickup rips past him and bandit manages to pull the cobra 
               back onto the highway and into the free lane

               new angle

               as the pickup truck now is facetoface with the first georgia 
               highway patrol car they jockey for position the first 
               highway patrol car swerves and passes the pickup but the 
               second one hits the shoulder barely avoiding a headon

               angle  the second highway patrol car

               as it flies over the ditch and does a complete midair end
               overend flip  landing in a ditch out of the chase

               the expressway overpass  late afternoon

               bandit i races toward the overpass the georgia highway patrol 
               car three hundred yards behind

               bandit i takes the hairpin turn full out and goes into a 
               four wheel drift bandit manages to maintain control and 
               punches it in midslide blasting the cobra through the turn 
               onto the expressway below

               camera holds

               as the highway patrol car tries the same feat loses control 
               and crashes into the chain link divider

               the expressway  from above

               bandit roars onto the expressway sailing right past a georgia 
               state troopers car parked on the shoulder waiting for 
               speeders

               the state trooper fires up his engine and with red lights 
               twirling and siren wailing pulls out after bandit i

               just as he does the georgia highway patrol car comes racing 
               by and they slam into each other  knocking both cars twenty 
               feet each way

               both cars straighten out and wait for the other to take the 
               lead the trooper starts off so does the highway patrol 
               car the trooper stops so does the highway patrol car this 
               goes on for several beats until they both start off at the 
               same time  and smash right into each other again

               high shot  the expressway

               as bandit i races down the expressway the two police cars 
               finally get it together and take off after him

               inside bandit

               bandit weaves in and out of traffic glances out his side 
               mirror

               angle  through side mirror

               the georgia highway patrol car and the georgia state trooper 
               racing down the expressway cars pulling onto the shoulder 
               so they can pass

               angle  expressway on ramp

               a large red sign reads wrong way  do not enter bandit i 
               blasts by the sign and enters the on ramp going the wrong 
               way

               another highway patrol car is coming down the ramp  headed 
               straight for them

               full shot

               the highway patrol car isnt giving ground as bandit i roars 
               toward him

                         oh dear god in heaven

               the two cars

               racing toward each other neither giving ground a deadon 
               chickie run

               finally at the last possible instant the highway patrol 
               car swerves to the right crashing through the guard railing 
               and sailing into

               midair

               the highway patrol car flies through the air and crashes 
               down on the back of a moving flatbed tractor trailer

               the flatbed truck just keeps driving not even noticing

               full of cars  headed straight for bandit i

               bandit floorboards it flies over the center divider and 
               ends up on the other side of the expressway just ahead of 
               bandit ii

               inside bandit i  moving  late afternoon

               as they race down the expressway flying past another

                                     bandit
                              looking over at 
                              clayton still out 
                              cold
                         you gotta admire the mans 
                         determination

               she hugs him a beat and the cops push bandit and cledus 
               into the back seat of the lead squad car

               as two cops move around the front kate leans in the rear 
               window

               inside the squad car

               bandit and cledus handcuffed

                                     kate
                              to the guys
                         well was it worth it

               bandit and cledus look at each other then nod then laugh 
               kate laughs with them

               then the two cops hop in the front seat as the other twenty
               six smokeys head for their cars

                                     kate
                              to cledus
                         ill take care of fred

               and now its almost over the cop starts up the engine kate 
               and bandit look at each other for a long moment

                                     kate

                         see ya kate

               kate backs away from the window as the squad car pulls out 
               followed by the endless line of atlantas finest

               their sirens now silent but their advertising still flashing

               and now as we pull further and further away watching the 
               whole event become history

               we hear

                                     voice one
