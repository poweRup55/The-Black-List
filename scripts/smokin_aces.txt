               it on the console the supervisor still confused by the 
               exchange wanting to speak but unsure of what to say he 
               gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front

               his head bulletgraze blood congealed by the cold the 
               concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind

               he crawls from the water muscles cramping knotting up he 
               reaches the sand unable to pull himself up any further he 
               turns back sees the bodies of deeks and dupree face down

               then beanie hears the small metallic warble of something 
               rolling around on the floor behind him gradually settling  
               a sensation overtakes him and he grows very still with 
               it

               he looks down at his hand for the first time sees blood 
               there reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered 
               hole right above the base of his spine  small wisps of 
               smoke drifting up out of the wound he turns numb and 
               sees what looks like a spent shell casing just ejected 
               coming to rest on the tile the phone continues to ring

               clothed wet with blood gun in her hand and grins

               sykes seeing darwin standing over ivy holding a sledgehammer  
               recognizes him as the perv from earlier she levels the glock 
               stepping out of the elevator steadying herself against the

               then the sound of an helicopter intrudes rotor thrum 
               building steadily growing louder  the floor seems to shake 
               as the chopper approaches  nervous eyes dart  nobody

               a flush headshot gill frantic rapid chest compressions on 
               israel who gags starts coughs heart back up and beating 
               his watery gaze moves from gill to soot who know stands 
               overtop of him aiming the 9mm down at him

               israel averts his eyes the end has come he looks over 
               and sees his lambskin coat lying there soaking in beanies 
               blood ruined beyond recognition a tear escapes his eye

                                     israel

               soot puts the gun flush with buddys skull when suddenly 
               the ceiling begins to tremble and shake the sound of a 
               helicopter filling the air

                                                                    cut to

               the absurdity of this makes messner want to cry laughing

               and thats when he hears the chopper and sees it as it 
               rises up past their floor past the contingent of cops and 
               feds slugging it out with watters across the street
