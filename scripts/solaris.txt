                                     october 4 2001

                

               first over black we hear the sound of a light rain

               then

                                     mans voice
                         im not a poet  ive never moved 
                         anyone with my words
                              beat
                         maybe thats why they chose me

               ext  woods  day

               a mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky  rain 
               continues to fall

               maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light 
               or is it the sky  something vaguely unsettling

                                                                    cut to

               int  bedroom  morning

               still the sound of rain is heard

               a man

               40s lies on his side in bed staring at us

               he has not been sleeping  in fact judging from his distant 
               expression he has not slept in ages

                                                                    cut to

               ext  road  day

               less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a 
               vehicle through

               the man dressed in rain gear walks down the middle  he is 
               accompanied by a mediumsized labrador and seems in no 
               particular hurry

               the sound of tires appear and grow in intensity  the man 
               without saying an actual word instructs the dog to heal  
               the dog obeys as the man moves off the road  the vehicle 
               hurtles past him  its engine quiet its windows darkened 
               spraying muddy debris in its wake

               seconds later the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop

               the man

               stops walking and stares at the car which seems ominously 
               still

               the car then reverses direction and begins to move toward 
               the man who remains motionless

               when the car is alongside him a darkened window turns 
               transparent and we see a welldressed bureaucrat in the rear 
               seat  his demeanor is pleasant and professional

                                     welldressed bureaucrat
                         dr kelvin

               the man he is addressing who we now understand is chris 
               kelvin stares back at him

                                                                    cut to

               int  cabin  day

               the contrast between the cabins rustic aesthetic and the 
               aggressively hightech equipment contained therein isnt as 
               jarring as you might imagine

               kelvin is seated in front of a desk scrolling through a 
               text readout on a flat transparent holographic screen  
               behind him is the welldressed bureaucrat from the car and 
               two others a woman in her 50s and a man in his 30s  they 
               are also wellgroomed  each of their suits are embroidered 
               with a small but distinctive logo of some sort that composes 
               the acronym dba

               kelvin scrolls through several menus hits a few keys and a 
               digitized video image appears on his screen a man unshaven 
               looking into the camera

               the man gibarian looks very tired and somewhat apologetic  
               the lower part of the screen has a time of day and date 
               display that reads 0221 hrs 111431

                                     gibarian
                         we take off into the cosmos ready 
                         for anything solitude hardship 
                         exhaustion death  were proud of 
                         ourselves in a way  but our 
                         enthusiasm is a sham  we dont want 
                         to conquer the cosmos  we want to 
                         extend the boundaries of earth to 
                         the cosmos  we are only seeking 
                         man  we dont want other worlds  
                         we want mirrors
                              beat
                         maybe we dont need to know what it 
                         is or why  maybe just knowing that 
                         it is should be enough

               gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before 
               switching it off and ending the transmission

               kelvin sits back

               the visitors exchange glances

                                                                    cut to

               int  space capsule

               close on kelvin  we hold on him a long time as a myriad of 
               readouts scroll and flash across his face  a slit of sunlight 
               glides slowly through frame

                                                               dissolve to

               kelvin

               in the same capsule a month later  he is asleep

                                                               dissolve to

               kelvin

               in the same capsule two months later  he is dictating some 
               coordinates to earth  he absently scratches his heavy growth 
               of beard

                                                               dissolve to

               kelvin

               two months later still  he is looking out his small 
               rectangular window and for the fist time we cut around to 
               see the approaching planet solaris

               kelvin stares at it hypnotized  it has a translucent 
               quality as though it is lit from within and its undulating 
               oceanlike surface slowly changes colors

               kelvins attention is diverted as an orbiting ship the 
               prometheus edges into frame

                                     kelvin
                         prometheus this is athena 7 on 
                         approach do you read me
                              beat
                         prometheus this is athena 7 on 
                         approach do you read me

               no response  he exhales and types on a keyboard

               ext  space

               the athena 7 sporting a dba logo advances toward the 
               prometheus

                                                                    cut to

               int  prometheus

               kelvin in a space suit climbs with some difficulty out of 
               the athena 7 which has come to rest in the docking bay of 
               the prometheus  several exploratory pods fill the remainder 
               of the area

               kelvin gets his bearings and looks around but sees no sign 
               of life

                                                                    cut to

               int  corridor

               empty

               note except for some robotic nonspeaking characters the 
               automated taskmasters  these are small buglike repair 
               units that constantly roam the ship fixing things  their 
               tiny hum is virtually silent and we see them all the time 
               on the prometheus  they can adhere to any surface at any 
               angle

               kelvin now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying 
               case and a duffle bag moves on

                                                                    cut to

               int  gibarians room

               ransacked

               kelvin registers it then moves to the corner of the room 
               where the computer terminal rests  within moments he has 
               discovered gibarian has recorded a video message for him to 
               replay

               video

               gibarian addressing the camera  he appears to be lucid but 
               extremely fatigued

                                     gibarian
                         hi chris

                         im so glad you came
                              beat the smile fades
                         i still have a little time and i 
                         want to tell you something  to warn 
                         you  by now you know about me or 
                         if you dont get snow or sartorius 
                         to tell you it doesnt matter
                              beat
                         i didnt lose my mind  you should 
                         be able to tell from this video  
                         im not mad
                              beat
                         if it happens to you remember that 
                         it isnt madness
                              beat
                         you should know im in favor of 
                         destroying solaris  i know thats 
                         illegal  and unethical  and 
                         irresponsible  but its the only 
                         way to make it stop

               a long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video 
               which draws gibarians attention offscreen

                                     gibarian
                              addressing whoever 
                              made the noise
                         cut that out  do you hear me

               gibarian switches off the video

               the computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and 
               overlays a readout indicating the file has ended

                                                                    cut to

               int  corridor

               empty  but there is a door at the end of it slightly open  
               kelvin moves toward it

               int  room

               a figure seated with its back to the door turns to see 
               kelvin enter  this is snow  he looks kelvin up and down 
               his expression wary and alert

                                     kelvin
                         snow  didnt you hear me radio  
                         im kelvin

               a long beat  snow just watches him

                                     snow
                         yes  we heard

               kelvin takes a step forward and snow recoils

                                     kelvin
                         whats wrong  what happened to 
                         gibarian

                                     snow
                         hes dead

                                     kelvin
                         how

               a beat

                                     snow
                         suicide

               snow exhales then looks up as though hes remembered 
               something

                                     snow
                         you didnt bring any chocolate did 
                         you

                                     kelvin
                         what

                                     snow
                              musing
                         i love chocolate  i realized just 
                         yesterday how much i love it
                              beat then he recovers
                         i thought maybe if they let you 
                         bring personal effects you might 
                         have snuck some through because 
                         well ive been thinking about it

               a long beat as kelvin stares at snow

                                     kelvin
                         what happened here

               snow lies back in his bunk

                                     snow
                         i cant talk just now  im too tired

                                     kelvin
                         wheres sartorius

                                     snow
                         in his lab  he wont let you in

                                     kelvin
                              leaving
                         hell let me in

                                     snow
                         kelvin if you see anything unusual

               kelvin stops but doesnt turn around

                                     snow
                         try to stay calm

                                                                    cut to

               int  corridor

               kelvin stands outside a door

                                     kelvin
                         let me in

               a beat

                                     sartorius
                              inside muffled
                         you have to give me your word you 
                         wont come in  then ill come out

                                     kelvin
                         all right

               sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit 
               and into the hallway  he is of obvious intelligence and not 
               to be messed with contentious intimidating when he wants 
               to be and probably brilliant  kelvin eyes him suspiciously

                                     kelvin
                         what happened to gibarian

                                     sartorius
                         didnt you talk to snow

                                     kelvin
                         i want to hear your version

                                     sartorius

                         the same thing that could happen to 
                         any of us

                         her  who are you talking about

               sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his 
               door  he struggles to keep his composure

                                     sartorius
                         his last wish was to be buried on 
                         earth  in dirt he said  i want 
                         to buried in dirt  what a clown

               sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is 
               on the other side of his door

                                     kelvin
                         they shouldnt let people like you

                         just so you know im not going back 
                         until i understand what it is  i am 
                         going to figure out what it is make

                         i dont trust snow  theres something 
                         wrong with him

               sartorius rotates and zips back into his room  as the door 
               closes kelvin sees a flash of another figure in sartorius 
               room  the glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the 
               other figure could have been

                                                                    cut to

               kelvin walks exploring the ship  he sees something that 
               stops him

               a nude woman

               black early 20s slipping across a corridor up ahead

               kelvin gives chase  he sees her turn a corner but by the 
               time he gets there she is gone

                                                                    cut to

                         is there anybody else here

                                     snow
                              sits up a little
                         why who did you see

                                     kelvin
                         gibarian warned me  he left me a

                         she was real  where did she come 
                         from

               snow looks at him but doesnt respond

                                     kelvin
                         tell me  i wont think youre insane

                         oh thats a relief

               snow lies back down

                         where did she come from

               a beat

                         how long can you go without sleep

                                     kelvin
                         that depends

                                     snow
                         well when you do go to sleep 
                         barricade your door

               snow rolls over away from kelvin

                                                                    cut to

                         and a perusal of the deceaseds 
                         personal effects indicate he was 
                         suffering from severe depression 
                         with psychotic features along with

                         opinions on my part  i will attempt 
                         to convince snow and sartorius to 
                         return to earth but as they currently 
                         view me as an intruder of sorts 
                         this may take some time

               later  kelvin is lying down  the lights are out and he is 
               trying to sleep

               after a moment he gets up checks the lock on his door and 
               lies back down

               then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door and 
               lies back down

               then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair 
               and lies back down

               laughing to himself he drifts off to sleep

               silence

               a womans lips slightly parted

               back to kelvin

               asleep  then

               int  train  day

               continued silence and

               rheya 30s staring at us practically daring us to look 
               away  her obvious intelligence and confidence make her 
               extremely compelling along with the fact that it was her 
               parted lips we were looking at a moment ago  her expression 
               indicates shes in a very raw emotional state

               reverse angle

               kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the train

               he is younger here not just in age but in spirit  the 
               contrast with his older self is striking

               back to kelvin

               asleep on the ship  after a beat

               extreme closeup

               rheyas lips

               except the circumstance is clearly different its darker 
               and there isnt the sidetoside shimmy of the train car

               a wider view

               reveals that rheya is not sitting on the train  she is 
               sitting in kelvins room on the prometheus right now

               she is staring at kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness

               kelvin

               awakens blinks and slowly recognizes her

               if he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously 
               dreamed of rheya before  he looks at her simply

               rheya

               stands and makes her way to kelvin

               without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore 
               each other and we see all of it happen and two things are 
               obvious first they have done this before and two they 
               havent done it in some time

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin is asleep rheya in his arms

               he wakes up and looks at her perplexed  after a beat he 
               rises to sit on the edge of the bed

               a wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to 
               his forehead  rheya opens her eyes

                                     kelvin
                         oh god  im awake

                                     rheya
                         yes

               he looks at her

                                     kelvin
                         where did you come from

               she moves to him and kisses him as if thats all she wants 
               to do forever

               between kisses

                                     kelvin
                         how are you here

               she stops

                                     rheya
                         how do you mean
                              beat
                         chris whats wrong

               hearing his name spoken by her and those particular words 
               perhaps nearly causes kelvin to scream

               he stands and moves to the chair  rheya watches him

                                     rheya
                         i love you

               he looks up at her for as long as he can  then he looks 
               down

                                     rheya
                         do you love me

               he doesnt look up

                                     kelvin
                         yes

               a beat

                                     kelvin
                         i need to see snow

                                     rheya

                              rising
                         ill just be a minute

               she bolts out of bed

                                     rheya
                         dont

                         why

                                     rheya
                         i dont know  i cant be alone

                                     kelvin
                         ill be right back

               she is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left 
               alone is palpable even excessive  he sees this and puts 
               his arms on her shoulders to comfort her

                                     kelvin
                         all right  all right  here

               he hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water

                                     rheya
                         what are they

                                     kelvin

                         to calm my anxiety

               she takes the pills and smiles

                                                                    cut to

               int  docking bay

               kelvin leads rheya to one of the exploratory pods  they are 
               in space suits

                                     rheya
                         were taking a flight

                                     kelvin
                         yes

               he opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter  
               she is unsure

                                     kelvin
                         go ahead  ill close the door behind 
                         me

                         thats ludicrous  this is contact  
                         we have found god  the only issue 
                         is figuring out how to prove this in 
                         a way that will make sense back on 
                         earth  so how will we describe it 
                         if we choose to describe it at all

                                                                    cut to

                         a prebiological colloidal envelope 
                         possibly exceeding terrestrial 
                         structures in complexity a plasmic 
                         mechanism  probably without life as 
                         we conceive it but capable of 
                         performing functional activities on 
                         an astronomic scale  my view is 
                         that solaris has reached in a single 
                         bound the homeostatic ocean stage 
                         without passing through stages of 
                         terrestrial evolution  i think it 
                         bypassed cellular development 
                         altogether  it hasnt taken endless 
                         eons to adapt itself to its 
                         environment but in fact dominated 
                         its environment immediately  from 
                         the moment it existed it was the 
                         most superior element in the universe  
                         and now it passes the time doing 
                         extravagant theoretical thinking 
                         about the universe with us as the 
                         cast

               we now show this scene being played out on a video monitor

                         its engaged in a neverending process 
                         of transformation an ontological 
                         autometamorphosis begging the

                         i dont care what it is we need to 
                         figure out how to make it stop

                                     gibarian
                         nelson we have the opportunity 

                                     sartorius
                         what if this thing follows us back 
                         to earth  what if whats happening 
                         here started happening on earth on 
                         a mass scale  dont you see that as 
                         a problem  i think its a serious 
                         mistake to assume its benign  for 
                         all we know its driving us crazy so 
                         it can watch us kill each other

               gibarian considers this

                                     snow
                         were not even sure it will let us

                         maybe its stuck  maybe its power 
                         isnt that godlike  i mean we 
                         have godlike power relative to an 
                         insect but that doesnt mean we can 
                         move the earth around at will  maybe 
                         its like a spider web waiting for

                         monologue with itself  of course it

                         i thought id been behaving normally 
                         rationally  but a sign of insanity 
                         is the inability to think about more 
                         than one thing  so if i am consumed 
                         by the idea that i am insane and 
                         cant think of anything else then i

                         yes  but not until you mentioned 
                         them  as soon as you said those 
                         things i remembered them  and they 
                         have associations that make me think 
                         of other things i remember  its 
                         like filling up

               she looks out the portal at solaris

                                     rheya
                         is it a planet

                                     kelvin
                         not exactly  it exists in a continuum 
                         that wasnt proven until ten years 
                         ago a higher mathematical dimension 
                         superimposed on top of the universe  
                         an infinite number of them in fact  
                         it was a violation of all of our 
                         various laws regarding the universe 
                         space or spacetime  it was 
                         completely counterintuitive  we 
                         had to unlearn everything

                                     rheya
                         is it intelligent

                         intelligent beyond our comprehension

                         then its god right

                         you still dont believe in god

                                     kelvin
                         the whole idea of god was dreamed up 
                         by a silly animal with a small brain 
                         called man  even the limits we put 
                         on it are human limits  it can do 
                         this it can do that  it designs 
                         it creates

                                     rheya
                         even a god that wasnt active that 
                         just created something and stood 
                         back and watched

                                     kelvin
                         youre talking about a man in a white 
                         beard again  youre ascribing human 
                         characteristics to something that 
                         isnt human  human beings look for 
                         causes and patterns  how could we 
                         know what solaris is up to if 
                         anything

               a beat

                                     rheya
                         but what if solaris is what there 
                         was before the big bang

                                     kelvin
                         as i said it is beyond our 
                         comprehension

                                     rheya
                         as i said then its god right

               she looks at him and cant keep from smiling eventually

                                     rheya
                         why are we talking about this shit 
                         when we could be fucking

               kelvin smiles

                                     snow
                         just a little strategy session  but 
                         in person this time

                                                                    cut to

               kelvin is getting ready to leave  rheya sits on the edge of 
               the bed nervous

                                     kelvin
                         all right

               she nods and kelvin exits locking the door behind him

               we sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm

               in the corridor

               kelvin listens  a long time

               satisfied he begins to walk away but is stopped by the 
               sounding of a crashing glass from within  he hears footsteps 
               approach the door and then a fierce pounding

               he takes a step back  an inhuman amount of noise begins 
               emanating from the other side of the door which is now 
               threatening to break apart  it sounds like a plane is 
               crashing in kelvins room  no human could create this kind 
               of cacophony

               finally he steps forward and presses the button to open the 
               door

               rheya

               is revealed covered in blood  she has completely torn the 
               inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself 
               in the process

                                     kelvin
                         rheya

               confused she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms 
               and carries her to the bed

                                     rheya
                         what happened

                                     kelvin
                         you were trying to break down the 
                         door  do you know why

                                     rheya
                         when i saw you were gone i got scared

               he puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom where 
               he gathers all the first aid materials he can find

               returning he blanches

               rheyas wounds have healed in fact they are healing in 
               front of us

               she looks up at him and doesnt like the look on his face

                         experiments  agreed

               kelvin and snow nod

                                     sartorius
                         i would like to start with motivation  
                         why are they here

               sartorius looks at rheya  she looks away

                                     sartorius
                         they are not autonomous individuals 
                         and theyre not actual persons  
                         they are projections materializing 
                         from our minds based on a given 
                         individual

                                     snow
                         its an experiment

                                     kelvin
                         no  theres no behavior modification

                                     sartorius
                         she reappeared exactly as she had 
                         before

               kelvin looks at rheya and nods  she is struck by the word 
               before

                                     snow
                         the same vulnerabilities

               he nods again

                                     sartorius
                         a recoil with no compensating 
                         mechanism

                                     snow
                         and when a given situation no longer 
                         corresponds to the normal faculties 
                         of the original the visitor 
                         suffers some sort of disconnected 
                         consciousness

                                     sartorius
                         followed by nonhuman manifestations

                                     snow
                         are the actions of solaris 
                         premeditated

                                     kelvin
                         is it being deliberately cruel you 
                         mean  i dont think so

                                     snow
                         im just trying to find an explanation 
                         for the continual reappearances

                                     kelvin
                              to rheya
                         when you cut yourself pounding the 
                         door did it hurt

                                     rheya
                         yes
                              looks around
                         of course

                                     sartorius
                         if theyre not learning anything and 
                         theyre not modifying their behavior 
                         why do they come back

                                     snow
                         its like theyre plugged into a 
                         game which goes around and around 
                         endlessly repeating itself

                                                                    cut to

               int  apartment  night

               this is ten years ago  rheya enters alone

               she crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink  almost 
               immediately the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and 
               stands beside her tail wagging  she ignores it and continues 
               mixing her drink

               halfway through this activity the bedroom light comes on  
               a moment later kelvin is in the doorway  eventually but 
               not angrily because hes still not really awake

                                     kelvin
                         whereve you been

                                     rheya
                         i been thinking about how much i 
                         hate you

               she finishes making her drink drinks it and walks out the 
               door

               kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat then pivots and 
               returns to bed  the light goes out

                                     rheya vo
                         yes i remember that  i went back 
                         to lois house and spent the night  
                         those were dark days

                                                                    cut to

               int  party  night

               kelvin and rheya later in the evening when they spoke for 
               the first time  they are absolutely infatuated with each 
               other they know something is happening between them will 
               happen between them

                                     rheya
                         i would have these  i dont know 
                         how to describe them  visions 
                         when i was younger  maybe not 
                         visions but like these waking dream 
                         states  time would just collapse i 
                         would be inside time  i would stare 
                         at a second hand on a clock until it 
                         stopped  freaky stuff

                                     kelvin
                         how old were you

                                     rheya
                         seven eight  so one day my mother 
                         catches me sort of staring off into 
                         space and she asks me what im doing 
                         and i start trying to explain to 
                         her about this state that i can put 
                         myself in and this look comes over 
                         her face

                                     kelvin
                         what kind of look

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin and rheya sit together in the prometheus  rheya 
               continues her story without a beat

                                     rheya
                         scared  no not scared  wary  
                         like i was something to be her 
                         guard went up  i was a threat  now 
                         i know why  she was afraid shed be 
                         seen  that i would see her for the 
                         selfobsessed neurotic that she was  
                         i think she thought she had a few 
                         more years of being on a pedestal  
                         but thats the cycle right  i knew 
                         a little more than she did she knew 
                         a little more than her mother and 
                         on and on
                              beat
                         i guess thats part of the reason 
                         why 

                                     kelvin
                         i know  i know  we dont have to 
                         talk about that

               another beat

                                     rheya
                         i remember days of just thinking 
                         about you

               int  offices  day

               intercut kelvin and rheya at their respective jobs going 
               through a normal day  there is no sound  as we see these 
               images its clear that kelvin and rheya are slightly not 
               present in their respective encounters with other people 
               they are distracted by the idea of each other

               and they like it

                                     rheya
                         thinking what you were doing and 
                         saying just being consumed by 
                         thinking of you  i loved it so much 
                         that feeling

                                     kelvin
                         i did too

               int  apartment  night

               rheya on the edge of the bed facing away

                                     kelvin
                         i used to watch you undress

               as she does

                                     kelvin
                         i never tired of watching you undress  
                         every time it was exciting  right 
                         until to the end

               a beat  then a shot of kelvin that weve seen before him 
               leaving their apartment angry

               on the prometheus

               a beat

                                     rheya
                         what happened to us exactly

                                     kelvin
                         you dont know

               rheya shakes her head

               kelvin just watches her

                                     rheya
                         i remember something burning  
                         coffee burning

               int  apartment  day

               the rainstreaked window

               an automated coffee maker has been left on and the solidified 
               coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking

               rheyas body is on the floor of the kitchen

               rheya on prometheus

               she is looking at kelvin  he is dreading this

                                     rheya
                         you found me

               he nods  its coming back to her

               int  apartment  day

               kelvin is yelling at rheya  we dont hear what hes saying 
               but judging from her reaction its not pleasant  she is 
               crying

               rheya

               experiencing this all over again  kelvin comes and sits in 
               front of her

               int  apartment  day

               kelvin still yelling is packing some things into a suitcase  
               rheya between sobs pleads with him

               rheya

               her eyes fill with tears  kelvin embraces her

                                     kelvin
                         im sorry  im sorry

               rheya is devastated inconsolable

                                     rheya
                         why did you say those things

                                     kelvin
                         i dont know  i couldnt understand 
                         why you didnt tell me

               int  apartment  day

               rheya lies on the kitchen floor dead  there is a note in 
               her hand

               kelvin kneels next to her

               kelvin on prometheus

               with rheya still in his arms

                                     kelvin
                         when you said you wouldnt make it 
                         i didnt believe you  or i didnt 
                         take you seriously which is worse

               int  apartment  day

               kelvin holds the dead rheya

               kelvin

               squeezing her

                                     kelvin
                         i should have believed you

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin lies in bed his eyes open  rheya is in his arms

                                                                    cut to

               int  apartment  day

               rheya talking to chris  obviously during a period when 
               they were getting along  or at least not fighting

                                     rheya
                         i cant help feeling that im cheating 
                         when i take them

                                     kelvin
                         its genetics  you know this  you 
                         know where it comes from  there is 
                         nothing wrong with uncrossing a few 
                         crossed wires

               she knows intellectually that he is right  but it doesnt 
               matter

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to snow  
               rheya is asleep in the background  the room is dark except 
               for the glow of the screen

                                     snow
                         youre unnerved because youve spent 
                         your whole life thinking nobody is 
                         looking over you and suddenly your 
                         subconscious is an open book  we 
                         are for the first time experiencing 
                         changes in natural reality by a force 
                         not our own  that proves that 

                                     kelvin
                          we are not sure of that  we are 
                         not sure we arent all hallucinating

                                     snow
                         if god is beyond our comprehension 
                         and she 
                              meaning rheya

                         it will end badly  as inevitably as 
                         the rising of a bubble

                                     kelvin
                         snow thinks we shouldnt leave until 
                         we figure out a way to document it 
                         to prove its existence to the planet 
                         earth  this is hilarious he thinks 
                         its god but he wants it to sit 
                         still for a photograph so he can 
                         show the folks back home

               they smile at this  rheyas smile fades before kelvins

                         well  he doesnt think its god 
                         but for different reasons than me  
                         hes thinking if i can figure out 
                         how to make it stop than i am smarter 
                         than it is and therefore it cannot 
                         be god

                         he does have a point  thats just 
                         not the way id like to see it proven

                                     rheya

                         it was obvious from the way he first 
                         looked at me

                         terrific vet  you drifted into 
                         writing and turned out to be a 
                         perceptive journalist  then it was 
                         politics which seemed best of all 
                         you had an actual gift for

               she just smokes not really looking at him  maybe its a

                         gibarian was under enormous 

                                     sartorius
                         gibarian was helpless  its very 
                         simple man created the science that 
                         resulted in the discovery of solaris 
                         and the ship that brought us here

                                     kelvin
                         meaning man can do whatever the fuck 
                         it wants

                                     sartorius
                         yes

                                     kelvin
                         thats fantastic

                                     sartorius
                         why did you agree to come here

               a beat

                                     sartorius
                         too tired to answer

               looks at rheya then back to kelvin

                                     sartorius
                         ill bet  is this what they sent 
                         you here to do  youve lost it 
                         youve gone native

               kelvin moves toward him  sartorius just lets him come

                                     rheya
                              to sartorius
                         youre the coward

                                     kelvin
                         dont debate him hell say anything

                                     rheya
                              still to sartorius
                         im just as human as you  i see i 
                         hear i touch and i feel just like 
                         you do

                                     sartorius
                         prove it

                                     rheya
                         these guests are a part of you of 
                         your subconscious  chris loves me

                                     sartorius
                         you are not human  try to understand 
                         that if you can understand anything

               kelvin is within an inch of his face

                                     kelvin
                         get out of here

               slowly carefully sartorius grasps kelvin by the shoulders  
               then he leans in and whispers in kelvins ear

                                     sartorius
                         rheya is dead  shes a copy  a 
                         facsimile  and shes seducing you 
                         all over again  youre sick  you 
                         think of fucking her as research for 
                         humanity  its just fucking

               kelvin backs away

                                     sartorius
                         theres nothing grandiose about it  
                         youve jumped out of a plane and 
                         youre trying to sew a parachute 
                         together while you fall

               sartorius turns

                                     sartorius
                         itd be hilarious if it werent so 
                         damn sad

               and leaves

               a beat

                                     snow
                         we didnt even get to hear his new 
                         ideas

               snow wanders toward the door

                                     snow
                         im not feeling well

               he passes kelvin and leaves

               kelvin watches him then looks at rheya  she seems dazed

                                                                    cut to

               ext  solaris

               the fogshrouded surface shifting and turning like an ocean

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               rheya is asleep  kelvin is talking to snow on the videophone

                                     snow
                         we can liquidate the station  take 
                         the athena back

                                     kelvin
                         no

                                     snow
                         of course when we return well be 
                         regarded as lunatics if we tell the 
                         truth
                              shrugs
                         well chalk it up to isolation 
                         collective derangement

                                     kelvin
                         ive never heard you express any 
                         desire to leave before now  why 
                         now

                                     snow
                         well i think were reaching the 
                         point of diminishing returns here 
                         right  certainly its learning more 
                         about us than well ever learn about 
                         it

                                     kelvin
                         but why is it doing what its doing  
                         given its resources it could have 
                         done anything  presented me with 
                         your double and you with mine

                                     snow
                         perhaps it did

                                     kelvin
                         human beings can die

                                     snow
                         but they are human  they certainly 
                         become human with incredible speed  
                         first theyre like they were in our 
                         memory but then they fill in on 
                         their own  dna doesnt determine 
                         the hundreds of trillions of 
                         connections that occur in the brain 
                         its not dense enough  they build 
                         up with experience

               int  kelvins room  earlier

               quick glimpses of rheya  in several of them she is in repose 
               thinking as if to illustrate snows point

               int  kelvins room

               back to kelvin thinking

                                     kelvin
                         they come when you sleep

                                     snow
                         thats right  and we all have to 
                         sleep eventually

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin on the bed with rheya  their eyes are closed

               we think they are asleep until

                                     rheya
                         you dont want me

                                     kelvin
                         rheya

                                     rheya
                         thats what you were saying  i heard 
                         what you were saying

                                     kelvin
                         for a reason that neither of us 
                         understand you are forced to stay 
                         near me  thats all i know right 
                         now

               she realizes she doesnt want to argue  not right now 
               anyway

                                     rheya
                         i have these strange thoughts i 
                         dont know where they come from
                              beat
                         i cant explain it

                                     kelvin
                         neither can i  not any of it  
                         theres no reference point for whats 
                         going on its never happened before  
                         its a clean break in the fabric of 
                         the universe a gap  there is nothing 
                         to do but experience it momentto 
                         moment and not let it destroy us

                                     rheya
                         but thats what happened before

                                     kelvin
                         not this time

               he kisses her  she wants to believe him so she says nothing  
               then

                                     rheya
                         do you want to stay here

                                     kelvin
                         do you

                                     rheya
                         if youre here

               they kiss again

                                                               dissolve to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin is asleep  rheya is next to him

               offscreen we hear the door open

               someone walks quietly though not surreptitiously through 
               the frame and sits

               after a long beat kelvin bolts upright his mind struggling 
               to clear  when it does

                                     kelvin
                         gibarian

                                     gibarian
                         leave the light off

               a beat  kelvin tries to get his bearings

                                     gibarian
                         i wish youd come a little sooner  
                         i might not have had to kill myself

               he smiles looking at kelvin

                                     gibarian
                         you think youre dreaming me like 
                         you dream her  understand something 
                         i am the real gibarian  just a new 
                         incarnation

                                     kelvin
                         what do you want

                                     gibarian
                         youre being tricked  sartorius 
                         picked a fight with you to avoid 
                         telling you about his idea for getting 
                         rid of the visitors  hes figured 
                         out theyre made of subatomic 
                         particles called neutrinos and hes 
                         going to create a negative neutrino 
                         field  twenty four hours a day 
                         until theyre back on earth

                                     kelvin
                         can it work

                                     gibarian
                         it can  ordinary matter like ours  
                         not affected  everything else 
                         disintegrates

               kelvin registers this

                                     gibarian
                         what im saying is dont trust 
                         anyone  find yourself a weapon of 
                         some sort

                                     kelvin
                         i can trust rheya

                                     gibarian
                         youll end up like me

                                     kelvin
                         youre not gibarian

                                     gibarian
                         no  who am i then

                                     kelvin
                         a puppet

                                     gibarian
                         and youre not  maybe youre my 
                         puppet  but like all puppets you 
                         think youre actually human  its 
                         the puppets dream  wondering if 
                         theyre human

               gibarian smiles

               kelvin

               wakes up gulping air  rheya startled

                                     rheya
                         whats wrong

                                     kelvin
                         gibarian  he was here

                                     rheya
                         you said he was dead

                         he is  but he was here

               he moves to the chair looking for some residue of gibarian 
               some proof  finding none

                                     kelvin
                         he spoke to me

               kelvin leaves the room  after a few beats rheya follows

               int  lab

               rheya lingers behind kelvin who is looking at gibarians 
               body

               it is there alone on its slab even the young girl is not 
               with him

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin thinking  he gives rheya some pills to take  she 
               just looks at them

                                     kelvin
                         are you going to take them

               she nods and takes them

                                     rheya
                         whats happening to us

                                     kelvin
                         its all right

                                     rheya

                                     kelvin

                                     rheya

                         if were playing out what happened 
                         before i wont survive

               he goes to her

                                     kelvin
                         that wont happen again  were 
                         different

                                     rheya

                         me  i only know what youre like

                         no you from before

               she sits frustrated  sad

                                     rheya
                         how could it be so cruel  how could 
                         it torture us like this

                                     kelvin
                         i dont think it knows its torturing 
                         us  its just watching

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin and rheya in bed  she looks despondent

                                                                    cut to

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin is asleep  alone

               after a long period of silence we hear the faint sound of 
               an instrument of some sort hitting the ground  after another 
               beat kelvin awakens  he notices that he is alone and 
               something tells him thats not a good sign

                                                                    cut to

               int  lab

               rheya is on the ground convulsing  beside her is a small 
               steel drum which is spilling a strangelooking liquid that 
               solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss

               kelvin moves to rheya and is startled to see that half of 
               her face and throat are burned away  not melted as in a 
               fire but merely eaten cleanly away  he picks her up

               int  corridor

               kelvin is carrying rheya  snow sticks his head out of a 
               passing room

                                     snow
                         what happened

                                     kelvin
                         she drank liquid oxygen

               int  kelvins room

               kelvin puts rheya on the bed  her face and throat have 
               returned to normal but she is not breathing  kelvin goes 
               and puts his head to her chest but doesnt hear what he 
               hoped to hear  he stands still looking at her  snow seems 
               very detached

               an uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually 
               not going to wake up

                                     kelvin
                         shes dead

               snow says nothing

               then

               her finger twitches

               barely noticeable at first but growing in intensity  kelvin 
               sees it and goes to her  she is starting to shake a little 
               as though cold

                                     snow
                         shell come back dont worry  but 
                         then what  my theory is she can 
                         only live here that she will die if 
                         she leaves this ship

               kelvin is still looking at rheya who is shaking a little 
               harder its feeling like a seizure now

                                     snow
                         why do you think she hasnt suggested 
                         that  its the most obvious solution 
                         escape  she knows she cant leave 
                         here 

                                     kelvin
                         get out 

                                     snow
                         oh this one you love  what about 
                         the first one the one you fucked 
                         and then put into a rocket and blasted 
                         into space  you didnt love her

               rheya is shaking much harder now kelvin tries to hold her 
               still but shes too strong  he stands reluctantly and 
               watches her

                                     snow
                         what happens if she comes back  is 
                         that polygamy  and even if you could 
                         take her home how would you get her 
                         through  you think theyre not going 
                         to notice her

               rheya is shaking violently now as if a rippling rhythmic 
               force were coursing through her  snow as he looks 
               dispassionately on the two of them

                                     snow
                         i never get used to them these 
                         resurrections

               he leaves

               rheya continues her process of waking up  its violent 
               even sexual  she spasms to a peak of some sort and then 
               slowly returns to normal

               kelvin puts his hand on her forehead

               she gradually begins to open her eyes  she looks at kelvin

               it takes her a moment to realize she shouldnt be seeing 
               him she shouldnt be seeing anything  she should be dead

               she begins to cry

                                     rheya
                         what am i  why cant i die

               she turns away

                                     rheya
                         im not rheya  youve always known 
                         that

                                     kelvin
                         rheya 

                                     rheya
                         dont call me that

               he turns her over

                                     kelvin
                         listen i dont care about anything 
                         but the fact that you are here  you 
                         are her you are rheya

                                     rheya

                                     rheya

                                                                    cut to

               still turning slowly

               but something about its appearance is different

               int  prometheus

               complete chaos

               kelvin is chasing sartorius to the flight deck

                                     sartorius
                              yelling as he runs
                         its changing characteristics  its 
                         solidifying taking on weight

                                     kelvin
                         how quickly

                                     sartorius
                         if it continues it will implode 
                         from its own weight and turn into a 
                         black hole in about four hours and 
                         pulls us in with it

               int  flight deck

               kelvin and sartorius get the ship ready for take off

                                     kelvin
                         wheres snow  did you call him

                                     sartorius
                         yes

               kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that snow is 
               sitting in his room

                                     kelvin
                              via intercom
                         snow  we need you up here

               snow doesnt reply

                                     kelvin
                         snow

               snow looks up  theres a strange look on his face

                                     kelvin
                         whats wrong with you  we need your 
                         help

                                     sartorius

                         im not snow

               this stops kelvin and sartorius  they look at each other 
               and then at the monitor

                                     snow
                         i got rid of him  i wanted to see 
                         if i wanted to be the only one  
                         i wanted to be snow

                                     sartorius

                                     kelvin
                         when did this happen

                                     snow

                         saw me with anyone  you shouldve 
                         noticed that  i miss him though

                                     kelvin
                         jesus

                         make it

                                     kelvin
                         maybe you can

                                     sartorius
                         you want it coming back with us

                                     snow
                         you go ahead  of what i remember 
                         about earth its all one thing 
                         now  everythings a blur  i like 
                         distinctions

               snow lies down on his bed  kelvin looks at sartorius

                                     sartorius
                         we do not have time to deal with 
                         this  get the diode sail into 
                         position and let me know when the 
                         bias drive and the induction ring 
                         are at zero point

               kelvin nods and obeys  he then takes one last look at the 
               monitor to see snow lying in bed  kelvin reaches over and 
               shuts the monitor off

                                                                    cut to

               ext  space

               silence

               the prometheus moves away from solaris

               closer on solaris

               after the ship has gone

               a soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet

               slowly inexorably this black spot begins to expand

               within a minute solaris has disappeared

                                                                    cut to

               kelvin back on earth  silent and still  and the rain 
               continues

               he watches the activity the cars buses and people moving 
               to and fro

                              beat
                         i have returned  finally

                         i work in the city now  after work 
                         i wander and lose myself  i am silent 
                         and attentive  i follow the current  
                         i make a conscious effort to smile 
                         nod stand and perform the millions 
                         of gestures that constitute life on

                         i will study these gestures until 
                         they become reflexes again  i will 
                         find new interests and occupations

               kelvin makes his way toward his cabin  as he nears his 
               labrador recognizes him and approaches

                         not give myself to anything or anyone 
                         because i am haunted by the idea 
                         that i remembered her wrong  that i 
                         shaded my memory of her to suit 
                         myself  that i was unfair to her 
                         and caused her destruction  what if 
                         i was wrong about everything

               kelvin is near the front door dog at his heel  he looks in 
               as he brings his key to the lock and his face freezes

               rheya

               is in the living room waiting for him

               she is sitting on the sofa looking toward the other side of 
               the room  sensing someone she turns to see kelvin and her 
               face melts into a smile

               kelvin

               opens the door  he cannot speak

               rheya

               rises and moves toward him

               they embrace

               he breathes her in  she squeezes him

               after a long beat

                                     kelvin
                         how can you be here

                         everything

               ext  cabin  day

               a tableau of the cabin  the dog is on the front step 
               seemingly content despite the light rain

               as fog drifts in we rise and soon the mist has nearly 
               obscured the house  the fog turns into clouds and we get 
               fleeting glimpses of the cabin as we move farther and farther 
               away

               we stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments until 
               gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the corners 
               of the frame  still there is a light rain sound

               these dark rounded edges penetrate further until they are 
               forming the shape of a circle

               the misty consistency begins to gain some color and body

               and we realize we are now looking at the surface of solaris

                                                                   fade out
