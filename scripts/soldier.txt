     babies blinking babies cooing babies chirping babies
     squalling

     its the squalling babies the ones with pinched faces and tiny
     bunched fists that seem to interest the two anonymous men in
     military uniforms  their anonymity is assured by the angles
     from which they are seen they are hands they are feet they are
     the backs of heads

     a lone nurse watches them grimly as they make their selections
     marking the cribs of the most active noisy babies with xs

      just as an aggressive fouryearold approaches a passive four
     yearold seated on the floor and kicks him

     its a harmless childs kick  but then as the date disappears
     he kicks the passive fouryearold again  and again

     the servomotor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall
     whines slightly as the camera pans to the record the action

     fourteenyearold todd is doing bench presses in shorts while all

     this a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold
     weather but the sixteenyearolds are superfit their faces
     hard and without expression their eyes as cold as snake eyes

     grass

     different sophisticated targets pop up urgently sometimes close 
     sometimes far some moving rapidly on tracks

                    new

     rubrick and sloan exchange a startled glance but mekum doesnt
     seem fazed as we

     a weapon firing  budda  budda  budda  the automatic weapon is
     being fired by the veteran soldier riley  hes blazing away at
     an elaborate electronic target a hundred yards away in the huge
     space

     todd is watching with the other veteran soldiers  theyre seated
     on the floor wearing drab fatigues directly across from the
     twenty new soldiers

     as todd glances at them the new soldiers look back unblinkingly
     the veterans in spite of their impassive expressions look very
     human compared to the new soldiers  their battle scars mark them
     as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectlymuscled young
     giants across from them

     the firing stops and riley his weapon empty leaps to his feet
     and salutes rubrick whos been watching the demonstration with
     the rest of the officers

                                   riley

     as riley joins the veterans squatting motionlessly rubrick
     glances at the shredded electronic target glances at his
     stopwatch then looks at mekum

     mekum smirks picks up the weapon disassembles it rapidly

                                   mekum
                    lets make it more difficult

     rubrick church and sloan exchange glances of disbelief as mekum
     scatters the disassembled parts onto the concrete floor with a
     loud clatter

     todd watches unblinking as mekum looks to the new soldiers

     a blond nordic giant is suddenly on his feet among the new
     soldiers  there is real dignity in his salute hes like a pro

                    the target from various evasive
                    positions in a thirtysecond period

     officers look at each other again in disbelief

     mekum punches his watch as caine 607 gracefully begins to pick up 
     pieces of weapon doing it rapidly yet without apparent haste

     todd is watching revealing nothing

     clack  ka shack  click  caine 607 slaps the weapon together 
     loading a magazine with a final ka shuck then he dives to the
     floor firing a rapid burst at the electronic target which blinks 
     wildly

     officers watch impressed

     caine 607 is firing from another position

     the target goes crazy

     caine 607 is rolling and firing at the same time

     the target goes wild

     mekums watch clicks off 27 seconds2829

     the firing stops

     todd stares impassively as caine 607 salutes  beside him riley 
     watches also

     theyre still in the giant warehouse in the gym section among all
     sorts of ominous exercise devices  the new soldiers and veterans
     are gathered in separate groups at attention their faces like
     stone

     todd is watching the big man handle the weight easily

     invisible through the curtains of rain

     rain slashes his face as todd runs his eyes staring vacantly

     separated by fifteen yards the two groups of soldiers the new
     and the veteran sit on the cold cement floor staring vacantly
     into space as they await orders  occasionally a veteran will rub
     his chin another will scratch his nose but nobody says
     anything and when their eyes accidentally meet they look away 
     deliberately expressionless  nobody flinches when a big door
     opens and pale light streams in

     breathing steadily raspily todd lopes through the rain
     something makes him glance back over his shoulder

     thirty yards back he sees a vague shape obscured by rain

     todd looks ahead again his face revealing nothing his legs 
     maintaining the same even pace running running running

     then he looks back again

     the vague shape is taking form a ghostly runner getting closer

     todd continues at the same even place  he doesnt look back
     again until he feels closeness  then he looks

     its melton only a few yards behind him running effortlessly
     keeping a steady pace thats faster than todds  the bigger man
     moves even with todd without even looking at him as though todd 
     werent there and then he moves ahead like a big machine
     inexorable

     as todd runs eyes straight ahead he can see melton becoming
     ghostly disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we

                    of course age is a factor but the

                    with the mind

     a shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off moves closer
     takes the form of a runner running  its todd still moving at
     the same pace his face like stone

     todd lopes into the big warehouse and breathing hard but evenly 
     comes to a halt in front of rubrick and salutes

     rafters sixty feet above grabs one and starts up it hand over
     hand

     mekum watches todd climb then looks at church who is looking at
     him expectantly

     mekum grins at church

     then mekum looks back at todd not hurrying

     todd is thirty feet up and climbing passing the eight inch
     circular platforms or footholds in the chain every ten feet

     melton takes a few easy strides gracefully catches a chain mid
     stride and smarts up climbing easily and twice as fast as todd

     church sloan and rubrick crane their necks as the two men
     struggle upward toward the rafters

     three quarters of the way up melton comes even with todd then
     passes him

     church is watching too and hes still not satisfied  his brow
     is knit somethings bothering him

     stonefaced melton is resting an a platform on the chain sixty
     feet up beneath the girders swaying gently

     his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a

     but he keeps falling the chain ripping flesh from his hand
     for twenty feet until

     he cant hold on any longer  todd plunges the last thirty feet
     to the floor landing with a terrible crunch right on top of
     romeros broken body below

     melton lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet
     landing gracefully on his feet in front of mekum and salutes

     tries to assuage him

     the new soldiers sit impassively the bleeding melton among them
     staring right at the veterans

     not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we

     a rage of flame  the mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow
     fury eight feet high

     two men burners in asbestos fire suits and helmets appear
     laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing  with
     effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly 
     consumed  slowly the burners turn and trudge back for another
     load as we reveal a refuse bin seven feet high looming in the 
     shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace  its 
     overflowing with junk barely distinguishable in the gloom

     the burners grab blindly and haul out the next object

     its romeros dead body  they haul it out of the bin and let it
     flop limply to the floor where romero stares sightlessly at
     nothing

     the burners stare at the body exchange a blank look through
     their visors shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward
     the flames

     int  refuse binfurnace roomclose by

     in the near darkness the faintest flickering light reveals two
     tangled bodies motionless in the confusion of refuse  but not
     quite motionless  a hand opens and closes  a bloody hand
     fingers twitch

     int  furnace room

     roaring flames as romeros body is tossed unceremoniously into the
     fire where the flames begin to consume it

     for half a second the burners watch romero melt into fire then
     they turn their backs and head back for another load

     int  refuse binfurnace room

     burners hands reach in and haul out another corpse goines
     dragging the body right over todds body

     as goines shoe drags over todds face todds eyes flicker
     stupidly

     then goines corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin

     todd blinks fighting for consciousness  where is he  he moves
     his head

     int  furnace room

     the burners silhouetted by flames feed goines body to the
     furnace

     close on the flames as goines body is consumed by raging
     flames

     angle on the burners trudging to the bin  they reach in blindly
     for whatevers next  tugging with effort they struggle the
     clumsy object over the rim and let it fall to the floor  its a 
     mattress

     communicating with a look the first burner drags the mattress
     toward the fire while the second burner reaches again into the
     bin

     the second burner frowns through the visor struggles with
     something frowns wrestles with it

     finally with great effort he pulls out a big carton that 
     immediately spills old magazines on him

     disgusted he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse
     littered floor toward the furnaces

     angle on his feet as the second burner struggles toward the
     fire stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable
     in the flickering firelight

     he passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it  the sign
     says nonflammable waste disposaland the trail of blood leads
     to that bin

     silence  a vast darkness with only a few tiny lights in the
     infinite depths

     a battered rusty spaceship glides slowly and silently into view
     this is a garbage ship and it looks it  awkward and slow and
     totally unglamorous it moves through space like a great clumsy
     church made of steel as we

                                                       cut to

     int  holdgarbage ship  day

     as the massive doors on the underside of the ship open light
     spills in and there is a huge roar as tons of debris including 
     massive pieces of machinery huge statues old vehicles and 
     numerous containers spill out through the open bays and tumble 
     downward  the one that says nonflammable waste on the side
     careens against the bulkhead with a thunderous sound then
     hurtles downward

     ext  junk mountainslandscape

     as debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge
     mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept
     terrain dimly lit by four pale suns the bays close and the
     rusty garbage ship glides away

     still the cascade of machines and other bulky junk thunders down
     the steep slopes shattering breaking into parts tumbling and
     tumbling settling here and there while a screaming wind very
     powerful picks off the lighter pieces and carries them off like
     snow blowing off a mountain

     the familiarlooking container somersaults halfway down the slope 
     where it bursts open spilling a confusion of junk

     above the container a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery
     and splits oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto
     the contents of the container sizzling and smoking on steel
     eating it like acid

     not far from a smoking piece of steel we find todds foot
     protruding from the junk heap  its motionless  acid drips and 
     hisses

     angle on todd sprawled inside the mountain of junk grimacing
     in pain as acid hits his exposed foot  trapped in the debris 
     battered and bloody and weak he struggles to rise fights the
     heavy objects pinning him fights to avoid the dripping acid  as
     the wind screams furiously he continues to struggle against the
     junk that pins him as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  inside and outside the mountain  day  a little later

     todds head caked with blood appears from the junk like a man
     looking out of a cave  wind seizes at his hair furiously

     he looks up sees four pale suns in the skyjust as a huge
     steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose
     boulder and todd has to duck hastily to avoid certain death

     as the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him wind plucks
     a twelvefoot ibeam from the slope next to him and whips it off
     in a frenzy

     holding on for dear life todd looks down at the ground four
     hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk
     shifting and skittering in the wind

     he notices something and reacts

     far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of linesand
     moving along one of the lines are four tiny figurestheycouldbe humansbut maybe not

     for a moment todd watches them

     then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk 
     inside the mountain and we

                                                       cut to

     ext  lower on junk mountain  day  minutes later

     far down the slope perhaps forty feet from the foot of the
     massive mountain todds head pokes out of the confusion of junk
     and he looks down at the figures below

     seen more closely the figures are more distinct but no less
     mysterious  heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur 
     their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape
     apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that
     stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like roads
     through the wind

     todd watches as one of the figures moves off the road  hes 
     trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles
     through the wind walking almost on all fours like an ape

     todd watches the figure moving among bits of junk until he
     locates something he wants picks it up and starts to struggle
     back toward the others dragging his burden after him

     todd is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging
     process by these strange unearthly figures as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  fading suns  dusk  later

     the four suns are changing color dimming in the sky as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  landscape and junk mountain  dusk

     tiny in the distance the four figures are moving together along
     a cable headed away from the junk mountain

     at ground level now todd is watching them crouched behind a
     massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of
     its great bulk

     peeking around the sheltering transformer he spots one of the
     taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of
     his mountain  the cable is twenty yards away in a canyon of
     junk and hell have to move across open space partially exposed
     to the wind in order to get to it

     he starts out from behind the transformer

     whoooooo  screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet
     his arms flailing  he comes down even further from the cable 
     struggling to keep on his feet  gritting his teeth he fights
     the wind struggles toward the cable

     suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time
     as it whistles close to his head

     todd drops to the ground and starts to crawl under the wind
     toward the taut cable and we

                                                       cut to

     ext  steel henge  dusk  later

     seen by todd the four tiny figures are far ahead disappearing
     in the distance and the dusk

     following them on a taut wire todd is passing through a barren 
     landscape punctuated by strange ruins great shapes of steel
     thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him
     vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must
     have crashed long ago

     the mountains of junk squat a mile behind him  hes come a long
     way its almost dark hes weak

     he hangs onto the wire walking with effort

     he can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire

     he notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right

     steel crosses  maybe a hundred of them  a cemetery

     just then the wind catches todd yanks him but he hangs onto
     the wire holding on desperately as the wind pulls at him and
     makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze

     then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire
     and get weakly to his feet  for a moment he looks like he might 
     collapse but he doesnt and we

                                                       cut to

     ext  landscape  night

     at night the four suns glow darkly like night lights

     todd is alone on the planet punished by the savage wind
     struggling along the wire shivering

     every stop is an effort but the eyes stare into the dark and
     they reveal no emotion not even when he suddenly tenses seeing 
     something ahead

     in the distance a faint light glows

     todd considers it as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  windowskylight  night  moments later

     the window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle embedded
     in a low mound of earth like a skylight  whatever is making
     the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only
     inches above the ground

     todd is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange
     window  he can see more of them glowing all around him as well
     as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind

     todd drops to his belly to keep under the wind  he crawls ten
     yards to the window and pears through it

     todds pov of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen
     through the thick scratched plexiglass window  the wild blurs of
     activity make no sense to him whatsoever nor do the very faint
     squeals of sound barely audible over the deafening roar of the
     wind

     what hes seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight
     between eight boys and girls ranging from four to ten years old 
     wearing cotton shifts dyed red blue or yellow theyre smacking
     each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a 
     dormitorystyle full of stacked bunks

     angle on todd prone on the roof mystified  hes never seen 
     anything like it  his greasecovered face barely reveals his 
     puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the
     wind

     the roaring wind that has dominated the environment since he first 
     arrived has diminished to a strong breeze

     todd tries sitting up  the breeze doesnt overpower him  he
     looks around

     the meaningless shrieks of the pillow fight though still muffled
     by heavy plexiglass are louder now but todds attention is on
     the other windowskylight that glows from this strange roof and
     on the strange sound thats coming to him borne on the breeze
     a musical sound

     struggling weakly to his feet todd staggers toward the next
     window  the music is louder as he approaches  its waltz music 
     played on an accordion

     todd drops to his knees and peers through the next window

     todds pov through the second window another mysterious
     vision  the color and movement are more subdued but todd is
     just as puzzled

     what hes seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an 
     overhead view of a man and a woman gliding across the floor
     moving as one first this way then that in time to a waltz  in
     the corner another person is making a strange movement that
     seems to initiate the music

     angle on todd flat on the roof  now that the weak breeze has
     given way to a deathly stillness the mysterious to him music
     is clearly audible as todd peers through the plexiglass at the
     warm scene below as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the
     pillow fights

     then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way
     past a smoking chimney toward the next window  halfway there he 
     freezeslistening

     a strange haunting whistling sound is coming from somewhere

     todd looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows
     theres nothing visible

     the mysterious sound is louder now drowning out the music
     ominously drowning out everything everything everything

     suddenly todd understands but hes too late

     rooooooooooaar  its the wind back with renewed fury more
     powerful than ever

     todd is hurtled into the air tossed head over heels by the wind
     struggling clutching at empty air in vain buffeted slammed to
     the ground lifted again before he can flatten himself tossed 
     violently somersaulted helplessly

     ext  inside a trench

     wham  todd is slammed face first to the ground  for a long
     moment hes motionless untouched by the howling wind for reasons
     that arent clear

     finally he rolls over weakly and looks up

     in the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of
     a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up protecting him
     from the wind howling overhead

     todd tries to get upbut the fall has injured his leg and he
     slumps to the floor of the threefootwide trench too weak and 
     injured even to crawl

     lying there barely conscious gasping for breath he suddenly
     sees something

     shoes  less than a foot from his bloody face

     he manages to lift his head a little and look up

     silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench
     wall are four childrenellen ten will six tommy five and 
     johnny eight

     barely conscious todd can just make out the astonishment on
     their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in
     amazement  then they go out of focus altogether as todd slumps
     unconscious and everything goes black black black and we

                                                       cut to

     int  meeting room  night

     voices confusion  about fifty people are jammed into the low
     ceilinged meeting room all of them talking at once  they are
     pioneers men and women of all ages and many races a hardy
     weatheredlooking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color

     their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines
     the skin burnished and even the younger ones have crows feet
     around the eyes from squinting

     as they chatter excitedly asking each other what happened who
     found him where and so on a sharpfaced fiftyish woman
     hawkins is standing behind a table in the front of the room
     calling for order

                                   hawkins
                    please  quiet please

     just as the hubbub finally dies down a grizzled pioneer named
     slade bellows loudly at her

                                   slade
                    just tell me one thing  how many of
                    them are there and are they armed

     hawkins stares slade down refusing to speak until she has real 
     silence  when she finally speaks her voice is calm and
     controlled

                                   hawkins
                    there in a manone man  he was
                    found in the trench by several
                    children

     a sudden murmur dies away quickly under hawkins hard stare

                                   hawkins
                    this man was not armed

     a murmur goes through the crowded room then a woman named elise
     speaks over the hum of voices

                                   elise
                    how could there only be one  how
                    could he get here

     hawkins glances toward mace a muscular bearded man about
     thirty

                                   mace
                    he was unconscious  we couldnt ask
                    him anything  he 

     a commotion in the back room causes mace to break off as jimmy
     pig a cleanshaven burlylooking pioneer in his thirties pushes
     his way in followed by four more pioneers  all five of then are 
     wearing their huge hooded parkas strange eskimotype wind
     goggles and carrying weapons

                                   jimmy pig
                    nothin out there  we couldnt see
                    nobody couldnt see no ship no
                    vehicles nothinplus the winds
                    up again real strong

     an excited hubbub  hawkins is trying to restore order when slade
     shouts over the commotion

                                   slade
                    theyre hiding i bet

     hawkins ignores him as she speaks with firm authority

                                   hawkins
                    lets everybody calm down right now
                         beat silence then
                    we have an injured man among us
                    one man  a traveler  unarmed
                         another pause then
                    we all want to do the decent thing
                    the decent thing is to help him
                    maces wife sandra is looking
                    after him now  now id like a vote
                    of support on this course of action
                    from all of you

     the way she says it you know shes used to getting her way and
     in fact pioneers are exchanging glances and nodding when slade
     shouts again

                                   slade
                    you keep an eye on him mace  you
                    watch him

                                                       cut to

     int  bedroom  night

     todd is on his back in a bed in a tiny earthwalled bedroom  he
     stares stupidly at the woman bending over him  she is sandra a
     woman of twentyfive who is attractive but not in a glamorous
     way  its a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and 
     dignity  shes wiping away blood and grease from todds face

     todds eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless

     he sees a window high on one wall

     he sees oldfashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned
     material hung here and there for decoration

     clothing hangs from pegs on the walls

     hedoesntsee the look in sandras eyes as she discovers the 
     savage scar on his forehead or the sergeants tattoo on his
     cheek  eyeing these telltale marks sandra pours liquid into a
     spoon and holds it to his lips

                                   sandra
                    want to try some more of this

     todd swallows weakly

     sandra smiles stands up moves toward the door

                                   sandra
                    you rest now  ill give you more
                    later

     todd watches her exit

     he hears her voice in the next rooma low murmur

     hes looking around again when a noise makes him look back toward
     the door

     a twoyearold is crawling into the room on hands and knees  the
     baby boy nathan stops just inside seeing todd in the bed

     nathan looks into todds eyes with childlike interest and wonder
     todd meets the look with those blank soldiers eyes

     int  living room

     a second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the
     macesandranathan living quarters  mace and sandra are deep in 
     conversation

                                   mace
                    what do you mean hes survived
                    worse  did he say something

                                   sandra
                    no but hes covered with old
                    wounds all sorts of scars  knife
                    scars bullet scars burns

                                   mace
                         worried
                    a soldier

                                   sandra
                    there are words on his shoulder

                                   mace
                    the tannhauser gate was a battle

     mace and sandra look into each others eyes very worried
     then

                                   sandra
                    well have to sleep on the floor

                                   mace
                         suddenly alarmed
                    wheres nathan

     mace is looking around  he spots the open door to the bedroom 
     hurries to it and disappears

     sandra starts after him looking worriedbut before she gets to
     the door mace reappears with nathan safely in his arms

                                   mace
                    if theres any danger to nathan 

                                   sandra
                         interrupting grimly
                    i wont permit danger to nathan

     mace and sandra lock eyes in firm understanding as we

                                                       cut to

     int  war ship  day

     explosion  screams  smoke  a siren  were in some kind of war
     ship in outer space during a battle

     the interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine cramped
     even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are
     awful as soldiers in bulky space suits stumble through thick
     smoke while a siren whoops urgently and wounded soldiers scream
     in agony

     whoooom  another explosion  screaming metal

     part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind
     ripping soldiers out of the hole into space

     we focus on a soldier in a space suit whos wedged himself behind
     a cannon  as we look closely at his visor we recognize todd
     whos firing back at the enemy while all around him soldiers are
     screaming and dying as we

                                                       cut to

     int  bedroom  morning

     sudden silence  todd blinks awake  he looks around

     its the same bedroom but morning light is streaming in the high 
     window

     he can hear soundslaughtercoming from beyond the door

     int  other room

     nathan is wobbling forward with wide eyes as mace holds one of
     his hands and sandra holds the other  theyre teaching the child
     to walk encouraging each step  but when they let go nathan
     totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass
     mace and sandra laugh making the whole thing a game and nathan 
     after a moment of confusion joins in the laughter  its a warm 
     moment until sandra sensing a presence turns toward the
     bedroom suddenly serious

     mace follows her look

     todd is standing in the doorway supporting himself on the door
     framehis soldiers eyes full of unspoken menace one leg
     heavily bandaged

                                   sandra
                         nervous
                    you must beyou must be feeling
                    better

     todd says nothing  his eyes flick to nathan

     mace is watching todd sharply

                                   mace
                    were teaching the boy to walk

                                   sandra
                         nervously filling silence
                    hes late learning  he was sick for
                    a long time

     todd says nothing  his eyes follow mace whos gone to the corner
     where hes seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon

     todd tenses  ready  dangerous

     as mace turns toward him mace doesnt notice the danger in
     todds eyes

                                   mace
                    i got something for you

     he innocently approaches with the metal rod

     super alert todd watches mace hold the rod out to him

                                   mace
                    here

     todd looks mistrustful

                                   mace
                    like this

     mace demonstrates using the rod like a cane

                                   mace
                    see

     expressionless watches mace use the cane

                                   mace
                    practice with it  in a day or two
                    maybe youll be strong enough to go
                    out to the garden with sandra

     mace never even realizes how much danger he was in

                                                       cut to

     int  other room  day  a little later

     todds heavy boots come close to nathan the cane clumps down
     just missing him

     nathan looks up with openmouthed innocence and childlike wonder
     at todd who looms past him walking very cautiously with the help
     of a cane

     todd looks down at nathan  their eyes meet for a moment  todd
     is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear

     sandra answers a knock at the door opens it revealing ellen
     the tenyearold in the doorway  behind her are johnny and
     will as well as several other children of various ages

                                   ellen
                    i came for nathan

     but ellens eyes are on todd and so are the others crowding
     behind her to peep over her shoulder  they all want to get a
     look at todd but when he looks in their direction they retreat 
     shyly

     sandra is wearing a parka too  she picks up nathan from where
     hes sitting near todds feet and carries him to the door giving
     him a kiss then handing him to ellen

     nathan starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as
     ellen hugs him and comforts him

     todd watches the drama as ellen and sandra comfort the child and 
     soothe his fears at being separated from his mother

     nothing shows in todds eyesbut affection seems to fascinate
     him

     as ellen and her cohorts hurry off with nathan they sneak over
     theshoulder glances at the strange monster todd

     just then mace dressed in a heavy parka also comes out of the 
     bedroom and heads for the door

                                   mace
                    lets go  come on sergeant

     mace is heading out the door as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  inside the trench  night  minutes later

     singlefile a dozen pioneers move along a trench as the wind
     screams overhead

     we discover the cane and boots of todd among them  the man in
     front of todd glances back at him occasionally curious while
     mace and sandra walk behind him

     as they pass huts there are windows high in one sloping wall of
     the trench  todd doesnt notice the distorted faces of the
     children peering out at him their noses pressed against the 
     plexiglass full of curiosity as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  a junction of trenches  day

     three trenches meet  some of the pioneers move off to the left
     some to the right  mace is going left but sandra guides todd
     toward the right with her

                                   sandra
                    this way

     mace gives her a wave  he waves at todd too  todd looks
     confused at the wave then he salutes

     mace is startled by that  he sort of grins as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  garden  day  later

     a nasty little snake a teninch viper slithers through the dirt 
     among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until

     squash  one neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel
     decapitates the viper

     sandra flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel 
     clean in the dirt as todd watches with those blank snake eyes of
     his

     theyre on all fours in a garden  the garden is simply a much
     wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated
     there are already neat rows of vegetables are growing  behind
     them kneeling pioneers are planting new seedlings and weeding
     around more mature plants

     sandra turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an
     offhand glance at the dead viper

                                   sandra
                    you have to watch out for them
                    they probably wouldnt kill someone
                    your size not if you were healthy
                    anyway  but theyd make you pretty
                    sick  someone smallerlike me or
                    a child

     her meaning clear sandra continues to demonstrate to todd how to 
     plant the seedling in the earth

                                   sandra
                    in a month this one will be as big
                    as those

     todd follows her look to the other side of the trench where the
     plants are already eighteen inches high

     other pioneers working on their hands and knees also are
     sneaking glances as todd among them a middleaged woman named
     judith and an older woman emma

     sandra frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects 
     another seedling from a tray and hands it to todd

                                   sandra
                    here  you try one

     todd looks at it  he doesnt exactly look scared but he handles
     it gingerly seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling  he 
     starts to plant it carefully as we

                                                       cut to

     int  dining commons  evening

     jabbering voices the click of utensils  heaping plates of food
     are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal
     style  johnny is kicking ellen under the table will flips a
     piece of food at tommy when his mother ilona isnt looking and
     the outspoken slade is lecturing a pioneer named chester

                    objective and nothing stops them but
                    killing them

                                   chester
                         a glance over his
                          shoulder
                    just one  to kill us all

     the conversation gets the attention of johnny and will who stop

     angle on the next table where todd wedged between sandra and
     mace is eating like a machine looking neither right nor left as 
     people jabber all around him

     angle on judith whispering to emma at a nearby table as she
     watches todd eat

                                   judith
                    you see how much hes eating

     angle on slade who turns now and boldly addresses todd across the
     gap between the tables

                                   slade
                    i dont see how you can not remember
                    how you got here sergeant

     theres a sudden hush in the noisy room broken only by a few
     urgent whispers and a cough

     todd looks up from his food and meets slades look

     sandra scowls at slade as slade persists

                                   slade
                    youre not a deserter are you
                    sergeant

     the silence is even more charged than before

     sandra looks alarmed  someone coughs  the tension is
     unbearable

                                   todd
                    no sir

     a sigh of relief from everybody  but slade presses on

                                   slade
                    then how come youre not with your
                    unit

                                   jimmy pig
                    oh come on slade let the man eat

                                   slade
                    its not an unreasonable question
                         to todd
                    how about it sergeant

     on todd actually struggling with the question
     remembering  suddenly he blurts

                                   todd

                                   mace
                    replaced

     todd hesitates for half a second before answering

     there are looks exchanged among the pioneers as we

     ext  garden  day

     a little seedling is fitted into the earth gently  todds strong 
     hands pat the earth around it

     todd reaches for another seedling  hes one of a group of ten
     pioneers all on their hands and knees all working intently 
     silently  they seem to have accepted him  nobody stares

     todd is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when
     something causes him to look up

     five enemy soldiers in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over
     him weapons pointed at him  all around them is a desert of sand
     stretching forever under a baking sun

     one of the soldiers kicks todd

     angle on emma judith and several other pioneer women exchanging
     nervous glances as they look back to where todds kneeling

     there are no soldiersbut somehow hes trampled several rows
     of seedlings

     todd looks toward them confused disoriented by his memory

     the women look away quickly frightened and we

     int  other room  night

     sandra is changing nathans diaper as she chatters her back to
     todd

                                   sandra
                    and it got worse and worse  my
                    father hadnt had any work in three
                    months andalsothere were other
                    thingsviolence  political
                    feelings  my father said hed heard
                    it was better in the trinity moons
                    a lot of other people must have had
                    the same idea because the ship was
                    jammed with peoplemostly
                    families  thats probably why it
                    broke down  overloaded

     across the room todd wearing a tshirt and baggy pants is
     sitting on a stool his face impassive as ever

     as sandra talks her back to him todds eyes are on the contours
     of her body against the shift shes wearing  its veryerotic

                                   sandra
                    even after they made the repairs it
                    barely got off the ground it was an
                    old converted mining transport a
                    piece of junk to start with  it
                    justdropped  maybe you saw
                    whats left of itout there in the
                    wind  a lot of people died  and we
                    couldnt make any radio contact
                    so we were stuck here  nobody was
                    happy about it  a few years later
                    when the dumpers started coming over
                    and dropping stuff people tried to
                    get their attention with explosions
                    and fires  but it didnt work
                    they must be unmannedor they just
                    dont care  maybe they think were
                    garbage too

     todds face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the
     shape of her bodyand she unaware continues to reminisce

                                   sandra
                    so there really wasnt any choice
                    people had to pull together and make
                    the best of it  we became a
                    community

     as sandra maneuvers nathan todd catches glimpses of her breasts 
     pushing against the material of the shift  she continues still
     not noticing where his attention is

                                   sandra
                    one good thingnobody bothers us
                    whod want to fight over a
                    godforsaken place like this

     a wry laugh  she turns to put nathan down on the floor and
     catches todds eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her
     breasts

     for a moment its awkwardshe looks at himthen she recovers

                                   sandra
                    i guess thats what you like  the
                    fighting i mean  the wars
                         unsure a question
                          really
                    you mustyoure a soldier

     todd doesnt answer as we

     int  corridor and meeting room  day

     the children are peeking around a doorway watching something in
     the meeting room

     hawkins coming along the dirtwalled corridor spots the
     children ahead

                                   hawkins
                    you children are supposed to be
                    doing lessons

     the children barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them
     she looks at what theyre looking at

     what theyre seeing through the doorway is todd shirtless doing
     an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises  his muscular body
     ripples revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks
     eloquently of the life hes ledgash marks long zippers of 
     stitches the puckered patches of burns

     hawkins watches for a long moment her eyes worried

     in the midst of a slow graceful movement todd suddenly whirls
     and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing
     speed and fury the terrible force contained in the movement all
     too obvious

     even as hawkins and the children gasp silently todd returns to
     the graceful almost balletic movement even spookier now that 
     preceded the deadly thrust

     the childrens eyes are like saucers their jaws agape

     hawkins shuddersand breaks the hypnotic spell speaking aloud
     to the children

     its dark the winds howling just above the trench walls as todd
     peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench

     todds pov through the bedroom window reveals a tender moment
     between mace and sandra as they enter the bedroom and kiss  a 
     flickering candle on a low table the only light exaggerates 
     their shadows

     angle on todd his face revealing no feelings as he turns away

     light spills from other windows some more brightly lit as todd 
     begins to jog along the trench gradually picking up speed until
     hes running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze
     of dark trenches

     as mace continues talking to todd he loads the pockets of his
     heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal

                         continuing

                    load up youll want the weight i
                    promise

     mace hands heavy hunks of metal to todd whos wearing a parka
     like maces  he pockets the metal obediently

     behind them a small crowd of pioneers are doing the same  jimmy
     pig slade chester red a woman named sally and several others
     in addition to the parkas they wear eskimostyle eyeprotectors
     and carry canteens tools and coils of rope attached to various

     carrying

                    have flares too  come on

     other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the
     surface above as mace urges todd to follow

     its very still no wind  the little group of pioneers is moving
     along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the
     wrecked spaceship  they are tiny figures in the vast landscape

     closer on todd and mace as they plod along in the line of
     pioneers  mace indicates the wreck off to the right

                                   mace
                    sandra said she told you how we
                    wound up here  our parents and so
                    on
                         turning left
                          indicating
                    over here we call these catcher
                    trenches

     todd follows his look to a long open trench leading apparently 
     nowhere

                                   mace
                         continuing
                    smaller stuff that blows across the
                    ground it falls in these trenches
                    it works sort of like a filter  we
                    go through the trenches sometimes
                    and get some good stuff

     as they pass close along the trench  todd looks in and observes
     the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts
     and assorted junk protruding

     mace chuckles at the sight

                                   mace
                    we try to work em when theyre dry
                    its lousy going in there when
                    theyre flooded  you can see

     a sudden shout heyyup  yo distracts them

     todd looks forward sees red pointing to a chunk of steel a
     hundred yards off the wire

     angle on jimmy pig already fastening his safety rope and a
     second rope to the wire then heading off toward the piece of
     steel trailing the two ropes

     angle on mace explaining the procedure to todd

                                   mace
                    whatever looks useful if we can get
                    a rope to it well go for it  but
                    you cant ever go further than your
                    safety line because itll come up on
                    you with sometimes maybe ten seconds
                    or even less

     todd is watching jimmy pig as he approaches the piece of steel
     and starts to attach his rope to it

                                   mace
                    like right now  you hear that

     todd listens

     nothing at firstthen a very faint whistling  the sound he
     heard that first night when he was on the settlement roof

                                   mace
                    its close when you hear that

     todd can see jimmy pig  hes attached the rope to the steel and
     he gives a signal

     as pioneers start to haul on the line pulling the steel toward
     them mace shouts at jimmy pig

                                   mace
                    shes gonna blow jimmy

     jimmy waves starts back toward them

     mace indicates for todd to help haul the steel and the two of
     them are just joining in the effort when

     whoooooooooo  the wind is sudden and ferocious  it staggers
     them

                                   mace
                    grab on sergeant

     todd follows maces example and like the others grabs the wire
     and hangs on as the wind screams and tears at them

     one of the pioneers chester shouts points

     they all see jimmy pig being blown faster than he can run his
     legs churning desperately to keep up with his windpropelled
     body  to no avail  hes suddenly airborne his legs still
     churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of
     his safety tether like a kite fifty feet in the air

     an eightypound steel barrel blows past tumbling in the wind
     bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles

     angle on the pioneers crouched low on their knees against the
     wind clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on jimmy
     pigs safety line  but the wind is too stronguntil suddenly
     todd is pulling and todds strength makes the difference
     slowly jimmy pig is pulled toward themand pioneers exchange
     amazed glances at todds strength

     as he pulls todd notices what the others dont

     angle on the rifle dropped by jimmy pig ten yards away

     angle on jimmy pig as hes hauled safely in to the group of
     pioneers who clap him on the back and hug him  chester is
     laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe
     and mimic jimmys desperate effort to outrun the force of the
     wind

                                   chester

     chester breaks off suddenly sober staring off and the others
     turn to see what hes looking at  everybody stops laughing

     angle on todd carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve
     the rifle  the wind is dropping off some enough to stand

     angle on mace and the other pioneers reacting with alarm at the
     sight of todd picking up the rifle

     angle on todd as he turns rifle in hand

     todds pov of the pioneers staring at him the wind diminishing 
     further

     angle on todd looking toward them  nothing shows on his face

     angle on slade looking sour  trouble  just what he expected

     angle on mace taking a deep breath smiling as he moves toward
     todd holding out his free hand for the rifle

                                   mace
                    uh thanks sergeant  thanks a
                    lot

     but mace breaks off realizing that todds attention is
     elsewhere

     todd is beyond mace toward the landscape

     mace and the other pioneers turn to see what todds looking at

     angle on the junk mountains in the distance several miles off 
     where hovering high above the junk mountains an ancient dumper
     ship issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the
     junk heaps far below  the faint thunder of the refuse tumbling
     onto the steep slopes is just audible over the sound of the wind

     close on todd as realizes how he got here

     angle on mace reacting to todds intense interest

                                   mace
                    dumpers  they come every twenty or
                    thirty days

     as todd turns and looks at mace mace puts out his hand again for
     the gun

     todd seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time
     unhesitatingly he hands the rifle to mace

     as macecasuallytakes the weapon the pioneers breathe a sigh of
     relief grinning again as the tension eases

     todd has turned his gaze back to the dumper ship fascinated  so 
     thats what they did to him

     just then jimmy pig claps todd heartily on the shoulder

                                   jimmy pig
                    thanks partner  these nogoods
                    woulda just let me blow away

     todd reacting to the smack on his shoulder looks at jimmy pig
     like what was that  are you hitting me

     but all the pioneers are gathering around todd in such a jovial
     manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isnt an
     attack

                                   mekum
                         interrupting
                    piece of cake guys  these are
                    totally remote totally uninhabited
                    territories  all you do is set
                    down send out a patrol purely as a
                    formality then have those veterans
                    of yours put up an atype unmanned
                    monitoring unit  you should be on
                    about number twentyfive by the time
                    i get back from my vacation

                                   church
                    what if we do run into people
                    say squatters or refugees

                                   mekum
                         a frown
                    well you sure as hell dont want to
                    get involved in evacuating people
                    and that sort of thing
                         then meaningfully
                    my advice would be toavoid
                    paperwork

                                   church
                    eliminate them you mean

                                   mekum
                    wellno ones out there but
                    officially these are hostile
                    zones  therefore youd be within
                    your rights to classify anyone as
                    hostile i think
                    but i repeat you should be worried
                    about boredom not action  any
                    other questions before i go

     church hesitates  sloan and rubrick look at him  then church
     blurts a question his voice breaking

                                   church
                    down thereis it snowing

                    christmas guys  see you when i get
                    back

     mekums image disappears and the video screen goes blank leaving
     a glum silence broken only by the drumming of the rain on the
     roof

     church moodily strolls toward his desk and his eyes go to the 
     photographs

     his wife and children smile back at him from the pictures

     just then sloan taps him and be turns to see her handing him a
     cup full of amber liquid

                                   sloan
                    merry christmas captain

     rubrick is pouring another glass from a bottle of scotch as the
     little tree winks on and off and we

                                                       cut to

     int  barracks  night

     silence  darkness  dim shapes in the darkness hard to
     distinguish

     rain beats on the roof monotonously relentlessly

     the room is alive with breathing

     then we hear a muffled whoop from outside

     the darkness is tense the breathing changes rhythm

     the rattle of the door breaks the quiet

     the door swings open a flashlight stabs the dark

     a woman giggles  sloan

     the flashlight beams and wavers in the darkness catching brief
     glimpses of the faces of the new soldiers  their eyes glitter in
     the lurching beam their faces are ghostly like vampires

     rubrick switches on a dim overhead lamp as he and sloan holding
     the flashlight and church stagger drunkenly into the bunkhouse 
     carrying a couple of halfempty bottles

                                   sloan
                    hi fellas  at ease

                                   rubrick
                    merry christmas everybody

     eyes riveted on the three officers the new soldiers are
     unresponsive to christmas cheer  in fact they look almost
     angry like big dangerous animals as the three officers stagger 
     stupidly down the row of bunks every eye following them

                                   church
                    we brought you a little christmas
                    tree

     church almost falls over as he places the tree on the floor

     as stone faces watch him without expression rubrick waves a
     couple of bottles

                                   rubrick
                    and some good cheer

     sloan giggling does a provocative bump and grind

                                   sloan
                    how about some christmas pussy
                    guys  anybody for a quick piece

     the new soldiers dont react  stone faces

                                   rubrick
                         smirking
                    thats conduct unbecoming sloan

                                   sloan
                    its christmas  havent you heard
                    of piece on earth  piece on
                    earth get it

                                   church
                         suddenly serious
                          sober
                    christ i wish we were on earth

     rubrick sets three bottles down and indicates them to the new
     soldiers

                                   rubrick
                    eat drink and be merry men  for
                    tomorrow you go on patrol in the 
                    hostile zone

     rubrick burps stupidly as the new soldiers stare back at him from 
     their bunks muscles bulging eyes glittering nothing but danger
     in their stone faces as we

     int  pioneer meeting room  night

     jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  in sharp
     contrast to the gloom of the soldier christmas the pioneers
     men women and children are singing and celebrating

     theres a sixfoot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift 
     decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping

     theres an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl

     angle on todd seated against a wall not far from the door  he
     stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him  what
     on earth is going on  what are they doing

     jimmy pig is marching around in a santa claus costume doling out
     presents to ellen will tommy johnny and other children

                                   jimmy pig
                    ho ho ho  ho ho ho

     passing todd jimmy pig acknowledges him with a wink and a
     special ho ho ho

     todds eyes give away his confusion  what the fuck is this
     jimmy pig in a fake beard and a fake stomach  this is the
     craziest shit todd has ever encountered

     angle on nathan a wrapped present in hand  he hasnt a clue
     what it is or what he should do with it

     laughing mace and sandra hover over him showing him how to pull
     the wrapping off  great idea  nathan likes pulling wrapping
     off  thats fun  sandra and mace watch joyfully as nathan tears
     at the wrapping enthusiastically

     angle on todd getting to his feet

     angle on nathan pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a
     pull toy a metal bird on crude wheels made of wire and junk

     mace takes the toy demonstrates pulling it  the wings flap as
     the wheels turn

     nathan reacts with delight and amazement  then grabs it

     a sudden screech

     angle on todd looking alarmed  hes on his way to the door but
     emma is charging at him shrieking

     not sure whether this is an attack or not todd watches the older
     woman scramble onto a stool next to him still shrieking giddily

     as todd eyes her and everybody else warily she gives him a
     peck on the cheek and points over head

     todd looks up sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it
     that says mistletoe

     means nothing to todd  theres a burst of applause as emma
     scrambles off the stool  somebody starts to sing god rest ye
     merry gentlemen

     a montage of faces  jimmy santa pig mace sandra red
     chester sally ellen hawkins even slade singing

     angle on the door  no sign of todd  gone

     ext  roof  night  minutes later

     a low wind moans and mingles with strains of oh holy night as
     todd bellies up to the skylight and peers down at the scene
     below in the meeting room

     todds pov through the skylight  the merriment has evolved into
     a more spiritual mood as the pioneers join in the solemn hymn

     but todd spots nathan trying to pull his pull toy along so the
     wings flap  nathan is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and
     starts to cry

     immediately sandra disengages from the adults and rushes to the 
     sobbing nathan and clutches him to her breast soothing himand
     mace joins her hovering over his son

     angle on todd watching  after a moment todd scrambles off the
     roof and drops into the adjoining trench while oh holy night
     continues to blend with the soughing wind

     ext  inside the trench

     lit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench todd starts

     hawkins is walking along the corridor outside the meeting room
     when she hears strange sounds  she approaches the door and looks
     in

     ellen and other children including nathan are playing
     childrens games on the floor paying no attention to the source
     of the strange noisesjohnny and will

     johnny and will are doing exercises obviously inspired by todds 
     martial calisthenics and including the sudden violent movements

     as the two boys make their ritual grunting noises hawklns frowns
     a worried frown and we

                                                       cut to

     ext  trench garden  day

     the seedlings have grown to twelveinch stalks  sandra is
     pulling some from the ground as todd imitates her  she shows him
     the fat edible root

                                   sandra
                    well eat these

     other pioneers are also harvesting with occasional glances at
     todd as we

     int  other room  day

     cleaning vegetables sandra is separating the roots shaking the
     dirt off cutting away the excess

     todd is carefully following her example cutting the stalks away
     with the knife

     nathan is tottering across the floor an a beginners wobbly legs

                                   sandra
                    it seemed like he was never going to

     whump  nathan falls on his ass

                                   sandra
                         a laugh
                    well not quite an expert

     todd watches sandra go to nathan and hug him affectionately

     turning back to the vegetables stone faced todd cuts his
     finger  blood flows  he ignores it continues working

     but sandra returning to the vegetables notices todds cut
     finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand

     todd looks startled is she takes his finger  then staunching
     the blood with the rag she looks him in the eye curious

                                   sandra

     question  seeing his difficulty sandra tries to help

                                   sandra
                    what do you think about

     no answer a stare

                                   sandra
                    do you think about food  or women
                    you must think about something

     todd gulps  his blank stare could pass for stupidity

                                   sandra
                    what about feelings then  you must
                    have feelings  you mustfeelsomething

     todd wets his lips  he seems about to answerand yet its
     difficult for him  he could kill a person easier

     on the floor nathan goos happily oblivious

                                   todd

                    you dontlook afraid  you look
                    fearless

     todd looks at her  this is incredibly difficult for him like 
     physical labor  he wets his lips and take a breath

     sandra is overwhelmed  she reaches for him hugs him to her
     breast like a little baby holding him

     but todd is as tense in her arms as steel  he cant relax  hes
     even trembling

     nathan on the floor looks up smiles innocently

     sandra lets go of todd and steps back looking at him her face
     troubled as we

                   i think hes in the meeting room

     jimmy pig nods takes the knitted scarf back from sandra as we

     ext  alleycity  night

     frantic civilians mostly women and children are illuminated by 
     flashes from rocket fire overhead as they scramble for cover
     amidst heavy crossfire from automatic weapons

     a terrified little girl separated from her family seeks shelter
     in a doorway when suddenly shes confronted by three soldiers in
     red uniforms looming over her

     looking up in abject horror she sees a red soldier casually pan
     his assault rifle pointing the muzzle right at her from only a
     foot away unmistakably flexing to fire

     blam  suddenly the red soldier is blown backwards violently
     shot in the chest

     angle on todd visored in a torn black uniform firing again

     blam  a second red soldier goes down

     click  todds weapon jams

     as the little girl amazed to be alive watches open mouthed
     todd swings his weapon like a club attacking the third red
     soldier before he can aim

     then she runs leaving todd savagely beating the third red
     soldier to death

     todd is delivering a final savage blow to the prone body when a 
     movement or shadow catches the corner of his eye and he whirls 
     savagely to defend himself from behind 

     int  meeting room  day

     whump  jimmy pig is slammed up against the wall of the meeting
     room todds big hand around his neck

     gurgling desperately his eyes popping out of his head jimmy pig
     stares helplessly into todds merciless soldier eyes and his
     stone face only inches away

     todd blinks  he sees hes got a terrified jimmy pig pinned to
     the wall his feet dangling two feet off the floor  slowly he
     lowers jimmy pig to the floor

     all jimmy pig can do is squeak desperately and point to the
     floor

                                   jimmy pig
                   scarf  scarf

     todd looks down  he sees a knit scarf lying on the floor  he
     doesnt understand  he looks up

     he sees jimmy pigs wife hawkins slade and several other
     pioneers standing in the doorway of the meeting room their
     stunned expressions indicating they just saw something
     horrifying

     todd stands there isolated barechested his huge muscles
     glistening with sweat decorated with terrible scars and
     mysterious tattoos as we

     int  bedroom  night

     mace and sandra are lying awake in the bed in darkness  for a
     long moment theyre both silent with the silence that comes in a
     heavy moment in a conversation  then mace speaks his eyes on
     the ceiling

                                   mace
                   theres going to be a meeting
                   people are upset about him

                                   sandra
                   hes not fully recovered

                                   mace
                   thats what scares people  he gets
                   stronger every day

     theyre both silent for a long moment  mace has something
     weighing on his mind that he hesitates to saybut finally he
     says it

                                   mace
                   ive caught himsneaking looks at

                                   sandra
                   i know

     a heavy silence then

                                   sandra
                   are you afraid of him mace

     mace stares at the ceiling and speaks with difficult honesty

                                   mace
                   yes
                         pauses then
                   god knows where hes beenor what
                   hes done

     another pause before

                                   mace
                   ive never been afraid of anyone
                   beforenot this way  i feel he
                   could break me in halfwith no
                   real effort and no realfeeling

                                   sandra
                   he told mehesafraid

                                   mace
                   maybe he is  it doesnt matter

     mace is staring grimly at the ceiling as we

                                                       cut to

     int  windowless cement room  day or night flashback

     silent and surreal the events of 1986 continue with the passive
     fouryearold sitting on the floor while the aggressive fouryear
     old looks down at him and other fouryearolds gather ominously

     its only now as he gets to his feet suddenly trading vicious
     blows with the aggressive fouryearold that werealizethat this
     passive boy is fouryearold todd  the boys dont fight like 
     children they dont quit or cry as the blood flows

     highlypolished shoes sharply creased trousers and eyes
     glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the
     faceless observers who make no move to interrupt the violence

     fouryearold todd his nose pouring blood exchanges savage
     hurtful blows with his opponent bloodying him viciously as
     we

                                                       cut to

     int  other room  day present

     eyes  the adult todd blinks away the memory stares straight
     ahead

     into nathans face only six inches from his own

     theyre all alone in the room  its very quiet

     nathan smiles a tentative smile raises a hand reaches out to
     touch todds face affectionately curiously testing their 
     friendship

     angle on todd his eyes  dangerous  he draws his face back
     enough to avoid being touched

     nathan looks unsure  hes used to affection  then he
     realizes it must be a game  he reaches out again

     again todd avoids the touchand as he does so something
     catches his eye

     todd sees a viper sliding across the floor toward nathan

     nathan doesnt see it hes still trying to figure out this game

     todd pulls off his boot and hands it to nathan

     nathan accepts it thinks its a gift  hes pleased  itsthatkind of game  he gives todd a friendly thanks for the boot
     smile

     todd points to the viper which is close to nathan now

     nathan looks at the viper  he doesnt understand what hes
     supposed to do

     todd makes a hitting motion with his hand

     the viper is close to nathan coiling

     nathan looks from the viper to todd

     todd indicates the viper with his eyes  his look is intense a 
     message in his eyes

     the viper is like a spring it strikes

     todds hand is like a blur almost invisible as he catches the
     snake and flips it a couple of feet

     nathan stares

     the angry viper spits and hisses and coils to strike again

     nathan looks at todd

     todd eyes the boot then indicates the viper with his eyes

     nathan frowns hes getting the idea

     the viper is about to strike again

     squash  a heavy boot comes down on the snake crushing it

     todd looks up to see mace standing on the snake reaching down
     for nathan  as mace hugs the boy protectively to his chest he
     glares down at todd with eyes blazing with fury

     todd meets the look without blinking  he never blinks

                                   sandra os
                   what happened

     todd turns to see sandra standing in the bedroom door her eyes
     almost as hard as todds as we

                                                       cut to

     int  meeting room  night

     todd stares impassively as hawkins addresses him

                                   hawkins
                   no one here has any animosity toward
                   you sergeant  none of us here is
                   your enemy

     todd is standing in front of the room full of grimfaced
     pioneers all looking at him  its like a court

     hawkins is flanked by mace and sandra

                                   hawkins
                   moreover we respect your qualities
                   we have no doubt that you are a
                   very very good soldier

     as she speaks todds blank stare considers the weathered faces
     of the pioneers facing him  he sees chester eva red with his
     wife jimmy pig and his wife slade and mrs slade judith emma
     sally  as hawkins continues todds sharp eyes pick out details
     he sees jimmy pig opening and closing his hands nervously he
     sees slade fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel  chester
     has a weapon too

                                   hawkins os
                   but because of your training i
                   dont think youll ever be able to
                   function in a group like this a
                   community of vulnerable people of
                   families of children where the
                   ability to fight is not the sole
                   purpose of existence

     the pioneers are nervous ready for trouble afraid todd might
     take this badly and fly off the handle

     as todds huge hand opensand closes their eyes are on it  he 
     could pick up the table and hurl it at them break men in half
     with his bare hands  his face is like stone his eyes like
     diamond chips as he glances toward sandra

     todd sees sandra is moved trying to suppress her emotions
     biting her lip as hawkins goes on

                                   hawkins
                   youre different from us sergeant
                   we dont hate you for that but we
                   have agreed that to try to include
                   you would pose an intolerable risk
                   to the community itself

                                   mace
                   well give you any tools you need
                   warm clothing a good knife boots

                                   sandra
                         emotionally
                   and if youre ever sickor you get
                   hurt

                                   mace
                   youre a friend sergeant  its
                   just

     mace doesnt finish  todds eyes glance again at the pioneers
     they too seem moved not so ready to shoot

     todd blinks  once  and we

                                                       cut to

     ext  inside the trench  morning wind

     todd is wrapped in a heavy parka his mouth wrapped with the
     scarf jimmy pig knit his eyes covered with eye protectors as
     mace hands him another sack in addition to the one already over
     his shoulder

                                   mace
                   if you need usyou can ask us for
                   help

     todd glances at the knot of pioneers gathered in the trench all
     eyes on him  sandra is among then with nathan in her arms  for
     just a second todds eyes go to the cheerful face of nathan then
     he turns to mace

     mace is startled to see todd pull the scarf from his mouth to
     speak  hes never spoken before unless spoken to

                                   todd
                   its not true
                         then with great effort
                   im not a good soldier

     then todd replaces the scarf over his mouth and starts to climb
     out of the trench into the wind as we

                                                       cut to

     ext  landscape and steel henge  day  later

     four suns glare down from the sky onto the vast windswept
     wasteland

     todd is a tiny dot in the vastness traveling like a bug along
     one of the long cables that stretches for miles and miles  hes
     out by the skeleton of the old ship as we

     a low slung armored vehicle on caterpillar treads rumbles over a
     steep rocky terrain faintly backlit by a cold sun that looms 
     enormously on the horizon while giving off only a faint glow

     hanging on to the outside of the insectlike scouting vehicle
     called a crawler are two nastylooking new soldiers in space
     suits designed for battle their heavy rocket rifles cradled and
     ready their visors blank and ominous

     int  crawler

     the husky sergeant caine 607 steers the vehicle and speaks into
     a radio mike at the same time

                                   caine 607
                   crawler crawler to daddy  no
                   hostiles

     the gunner beside him and the new soldiers in the back seat stare
     stoically out the windows as caine 607 replaces the mike

     int  cockpitdaddy

     rubrick is sitting at a console cluttered with coffee cups and
     halffinished cheeseburgers responding to the radio

     rubrick turns to church whos standing in the cramped cockpit
     staring out a window at the gloomy planet outside watching the 
     crawler creep over the terrain

     very very alone as we

     the fire is nothing but coals  todd sits stoically over the
     embers more alone than ever chewing on a piece of dried food
     part of his spartan meal

     as he chews he stares blankly at nothing until

     a single tear crawls down one cheek

     then another

     todd looks like a stone statue oozing tears  he reaches up and 
     touches the strange water with his finger then studies the
     finger as though a tear were the most remarkable thing hes ever 
     seen  he cannot remember anything like this he cannot remember
     ever having cried

     and suddenly without warning hes convulsed with tears heaving
     with sobs alone in the big pipe with the pitiful little fire
     bawling like a baby as we

     a viper writhes across the floor through the patterns of light 
     streaming through the window a sinister presence full of menace
     and evil designs

     the viper winds its way toward an object that will prove in a
     moment to be a corner of the bad

     smack  the viper doesnt make it  smack  another blow from
     maces heavy boot being swung by hand

     the viper coils and hisses angrily wounded and dangerous

     smack  the boot again

     nathan wields it awkwardly hitting bravely at the hissing viper

     smack  nathan hits again and

     mace rolls over in the bed

     mace lunges from the bed

     snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away

     mace is holding nathan staring down at the viper

     the viper has up the ghost lying on the floor

     their eyes meet and for a long moment they just look at each

     flat landscape several miles off

     a heavy barrel blows by then an old refrigerator tumbles past

     mace squints into the wind

     off to the right about a quarter mile away he can see a big piece

     toward a catcher trench

     hes teetering on the lip of the flooded trench about to fall
     in when todds strong arms grab him

     they look like a strange fourfooted beast as todd drags him
     through the wind in an awkward embrace toward the cable

     once mace has the cable in his hands he laughs and gasps

     the new soldier comes straight like some inexorable death
     machine lumbering awkwardly with his burden of weapons goggled
     and blank faced

     a pioneer is backing away ten yards in front of him firing
     wildly  pow  pow  pow

     the new soldier looks at one of his armorgloved hands opening
     the palm in front of his face  his hands been hit  he shakes
     it annoyed like it was a bee sting then he aims at the

     engulfs the helpless pioneer as we

     and fire a rifle and a pistol at a third soldier whos advancing 
     along the trench

     sally and red dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer
     named singh is crouched watching with alarm the third soldier 
     advancing unfazed

     exchanging a horrified glance they turn to retreat down the
     interior corridor but before they get two steps they freeze

     a soldier is in the corridor not looking at them but breaking
     down a door  they cant go that way

     trapped they turn to see the third soldier almost to the
     doorway his flame thrower aimed his finger on the trigger
     and

     a blur  something lands on the third soldier from above the
     trench and the third soldier falls over backwards slamming hard
     to the floor of the trench

     but hes a super soldier so that almost at the same time he hits
     the ground hes already lunging upward to regain his feet and
     fight except

     a knife blade rips across his throat opening it wide in one
     swift movement and

     the third soldiers head sags back because not even superman can
     fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi 
     goggles is

     todd looming over him with a bloody knife a face like stone and
     fierce soldiers eyes

     angle on the doorway where red sally and another pioneer peer 
     around the corner eyes wide with amazement at the sight of todd 
     kneeling over his victim

     angle on todd slipping the utility belt off the dead third
     soldier yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body stuffing
     a heavy pistol in his own waistband

     red approaches timidly

                                   red
                   you want help partner

     todd glances up at him and red sees todds eyes and red backs
     away quickly because

     todd looks badder even than the new soldiers

     turning back to the dead man todd goes for the last itemthe
     goggles  ripping them off he reveals

     a oneeyed soldier  the dead man staring up at him is melton

     for just a moment todd stares into the dead face revealing
     nothing of how he feels as we

     nathan is screaming in terror on the floor ignored as sandra and
     children haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of
     obstacles theyve placed in front of the door already  the
     stove everything is wedged against the door to the corridor

     as they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other 
     belongings the door quivers the heap of furniture shifts

     int  corridor

     the first soldier as big as an offensive tackle shoulders the
     door again and it gives

     int  room

     children scream as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards
     and the door opens part way revealing the first soldier

     sandra grabs nathan and hands him to one of the children

                                   sandra
                   into the bedroom all of you

     sandra picks up a stool to defend herself

     int  bedroom

     dashing into the bedroom the children are greeted with a
     terrifying sight  smash  soldier boots are kicking out the
     little window high in the wall smash smash smash and the
     window collapses a boot sticks through the opening

     int  other room

     unhurriedly the giant first soldier bulls through the furniture
     tossing the bed and table aside like sticks

     sandra smashes at him with the stool hitting him twice hurling
     it in his face

     the first soldier shakes off the blow as if hed been hit by a 
     feather  but shes got his attention  he turns his goggles at
     her starts to raise his weapon as

     sandra turns and disappears into the bedroom

     int  bedroom

     as sandra dashes into the bedroom in blind retreat she runs smack
     into the chest of another soldier

     helpless and horrified she looks right into a cruel stone face
     and goggled eyes and she gasps

                                   sandra
                   sergeant todd

     todd never takes his eyes off the door as he brushes her roughly
     aside with one hand while his other arm aims the heavy rocket
     gun right at the door and

     the first soldier comes into the doorway with his flame thrower
     raised to torch women and children and what he sees is todd
     looking right at him aiming the rocket gun and bawhoom the
     first soldier is blown clear back across the other room with a 
     shot right in the chest

     angle on sandra still on the floor where he knocked her
     watching todd exit the room weapon raised his utility belt
     dangling bandolier style across his chest

     he looks likeone of them  a soldier

     int  other room

     crossing the next room todd moves quickly to the door flattens
     and peers into the corridor

     he sees the second soldier heading toward him

     blam  blam  todd fires twice around the door and sees

     the second soldier staggering back hit a pistol from his
     hip

     dirt explodes around the door frame as todd ducks back  quick as
     a wink he yanks a grenade from his utility belt triggers it
     and flips it around the corner as crack  a shot rips at his arm

     bawhoom the grenade goes off and bleeding from his arm todd
     swings into the corridor and follows the grenade with three quick 
     rocket shots

     int  corridor

     keeping low todd charges his weapon pointed at the fallen
     second soldier

     the second soldier is sprawled bloodily in the corridor the
     walkietalkie on his chest squawking urgently

                                   walkietalkie vo
                   crawler one calling double mike
                   give me an okay double mike

     todd seizes the walkietalkie presses the transmit button and
     snarls a throaty animal growl into the mike

     caine 607 is sitting at the wheel of the motionless vehicle
     parked near the trench garden radio mike in hand when he hears
     the low animal snarl come across his speaker

     caine 607s robot face reveals nothing as he listens to another
     growl  wind howls outside

     then he flicks a switch on the dash and puts the mike to his
     mouth his face expressionless

     someone is dragging a corpse down the smoky lamplit corridor as 
     little nathan watches sandra tending to the bloody wounds of a
     pioneer lying on the floor  as the corpse is dragged past
     nathan the lifeless vacant eyes stare right at the
     uncomprehending little boy

     nathan sees the pioneers seven year old daughter angie sobbing
     uncontrollably at the sight of her fathers wounds  sandra is
     trying to help with the bandages and console angie at the same
     time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people groan
     and children cry out

     nathan doesnt understand it its confusing  men and women loom
     past him  he wobbles off down the corridor toddling away from
     the sounds of pain

     shuk  kashuk  strange sounds come from a doorway ahead the
     doorway to the meeting room  chak  klak  shik chik ka chik
     the sound of metal and metal metal parts clicking and sliding

     alone in the corridor nathan toddles innocently forward toward
     the sounds

     int  meeting room

     nathan wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there
     staring

     the burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room
     leaving a large open space where todd barechested a tourniquet
     on one arm is squatting on the floor skillfully reassembling a
     stripped rifle

     surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles 
     pistols ammo clips utility belts goggles torn armor vests
     boots grenades knives and flashlights he salvaged from the
     dead soldiers  todd looks up at nathan and their eyes meet

     nathan recognizes his friend tries a tentative little smile
     but todd just stares at him and the unformed smile fades from 
     nathans face  for a long moment they just look each other in
     the eyes very seriously

     sandra enters her dress covered with the wounded mans blood
     not noticing todd she rushes to nathan grabs him

                                   sandra
                   nathan thank god there you

     suddenly seeing todd she breaks off stares at him

     squatting on the floor surrounded by weapons todds eyes meet
     hers for a long momentthen he looks away goes back to
     assembling the weapons with quick sure movements almost as if he 
     wanted to avoid her eyes

     sandra wets her lips to speak hesitates then finally blurts out
     what she can hardly bear to ask

                                   sandra
                   did he find you

     no answer  todd finishes with the weapon starts checking the
     next one

                                   sandra

                   look for you  hefound you

     todd looks up at her and nods  their eyes lock

     todd nods turns back to his arsenal

     sandra stands there hugging nathan to her chest holding her
     tears in her lids quivering fighting to conquer her emotion
     after a long difficult moment she wins the battle with herself
     she looks numb stunned but shes not crying

     todd has begun to dress  he straps a sheath knife to one ankle
     pulls on boots  then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso 
     covering all the old scars the tattooed names of battles and
     the tourniquet on his arm

     staring at him with glazed eyes sandra notices a blotch of blood
     form on the jersey leaking through the tourniquet  she speaks 
     numbly

                                   sandra
                   your woundits still bleeding

     stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items todd glances at
     her with eyes that glitter dangerously

                   iliketo bleed sir

     sandra stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress pulling
     on a heavy armored vest

                                   sandra
                   it doesnthurt

     todd pulls on a second armored vast one that already has a
     ragged hole in it from a rocket

                                   todd
                   not enough sir

     sandra watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the
     corner and take a blackened stick from it watches him smear
     charcoal under his eyes

                                   sandra
                   how do you know theyll come back

     his voice is soft as silk but hard as steel  she looks into his
     eyes  does she detect a hint of approval of respect in those
     flat expressionless snake eyes

     they continue dressing obediently their eyes the sullen eyes of

     riley sees something reacts

     he sees seventeen new soldiers exiting the ship in the fringe of
     the worklights ominous death machines in their heavy gear and 
     goggles partly lost in shadows like some vision from hell

     riley stares at them at the men who carry the weapons he used to

     sally and red are guarding a door to the trench when a clanking
     noise in the corridor behind them makes them turn and look
     their jaws go slack with amazement

     clanking toward them is todd so armored and laden with fighting
     gear he looks almost like a medieval knight  he says nothing as
     he looms closer to then heading for the door  the two of then
     shrink hastily out of his way

     ext  inside trench

     stepping into the trench todd hears the wind scream overhead
     he approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and
     begins to pull himself up into the wind

     as he climbs the screaming wind changes pitch radically and by
     the time he bellies over the lip of the trench the wind is only
     a breeze

     getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying replaced
     by a terrible stillness

     as todd looks off into the darkness a voice calls to him from
     the trench behind biz

     todd looks at her for a long moment his face a mask before he
     nods almost imperceptibly  her eyes are full of tears

     todd looks into her eyes  it is impossible to tell if he knows
     that she cares about him and that she is blessing him

     after a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness

     littered across the terrain ahead of them

     water and littered with rusting junk

                         suddenly urgently
                   shhhhhhh

     sandra is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the 
     doorand sounds

     she puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering child hushes
     another

     a timber falls outside the door and sandra sees a shadowy shape
     enter the meeting room looming in the darkness

     frightened children hold their breath peer out fearfully

     crack  smash  the huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way 
     switches on a flashlight probes the darkness

     the light wipes the damaged room

     suddenly sandra gasps

                                   sandra
                   oh my god  its its you

     todd maneuvers the flashlight beam sees the frightened children

     caine 607 only six feet away hurls the door at him

     red shoves the door aside aims his gun up at caine 607 as the
     huge soldier looms over him

     before red can pull the trigger caine 607 snatches the rifle
     barrel and yanks the weapon out of reds hands

     red rolls scrambles to his feet

     and caine 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle 
     crushes his skull with three brutal blows

     int  room

     todds impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness
     he feels at whats happening to him  tommy is seated on his 
     shoulders hes got nathan in one arm and johnny is nervously
     looking up at him as he clutches at todds huge free hand and
     now a little girl sarah clutches at his combat pants as sandra 
     instructs her

                                   sandra
                   sarah you hang on to sergeant todd
                   no matter what happens

     clutching todds combat pants fiercely sarah looks up timidly at
     the big stonefaced man as sandra turns to ellen

                   clothing they can carry
                         turning to the

                   no but hes our friend  our good
                   friend  do you understand

     frightened faces look to the awkward killing machine

     todd looks like a statue decorated with children

     johnny is sobbing as he hangs onto todds giant hand obediently

                                   johnny
                   i want my father and my mother  can
                   he find where my father is  i want
                   him to find my father

                                   sandra
                   no  no he cant do that but 

     a scream  from the corridor

     sandra freezes  todd is alert tenseand covered with
     children

     sandra turns and runs for the door as todd starts to put the
     children down  but hes awkward slow not his usual graceful
     self trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables

     int  corridor

     bursting into the corridor sandra sees ellen racing toward her 
     weaving through broken beams screaming as caine 607 lumbers
     after her out of the shadows  caine 607 doesnt bother to avoid 
     obstacles shoving beams aside like twigs dragging his bad leg

                                   sandrasergeant toddellen dives into sandras arms and sandra turns only three steps
     ahead of caine 607 and rushes into the meeting room

     int  meeting room

     todd is just putting nathan gently on the floor when he sees
     caine 607 arrive in the doorway  for halt a second their eyes
     meet then 

     caine 607 advances on todd

     still encumbered by children clutching at him todd sees his
     weapons but cant get to them  then its too late

     the terrified children watch as the giant caine 607 clubs todd 
     mercilessly with the rifle butt then hurls him backwards like a
     rag doll

     horrified sandra sees todd slam into a wall slump to the floor

     dismissing todd caine 607 turns looms toward the children

                                   sandra
                   theyre just children

     caine 607 ignores her heads for ellen dragging his bad leg

     spotting todds weapons sandra snatches a heavy rocket rifle
     brings it up awkwardly points it fires

     and the kick from the heavy gun sends sandra sprawling back the
     weapon trembling from her hands

     but the whizzing rocket a near miss gets caine 607s attention
     he turns away from ellen toward sandra

     angle on todd rising to his knees blinking stupidly trying to
     focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead

     todds pov a vague unfocused image of sandra snatching a
     bayonet from todds gear on the floor and lunging courageously at 
     caine 607

     vaguely todd sees caine 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and
     grab her  as she beats at caine 607 bravely with her fists the
     big man slams her into a wall brutally  as she crumples he hits
     her again

     angle on todd struggling to his feet staggering as he shakes his
     head to clear it

     his eyes go to sandra slumped against the wall bloody

     terrified children look up at caine 607 as he towers over them 
     suddenly

     shtunk  a knife blade suddenly sticks in caine 607s neck

     caine 607 only flinches and as he yanks the knife from his
     neck by the handle he turns to see who threw the blade

     wham  todd slams into him tackling him driving his big
     shoulder deep into the new soldiers waist slamming the big man
     hard into a wall

     air goes out of caine 607 the knife drops from his hand

     but thats it for todds victory  sixfive twosixty caine 607
     is bigger and stronger than todd  his powerful arms rip todd off
     him like hes taking off a bandaid

     terrified wideeyed children watch todd hurled back across the
     room

     todd scrambles to his feet shakes his head clear

     here comes caine 607 dragging his bad leg

     todd attacks  combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a
     vicious kick

     but 607 counters expertly brushing aside the attack

     todd lunges again employing yet another skilled move

     smack  caine 607 outmaneuvers todd again punishing him
     brutally

     whack  wham  smash  crunch  this time todd jolts the bigger
     man with a terrible combination of moves smashing him in the
     adams apple kicking him in the knee driving an elbow into the
     jaw

     this time its caine 607 who has to back away to recover  and
     now he seems to reconsider todd revealing for the first time a 
     genuine respect

     as their eyes meet caine 607 seems to be saying all right then
     youre serious lets do it fella

     todd lunges

     smash  caine 607 creams him

     todd twists slams caine 607 back

     bash  a fist to the face

     ummmmmph  a knee in a groin

     slam  a head against a wall

     int  meeting room  night

     whump  todds bloodied head is slammed on the floor  his eyes
     are almost swollen shut as he looks up at caine 607 kneeling on
     top of him  both men are bloody and exhausted their breath
     coming in gasps but its caine 607 whos on top beating the
     last bit of resistance out of todd who struggles desperately one
     more timebefore he slumps unconscious

     horrified nathan sees caine 607 smash the unconscious todd with
     the last of his strength finishing him off  nathan cant
     stand it

     he toddles toward caine 607 whos still on all fours and
     attacks his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monsters
     bloody face

     the frightened children see caine 607 ignore nathans ineffectual
     blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet

     once standing he looks down at nathan beating at his knees  for
     a moment hes confused  whats this

     then he sees the frightened children and orients himself  when
     he looks down at nathan again tiny nathan is an enemy as good as 
     dead  one blow and

     but just then big hands close around caine 607s ankles tackling
     him  as the giant topples todd lets go of the ankles and crawls
     on top of the fallen man

     as caine 607 looks up into todds fierce face the fight goes out
     of his eyes  he knows hes beaten he knows todd will never
     quit  hes helpless as todd grips him in a terrible hold and as
     todd puts the pressure on caine 607 whispers

                                   caine 607
                   it hurts

                                   todd
                         sympathetic
                   i know

     snap  todd breaks caine 607s neck and watches the life go out
     of him

     in the sudden silence as todd panting stares at his defeated
     enemy he hears a voiceher voicevery weak

                                   sandra
                   sergeant

     todd turns and sees sandra slumped against the wall where caine
     607 threw her  theres a trickle of blood coming from a nostril
     more blood in her hair  her eyes dont look right

                                   sandra
                   nathan

     todd sees nathan looking at his mother with fear in his eyes 
     struggling to his feet todd picks up nathan and puts the boy
     down close to his mother

     sandra reaches out and takes nathans hand  she holds nathans
     hand toward todd

     todd looks confused

     there are tears in sandras eyes as she pushes nathans little
     hand into todds huge left paw

     todd looks down at the joined hands then he looks into sandras 
     flooded eyes

     does todd understand her gesture  his face is impassive  maybe
     he doesnt  just then a hand touches his shoulder

     todd turns to see johnny face him trembling but valiant to ask
     the question the others are fearful of asking

                                   johnny
                    ssirsir are you our friend
                         indicating sandra
                    shshe said you were our friend

     todd sees all the children looking at him their eyes big with
     hope and fear as we

                                                       cut to

     int  dining commons

     blackened with soot jimmy pig still has the axe in his hand as
     slade manages with a supreme effort to hold the door of the
     root cellar up enough to allow emma and judith to push the four
     children out of the cellar and then to scramble after them

     exhausted slade lets the door fall back picks up his rifle and
     turns toward the exit  and freezes  dumbfounded

     standing in the doorway is todd laden with children on his
     shoulders in his arms surrounding him clutching at his

     crude letters scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say love
     from daddy

     the heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor

                                   sloan os
                    well riley you wanted a weapon
                    right  now you got one  a real
                    biggee

     we see that riley and three other veterans  green chesley and 
     moore  are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the
     narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as sloan follows on
     their heels and church and rubrick fretting follow her

                                   rubrick
                    what goodll it do just setting it
                    outside  we dont know where the
                    enemy is

                    this is a very dirty bomb  that
                    wind will churn the radioactivity
                    around like soap in a washing
                    machine  this is gonna be one clean

     int  bowels of the ship  night

     the timer on the bomb clicks into action ticking off seconds and 
     blurring off the tenths

     angle on sloan punching a code into the device as she addresses
     the four veterans

                                   sloan
                    okay fellas take it about a
                    hundred yards then get back on the
                    doubleunless you wanna fry

     riley his face impassive opens a hatch revealing the darkness
     outside where the wind screams

     as rubrick and church watch the four vets stagger into the
     darkness with the bomb rubrick has to shout to church to be
     heard over the wind outside

                                   rubrick
                    thirty minutes is awful tight  we
                    have to launch and get clear of the
                    atmosphere

                                   church
                    its enough  if we leavemorethan
                    enough theenemymay get clear
                    somehow as well

     as sloan shuts the hatch she checks her watch

     ext  spaceshipdaddy

     carrying the heavy bomb in a sling riley chesley moore and
     green stagger past the worklights into the darkness while the
     wind rages around them  holding the sling onehanded green is 
     illuminating the ground ahead with a flashlight

     int  cockpitdaddy

     flick  flick  flick  flick  sloan is flicking switches as
     rubrick reads off a check list and she responds to each item on
     the list with roger

     church is punching buttons on the control console causing lights
     to light up reading port power cluster starboard power
     cluster vertical stabilizer unit and so on

     ext  terrain

     darkness  buffeted by the wind riley and his companions lower
     the bomb to the ground and release it gently  theyre just
     turning to go back fighting the wind when riley senses
     something  he takes the light from green and points it

     the four veterans axe astonished at what they see

     crawler one battered and motionless is abandoned only ten yards 
     away

     the flashlight beam probes the blown out windshield the scarred 
     chassis pans across the back seatand pans back urgently
     glimpsing tiny eyes

     the eyes disappear behind the back seat

     riley chesley green and moore exchange glances

     the light probes again this time revealing the frightened faces
     of children cowering in the back seat hiding from the wind

     suddenly riley whirls

     out of the darkness beside him todd looms

     riley looks into the face of a man he saw killed

     todd has a child in each arm and another hanging on to his leg
     for dear life  hes wearing the scarf jimmy pig gave him

     in the shadows behind todd jimmy pig slade emma judith and
     more children are watching anxiously

     rileys stone face comes as close to expression as it ever
     willastonishment

     the other veterans stare too amazed

     suddenly riley gives todd a smart military salute

     angle on jimmy pig and slade exchanging a look of wonder  whats 
     going on here  they havent a clue  and we

                                                       cut to

     int  cockpitdaddy  night

     the countdown clock is ticking away showing ten minutes as
     church rubrick and sloan complete their prelaunch prep

     church relaxes looks up at the clock satisfied

                    all right were go  im allowing
                    us three minutes to clear the
                    atmosphere and get out of range
                    that means we can wait seven more
                    minutes

                                   sloan
                    fuck em  lets just go

                                   rubrick
                    shes right  four more casualties
                    arent gonna mean anything to
                    anybody especially when theyre
                    already obsolete

     church considers for a moment then shrugs

                                   church
                    i guess they wouldnt want to get
                    old anyway
                         to sloan
                    go ahead lock the hatch
                         to rubrick
                    rube punch up the port power
                    cluster and 

                                   sloan
                         interrupting urgently
                    what was that

                                   church
                    huh  what was what

                                   sloan
                    sssshhhh  listen

     sloan is listening intensely

     all they hear is the hum of the air system and miscellaneous
     white noise

     church and rubrick exchange a glance and are about to speak when
     they all hear it

     a sound like a child crying somewhere in the ship

     all three of them stare at each other in utter amazement

                                   rubrick
                    it sounds

                                   sloan
                    like a kid

     just then they hear it again closer

     church frowns  what the fuck

                                                       cut to

     int  bunksdaddy  night  moments later

     emma judith slade and jimmy pig are settling most of the
     children in the cramped crew quarters pulling off hats and
     coats when a commotion causes them to look toward the open door
     to the corridor in time to see

     a glimpse of rubrick being shoved roughly along the corridor by
     moore his loud protests clearly audible

                                   rubrick
                    are you crazy  you cant do this
                    soldier  youre going to be in
                    trouble

     then as rubrick is pushed out of view church appears indignant
     and panicky as chesley hustles him past

                                   church
                    im your superiorofficer dont youunderstandthat

     angle on the pioneers exchanging glances

     int  corridordaddy

     as chesley shoves him along church continues to protest

                                   church

                    you adirectorder tototo

     church breaks off suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him

     here comes todd laden with more children the tattoo on his
     cheek clearly visible  his eyes meet churchs

                    it  you  how  how

     weak at the knees church is still stammering as chesley shoves
     him ahead

     and then sloan in the grip of green is hustled by  she looks
     wideeyed at todd and the children

                                   sloan
                    sergeant todd

     int  bowels of the ship  night  seconds later

     rubrick church and sloan are still protesting as the veterans
     hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch

                                   rubrick
                    listen you dont understand  that

                    no  no  no

     rubrick is shoved out the door into the night

     ext  spaceshipdaddy  night

     rubrick desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage
     wind tears at himbut he cant hold on

     as sloan and church are shoved out the hatch they see rubrick
     blown off into the night screaming

                                   church
                    down  lie down  flat

     and church dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him

     sloan does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them 
     shutting them out of the ship

                                   sloan
                    no  no  no  please  no

     int  cockpitdaddy  night

     the countdown clock shows four minutes and twenty seconds as it
     clicks off the seconds

     their soldier faces inscrutable todd and rubrick consider the
     various lights winking on the control panel

     riley points to a row of switches and looks at todd  their eyes
     meet  todd considers the switches then nods

     riley throws the switches  a row of red lights goes on and the
     ship seems to hum with life

     still communicating wordlessly todd points to another switch
     riley throws it

     ext  spaceshipdaddy

     blast off  big engines belch fire illuminating the bleak
     landscape as the ship rises into the night

     brightly lit by the ignition sloan still on her belly sees the
     ship taking off

                                   sloan
                    oh my god  oh my god

                    there it is  i see it

     the bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of
     the takeoff

     church bumps madly along the ground on his belly

     ext  spaceshipdaddy

     the naf ship daddy climbs off into space getting smaller and
     smaller the light from the takeoff diminishing

     ext  the bombterrain

     the countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying
     light  it reads twenty seconds

                                   church vo
                    twenty seconds  hurry

     church and sloan are hunched desperately over the bomb in near
     darkness the wind tearing at them  sloan tries to punch a code
     into the keys

                                   sloan
                    oh my god i cant remember if its

     bahwhoooooooooooooooom  everything is dazzling blinding light

     int  cockpitdaddy

     white light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as todd and 
     riley stare at the video monitor where mekums video image is
     babbling frantically

                                   mekumvideo image

                    right now  do you understand me
                    right now

     riley turns to todd looking a question at him  todd meets his
     look and no words are necessary

     riley reaches for the control switch as mekum continues babbling

                                   mekumvideo image
                    this is important for all of us for

                    that was the boss huh

     todd and riley turn to see slade in the entrance to the cockpit 
     addressing todd and the veterans collectively

                                   slade
                    well then i guess you fellas are
                    all right  i guess i misjudged you

                    now till it goes otherwise you got
                    my sincere approval and support

     with that slade turns and exits

     todd looks at riley riley looks at todd  what the fuck was
     that

     int  corridordaddy  night

     nathan wobbles along an empty corridor stumbles catches himself
     on a wall keeps going

     he passes a doorway peers in sees two soldiers working at a
     console like robots  they dont look up

     nathan keeps going toddling toward a hatchway

     int  cockpitdaddy

     entering nathan moves among the legs of big men veterans
     nathan keeps going

     then backing against a wall he looks up and veterans loom past
     him with blank faces  he is alone again

     nathan totters onward

     close angle on charts the same ones church had on christmas eve 
     showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space

     todd and riley are poring over them their eyes considering dot
     after dot  finally todd points to a dot and looks a question at 
     riley

     riley considers the dot for a long momentthen he looks todd in
     the eye

                                   riley
                    cold

     todd looks back at the dot considers it looks back at riley

                                   todd
                    air

     riley nods a yes

     todd is thoughtfulfinally asks the next question

                                   todd
                    safe

                                   riley
                         nodding yes
                    but very cold

     todd considers the dot on the map again then looks at riley

                                   todd
                    that one

                                   riley
                    aye aye sir

     riley turns toward a console but something makes him look down
     toward his feat  then he looks back at todd

     todd follows the look

     tiny nathan is looking up at todd whos towering over him

     todd looks down without expression the scarf from jimmy pig
     still wrapped around his neck

     nathan puts his arms out to be picked up

     todd considers the outstretched arms

     riley looks from todd to nathan and back to todd  whats this

     todd hesitates a half second more then leans down and picks
     nathan up in his arms lifting the boy to his chest

     riley looks on  never seen anything like it

     nathan is close to todds face looking right into it trying a
     little smile a nervous one looking for a response

     todd hesitates takes a breath moves the muscles of his face

     all he can produce is an awkward grimace the distortion of a
     smile almost comical

     nathan reads the intention successfully  his face collapses into
     a huge friendly grin

     todd tries again making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince

     riley watches  totally amazed

     todd turns takes nathan to a porthole puts his face up to it

     nathan stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars
     a sky full of hope

     as nathan looks out todd works his face again trying for a
     smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight

     nathan looks at the stars outside todd looks with him and
     suddenly todds face relaxes into an awkward grin almost by
     accident

     riley watches the two of them for a moment confounded by what
     hes seeing  then he turns to the console and

                      the closing credits rollthe end
