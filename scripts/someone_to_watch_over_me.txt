space edged by darkness every reason to be pleased

close shut pounds the button again

that emerges from the darkness around her her
vulnerability penetrates to the very core

returns it in spite of herself disarmed by his frankness

throwing in everything he can find tuna fish chopped
pickles mustard his kid tommy in evidence in the
bg on a skateboard whizzing through the kitchen even
riding it down the stairs

mike moves to a cabinet  and his feet go out from under
him  hes slipped on a skateboard  barely catching
himself in time

                  yelling
          tommy  goddamnit  get these
          skateboards off the goddamn kitchen
          floor

tommy whizzes through expertly picking it up on the
move mike taking a futile swipe at him

tommy goes whizzing on out again  ellie comes in loaded
up with the groceries  puts them down giving mike a
kiss

int  the reception  same  night

mike and claire caught in a crush of people jamming the
entrance way  their bodies coming into close contact so
close that mike is forced into an awkward posture in order
to stay close to her one arm up in the air uncomfortable
about taking her arm

                         claire
          you can touch me i wont bite

                         mike

gives her momentary pause but she dismisses it looking
for her purse  realizing she left it on the sink 
opening her stall door and heading out

she barely hears the click of the bolt sliding behind
her  and looks up into the mirror seeing venza appear
behind her  she spins  but doesnt have time to cry

makes it just by staying immobile for too long  she
smiles and takes off her coat holding it out to him  and
in the moment of exchange is the return to reality

int  milton gregory  banquet hall  evening

overhead chandeliers gleam  a small orchestra comprised
of students of the school plays a variety of tunes
mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers carved gilt and
candlelight

gloved service personnel wait to be of service at the
sides  the room is quite large yet intimate  the tables
set perfectly  guests continue to move toward their
places engaged in animated chatter

another angle  claire moving through the crowd
plainclothesmen flanking her as anonymously as possible
koontz among them her eyes anxious scanning the crowd

shes spotted by the principal of the school giddings
who approaches surprised to see her

                         giddings
          hello claire  how extraordinary
          that you came

                         claire
          it was something my father always
          liked me to do

          honored

                         claire
                  understands gamely
          just putting in an appearance then

she glances around her escorts mistaking it for
anxiety one of them taking her arm and escorting her in

int  the banquet room  later

speeches droning on  camera finding claire at a round
dinner table with others who think theyre engaging her
in conversation but her thoughts are elsewhere her eyes
continually glancing toward the doors  both hoping and
fearing

                                            dissolve to

int  the banquet room  later

the speeches have long since ended people dancing slow
dances to the live orchestra  camera panning to claire
sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated
table having lost hope feeling utterly alone  her chin
is resting in her hand her eyes fixed sadly on her wine
glass  plainclothesmen situated around her study her
dispassionately

close on her face  expressionless  but it slowly gains
animation as she realizes the music has changed made a
segue to something new  its someone to watch over me

she looks up  to see mike his approach from the
bandstand indicating that the change of music was his
doing

her face breaks into the most enormous and grateful
grin

close on mike  returning the smile as he comes toward

                         koontz
                  as he passes
          dont do it man  i love ya but
          youre out of your mind

uncaring mike moves to claire

angle on both  gazing at each other

                         claire
                  overwhelmed
          what a memory

          do you dance

                         claire

          pretty bad

          lets do it

they take to the floor she moving into his arms  she
puts her head on his shoulder then draws back to look at
him studying his face with the hunger of a woman who
knows it might be for the last time

                         mike
          they guys treatin you all right

                         claire
                  too emotional to

the words

          id miss my life

                         claire

she rests her head on his shoulders again they continue
to dance

                         mike
          how long you going away for

                         claire

                  choked up
          yeah

he holds her tight  his eyes emotional as they roam the
room 

but his expression changes as he spots something at a far
end of the room  near the rear doors

its a plainclothesmen headed purposefully toward koontz
conferring with him  both men looking to mike a sense
of bewilderment in their eyes

angle on mike  stopping  as koontz heads quickly

heads toward down a narrow hallway  he falters almost

roll of the skateboard under his foot  hes sliding it
into the middle of the doorway

steps into the kitchen doorway  he tries the light

mike yanks tommy under the table taking his place in the
chair the cocked gun presses up against mikes temple

angle on ellie  her widened eyes continuing to indicate
beneath the table

close on tommy on his knees his hands tied behind his
back emitting a whimper of terror

                         ellie
          be careful tommy

he looks up  spotting her gun where shed hidden it for
safekeeping taped securely just over his head

the front door opens  with a slow creak  the figure of
claire her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from
outside seen standing in the front hallway

                         mike
                  frantic
          claire  its dark  watch your
          step  come slowly

angle on tommy  trying desperately to get his hands tied
behind his back within reach of the gun taped over his
head  its impossible

close on mike  eyes darting to ellie  as the figure
slowly approaches down the darkened hall his hand
lowering beneath his knees within reach of tommy under
the table

angle on tommy  in a near headstand his small hands
managing to touch the tape his fingernails futilely
attempting to dig beneath it  as the footsteps continue
to approach down the darkened hall

angle on the figure  almost at the kitchen door  about
to step into the light

                         mike
          watch your step

                         venza
                  rising
          what the fuck you doin

tommys hands are on the gun

                         mike
          theres a skateboard in the door

with a sudden sound of tape ripping from under the
table  all hell breaks loose  tommy rolls thrusting the
gun into mikes hand as the figure at the door kicks the
skateboard sending it zooming into the room  venza leaps
aside and fires the figure at the door opening fire in
return  mike leaps for ellie knocking her off her chair
rolling fast as the entire kitchen erupts in gunfire

angle on ellie  throwing herself over tommy bullets
pinging around mike as he rolls returning the fire
the pitchblack kitchen shudders with bangs and flashes
like the fourth of july mixed with the whine of bullets
hitting pots and pans and the sight of bodies hurtling
through the dark

the figure at the door is firing with both hands
scoring a hit on venzas accomplice who goes down
wounded his gun clattering to the floor  he reaches for
it but ellie gets there first grabbing it with her two
hands tied in front of her

                         ellie
                  to tommy
          stay down

the accomplice is staggering upward as ellie gets to her
feet squaring off in police stance  and fires catching
him square between the shoulder blades he spins crashing
backwards through the glass door  swishpan to venza
trying to get out the kitchen window

                         mike
          turn around fuck

he does blasted by mike and the figure in the door
simultaneously  he falls out the window but still has
life in him staggering to his feet and hit by spotlights
from the cars outside  in a sudden barrage hes hit by
crossfire spinning lurching  finally going down

and then all is quiet

inside the kitchen  all sound and movement has suddenly
ceased everyone is a state of shock

                         ellie
                  desperate
          tommy

                         tommy

          ellie

                         ellie
          im all right

the overhead light is snapped on by the figure in the
doorway  revealing it to be koontz  in claires dress
guns in both hands still smoking

                         koontz
                  emphatic
          fuckin miracle man

in the background distant sirens are heard heading toward
the swat squad  camera moving across the faces of ellie
tommy mike and koontz all holding in place
listening to them come

                         koontz
                  re the sirens
          told you theyd be here in a few
          minutes

the grim humor of it is registered in silence  mike picks
up venzas hunting knife from the floor cutting through
the ropes that bind tommys and ellies hands she pulls
tommy to her in a tearful embrace shielding his face
from the ghastly sight of the man lying dead on the
floor

other people are moving inward claire among them clad in
an oversized police overcoat  looking frail and
frightened shuddering with relief when she sees that all
are safe  but there is no mistaking the presence of
something else in her eyes

close on claires face  gazing at mike his family
wrapped in his protective embrace  he looks up meeting
her eyes

                         claire
          everyones all right

                         mike

long angle on the room  dimly illuminated by the single
light shed from the opened refrigerator door as people
begin to move  awakening to life and its necessary
details in the aftermath of the crisis

ext  the house  same

revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene a small
gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes
ambulances pulling slowly silently away

camera pans to two figures alone beside a squad car in
the distant shadows  its claire still clad in the
police overcoat and mike  they are together but
separate maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye

closer angle on them  not knowing quite what to say

                         mike
          so

                         claire

                         claire
          i think its probably still a good
          idea

close on mike  getting her message

                         mike
          yeah

                         claire

her eyes are glistening she gives him a bracing smile
but he cant quiet manage it

                         claire
                  barely able to
                   speak
          say goodbye

he struggles with it unable

                         mike

                         claire

                         mike
                  thick voiced
          you take care

mike turns  camera moving with him as he walks slowly
away  finding himself on a collision course with garber
they meet spending a long moment in noncommunicative
greeting

                         mike
                  finally
          what do you think

          it

mike absorbs it looking up to see ellie and tommy beside
a squad car a distance away  girding himself he heads
toward

angle on ellie and tommy  as he approaches and stands
beside them  not much to say  finally he reaches out and
tousles tommys hair

                         mike
          good police work kiddo

he catches ellies eye both assessing each other

                         ellie
                  re tommy
          he doesnt want to sleep here

angle on all  finding each others eyes

                         mike
          lets find some place to start over

mike puts an arm around tommy  and the camera begins a
long pullback as ellie moves to his side and the keegan
family begins to move away  we see claire being helped
into a squad car turning to look back at them as it pulls
away  cars revving up and pulling out in all
directions

from a distance we hear mikes voice

                         mike vo
                  to ellie
          what this crap about singing
