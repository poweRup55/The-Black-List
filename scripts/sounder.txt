mixture of redbone hound and bulldog with great square jaws

moving until they come upon a quiet river stream

about in disappointment sounder scratches the earth  nathan looks out into 
the darkness with a nagging expression on his face

				nathan lee
		here put my jacket over you

nathan takes his jacket off and drapes it over the boys frame as sounder 
begins to scratch and whine with intensity he moves to stand over the dog

				nathan lee
		you all right boy

suddenly sounders voice lets out and he breaks away in a burst of speed 
nathan and david react quickly and take up the chase behind him

titles begin again

as sounder makes his way through the woods  nathan and david rush behind 
him following the great unique sound of the dogs voice it is a sound that 
bounces  soulful louder and clearer than any purebred redbone it is 
spaced with precision bouncing from slope to slope like a rubber ball 
filling up the night with music as though the branches of all the trees were 
being pulled across silver strings

ext the base of the tree where the possum has taken refuge  night 

sounder arrives and makes a leap to climb the tree as nathan and david rush 
on to the scene nathan looks up and points to the spot where the possum is 
he puts his rifle down near him and david assists him in the shaking of the 
tree as sounder makes his leaps upward to the rhythm of the sound coming from 
his voice the possum gives way to the force and falls to the ground sounder 
charges for the animal  nathan quickly picks up his rifle and aims for the 
animal he fires into blank darkness and misses the possum recovers from the 
fall and scampers into thick brushland with sounder in close pursuit

ext the area of the thick brushland  night 

sounder cannot overcome the briar thickness of the brushland  but the 
possum with his smaller size manages to elude the dog

ext the edges of the brushland area  night 

sounder comes out of the brush area whining in frustration as nathan and 
david approach him nathan immediately realizes that the possum has gotten 
away

hands on the boys shoulders

				nathan lee

to a pathway

shed nathan hangs the burlap sack on one of the wall nails and places the 
rifle down on the table  david does likewise with the lantern

they all stop  and can see the shadowy figures of two men standing in 
their yard and a pickup truck parked off the road toward the other side of 
the cabin

				david lee 
		who is they 

				rebecca 
		children come here

the children move back  nathan lee looks behind himself and across the 
fields as if he would like to make a dash for it  but rebeccas eyes follow 
every physical and mental motion he makes

				nathan lee 
		we better see who they is

they begin to move slowly toward the house with deliberate caution with the 
two men becoming more visible identifiable with their shotguns dropped to 
their sides they move into the yard and stop about twelve feet from the two 
men

ext the front yard  day

sheriff young steps out of the front door of their house the two groups do 
not speak for a moment  they merely stare at each other  the morgan 
family with inquiring and fretful eyes

				sheriff young 
		we been in your house nathan

nathan and rebecca look to each other with knowing glances
 
				sheriff young 
		we found what we was lookin for

he moves away from the door and stops at the edge of the porch 

				sheriff young 
		you took some food and stuff from the james 
		smoke house last night so me and my deputies 
		here gon hafta take you to the county court 
		house

sheriff young nor the deputies make a physical move toward nathan there is a 
long moment of tense silence for a second nathan seems to want to make a 
desperate break and run but rebecca holds him by the arm with all the 
strength her hand can afford

				sheriff young 
		okay boys

the deputies move in and take nathan by the arms from both sides and put 
handcuffs on him

				earl
		what they doin mama 

				rebecca 
		be quiet son

earl falls into his mothers embrace  suddenly sounders voice rips into 
the atmosphere and for the first time the deputies draw their shotguns to 
waist level 

				sheriff young 
		shut that mongrel up

david runs to sounder and tempers him as the sound fades to a growl  the 
dog frantically scratches the earth as david holds on to him 

				sheriff young 
		git that truck up close here and quick

one of the deputies moves out in a hurry to fetch the vehicle as sheriff 
young moves down the steps into the yard and looks to david holding sounder

				sheriff young 
		now boy if you love that dog you better keep 
		a good strong hold on him

the sound of the truck is heard moving up close to the house and stopping 
rebecca moves away from josie mae and earl and stops directly in the face of 
sheriff young

				rebecca 
		you been knowin nathan for a long time 
		sheriff young and you know what kind of man he 
		is and you know the trouble we face in these 
		offseasons

the sheriff cannot look her in the face  he walks away from her and 
everyone and just looks out over the fields  then finally he motions with 
his hand to the two deputies standing at nathans side to put him into the 
truck they lift him up into the truck as josie mae standing up on the porch

entrance with two guards just inside the gate they move off the road down a 
sloped hill just beneath the entrance of the camp they lie down on the grass 
to sleep

ext the slope off the road  day 

it is early morning as david is awakened by the voices of the guards and the 
motor of a truck

the truck carefully us the guard makes his check

to see that his father is not on it then where is he the boy thinks to 
himself as he sees the truck move away up the road the truck is moving no 
more than about twenty miles an hour  david lee makes a decision and takes 
off after the truck running

where the convicts are moving along the road outside of the fence

distances of about three hundred feet in a half moon formation spread out

david hurriedly gets back across the road with sounder and watches the guard 
as he moves the men back david looks on in frustration trying to figure out 
what his next move will be  the guard moves away from the men and walks up 
to another guard to engage him in a conversation  while the two guards are 
rapping with each other david decides to make a desperate try of it 

				david lee 
		okay sounder lets go

farm area

them david takes off in a circle with the guard in pursuit of him away from 
the direction of the road  sounder is close behind him  they circle back 
into the direction of the road and zoom past the group of convicts  david 
is running at electrifying speed david and sounder are making tracks with 
the guard still after the boy they come to the fence and quickly slip 
through but davids hand falls on a broken bottle with gashing force  he 
leaps up and continues on across the road and into an open field the guard 
stops at the edge of the road and gives up the chase

		which means that a man and a woman are human 
		and must be treated that way
			she returns to the text

as she reads davids mind and imagination take to drawing pictures and 
images of what he can apply to his intuitive understanding of what she is 
reading to him

of view and make their loving living and doing precious to all human

davids images

darkness as camille starts to make the bed for him  she stops for a 
moment and looks up and over at him at the window 

				camille 
		what are you looking at out there theres 
		nothing to see

answer for the boy  she sits down on the bed as he turns back to gazing out

puts her arm around his shoulder  and they both look out of the window into
