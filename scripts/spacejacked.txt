fade in

the vast infinity of space  

roll credits  drifters

soon the silhouette of a planet fills the screen 

the sun breaks slowly across the arc of the planet 

end credits  

as the light increases we see the planet is earth  

a title reads earth  2070 ad

soon afterward the moon can be seen in the distance 

				womans voicevo
		ahh the space age  must have been
		a thrilling time to be alive  all 
		the hopes for a better tomorrow all 
		the dreams of inhabiting new worlds

soon a spaceship enters the frame  only the rear of the craft is visible at first
as it heads into space  

				womans voicevo
		its amazing they even made it out
		this far considering what they had
		to work with  guess it really was
		one giant leapa hundred years ago

soon the side of the ship becomes more and more visible  

				womans voicevo
		but i guess after that first leap 
		things just werent as exciting  
		how much do you need to know about
		a place like the moon its cold
		silent

the camera begins to pan the side of the ship  

				womans voicevo
		but it sure was a beautiful place to
		visit or so they said  at least if 
		you could afford itguess it all 
		boils down to money in the long run 

as the camera pans across the side of the ship we see its name  star princess 
written in a slick commercial 
style  

				womans voicevo
		me i just felt lucky to be along 
		for the ride

int spaceship lounge  night

we see dawn murphy an attractive girl in her late 20s gazing out the window of
the lounge  

just then mac a fully articulated human android dressed in a futuristic
conciergelike outfit approaches dawn 

she turns to face him and his eye scans a small computerized pin on her jacket 
he looks up to her  

				mac
		how are you this evening dawn
		murphy

dawn smiles at the android looks around as if a little embarrassed then looks
back out the window  

				dawn

		award

				dawn

				mac

		you with

		reminder we have fabulous cuisine
		available 24 hours in the earthrise
		room and a large selection of
		vintage wines here in our ship bar

dawn then looks at mac  

				dawn
		thank you im fine

mac smiles at dawn  
		
				mac
		enjoy your trip with us

mac then heads off  dawn turns and looks at him  

we see the lounge of the ship  sleek and luxurious decorated in rich fabrics and
material  behind the bar we see the bartender jack a burly man in his 40s
cleaning some glasses 

mac walks by a table where a couple is sitting  they are delbert miles 49 an
overweight man with slicked back hair and a gaudy ring on his hand  across from
him is monica miles 22 a buxom somewhat boredlooking blonde brandishing an
enormous diamond wedding ring 

delbert puts down his drink and grabs mac as he passes  

				delbert
		hey chief

mac stops and looks at the couple scanning the pins on their chests  

				mac
		hello delbert and monica miles
		congratulations on your recent
		wedding  

				delbert
		yeah yeah look never mind all that
			shakes his drink		 
		let me get another one of these lots
		of ice and dont be stingy with 
		the whiskey this time ok

jack listens in the background to the conversation  

mac then looks at monica  

				mac
		certainly and anything for you
		monica

				monica
		im fine thank you

				delbert
		oh and bring out some more of 
		those little baked things and
		some hot mustard

				mac
		certainly  i will now process
		your request and i hope youre
		enjoying your trip with us

mac walks away  monica stares into her drink  

				monica
		i dont like him calling me by my
		name it gives me the creeps

				mac
		yeah i wish hed put a sock in 
		it already

delbert downs the remainder of his drink  monica looks sullenly into her glass 
delbert notices this puts his drink down  

				monica
		whats wrong baby  you havent 
		said a whole lot lately

delbert picks up her hand and kisses it  monica doesnt respond  
				monica
		im homesick

				delbert
		homesick  its only been two
		days

				monica
		we should have gone to nassau at
		least we could go swimming lie on
		the beach

				delbert
		ah hell we can always do that listen
		believe me once we get to the 
		moon your tone is going to change

				monica
		how is it going to be different
		from this  go see some boring
		footprint under glass

				delbert
		look you were the one who wanted
		to do something different something
		to tell all your friends  any
		chump can go to nassau  

delbert scans the room littered with the beautiful people of the times  

				delbert
		look around you baby were rubbing
		elbows with royalty oil sheiks
		this is class  youll be envied
		by everyone 

				monica
		i guess so

				delbert
		besides i cant wait to tee off
		on the sea of tranquillity that
		should shore up that prick hank
		drexler

monica stares blankly back at him  

				delbert
		you know  the guy at the club i
		was telling you about

monica takes a sip of her drink and puts it down  

				monica
		i still say we should have gone
		to nassau

int ship bridge  night

pan an array of blinking controls and sensors  seated at the console is the ships
first mate ryan taylor a goodlooking man in his 30s examining them  

soon the ships captain approaches captain reynolds a distinguishedlooking man
in his fifties 

				reynolds
		hows everything looking

				taylor
		finishing up the diagnostic
		everything checks out normal
		we still have to take a look
		at the starboard suite on b 
		deck  weve relocated her
		and she doesnt seem to be
		that upset about it

seated across the bridge second mate alex barnes turns and  addresses them  

				barnes
		why should she its her fault  
		all guests are told not to eat 
		in zero gravity but she just 
		wanted to have fun i guess 
		didnt realize what a grain of 
		salt can do to sophisticated
		machinery

				reynolds
		well i guess she figures shes
		paying for it

				barnes
		aint it the truth must be good
		to be rich

reynolds takes a look at his watch  

				reynolds
		all right im headed down to 
		engineering  if you gentlemen
		need me thats where ill be

				taylor
		yes sir
reynolds leaves the room  

barnes then gets up and stretches  

				barnes
		well i guess theres no time
		like the present  ill go 
		run a check on that room just 
		to show we go that extra mile
		for our guests

				taylor
		sounds like youve been talking
		to mac too much

barnes heads toward the door  

				barnes
		yeah  i think hes developing
		a crush on me

taylor smiles as barnes exits  he then turns his attention to a screen   

pov he cursors down to a command  life pod status engage

we see him select that option  

int hallway  night

two porters struggle with the luggage of anna koros the thirtysomething heir to a
shipping fortune who follows behind  

				anna
		now look will you please be
		careful with those  they cost 
		more than you make in a year

the two porters look at each other as one unlocks the door  

anna takes a cellular phone out of her purse  

				anna
		when will my original room be
		ready again

				1st porter
		im sure theyll notify you as
		soon as theyre done maam
				anna
		shuffling back and forth  i feel
		like im traveling coach

she dials the phone from the hallway watching the two men enter the room  

				anna
		put them near the window
		and be careful

anna dials the phone and puts it to her ear  she then does a double take down the
hall  

pov we see an impeccably groomed movie star handsome warren wayne exit his
neighboring suite room and lock the door  

annas jaw drops as she slowly lowers the phone  

wayne puts his key in his pocket and gracefully slicks his hand across his
perfectly combed hair before heading in the direction of anna  
 
anna watches him approach  

				anna
			to herself
		oh my god

wayne approaches and smiles at anna  

				wayne
		evening

				anna
		it cant be

				wayne
		excuse me

				anna
		youre warren wayne

warren slows down somewhat reluctantly  

				wayne
		uh yes i am  and you are

				anna 
		anna koros
she sensually extends her hand warren shakes it  

				wayne
		koros as inkoros  dimitri
		koros

				anna
		my grandfather  my god i cant
		tell you what a fan i am of yours
		you were magnificent in deadly 
		gamble

				anna
		so what brings you out here
			beat
		pleasure cruise

				wayne
		well a little business too  in my
		upcoming project star trackers i 
		play a ships captain and i really
		wanted to get a feel for the outer
		space experience  i feel it will
		add more credibility to my performance

				anna
		of course of course
			
				wayne
		so

				anna
		well i guess were neighbors for
		this trip
				
				wayne
		well so we are

wayne looks at anna and smiles  

				wayne
		well it was nice meeting you
		enjoy the rest of the trip

				anna
		im sure i will

wayne heads off  

				anna
		im sure well see each other
		again

wayne turns back and smiles  

as he turns away we see his smile vanish  

just then the two porters exit the room  

				1st porter
		youre all set maam  ill
		personally go and check on the 
		status of the old room right
		now

				anna
		youll do nothing of the kind

the two porters look at her as she heads toward the door  

				anna
		im staying put thank you very
		much

anna then slams the door in the porters face  the two men look at each other  
				
int hallway  night

camera approaches barnes as he works on some circuitry in a open panel in the wall 

quickly and methodically barnes works with some tools  he then looks up and down
the length of the hallway before quickly taking a small metal case out of his
pocket  

close on the case as he opens it  it contains a sophisticated series of connectors
attached to a dense white cube of what appears to be plastic explosive surrounded
by black metal  

int bridge  night

taylor continues running a check of the life pods onscreen 

just then a command comes up  fail mode confirmed 96

the command seems to trouble taylor who faces the computer and enters some
commands  he pauses for a beat  

he sits back  once again fail mode confirmed  96

taylor frowns at the command  he presses a button on his wrist watch  

int hallway  night

barnes begins to carefully crossinstall the device in the case onto the equipment
in the circuit panel  soon his watch beeps  

				taylorvo
		hey barnes

barnes stops working for a beat then answers his watch 

				barnes
		yeah go

int bridge  night

taylor looks at the monitor  

				taylor
		im getting a very strange command
		on the life pod status check did
		anything come up on the last
		diagnostic




int hallway  night

barnes seems angry at the news  he shakes his head bites his lip and quickly
removes the few wires he has attached  

				barnes
		no i just ran it  why are you
		running it again

				taylorvo
		well its a good thing that i 
		did

int bridge  night

taylor looks at the screen  

				taylor
		its telling me fail mode
		confirmed  did you see this

				barnesvo
		there must be some mistake you
		sure you hit the right commands

				taylor
		yes im sure i hit the right
		commands

int hallway  night

				barnes
		why dont you reset and run it
		again  the pods check out ok


				taylorvo
		youre certain of that

				barnes
		trust me
			beat
		even checked em with my own 
		eyes

int bridge  night

				taylor
		all right ill give it a shot

taylor presses the button on his watch and resets the commands  

just then dawn taylor enters the bridge  taylor turns and faces her  

the two look at each other for a beat  

				dawn
		they said it would be ok to come
		up here

taylor gets up and approaches  dawn extends her hand  

				dawn
		im dawn murphy

they shake hands  

				taylor
		oh right right youre on that
		research grant

				dawn 
		thats right

				taylor
		ryan taylor first mate  welcome
		aboard  first time in space

				dawn
		yes  theoretical discoveries aside
		theres nothing like the real thing
		how about you

				taylor
		this is my second commercial flight
			beat
		i used to run satellite freighters
		but that got old fast 

dawn looks around the bridge  

				dawn
		so you were looking for a new
		challenge

				taylor
		well plus the money aint that
		bad
				dawn
		so tell me do you think everyone
		gets their million dollars worth
		on this trip of a lifetime

taylor and dawn look at each other and smile  

				taylor
		well let me put it this way  most
		of the cost is due to safety reasons
		most people are not familiar with
		space travel so we have to take
		extra precautions in the event they
		do something careless

				dawn
		like open an airlock by mistake

				taylor
		well i dont think theres a 
		chance of that happening  its
		usually the moon walks  sometimes
		you feel like a kindergarten teacher

				dawn
			laughs
		well i hope i dont do anything

uniform  he feels the pockets shakes his head  

he looks around the room and exits his quarters  

int bridge  night

close on a pair of reading glasses folded and lying on a counter  in the

barnes pauses for a beat  

				barnes
		without breaking a few eggs

barnes sits back  

suddenly the bridge door slides open  

barnes spins his chair around  

reynolds enters the bridge in his bathrobe brandishing his key  

				reynolds

barnes stands up and stares at reynolds  

				barnes

				reynolds
		what the hell is that

barnes approaches from behind  

				barnes

		a little fun

reynolds turns and looks incredulously at barnes  

				reynolds

		barnes  you realize how sensitive 
		this equipment is

barnes nods and stares down reynolds  

				barnes
		all too well captain

				reynolds

close on reynolds staring at the computer  barnes approaches from behind

console  

blam another blast  soon reynolds hits the ground falling offscreen  barnes
approaches him and blam shoots again

ext ship  night

an explosion rips through the outside of the ship  huge chunks scatter from the
heat of the fireball  



int hallway  night

terrified passengers grab on to handrails for dear life as they are sucked into
space  

int dining room  night

the room shudders violently  people scream as bottles fly across the room glass
breaks lights flicker  

terrified passengers run toward the exit  

ext ship  

suddenly a chain reaction of explosions send a series of life pods scattering into
space  

int lounge  night

the drop in pressure sends debris hurling around the room violently slamming into
passengers  

int kitchen  night

an explosion sends ovens overhead fixtures and boiling cauldrons crashing down
killing the cooks all screaming in vain   

int dining room  night

taylor fights to get his bearings  he runs to the dining room door but it shuts
rapidly   
int engine room  night

several engineers scramble to get out as an explosion rips through the room 

a burst pipe spews toxic gas into the room  the engineers struggle to breathe
clawing at the doors   

ext ship  night

a few scattered explosions occur around the now severely disabled craft which
drifts erratically through the void  

int dining room  night

moaning and groaning can be heard throughout the darkened smoky room  

taylor looks around surveying the damage  

he sees dawn hunched in the corner coughing  he rushes over to her  

				taylor

taylor addresses his wrist communicator

				barnesvo
		thats very professional sounding

taylor looks around the room  

int bridge  night

close on a small monitor with a wide view of the dining

				barnes

				barnesvo

		move at this juncture

dawn approaches taylor with a worried look on her face  

				dawn
		whats he talking about

taylor looks at dawn then back toward the room  

				taylor
		barnes have you flipped your wig

int bridge  night

barnes gets closer to the mike to be emphatic  

				barnes
		its a weave taylor and you 
		know that  weve always been 
		straight with one another





int dining room  night

				barnesvo
		now do you want the good news
		first or the bad news

				taylor
		you better start making sense		

				barnesvo
		ok i will  the bad news is the 
		ship is history  life support will
		last another 36 hours maybe

				taylor 
		then weve got to get to the 
		lifepods

int bridge  night

				barnes
		id advise you to shut up and
		let me finish taylor  you 
		neednt worry about the lifepods
		because theyre all gone 
		jettisoned save for one

int dining room  night

the people in the room react to this news  

				barnesvo
		and i think we know whos getting
		it
				taylor
		why are you doing this

				barnesvo
		i was getting to that  now please
		dont try my patience ryan

int bridge  night

				barnes
		now were all businessmen and a
		common rule of business is to
		make payment for services rendered
		given that im willing to provide
		a service to each and every one
		of you
int dining room  night

				barnesvo
		im willing to transmit that code 3
		emergency if youre lucky a rescue
		team might just get to you in time
		of course by then ill be long gone			
		
				carlo
		in exchange for what

				barnesvo
		well carlo youre not really part
		of the equation

int bridge  night

				barnes
		but those other high rollers around
		you are  i will provide this
		service in return for the personal 
		authorization codes of each and every 
		bank account  once i have those
		codes and ive completed the 
		transfer ill signal the alarm  but
		not a minute before

int dining room  night

taylor listens to this as delbert approaches  

				delbert
		what the hell is he talking about

				barnesvo
		what part didnt you understand fat 
		man  its a hold up pure and simple  
		i want your money  cooperate and ill
		let you live  and this offer is non
		negotiable 

dawn walks over to taylor  
				
				dawn
		it doesnt make any sense





				taylor
			to barnes
		its suicide barnes  how do you
		think youre going to get away
		it

				anna
		theyll track him down in a
		heartbeat

				barnesvo
		i understand your concern but
		those are my problems not yours
		but for the record the transfer 
		trail will take them years to follow  
		by then it wont matter because i 
		wont exist at least not on paper	

				warren
		why would we give you anything
		without a guarantee of our safety

				barnesvo
		well i guess thats just a 
		question of faith huh  of
		course if money means more
		to you than a chance at survival
		id say youre my kind of
		guy

				taylor
		its still not going to work  
		theyll detect you upon reentry
		in an emergency vessel

				barnesvo
		who said ill reenter in the pod
		i got friends out in space ryan
		friends willing to get me back
		unnoticed  thank god for deregulation
		huh

int bridge  night

				barnes
		now i think ive given you all
		the information you need to make 
		a sound decision  but id advise
		you to hurry

barnes leans closer to the microphone  

				barnes
		ill give you fifteen minutes
		to organize your information  ill
		take any further delay as a sign
		youve rejected the offer and
		then of course its rescinded

barnes then reaches over to a button  

				barnes
		over and out

barnes then presses the button  

int dining room  night

they guests all look at one another  taylor concentrates saying nothing  

warren approaches him  

				warren
		this is insane  this cant be

dawn approaches taylor  

				dawn
		what are we going to do

				taylor
		i dont know  

int bridge  night

close on the screen showing the dining room  

				tayloros
		i think we should do what he
		tells us

barnes leans back and watches them smiling 

int dining room  night

dawn approaches taylor who inspects the sealed door  


				dawn
		how do we know hes not 
		bluffing

taylor sees any attempt at opening the door is futile  

				taylor
		we dont	

				dawn
		well maybe theres a way out
		of here

				taylor
		fat chance of that  even if we
		had c4 and a laser torch these 
		doors wouldnt budge
			beat
		that son of a bitchthat stupid
		son of a bitch			
		
carlo and dawn talk with taylor  

				dawn
		given a malfunction how would
		a rescue team get you out if
		the doors wont open

				taylor
		probably come through the wall
		i suppose

				dawn
		well maybe we can do something
		like that

taylor looks at dawn  

				taylor
		i dont think you know what youre
		talking about  besides what could 
		we use for tools  a steak knife  a
		corkscrew

				dawn
		just considering our options
		sir

dawn and taylor look at each other  

				carlo
		we couldnt try anything anyhow
		he must be watching everything
		we do

				taylor
		youre right

taylor looks at the control panel next to the door  

				taylor
		if only i could override this
		thing

at the other end of the room mac approaches delbert who nervously lights a
cigarette  

				mac
		on the behalf of the star princess
		we apologize for any inconvenience
		you might experience 

				delbert
		get outta here will ya
		
mac backs off and walks away  monica approaches delbert  

				monica
		well now what are we gonna do

				delbert
		how am i supposed to know

				monica
		youre delbert miles  you have
		more clout than some whacked out
		pilot  talk to him

				delbert
		talk to himjesus

nearby jack places a tablecloth over a dead guest  

				delbertos
		i tell you one thing im not
		giving him shit not a password
		not an access code not the time 
		of day

jack turns around and looks at delbert  
warren and anna approach delbert and monica  

				anna
		i think we should do what he 
		asks

delbert looks at her incredulously  

				delbert
		oh you do huh  well let me
		tell you something lady if you
		think that cracker is on the
		level youre nuts

				warren
		thats a risk we cant afford
		to take

				delbert
		i can  use your head do you 
		think he wants anyone around to
		say what happened

jack approaches  

				warren
		theres a chance hell keep
		his end of the bargain if we
		only cooperate

				delbert
		bullshit

jack steps up and looks at delbert  

				jack
		look  were talking about life
		and death here  i dont know
		why were even having this 
		conversation

				delbert
		well what would you know about it
		you dont have anything to lose

jack gets closer to delbert  				




				jack
		youre gonna give him those bank
		codes you know why  because im
		telling you to thats why  im
		not losing my life over some greedy
		pig

				delbert
		who are you calling a pig rummy

just then jack shoves delbert violently  delbert charges jack and they scuffle
briefly before being separated by warren  
				warren
		come on  stop it  stop it

delbert and jack back off from one another still staring each other down  

				warren
		lets just stay calm ok

				jack
		i dont believe this crap

mac approaches taylor dawn and carlo  

				mac
		i am receiving a high level
		of negative feedback from our
		guests comments  many expletives
		at a higher than usual decibel
		level

taylor looks at mac then approaches the others  

				taylor

		first mate i know a lot about this

		on outside these doors i dont know
		where the captain is i dont know

		suggest we collect the information
		he wants and give it to him



				delbert
		thats still no guarantee of anything

				taylor
		we dont have a choice  now lets
		write them down ok

				dawn
		supposing we could get out of this
		room  is there anything we could
		do to reach the bridge

				taylor
		it depends on the condition of 
		the ship  if i could get to 
		one of the suit compartments
		i could check the exterior air
		locks for a possible entry

				dawn
		cant we access the mainframe to
		check the ships condition

				taylor
		with what  how am i going to 
		interface with it  i need to
		be able to talk to the system
		and to have the system talk to

dawn looks at taylor who looks down at the ground  

				carlo

suddenly something dawns on taylor  

				taylor
		a way to talk to the system

taylor then looks up at mac 

dawn watches taylor  

taylor turns to carlo  

				taylor

barnes reaches over to a button

		yeah yeah 104

barnes disconnects the message  

he then gets up and approaches reynolds lying dead on the ground  he stares at
him for a beat  

he reaches into the bloody robe pocket and pulls out a 
cigar  

he smells the cigar wets the tip and lights it  

				barnes
		shame to waste a fine corona				
 
int dining room  night

carlo removes some cables from a computerized menu monitor for the restaurant and
approaches taylor  

taylor takes the cables and approaches the others  

anna has finished writing down everyones authorization codes on a piece of paper

				anna
		yes  thats all of them

taylor picks up the piece of paper  


				delbert
		i cant believe were doing

taylor then approaches the wallmounted camera lens  

the others watch him  

				taylor
		barnes  can you hear me

taylors face can be seen on the monitor  

				taylorvo
		barnes

barnes takes a puff of the cigar and looks at the monitor  

				barnes

		to the lens  ill write them down
		and once im through verifying them
		ill get back to you

				taylor

taylor slowly holds up the piece of paper to the lens  

int bridge  night

close on the monitor showing the piece of paper listing the authorization codes of
the passengers nest to their names  the list takes up the entire screen  

barnes examines the list and begins entering the first number on the list onto
another screen  

he then hits enter  the screen reads connecting with netbank 

barnes sits back  

int dining room  night

taylor gestures to carlo to come over  carlo approaches and taylor carefully hands
him off the paper to hold up

int dining room  night

close on the cable connected to the wall console  

the camera slowly pans following the cable  

				tayloros
		ok the first thing we need to 
		know is the status of this floor

taylor then gently moves the other end of the cable toward macs face  as we
approach we see macs left eye removed with a socket for the corresponding cable 

				taylor

taylor slowly inserts the cable into the socket  

everyone waits for a beat  

				taylor

dawn examines the eyeball then looks at taylor  

				dawn

the others watch apprehensively  

				mac

				jack

taylor looks at jack

taylor looks at dawn

taylor then looks at jack  he raises his wrist  

				taylor
		jack let me have your walkie

picking up one of the steel legs  

taylor then looks at mac  

				taylor

int hallway  night

close on the doors to the dining room opening  

mac exits the dining room

to slide through

int damaged hallway  night

mac approaches the door at the other end  

the door does not open automatically  mac stares at it for a beat  
				mac
		i will manually open the door
		and will report this problem to
		maintenance

mac raises his hand to the panel on the wall  

as he does the wrist walkie gets near a live wire jutting out of the wall  

as mac punched in a number  

the cable touches the walkie and a surge of electricity rips through mac  

int dining room  night

taylor hears a loud crackle emit from his walkie  

				taylor
		what the hell was that

int damaged hallway  night

mac gets blasted against the wall of the hallway  

he reels for a beat then staggers a few steps

				barnes
		not bad for a days work

suddenly there is a bell indicating someone trying to enter the bridge  

barnes swings around  

he checks the monitor and sees it is mac waiting outside the bridge door  

barnes grabs up his gun and approaches the door  

he opens the door all the time aiming his weapon  

mac stares at him

barnes looks at the monitor  taylor and the others are still in the dining room  

				barnes

ext spaceship  night

an airlock entrance can be seen  suddenly mac shoots out of the entrance and flies
away from the ship  

mac disappears into the void arms and legs akimbo looking ridiculous  

int bridge  night

close on the monitor with a view of the exterior as mac disappears into space  

barnes howls with laughter bending over slapping the console  

he gets up laughing even harder shouting with laughter  

he then opens a panel and begins flipping switch after switch after switch  
int hallway  night 

the lights go out in ascending order down the hall  

int dining room  night

suddenly the lights begin to shut off and the send of an engine running down can be
heard  

the occupants all look at one another  

				anna

int hallway  night

dawn and taylor make their way down the darkened hallway strewn with debris and
collapsed ceiling panels  

				taylor
		watch your step

taylor approaches a sealed door  he looks at it for a 
beat 

				taylor
		its through this door

taylor then looks at dawn  

				taylor
		i dont know what were facing  

				dawn
		i understand

they look at each other for a beat  

taylor takes a deep breath  

				taylor
		are you ready

				dawn
		ready as ill ever be

taylor nods at her  he then looks at the door  

taylors hand approaches the emergency lock release  

				taylor
		here goes nothing

taylor hits the button  

close on the doors  they swoosh open 

int suit compartment  night

the pressurized room blasts  taylor and dawn into the small room filled with
several large recessed lockers  there is no sound whatsoever  

they struggle to anchor themselves as they slam around the room and come
dangerously close to a gaping hole in the wall leading out to space  

dawn grabs onto a railing for dear life her face contorting from the lack of
oxygen and the brutal cold  

taylor rips open one of the lockers containing a space 
suit  the door swings open and shut violently as taylor struggles to hold on  

dawn struggles to get closer to another one of the lockers  

frost rapidly begins to form on her hand and the railing  

taylor slips and slams backward  but through sheer will power grabs hold of the
locker door and pulls out the suits helmet  he lets go and flies backwards
holding the helmet  

he slams into dawn and hands her the helmet  she too lets go to grab it and is
propelled around the room  

taylor then opens another locker and repeats the procedure this time grabbing
another helmet  

by this time dawn has gone to the first locker and removes the suit struggling to
get into it while keeping her bearings  

taylor puts on the helmet and follows suit grabbing another suit out of the second
locker  

almost at the point of bursting dawn begins to lock the helmet down  

taylor continues to do the same getting the arm of the suit stuck in the locker  

dawn floats over to the railing  she grabs it and positions herself  

taylor finally frees the stuck jacket and continues getting into the suit  

close on dawn as she uses her free hand to press some commands on the other forearm
of the suit  

a small light goes on in her helmet  soon she begins to hungrily gasp in the
incoming oxygen  soon a look of relief crosses her face  

taylor continues to struggle with the suit  dawn heads over to him  

taylor locks down his helmet  

just then dawn reaches over and presses the buttons the forearms of taylors suit  

the small light goes on in taylors helmet  he too begins to suck in the air as
if for dear life  

slinking back from exhaustion taylor looks over at dawn  

dawn looks back at him  slowly a smile crosses her face  

slowly taylor smiles back at her  he presses a button on the forearm of his suit 
we hear his voice through the helmet speaker  

				taylor
		are you all right

dawn looks at the suit and presses the button on her forearm  she then looks at
taylor  

				dawn
		yeah
			beat
		we did it

				taylor
		so we did

taylor then heads over to the gaping hole in the wall  

				taylor
		now thats what i call an emergency 
		exit

taylor inspects it and looks out into space  he then turns and looks at dawn  

				taylor
		youre ready for the real thing

				dawn
		at this point im ready for 
		anything

taylor smiles at her  he slowly makes his way out of the hole  dawn follows
closely behind  

int dining room  night

close on carlo who stares despondently at the ground  
delbert paces as monica watches him  

				delbert
		i tell you somethings not right
		here
			beat
		how do we know theyre not going
		to use the pod for themselves

				jack
		because taylor wouldnt do that

jack looks at delbert with contempt 

				jack
		im not asking now im begging
		please shut up

int wine room  night

close on warren corking a vintage wine  

just then anna enters closing the door behind her  

warren shows anna the bottle  

				warren

warren then takes an enormous swig of the wine then wipes his mouth  

				warren

				warren
		and warren waynes going out in

warren takes a swig of the wine  

				warren

										cut to
ext star princess

slowly taylor and dawn rise into the frame and hover over an area of the ship
grabbing onto handles placed around the area  
				taylor
		be careful you dont want to 
		puncture the suit
		
				dawn
		dont worry about me
			beat
		where are we going




				taylor
		to the other side  theres
		an airlock close to engineering
		if its intact i can get to 
		the pressure vents

suddenly taylor sees something  

				taylor
		what the hell is that

taylor approaches a section of the ship and scrutinizes it  

dawn looks in that direction 

pov taylor grabs a chunk of c4 plastic explosive attached to a pipe on the ship  

				dawn
		explosive

				taylor
		one of barnes duds luckily
		for us  take this out of the
		equation right now

taylor puts the c4 into a storage pouch on his suit  

				taylor

				taylor 
		come on lets go

dawn follows him  they look at each other  

				dawn

		happen to us

taylor looks back at dawn  
				taylor

the two continue to make their way across the ship  

				taylor
		do you want some advice

				dawn
		sure

				taylor
		dont worry about what will happen
		just concentrate on what is
		happening  youll live longer

				dawn
		words to live by	 
		
int bridge  night

barnes closes up his laptop  

he walks across the bridge  soon he notices something  

close on the emergency distress signal panel with three levels of emergency 
moderate code 1 extensive code 2 critical code 3  

barnes looks at it for a beat smiles then reaches for his gun  

he then blasts the panel which crackles and emits some black smoke  

barnes laughs  

he then goes over to the monitor  

he presses a button and looks at the monitor  the screen is blank 

barnes smile fades  


				barnes
		those idiots

barnes then presses another button  

pov the monitor shows a wide view of the hallway outside the dining room  

barnes scrutinizes the image   he sees something he doesnt
like  he hits a button  

pov the monitor zooms in to reveal the doors to the dining room open about 18
inches  

barnes frowns at this discovery  

ext star princess 

taylor and dawn continue to crawl across the side of the ship  

just then taylor sees something  

he gestures to dawn  

				taylor
		good news

dawn looks in the direction taylor is pointing  

pov coming into view on the other side of the ship is an airlock  

				tayloros
		its intact  were one step
		closer  come on

taylor and dawn make it closer to the airlock  

int bridge  night

barnes is checking all the various security camera shots on the monitor looking
for any movement  

on another monitor the freighter pilot talks to the 
screen  


				pilotvo
		its time we lock coordinates
		
				barnes
		i know i know

barnes keeps checking the security monitor  he is now exploring the exterior of
the ship  

				pilotvo
		so what are we waiting for

				barnes
		cool your jetsim doing a little
		damage control

				pilotvo
		damage control  what kind of damage

barnes slams the console with his fist

				barnes

ext star princess

taylor and dawn are now in front of the airlock  

taylor begins to reach for the opening lever  

int bridge  night

barnes speaks to the pilot

barnes then rushes over to a console  

ext star princess

the airlock door opens and taylor makes his way in  

dawn is about to follow suit when  

int bridge  night

taylor rushes out of the airlock and begins to climb frantically up the side of the
ship to save dawn  

dawn begins to drift away higher and higher  

taylor continues to frantically climb  

dawn struggles to grab the ship but cant reach it  

taylor approaches the top of the ship  

dawn continues to rise rapidly approaching the point of no return  
taylor gets to the top reaches out to save her 

dawns boot gets closer to taylors hand  taylor reaches as far as he can  

close on dawns boot too far for taylor to reach  she slips away  

just then taylor leaps toward dawn  

he barely manages to grab her ankle  

the two of them drift for a beat until  

taylors boot hooks under an antenna at the very end of the ship  

the two hang there in space  

				taylor
		youre safe  grab my hand  

close on dawns glove clutching taylors 

int wine room  night

dawns eye  

he then gently kisses her forehead then her cheek  

they then look at one another for a beat

close on the half smoked corona sitting on the edge of a console  the band around
it is still intact  

taylor removes the band and approaches dawn  

dawn extends her hand and taylor slips the ring on  

				taylor

they see earth in the distance  

				dawn
		right now its about 8 oclock
		at home  people are going to 
		work kids are going to school

taylor look at her then turns in the direction shes looking  

pov a small craft approaches from far away  


				taylor
		oh my god

the two begin to walk toward the direction of the approaching ship  

like little ants on the surface we see taylor and dawn as they cross the barren
landscape  

the ship gets closer and closer  

taylor and dawn rush toward it  

the ship gets closer and closer  soon a small window becomes visible

		what is it

				taylor
		i dont know  wave to them

smiling faintly  

				dawn

shakes his head no  

the crew member gestures to the two  

				crew member

taylor and dawn approach the door and slowly enter the 
ship  

the ship door closes  

				dawnvo
		and so we were saved  the freighter
		found mac floating through the 
		void quite by accident and through
		this simple twist of fate two 
		little people made it off the moon

the ship lifts off and leaves the moon  

the twisted wreckage of the star princess can be seen in the distance as the rescue
ship ascends  

				dawnvo
		later we would find out the
		lifepod made it safely back
		to earth where the adventures 
		of anna koros and warren wayne
		became the tabloid story of
		the year

the ship turns and heads away  

				dawnvo
		as for ryan taylor and me we
		decided to stay married after
		all although we got new rings
			beat
		but for the time being it was time 
		to head back to the comforting bonds 
		of a small blue planet called home

the ship heads toward earth  

					dawnvo
		it never looked so beautiful
