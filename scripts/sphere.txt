     ext ocean floor  day

     begin titles

     moving among the hallucinatory variety of creatures 
     barbaric distorted sublime  that haunt the ocean floor
     all but unknown to man except in the deep preconscious brain
     that houses the family album of the race where we remember
     that they are us then

                                                       dissolve to

     ballet of odd shapes

     and exotic colors  like a living abstract painting 
     tropical fish moving in the fg aquarium fish  fish we
     know  fish of the lesser depths as we rise up toward the
     surface

     then nearer the surface still fish dart and flee before a
     distant rumble that grows louder and louder

     helicopter

     erupts into watery view as it blasts across the ocean

               but thats impossible

                          barnes
               its not impossible if this spacecraft
               came to earth from an alien civilization

                          ted
               you think this is an alien spacecraft

               you see its not impossible its
               ridiculous

                          barnes
               we believe this spacecraft contains an
               unknown life form thats why youre
               here  youre the human contact team
               recommended in the goodman report
                   gestures to each
               we have a biochemist to assess the
               physiology of the unknown life form we
               have a mathematician because thatll
               probably be our common language and we
               have an astrophysicist to locate its

               thats from normans report

                          ted
               im sorryare these parameters correct

                          barnes
               yup

                          ted
               so youre saying you have a fuselage
               from a spacecraft over a halfmile long
               that crashed in the ocean three hundred
               years ago and its completely intact

                          barnes
               thats right and the kicker is our

               coral couldve grown faster than an inch
               a year

               no

                          ted
               well thats why were going down there
               to see isnt it

                          harry
               who said were going down there

                          ted
               are you kidding  this is the greatest
               scientific discovery since copernicus
               bigger than copernicus  the idea that
               were not alone  itll change
               everything we have physical evidence
               that theres extra terrestrial life  you
               dont want to see that

                          harry
               this is not an equation that needs to be
               solved no

               that flows like a river inside the ocean

               normal

                          barnes
               those noises are the pressure of the
               water attacking the integrity of the sub

                          beth
               you know a little something about that
               dont you norman how the pressure can

               alright were gonna pressurize you now
               i know its hot in there but youre
               going to feel coolness  thats the

               was i the only one paying attention

     ted is so captivated by his pompous explanation that he
     doesnt realize his voice is getting higher and
     squeakierin fact all of their voices have been distorted
     by the helium

                          ted
               oxygen is a corrosive gas in the same
               family as chlorine and fluorine

     everyones smirking at teds seriousness and his squeaky
     voice

                          ted contd
               essentially thats why were breathing
               helium down here because oxygen at any
               level higher than 23 becomes toxic

                          norman
               can you run that by me again ted  i
               dont speak fluent balloon

               yesthats my voice  the helium

                          harry
               has it occurred to anyone that maybe we

                          norman
               why do you say that

                          harry
               we always assume these creatures will be
               green or insectlike but basicaily
               human  but what if they inhale air and
               exhale cyanide gas  its perfectly
               plausible

                          beth

                          norman

                          harry
               a creature that cant be killed wouldnt
               think killing was right or wrong  theyd

               im sorry  all im saying is i think any
               one of us could do better with a crowbar

               could come down here once a day every day
               for fifty years for that  the ocean is
               the oldest living environmentso much
               older than the land yet we dont know
               anything about it

     he can barely make out the others this is a long way from

               even the weakest sea snake is inveritably

     as their little helmet lights sweep up towards

     buried under a mountain of coral its about as big as an
     airport terminal  with the titanium fin looming beyond

     angle on barnes

     near the entrance  carved through the coral and lit by
     tiny hanging bulbs  barnes waves them on and they follow him
     down

                          barnes
               this is our airlock  itll take us from

     as he descends awkwardly grabbing clumsily at the bulky iron
     pitons drilled into the coral walls till he reaches

     portable airlock

     against the door of the spacecraft  norman and the rest of
     the team enter  barnes seals it shuttheres a rush of
     incoming gas which pushes the water out

     close on norman

     as the water recedes down past his faceplate then he and
     the rest of the team turn toward

                          harry

               the crash  that this titanium alloy was
               superstrong there was no way you could
               hurt it

     int spacecraft  flight deck

     norman and beth arrive at the flight deck it is extremely
     dark  they discover a large contoured console  but with
     no instrumentation of any kind norman feels his way around
     what seems to be a leather chair

                          norman
               this must be the cockpit hold
               onheres a chair

                          norman contd

                          beth
               norman do you hear a kind of gurgling
               sound

                          norman
               gurgling aaaaargh

     suddenly the chair grabs him squeezing his shoulders
     grabbing his hips wrapping around his head as if it was
     swallowing him beth screams

                          beth
               norman

                          norman contd

     close on norman

     as he disappears into the chair being swallowed up by it
     beth screaming norman norman and then it stops

                          norman
               im okay

     then a loud whir as the chair snaps forward zooms up tight
     to the console

                          norman contd
               erbeth i could use a little
               help  beth

     close on norman

     he maintains his composure by dint of will  then his face is
     bathed in a soft christmastime glow of colored lights

                          beth
               norman  norman

     he gestures down with his eyes  she follows his gaze

     as it begins to take on depth the instrumentation is
     somehow within the surface of the console like a hologram

     the chair unwraps around norman

     norman relaxes  beth turns and sees that the chair beside
     norman has opened as well and theres a skeleton in uniform
     inside it

                          beth

                          beth
               my god  its an american spaceship

     they exchange a look as they absorb this stunning revelation

                          norman

               three hundred years old there werent

     beth presses the console at unknown entry event

     as it expands a sort of hologram created all around
     themas they streak through a galaxy stars and planets all
     around them they feel like theyre falling into outer
     space

     then in the middle of the screen a black spot that gets
     bigger then suddenly has a white cluster in the middle of
     it as if theyre flying toward a giant black donut

     and thennothing they sit a beat in the eerie blankness
     and silence

     the sphere a giant metal ball with an iridescent surface
     ten meters across is held suspended by a giant clawlike
     apparatus in one of the forward bays something mesmerizing
     about it the team approaches tentatively

                          ted
               what the hell is it

                          barnes
               whatever it is it seems to be what this
               bird was designed to do go out into
               space and gather things like this up and
               bring it back

                          ted
               yeahbut back from where

                          harry
               dont get too excited ted  well turn
               it over and itll say made in korea

                          ted
               somehow i doubt that harry

                          barnes
               what do you think norman

                          norman
               im still working on what the hell is it

                          barnes
               no hinges no doors of any kind

                          ted
               i bet if you put a laser micrometer on
               this youd find its a perfect sphere  i
               mean a perfect sphere  down to a
               thousandth of an inch  thats a message
               in itself

                          harry
               really

                          barnes
               what do you mean

                          ted
               i mean when pope benedict asked giotto
               for a drawing to prove his worth as an
               artist what he did was draw a perfect
               circle freehand perfection is a powerful
               message

                          beth
               i know what the zen masters would say

                          harry
               whats that

                          beth
               the ball wants to be caught

                          barnes
               nobody built a thing like this looking
               into his third eye  they went to a lot
               of trouble  and they didnt do it for
               nothing something put it out there to
               get picked up and brought back are you
               forgetting the trojan horse it could be
               a trap

                          ted
               that sounds a little paranoid dont you
               think barnes

                          barnes
               paranoia is a disease  fear is useful
               defense is basic  down to the simplest
               onecell organism us  them
                   checks watch
               well leave a video camera here keep an
               eye on it

                          norman
               can i ask you something about this
               reflective surface 

     barnes edges up to the sphere

                          barnes
               it looks like its made of mercury
               except mercury is a liquid at this
               temperature

                          norman
               no  thats not what im talking about
               what worries me is that its reflecting
               everything but us

     barnes steps back to get a better look the team edges up
     beside norman

                          norman contd
               i hate to be the one nonscientist who
               picks this up guys  you know what i
               mean what do you think it is

     their pov

     its true  a perfect mirror image of everything in the cargo
     bay but them

                          barnes

                          harry
               we know what a black hole is ted

                          norman
               i dont know what a black hole is

                          harry
               a black hole is a collapsed dead star
               that has so much gravity it acts like a
               huge vacuum cleaner sucking everything
               into it  a light interstellar dust
               time

                          ted
               time

                          harry
               its possible but not plausible

                          ted
               its more than probable its rudimentary
               astrophysics  we just havent been able
               to fly into one and prove it

                          harry
               well ted sounds like youve got this
               all figured out

               take a nap  you need to lower your
               metabolism before the decompression

                          ted

                          norman
               harry  doesnt it seem odd to you that
               barnes was so excited about coming down
               here but he wasnt the least bit upset
               about going up

                          harry
               were on the same page

     norman stops a beat  thinks  then turns to harry

                          norman
               why do you say that harry

                          harry
               theres something inside it

                          norman
               how could there be anything inside it
               theres no doors no seams

                          norman
               okaypop psychology  you want to know
               what this is really about i think for
               what its worth  your anger towards our
               friend ted in there is because he
               figured this out before you did

     beat

                          harry
               you really think so

               i dont know  this is my first
               underwater session

     they laugh

                          harry
               youre right  ted did figure it out
               first didnt he  good shrinkage

     harry takes a slow rueful ruminative beat  then

                          harry
               were all going to die down here you
               know

     this stops norman

               what what

                          harry
               you see its curious ted did figure it
               out time travel and when we get back
               were gonna tell everyonehow its
               possible  how its done  what the
               dangers are  but then why fifty years
               in the future when this spacecraft
               encounters a black hole does the
               computer call it an unknown entry
               event  why dont they know if they
               dont know it means we never told
               anyone and if we never told anyone it
               means we never made it back hence we
               die down here
                   beat

               going to lose a civilian on my watch

                          beth
               my point is harry should never have been
               anywhere near that sphere  if you were
               doing your job instead of fuddling around
               here like some middleaged man whos lost
               his keys wed all be breathing fresh air
               right now instead of worrying about how
               much oxygen

                          barnes
               for someone whos worried about oxygen

               here

                          beth

               genius kid from the slums of philadelphia
               in six years he had a phd
               norman chose ted  a whiz kid
               astrophysicistand norman chose you
               why are you here are you the most
               qualified in your field  norman must
               have thought so then again the reports
               a few years old maybe things have

               the video storage out to the minisub and
               press the reset button  the idea is if
               something happens to us and we dont
               reset it the sub goes to the surface
               automatically so if were all dead they

               with no link to the surface is just about
               the most dangerous place on the planet

               my point is you didnt feel it was
               important enough to mention this to
               somebody youre willing to jeopardize
               the lives of all of these people by
               having someone here who could in fact be

               underwater

                          barnes

               or ten feet why didnt you tell me about

                          norman
               it was a passive attempt

               get out  were still here

     barnes forces a chuckle

                          barnes
               so we are so we are

                          ted

               harry

     harry resumes eating his eggs from behind harrys back
     norman assesses harry with a shrewd appraising gaze  as if
     he has eyes in back of his head harry catches him doing it

                          harry
               why are you looking at me like that
               norman

     then harry turns  normans eyes crinkle in a kindly
     smile

                          norman
               erim jealous harry  i love eggs

     harry laughs heartily norman brings a big platter of
     calamari to the table harry spears a few with his fork

                          barnes
                   circling back
               are you saying we shouldnt still be
               here harry

                          harry

               so where is teeny

                          barnes
               teeny had an unfortunate accident she
               was killed

                          harry

               jellyfish  thats strange

                          barnes
                   beat
               yes it is strange isnt it

     norman brings harry another plate of food

                          norman
               here you go harry

     harry digs in

                          harry
               whoa onion rings

                          norman

               what

                          norman
               calamari

     suddenly harry spits out his calamari starts to gag

                          harry
               uccch  aaaaargh  squid

     ted runs around the table and gives harry the heimlich
     maneuver harry struggles to say something ted
     vigorously pumps at harry lifting him high in the air

                          ted
               okay harry bring it up  bring it up
               big fella

               ted  ted  i think hes trying to say
               something

     ted stops the heimlich maneuver  harry shrugs him off

     ted backs off

                          ted

     barnes warily takes the platter of calamari away  harry sits
     down again norman sits opposite him

                          harry
               i hate squid

                          harry
                   nods

                          ted
               he was in there he went inside the

               doesnt want to tell us

               willing to put all of our lives on the

               information

                          norman
               ted i think

                          ted

               and you dont

                          ted
               no  yeah  norman youve known me

               to be the guy who gets the recognition

                          norman
               have you any idea how respected in your
               field you are

               every time i purge it it comes back

                          barnes
               you think its a discharge from the
               buffer memory

                          ted
               i ruled that out

     edmunds enters

                          edmunds
               you figure that out yet

               if thats true what are the options

                          ted
               youd have to replace the chips

                          barnes

                   off computer
               you figure that out yet

                          ted
               its some kind of saturation effect

                          harry
               i dont think so if it was a saturation
               effect itd be random

                          ted
               what do you mean

                          harry
               this has a pattern  see its like a
               code

     harry leans over to the keyboard highlights the sequence
     that repeats  ted moves closer  upset that he missed it
     harry grabs a pad and pencil starts to write

                          barnes
               a code from where

                          ted
                   re harrys code letters
               how do you do that

                          harry

     ted rattles at the keyboard

     on screen

     the numbers change to a string of 0s and 1s they stare
     at it a quick beat

                          harry

                          ted
               do you think its coming from the sphere

               alphabet  the way its organized on the
               keyboard

     ted thinks hard

               keyboard and wind it around a sphere
               then starting at the center key g
               number the letters spiraling out

     harry stops stunned  then breaks into a broad smile

               now all thats left is to plug in the

               the content certainly appears childish
               but when you think about it its highly
               logical  a simple message  lucid
               friendly unthreatening  the way youd
               address a small child  or a dog

     although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain
     down for duration of storm to continue investigation

                   humoring her
               but beth we never elected to remain  we
               elected to return

               happened  the submarine was coming but
               edmunds said she wasnt getting a
               reading but the truth is the submarine
               was never coming
                   looking at barnes
               somebody told it not to come

                          barnes
               what are you saying  you think it was
               me

                          barnes
               i dont know beth  maybe it was jerry

                          beth

                    chuckling
               maybe he can  maybe he can read minds

                          beth
               it had to be you or edmunds or fletcher 
               youre the only ones who knew the codes

                          barnes
               and theres no place else this message
               could have come from like maybe you made
               it up

     beth looks at barnes  turns to harry

     as they run with edmunds body stumbling through the
     sticky eggs as they pile high on the ocean bottom the
     pong pong pong audible over the intercom

                          norman

     normans pov  through faceplate

     through a heavy fog of condensation norman sees a shaft of
     light coming down through the airlock eggs falling
     everywhere norman breathing heavily

     then suddenly hands grab norman and pull him up to safety

     int habitat moon pool  same time

     as barnes yanks norman inside passes him to harry who help
     him to get out of his suit swaddle him in a blanket
     barnes reaches down again and pulls beth aboard then turns
     as edmunds squashed head bobs up through the opening
     grimly barnes reaches down pulls edmunds body aboard

                          barnes

               whatever it is its too big for the
               sonar

     norman shivers in his blanket the distant pong pong
     pong of the sonar in the video room audible over the
     intercom  then it suddenly grows softer  and stops

                          ted
                   over intercom
               its gone

     int habitat  corridors to video room  later

     norman leads the others through the corridors toward the

     the others file in behind barnes  a message awaits on the
     computer

               jerry use your words  hes mad  jerry

               he leaves us alone

                          norman
               maybe he doesnt want to be left alone
               hes been down here in isolation for
               three hundred years maybe jerry is
               lonely

                          barnes
               lonely  thats like saying an artichoke
               is lonely

                          norman
                   whispering
               he hears everything were saying

                          barnes
               its just a figure of speech

     pong pong pong getting louder and more frequent

                          norman
               in your great understanding and wisdom
               jerry you must understand that entities
               such as ourselves need to talk alone
               sometimes

                          the sphere
               are you afraid

                          norman

                          beth
               where did he go

     then barnes turns suddenly alert  he moves to adjust a
     couple of knobs beneath the gas plasma readouts on the
     console  pulls on the headphones

     norman joins her

     their pov  on monitor

     thousands of eggs on the monitor like the ones they saw
     earlier falling through the water streaking mucus

     some of the eggs stick to the window then more till their
     view is obliterated

               its back

     angle on barnes

     as he works furiously at the console turns to ted

                          barnes
               positive thermals on inline perimeter

     they hear a distant metallic clank

                          beth
               what was that

                          barnes

                          barnes
               high voltage  we can run it across the
               surface of the habitat  every time weve
               tested it its started an electrical
               fire

     suddenly red lights and an alarm

                         barnes contd
               peripheral sensors activated  im going
               to try and image it on the fast acting
               sonar

     pong pong pong

     angle on screen

     as barnes looks at it an amorphous streaky blob

                          barnes
               building image eighty yards and moving
               fast

     angle on screen

     a new image not a lot sharper a blob with streaks
     spraying out from the center

                          beth
               can you tell what it is

                          ted

                          barnes
               fifty yards
                   off sonar
               reimaging

     angle on monitors

     a blurred mass and a spray of what might be tentacles fanning
     out from the center

                          beth
               it looks like a giant squid

                          ted
               a giant squid the size of this entire
               habitat  theres no such animal

                          beth
               that may be but that doesnt mean its
               not out there

                          barnes
               reimaging  thirty yards

     another slightly clearer image it sure looks like a
     squid on the video surveillance blurred images  a
     tentacle ringed with suckers an eye  too close and too
     fast to make out  then suddenly all the monitors and
     sensors go blank

                          ted
               whats going on

                          norman

                          barnes

                          norman
               i know where it is but what is it

     then suddenly the monitors flash on

                          the sphere

               flooded we dont have to worry about
               filling that space with gas either

                          norman
               thats a helluva bright side harry

     norman looks at beth

                          norman
               answer the question

     she gives him a hard look then walks out

                          norman contd
               what do you think harry do  you think
               she went into the sphere

     harry says nothing

                          norman contd
               here  you dropped your book

     norman picks up the book of 20000 leagues under the sea to
     hand to harry but sees that hes still reading the book

     norman thinks a beat  then opens a cupboard to reveal rows
     and rows of books of 20000 leagues under the sea arranged
     neatly inside

     puzzled and scared norman opens another cupboard  more
     copies of 20000 leagues under the searow after row of
     books

     back on norman

     his fear accelerating struggling to think to put the
     pieces together

                                                            cut to

     int video room  later

     norman broods alone then he turns to the monitors

                          norman
               what isnt harry telling me i know
               youre there jerry whats inside the
               sphere jerry  jerry i know youre
               there  youre always there
                   beat
               harry is reading this book 20000
               leagues under the sea  what makes me
               nervous is that after page 87
                   he ruffles through the book
               its all blank pages  harrys
               upstairs sitting in the cafeteria reading
               blank pages  why why did he go into
               the sphere and come out like this why
               why why jerry why is this book half
               a book jerry why whats going on
               jerry  why jerry why why why

     no response

     then norman turns back to 87  reads

     jump cut

     back on norman

     as he works out the code of jerrys original message with a
     pencil

                          norman
               so its g being one spiraling out from
               the center and 2 is b that means that
               h is 3 and 4 then is y

     he completes the sentence my name is harry a piece of
     the puzzle may be in place  he goes back to the dormitory to
     check on harry

     int dormitory  same time

     through the porthole in the door norman looks in on harry
     who is still thoroughly engrossed in 20000 leagues under the
     sea

                                                            cut to

     int engine room  later

     the noise of the various pumps and compressors norman
     his nerves frayed juggles a copy of 20000 leagues under
     the sea the printout and the pad as he confers with beth

                          norman
               he makes it real for you he makes it
               real for mehe has made it real for
               everybody  its really frightening
               because you dont know whether its
               really real or whether hes made it real
               for us to believe its real and its
               because of the sphere

                          beth
               our harry our harry is jerry

                          norman

     he hands her a copy of 20000 leagues under the sea

                          norman contd
               harry said he couldnt get past page 87
               because he said it was too scary okay

                          beth
               if theres nothing on the pages wheres
               the rest of the book

                          norman
               read whats on page 87

                          beth
                   reading
                according to calculations of some
               naturalists one of these animals only
               six feet long would have tentacles
               twentyseven feet long  that would make
               a formidable monster
                   closes book

                          norman
               yes  and what does harry hate

                          beth
               squid

                          norman
               and when he read that it scared him
               getting the picture  do you remember
               when all those jellyfish attacked  what
               was harry doing

                          beth
               sleeping

                          norman
               he was dreaming and this is the really
               wild part  what he dreamed

                          beth
               happened

                          norman
               it happened

                          beth
               youre telling me that because harry went
               inside the sphere he now has the power
               to manifest his dreams his fantasies
               his emotions his fears

                          norman
               manifest  he manifested ithe made it
               happen

                          beth
               well wed better not piss him off

     int dormitory  close on harry  same time

     still reading 20000 leagues under the sea  then he stares
     into space

                                                            cut to

     int engine room  same time

     beth and norman still figuring things out

                          norman
               its like an eticket ride for harrys
               subconscious  its the wildest ride you
               could imagine  its the ultimate acting
               out  its not that different when youre
               a child  a child when it imagines
               something thinks that its real but
               its not
               in harrys case its in fact so real
               that its not only real to harry its
               real to all of usand what i cant
               understand is that ever since he went in
               the sphere the sphere has some kind of
               power that projects every subconscious
               thought that harry has out to the
               computer it prints it out and we
               interact with it  we thought it was
               jerry  its not jerry its harry
               harrys jerry

                          beth
               does harry know this

                          norman
               no and what i dont understand is that
               you went in the sphere and nothing
               happened

                          beth
               cos with my subconscious can you just
               imagine  itd be like liquid drano out
               there

                          norman
               but nothing happened

                          beth

               so what are we going to tell them

                          harry
               we cant tell them that we found an alien
               sphere on an american spacecraft from our
               own future and we definitely cant tell
               them we discovered the power to manifest
               just by imagining killer jellyfish a
               giant squid sea snakes 

                          beth

               the greatest discovery in the history of

               relatively enlightened ethical educated
               we think of ourselves as good people
               but when the sphere gave us this power
               what did we do with it

                          beth
               we freaked out

                          norman
               yes  we were given the greatest gift in
               the history of mankind
               we were given this magic ball and it
               says imagine what you will and you can
               have it and were so primitive we have
               so many fears that we carry with us that
               we manifest the worst in us rather than
               the best in usand that aint gonna
               change

                          beth
               maybe we still have it

               what

                          beth
               the power
                   beat
               maybe we still have the power to manifest
               what we will

                          norman
               if we do still have the power
                   off her look
               then we have the power to forget to
               manifest a world in which we dont have

     around by the backwash of the whirring rotors he
     climbs into

     ext ship  same time

     beth emerges on the bridge  watches as normans helicopter
     takes off

     close on beth

     thinking as if she harbors some secret we follow
     her gaze out to the horizon and over the ocean then we
     dive down into the water the debris gets thicker as we go
     deeper the water gets murkier till it clears and we
     see

     the sphere

     freeze frame

                                                          fade out
