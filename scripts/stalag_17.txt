               ext compound  cold grey morning

               most of the pows are out of their barracks by now a mass 
               of freezing disheveled men some wear army coats over their 
               underwear knitted caps pulled down over their ears some 
               are huddled in blankets their feet in wooden clogs only a 
               few are fully dressed and shaven a few are on crutches or 
               bandaged up

               they assemble before their respective barracks forming a u 
               facing the center of the compound the barrack chiefs are 
               assisting the guards in lining them up fifteen abreast and 
               five deep

               supervised by schulz and hoffy the last ones from barrack 4 
               emerge

               the hubbub dies down

               the guards march down the front line of their barrack groups 
               counting the lines of five in german

               as schulz passes him blondie spots something in the middle 
               of the compound he nudges duke duke nudges price price

               is putting on his wool gloves the glove drops they all 
               look off in the same direction

               in the center of the compound right smack in the mud lie 
               the corpses of johnson and manfredi covered with a blanket 
               you know its them because johnsons foot is sticking out 
               with the barrack bag still tied to it

               a stir goes through the men of barrack 4 they are hit hard 
               all but sefton he looks at the corpses for a moment then 
               bends down picks up the glove and starts putting it on

               in front of the administration building a german lieutenant 
               has been supervising a couple of guards as they lay narrow 
               planks over the mud in a line leading to the middle of the 
               compound he turns now to the pows

                                     german lieutenant
                         parade attention

               the german guards come to rigid attention the americans 
               just stand there sullenly

               the lieutenant comes to a heil salute through the open door 
               of the administration building steps the kommandant oberst 
               von scherbach followed by another lieutenant von scherbach 
               is a big erect officer of the potsdam school over his 
               shoulder hangs a furlined officers coat his boots shine 
               like polished glass he glances over the compound then walks 
               down the planks followed by the two lieutenants marching 
               through the mud on both sides of him von scherbach stops at 
               the end of the plank in front of him lies a deep puddle he 
               clicks his heels and raises his hand in a heil salute

                                     von scherbach
                         guten morgen sergeants

               a glowering silence from the men von scherbach lowers his 
               hand

                                     von scherbach

                         stole his name from our capital  
                         that somethingorother berlin

               he waits until his nasty little joke sinks in schulz has 
               come up to the lieutenant salutes and hands him the slips 
               of paper with the prisoner count

                                     von scherbach

               he turns to the lieutenant for the tabulations

                         record now you wouldnt want that 
                         to happen to me would you 
                         fortunately those two men 

               from the ranks of the men comes the eerie dissonant sounds 
               of joeys sweet potato

               joey in the second row of the barrack 4 company is playing 
               on his ocarina oblivious to what is going on stosh turns 
               and quickly grabs the ocarina from joeys mouth

               von scherbach chooses to disregard the little musical 
               interlude

                                     von scherbach
                         as i was saying fortunately those 
                         two men did not get very far they 
                         had the good sense to rejoin us again 
                         so my record would stand unblemished 
                         nobody has ever escaped from stalag 
                         17 not alive anyway

               he snaps his fingers in the direction of the guard who stands 
               watch over the corpses

               the guard pulls back the blanket in such a manner that all 
               we can see is the barrack bag tied to johnsons leg

               the pows however see the corpses there is an angry buzz

               hoffy marches up to von scherbach

                                     hoffy
                              saluting
                         sergeant hoffman from barrack 4

                                     von scherbach
                         yes sergeant hoffman

                                     hoffy
                         as the duly elected compound chief 
                         i protest the way these bodies are 
                         left lying in the mud

                                     von scherbach
                         anything else

                                     hoffy
                         yes according to the geneva 
                         convention dead prisoners are to be 
                         given a decent burial

                                     von scherbach
                         of course im aware of the geneva 
                         convention they will be given the 
                         burial they deserve or perhaps you 
                         would suggest we haul in twentyone 
                         cannons from the eastern front and 
                         give them a twentyone gun salute

               hoffy turns on his heel and walks back to his men

               von scherbach without even looking at the corpses snaps 
               his fingers the guard throws the blanket back over the 
               bodies

                                     von scherbach
                         for the last time gentlemen let me 
                         remind you any prisoners found 
                         outside the barracks after lights 
                         out will be shot on sight 
                         furthermore the iron stove in barrack 
                         4 the one camouflaging the trap 
                         door will be removed and so that 
                         the men from this barrack will not 
                         suffer from the cold they will keep 
                         warm by filling in the escape tunnel 
                         is that clear

               the men just stand there in frustrated anger stosh clenches 
               the ocarina in his first

                                     von scherbach

                         little tree for every barrack you

               stosh with a quick underhand flip throws the sweet potato 
               in the direction of von scherbach

               it lands smack in the middle of the puddle in front of von 
               scherbach and splashes his boots with mud

                                     von scherbach
                              stiffening

                         five seconds to step forward

               he looks about the compound five seconds pass nobody moves

                                     von scherbach

                                     von scherbach
                         that is better

               but his triumph is shortlived for almost instantly harry 
               steps forward alongside stosh then duke and blondie and 
               cookie spontaneously men from all the other barracks follow 
               until all the pows have moved forward one step

                                     von scherbach

               he wheels about and marches back up the plank and into the 
               administration building his lieutenants after him two of 
               the guards start picking up the planks again

                                     schultz
                              shouting to the

               the guard slaps it back across the net again harry pops it 
               at him  and slowly the guard finds himself sucked into

               the barrack he closes the door his entire attitude has

               chess set on the table out of his pocket he takes a chess 
               piece  a black queen  and exchanges it with the black 
               queen from the set he puts it in his pocket steps over to 
               the light bulb pulls the slip knot free and exits

               guy just finishing washing his hands sefton quickly climbs

               and stops there the colored pow doesnt notice it

               ext wash latrine

                         as anybody else in the camp because 
                         i had worked for him for two years 
                         but there were lots of things i didnt 
                         know about him take for instance 
                         where he would disappear to once in 
                         a while of course i had a hunch 
                         but it seemed so crazy i couldnt 
                         quite believe it  just as i would 
                         never have believed that sefton was 
                         the guy that would give away 
                         lieutenant dunbar for blowing up

                         us the geneva man did he had started 
                         out with seven truckloads he was 
                         lucky to get one of them through  
                         with all the bombing and booby traps 
                         and pilfering still they were 
                         presents and made you feel good

                         and toothbrushes and about a thousand 
                         rolls of that sanitary paper brother 
                         they sure kept sending us reams of 
                         that stuff ill bet you if they had 
                         dropped all that paper on berlin the 
                         first day the war would have been

               lieutenant enters ushering in the geneva man schulz stiffens 
               and clicks his heels

                                     geneva man
                         as you were gentlemen please

                                     geneva man
                         naturally it would be rather awkward 
                         to have three men in one bunk

                                     german lieutenant
                         as for the blankets you will notice

                              particular bunk

               the pow looks noncommittally

                                     geneva man
                              to the lieutenant

                         so we had to remove it temporarily

               the chowtub steaming with some brew they put it on the 
               table in the middle of the barrack

                                     german lieutenant

               the geneva man continues down the barrack

                                     von scherbach
                         whatever it is its out of your 
                         jurisdiction this man is not a

                         a saboteur

                                     geneva man
                         he is a prisoner of war until you 
                         can prove sabotage

                                     dunbar
                         i didnt do it i was in the frankfurt 
                         station and the train was three miles 
                         away when it blew up

                                     von scherbach
                         oh come now you threw a time bomb

                                     dunbar

                         they searched me when they took me 
                         prisoner

                                     geneva man
                         and the way you search your prisoners 
                         it does sound rather unlikely

                                     von scherbach
                         all i know is he did it i am

                         is there anything about letting a 
                         guy sleep in the geneva convention

               he has shuffled over to the sofa and plunks himself down  
               instantly asleep

                                     von scherbach

                         are ended there will be such a thing 
                         as a war crimes commission if this 
                         man should be convicted without proper

               the geneva man looks straight into von scherbachs eyes von 
               scherbach doesnt like the look he picks up the black queen 
               and tosses it again

               an empty glass jar follows them surreptitiously and in 
               moving siphons off a stream of booze into the glass jar

               takes off his jacket his eyes fall on 

               the loop in the electric cord

               and places the chess piece back on the chess board he is 
               about to read but  some of the pows come marching down 
               the barrack toward price in a takeoff of a homecoming parade 
               led by harry and stosh

               slip noose out of the light cord and walks toward the center 
               table

               sefton lying in his bunk sees the shadow of the bulb and 
               the light cord on the wall swinging gently back and forth 
               it doesnt make too much of an impression on him however 
               he definitely notices it and looks around for the cause he 
               dismisses it and lies back in his bunk

               the phonograph on the center table is playing i love you

               them triz leading harry blondie leading a bearded pow 
               the whole thing is very elegant with new guys cutting in 
               politely one of the pows sings into a mike consisting 
               of a stick stuck into a knothole in the table with a tin can 
               on top

                         all the fireworks that were to go 
                         off all at once and bust the camp 
                         wide open it sure started off 
                         innocently enough with a party going 
                         on in every barracks

               sefton propped up in his bunk is watching the proceedings 
               in back of him against the window sits cookie seftons

               pow they are supplying a makeshift jazz accompaniment 
               playing on a washboard drumming on the table and strumming 
               a bass fiddle string attached to a bucket

               sefton there is a look of cynical amusement on his face as 
               he takes this in

               a pow tags triz to cut in harry holds out his arms he 
               is ready but the pow dances off with triz leaving harry 
               flat harry looks over to stosh

               stosh lies in his bunk drinking whats left of the booze he 
               swiped from the distillery he is staring at the pinups of 
               grable pasted on the ceiling of his bunk

                                     harry

                         when he wants to be alone so go 
                         away

               he takes another swig and lets down the big pinup so it 
               hangs a few inches in front of his eyes

               harry turns away from stosh picks up a pilot cap turns it 
               inside out so the yellow fur shows on top puts it on he 
               gets some straw out of a hole in a mattress and tucks it 
               under the cap like curls

                                     harry

               betty grable or rather the pinup photo superimposed in the

               happiness dawns on his face he climbs out of his bunk and 
               walks toward harry in a trance

                                     stosh

               he climbs off the table stosh puts his arm around very 
               elegantly and dances him off

                                     stosh
                         who wouldve ever thought id be 
                         holding you in my arms

               a peculiar expression comes over harrys face

                                     stosh

               close to harry he is lost in blissful romance

               several hundred pows are casually strolling about the 
               compound the camera moves towards the administration building 
               past an ss car parked on the roadway with the motor 
               running an ss driver stands at the car door harry and 
               stosh stand by the car inspecting it camera moves on past 
               the flagpole against which leans duke and on to the porch 
               of the administration building there stands hoffy reading 
               the bulletin board only he isnt reading it from one corner 
               of his eye he is peeking through the window into the 
               kommandants office suddenly he reacts to a movement inside 
               without turning he gives the signal he throws one end of 
               his muffler around his neck

               duke at the flagpole gets it and throws his muffler around 
               his neck thusly relaying the signal

               at the car harry follows suit

               marko leaning against the north latrine catches the signal 
               and still facing the compound raps with his knuckles on 
               the wooden boards

               int north latrine  day

               the crutch is sitting on the wash trough on hearing the 
               raps bagradian pulls up the crutchs loose pants leg 
               blondie strikes a match and lights the fuse on the smudge 
               pot bagradian pulls down the pants leg they help the crutch 
               off the wash trough and he hobbles out

               ext compound  day

               the crutch is slowly hobbling toward the car a thin wisp of 
               smoke curling up from his pants leg

               out of the administration building emerge two ss men 
               leading dunbar between them hoffy standing at the bulletin 
               board whistles a few bars of the air force song dunbar 
               turns sees hoffy whistling hoffy doesnt look at him but 
               dunbar senses that something is in the wind he walks on 
               between the ss men as he is being led toward the car 
               still some thirty feet away pows crowd in to watch him

               the crutch hobbling on from the direction of the latrine 
               is some twenty feet from the car

               duke straightens up from the flagpole casually and starts 
               sauntering toward the car

               the latrine blondie and bagradian have moved out of the 
               latrine and stand there with marko watching the car

               harry and stosh at the car stosh tightening the belt of his 
               coat harry pulling the barracks cap tight on his head

               the driver of the car opens the door the ss men and dunbar 
               are some eight feet away now

               the crutch hobbling past the car releases a string and the 
               smudge pot drops as he moves on he barely makes it almost 
               instantly there is a belch of fire and smoke starts pouring 
               out of the smoke bomb

               the wind billows the smoke across the car rapidly enveloping 
               the ss men and dunbar there are german shouts from within 
               the smoke cloud

               duke harry stosh blondie bagradian marko and hoffy move 
               into the smoke from all sides all now is lost in smoke 
               just silhouettes of men rushing about shouts german 
               commands sounds of scuffling from off a siren starts to 
               sound german guards come running from all corners of the 
               compound into the cloud

               in the goon towers the guards wheel around their machine

               from the administration building storms von scherbach 
               followed by the two lieutenants schulz and other guards 
               they dash into the smoke cloud which starts lifting

               the compound  through the window of barracks 4

               the smoke cloud starts to clear at the car the two ss 
               men and the driver stand with guns in their hands dunbar is 
               gone the other pows stand around innocently von scherbach
