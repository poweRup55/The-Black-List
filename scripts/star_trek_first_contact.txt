               1   a black void                                                   1

                   we can hear movement strange skittering sounds like
                   razorclaws on metal the hiss of pneumatic hoses
                   the whirr and click of servos liquid gurgling an
                   eerie alien cacophony

                   appears hanging now in the starry blackness the
                   alien noises continue and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled thump of what could be a distant explosion
                   alien text suddenly appears next to earth and we
                   reveal we are in 

               3   int borg recon center                                         3

                   the image of earth is actually on a monitor which is
                   only one of dozens of monitors covering a huge wall
                   we dont see anything of the rest of the room but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre 
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements
                   circuitry and optical cabling are sidebyside with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs we can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises
                   occasionally a shadowy form sweeps past the camera
                   vaguely humanoid but we cant tell who or what it is

                   all of the monitors are active and they present myriad
                   images and sound  all related to earth history the
                   screens show everything from written chinese to
                   renaissance paintings to black and white newsreel
                   footage of world war two to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century the entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors the
                   effect is dizzying  we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race

                   there is another thump and the wall of monitors
                   shudders slightly we hear the voice of what we will
                   come to know as the borg collective  thousands of
                   voices speaking at once 

                                           borg

                             98 through 2084

                   the images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21st century earth history

                   again its a collection of still photography video
                   footage text artwork etc we hear snippets of sound
                   bites music speeches from the period a lot of
                   enticing details as the images race across the
                   monitors we should learn the following

                    the turn of the 21st century brought chaos
                   regional wars the collapse of the united nations

                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before humans and vulcans working together beginning
                   to solve longstanding problems with new technology
                   we see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions a new world government is formed

                   planets and they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration they call it starfleet

                    these are images recounting the birth of the star
                   trek universe

                   another muffled explosion this one stronger shakes
                   the entire wall one of the monitors blows out in a
                   shower of sparks and now a new voice a womans
                   voice low threatening with a slight metallic
                   inflection speaks for the first time

                   another explosion rocks the room and it takes us to

                   a huge spherical borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel the blast smashes into the
                   borg sphere but the massive ship continues the
                   sphere returns fire follow the borg fire to 

               5   a federation starship                                          5

                   locked in battle with the borg sphere the borg fire
                   destroys the federation ship in a fiery blast

                   as the borg sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship and as it does we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of 

               7   a massive space battle                                         7

                   involving dozens of starfleet and borg vessels engaged
                   in a fierce firefight as far as the eye can see ships
                   turning twisting firing exploding lots of movement 
                   its a spectacular sight

                   the borg sphere is moving away from the battle heading
                   off in another direction

                   in the middle of the battle a borg cube is attacking
                   a smaller federation starship the starship is taking
                   quite a beating explosions all along the hull it
                   doesnt look like it can take much  more of this

                   suddenly a spread of four torpedoes come blazing in
                   from oc the torpedoes slam into the borg ship
                   causing massive damage

                   the enterprise is starfleets newest and most powerful
                   vessel an elegant and majestic ship but unlike the
                   last enterprise starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
                   and other defensive armory we get the feeling this
                   enterprise is ready for anything

                   the silo is buried deep underground but on the surface
                   there is a large poured concrete missile door

                   built to withstand a nuclear blast the door has
                   nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the borg
                   attack from orbit there are large smoking craters
                   all around part of the ground seems to have collapsed
                   to a depth of ten feet like a sinkhole nearby picard

                             how serious is the damage

                             radiation leaking from something

                             probably from the nuclear warhead
                             cochrane was planning to use it to
                             ignite the warp drive

                   as they speak beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
                   everyone injections

                                           beverly
                             this will protect us from the

                   geordi moves to the thick concrete missile door scans

                             there should be an access hatch
                             nearby

                   everyone spreads out looking for the hatch one of
                   the guards  lange  finds it

                             over here

                   everyone rushes over to him theres a small hatch on
                   the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
                   brush geordi kneels down starts working a complex
                   looking lock on the hatch

                                           geordi

                             i have the password right here

                   picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back
                   he aims and fires at the hatch which is blown open
                   revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness
                   as they start to crawl inside

                   this is the mission control for cochranes test site
                   the underground room is filled with 21st century
                   equipment consoles and monitors one entire wall of
                   the room is dominated by a huge metal blast door which
                   is now closed we will learn that on the other side of
                   that door is the nuclear missilewarp ship itself

                   the ceiling has partially collapsed chunks of
                   concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
                   equipmentonly a few of the consoles are active most
                   are dark or fritzing sporadically the lights are out
                   and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires
                   four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room
                   its a scene of destruction

                   and his team enter the dark and smoking ruin beverly
                   and picard move to one of the dead men while geordi
                   and the security guards move to the other three
                   beverly rolls the man onto his back  hes clearly
                   dead the name stitched on his uniform says rippert
                   picard looks up

                             see if any of these men are
                             cochrane

                   geordi and the guards start checking the dead bodies

                   picard and beverly move toward the immense blast door
                   as beverly scans it picard glances at a nearby desk
 
              57   the desk                                                      57

                   is littered with debris and various documents and
                   schematics three photographs are pinned to a bulletin
                   board above the desk  they show zephram cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship the photos are odd
                   looking printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth

                                           beverly
                             theres a life sign behind this
                             door about ten meters below

                   geordi moves to the door

                                           geordi
                             blast door its designed to
                             protect the control room when the
                             missile is launched

                                           picard
                             there should be some kind of
                             manual release

                   they hunt around for a moment geordi runs his hand
                   along the edge of the blast door picard turns to the
                   guards

                                           picard

                             get those fires out and then try
                             to restore main power to the
                             control room

                   the guards move off

                                           geordi
                             got it captain

                   geordi has found an emergency box with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   emergency use only he pulls down the lever there
                   is a hissing sound and the blast door slowly slides
                   down into the floor we can now see the missile silo
                   itself beyond the door picard geordi and beverly
                   step into

                   picard geordi and beverly step onto the catwalk which
                   surrounds the silo walls in the middle is the warp
                   ship itself it should look like an advanced icbm
                   missile with a cockpit in place of the warhead and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage the
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room on
                   the side of the missile is the name phoenix the
                   missile itself extends down another four stories
                   there are other catwalks below this one with ladders
                   connecting the different levels beverly sees
                   something below

                                           beverly

                   two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating they all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile note because of the design of the
                   silo we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots for the most part our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile

                   beverly reaches the man who is lying facedown on the
                   metal grating she scans him

                                           beverly
                             severe radiation exposure

                   geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level the side panels have been removed
                   revealing complex circuitry within

                   picard joins beverly who turns over the injured man
                   its zephram cochrane  the man whose picture we saw
                   on the borg monitors beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit injects cochrane with a hypospray
                   cochrane is a man in his midforties he has a
                   youthful dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns

                             need radiometric therapy i want
                             to take him to the ship

                   attach a small pod to a starfleet console and activate

                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face

                   through the tubes we can see an exchange of fluid and
                   energy pulsing back and forth  some sort of bizarre
                   feeding or renewal is going on the tubes all seem

                   data is now horizontal on his back and the table locks
                   into position a borg drone opens a panel on the side
                   of datas head and begins connecting a thick bundle of

                   a rural western community thats probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years and we can see the roots of

                   century

                   the most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred wind mills which
                   provide the only source of power for the town the
                   blades are enormous but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles some are sleek
                   fiberglass futuristic others have a more cobbled
                   together makeshift appearance at the moment only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze

                   picard and beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher they exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it

                   a few minutes later picard and beverly carrying
                   cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end as they walk along we get our first taste of
                   postapocalyptic 21st century life

                   this is a recognizable american community but its
                   definitely a futuristic town clothing architecture
                   technology  all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years but it is a broken future what used
                   to be hightech public computer terminals are rusted
                   and abandoned we can see the corroded hulks of hover
                   cars lying idle in the streets futuristic elements
                   now useless

                   at one point they pass a large polyurethane tent 
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within the
                   entrance is guarded by a single militia guard later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food

                   what used to be a mcdonalds or some other
                   recognizable food chain has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop people are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs

                   the sidewalks are populated with people who congregate
                   in small groups quietly talking amongst themselves
                   others just staring vacantly off into space many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies 
                   victims of the war and postnuclear environmental
                   dangers a few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face  protection against the toxic
                   elements a long food line snakes around a block as
                   people line up to get their daily rations

                   a few people glance up at picard and beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks this is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers at one point they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic camouflage carrying an automatic
                   weapon  we will learn hes a militia soldier he
                   stares at them with a neutral expression then walks
                   off

                   the people here have that holloweyed listless look
                   about them theyre going through something that makes
                   the great depression look like a minor inconvenience
                   but theres also a toughness to these people a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds we are looking at our future and
                   its on the verge of collapse

                                                                            cut to

                   a short time later cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table picard and beverly step back from the
                   table as a doctor and two nurses look him over the
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered
                   tired look to him the hospital itself is like the
                   rest of the town  a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times the light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital 
                   we get the feeling they have very little power

                   he checks cochrans head injury as beverly takes out
                   her tricorder and scans him

                             it looks like he has a cranial
                             fracture but ill need xrays to

                             out at the missile silo

                   she looks at him for a moment her eyes boring into him
                   without expression as though probing the truthfulness
                   of his statement

                                           doctor

                   she looks up at picard and again theres a slight
                   feeling of chemistry in the air and then she turns
                   and starts to walk out of the room picards combadge

                   looking down the side street ruby the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder she stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burntout old hover
                   car stares at itthen pulls a homemade
                   futuristic camera out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car she continues on her way picard is
                   intrigued  wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of just then

                   picard turns just in time to catch a small metal
                   canister with a screwtop

                   the man who threw it steps into view its lieutenant
                   scrimm scrimm is the head of the towns militia
                   while not a physically threatening man there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility
                   hes wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm before the war scrimm was probably
                   one of the survivalists who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of armageddon came
                   true at the moment scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to picard

                                           scrimm

                   picard eyes the canister not sure what to make of it

                   scrimm is still smiling at him but his eyes never
                   leave picard

                                           picard

                             the no zone

                   picard begins to walk away not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town scrimm falls in next to him

                                           scrimm
                             where in the states

                             for travel

                   he casually steps in front of picard blocking his way

                                           scrimm
                             where are you from most recently

                             theres a few of us left

                   picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street scrimm waits a beat then walks after him
                   again

                                           scrimm
                             that was a pretty clever trick you
                             did with the hospitals batteries
                             howd you do it

                                           picard
                             it wasnt a trick i used to be
                             an electrical engineer

                                           scrimm
                             huh

                   he steps in front of picard again still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face picard
                   realizes he isnt going to shake this man so easily

                                           scrimm
                             and what were you doing out at the
                             missile silo

                                           picard

                                           scrimm
                             lucky for him you came by when you
                             did he might be dead now

                                           picard
                             yes

                                           scrimm
                             maybe you can tell me what hes
                             been doing in that silo we heard
                             some explosions out there this
                             morning

                                           picard
                             i think he was running a test on
                             an old rocket engine and one of
                             the fuel cells burst

                   scrimm eyes him evenly

                                           scrimm
                             you seem to have an answer for
                             everything

                                           picard
                             something wrong with that

                                           scrimm
                             not yet

                   a tense beat then scrimm smiles easily

                                           scrimm
                                     re balm
                             be sure you put that on you need
                             a lot of protection around here

                   he holds picards eyes for a moment

                                           picard
                             thank you but ive never had
                             much trouble protecting myself

                   now its picards turn to smile pleasantly at scrimm
                   picard walks around him and heads for the gates
                   scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression 
                   clearly hes more than a little suspicious

                                                                            cut to

                   worf and his team watch as the forcefield protecting
                   the hatch flashes off worf reaches down and releases
                   the hatch which slides open with a soft whoosh he
                   glances at his men for a moment then jumps down the

                   as worf lands on his feet the light is dim no power
                   on this deck hard to see he looks around warily for
                   a moment phaser attheready then activates his wrist
                   beacon we immediately notice that we can see worfs
                   breath  its freezing cold down here he shines the
                   light around the darkened corridor then silently
                   motions his arm for the others to follow a beat then
                   we see the security officers start to drop into the
                   corridor from the hatch above

                   theready everyone alert with fingers on the triggers
                   we see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
                   own light sources intended to illuminate the target
                   before you shoot at it the security officers are
                   constantly moving their lights back and forth through
                   the chilly air worf gives hand signals  holds up
                   two fingers then a fist and points forward

                   two guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet
                   stop and take up firing positions then two more
                   members of the team run down leap frog ahead of them
                   and take positions further down the corridor classic

                             on this deck our tricorders are
                             useless

                   the team continue to explore deck 47 its spooky
                   eerie a sense of menace around every corner they
                   open doors check room by room section by section
                   still no sign of the borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness

                   the corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall
                   ceiling and deck panels  all the normal decorative
                   enterprise sheathing is gone revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself unlike the rest of
                   the corridors there does appear to be power flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead and it gives off
                   an eerie glow

                   we can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed  not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement youd expect to find behind bulkheads 
                   theres a sense of crosscircuitry rewiring
                   equipment being rearranged clearly a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship worf steps forward
                   examines the corridor closely

                   worf signals the team forward and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the borgified corridor its
                   not easy  they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables circuits and
                   machinery ensign hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry which gives off a beep the entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate ensign who pales at their sudden attention

                   worf looks irritated then motions his team to continue
                   their search they continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor and as they turn a corner

              92   new angle  another corridor                                  92

                   where the machinery is now thicker and more borglike
                   in appearance tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling if anything its even colder in here the
                   deeper they go the worse it gets we can now hear a
                   low sinister hum of alien power at the end of this
                   corridor is the enviromental control room as seen
                   earlier the entire doorway is gone  and a weird
                   pulsing glow fills the room worf stops his team at
                   the sight from this vantage we cannot see directly
                   into the room but clearly something is going on in
                   there

                   worf signals his men to spread out and they take up
                   positions around the corridor all weapons trained on
                   environmental control

                   as work and riker continue talking we move to ensign
                   hawk who is now the last man in the formation
                   covering the rear hes shining his phaserbeacon into
                   the empty darkness he cant help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   environmental control room  that seems to be where
                   the action is as he turns his beacon moves with him
                   throwing the corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness

                                           worf

                              reconfigured the odn network
                              and rerouted all power on this
                              deck into environmental control

                   as worf speaks ensign hawk turns back but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness something
                   moves in the distance  a shadow the ensign freezes
                   brings his rifle up but did he see it or was it his
                   imagination

                   a tense beat as he waits heart pounding but nothing
                   happens on the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a biomechanistic cable creeping
                   out of the wall which begins slowly heading for the
                   ensigns neck just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him the cable whips out
                   around his neck and yanks him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye  the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it

                   worf turns his head at the sound

                   utter silence except for the hum of the machinery and
                   the frosty breathing of the team

                    two of the borg raise their arms and fire laser
                      bursts out of their arms and wrists taking down two

                   up he barely manages to vanish from view just as the

                   the conclusive blast comes up through the hatch
                   causing worf to duck for a moment

                             vaporized and without it
                             theres no way to launch the ship

                                           picard
                             can you reconstruct the throttle
                             valve

                                           geordi
                             yeah if i knew what it looked
                             like theres probably five
                             hundred ways to design a valve
                             like this

                                           picard
                             we need to launch this ship in
                             under eighteen hours
                                     beat
                             there must be some design
                             schematics blueprints

                                           geordi
                             were tearing this place apart
                             looking for them but the
                             computers are down and the fires
                             destroyed half the filesso
                             far nothing

                   they look at the damage in frustration

                                          geordi
                             if it was just part of the warp
                             drive id know what to do but
                             this its like trying to
                             rebuild orville wrights airplane
                             with canvass and sticks

                   picard thinks remembers something

                                 picard
                             wait a minute

                   moments later picard and geordi are looking at the
                   three clothprinted photographs seen earlier  the
                   headshot of cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three clothprinted photographs seen earlier  the
                   warp ship with people working on it picard spreads
                   them out on the desk

                                           geordi
                             yeah i looked at these already

                   geordi points to a photo of the ship  a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly blocking
                   most of it from view

                                           geordi
                             you can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture

                   picard considers absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket he pulls out the canister of balm
                   scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table

                                           picard
                             could you reconstruct the throttle
                             from a photograph like this if
                             that man wasnt blocking the view

                   geordi thinks it over

                                           geordi
                             maybe
                                     beat
                             sure yeah as long as i could
                             get a clear look at the intake
                             configuration but so far we
                             havent found any other photos

                                           picard
                                     staring at photos
                             if there are other photographs
                             i think i may know how to find
                             them

                                                                            cut to

                   its a while later and the borg are making progress
                   data is strapped to the table panels open on his head
                   and chest three borg drones are working methodically
                   on his innercircuitry the jagged voice of the woman

                             act as a collective consciousness
                             there are no individuals

                   out of the mist that hugs the top of the room descends
                   the borg queen

                   she is unlike any of the borg drones weve ever seen 
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body she has no legs her torso is suspended
                   by a complex rig of cables and hydraulics her face
                   and uppertorso are much more humanoid with the pasty
                   pale white of borg flesh her eyes have a silvery
                   glint to them her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh mechanical surroundings she
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds  organic and
                   mechanical

                   with the soft hiss of hydraulics she lowers herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of datas
                   her features are almost angelic but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an innerdarkness

                             chaos

                   she studies his face with a certain childlike quality

                                           borg queen
                             its unfortunate we will have to
                             destroy you to obtain the

                             you have no idea how close to
                             perfection you are
 
                   she stares at him intently and we get the hint that
                   her interest in data may go beyond simple assimilation
                   she seems fascinated by him data picks up on this

                             how do you define perfection

                   the queen opens her arms slightly clearly indicating
                   herself

                                           borg queen
                             a blending of the organic and the

                             is not one that applies to me i

                             no organic components

                   she looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
                   she mightve just found the chink in datas armor

                                           borg queen
                             have you ever wondered what its
                             like to have flesh

                                           data
                             it is impossible to imagine
                             sensations for which i have no
                             frame of reference
 
                   she smiles

                                          borg queen
                             that can change

                   the queen looks to the three borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command the drones immediately stop working
                   on datas open panels and shift their attention to
                   his right arm one of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on datas uniform exposing his bare arm another then
                   uses a small cutting device to slice off the synthetic
                   skin from datas arm as data prepares himself for the
                   worst

             101   int enterprise corridor                                     101

                   three armored security guards with phaser rifles run
                   into view hit a control panel on the wall a giant
                   emergency bulkhead comes slamming down cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor

                   the security guards turn to run down the hall but then
                   there is a highpitched shriek of wrenching metal
                   they drop to the deck and take combat stances

                                           guard 1
                             set phasers to rotating
                             modulation

                   they make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors explode inward in a blinding flash the
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the borg jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead racing down the corridor toward them the
                   guards fire and when they do the phaser blasts
                   alternate color  red blue green purple orange 
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency

                   the phaser blasts take down a few of the borg but
                   then we see the distinctive personal forcefields of the
                   other borg begin to compensate and the phasers no
                   longer affect them

                                           guard 1
                             thats it theyve adjusted 
                             fall back

                   they turn to run but borg phaser fire lances out from
                   the borg soldiers and rips them apart

                                                                            cut to

                             have to gain access to one of two

                   in town with this much power

             104   int hospital corridor  night                               104

                   picard walks down the hall stops outside a door marked
                   xray processing the red light is on above the
                   door but that means nothing to picard who opens the
                   door and steps inside

                   much like a traditional darkroom trays of chemicals
                   and washes etc but everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbledtogether feel they are
                   developing xrays by hand instead of by machine the
                   room is lit with an amber glow as soon as picard
                   opens the door we hear rubys voice

                                           rubys voice
                             shut that door

                   picard quickly shuts the door behind him looks around
                   the room ruby whos working at a tray of chemicals
                   turns around in fury

                   she pulls down a small pane of glass probably from a
                   window out of a tub of water holds it up to the
                   light and there on the glass is a xray of a mans
                   skull picard moves to her

                   she picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to

                   operating table his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic shell
                   obscured from view clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into borg machinery  liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes a couple of borg drones are moving about the
                   room carrying out various tasks

                   theres been a change since weve been here last
                   there are now several plexiglass cylinders surrounding
                   datas table  each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid which is swirling around every once
                   in awhile something that looks like raw flesh bumps up
                   against the clear plexiglass then disappears again
                   we dont know what these tubes are for but theyre
                   definitely creepy

                   data takes all this in but there is nothing he can do
                   hes still immobilized

                   suddenly the table rotates and begins to move up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling it
                   stops a few feet away and data finds himself faceto
                   face with the borg queen again

                   the borg queen she slithers through the air and down
                   slightly so that she is on the same level as data
                   she looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   datas right arm which opens at her silent command and
                   moves away

                   we can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from datas right arm showing the innerworkings of
                   his android limb  circuitry and servos etc but on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something

                   carrying blood its a delicate fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly mechanical surface

             125   ruby                                                         125

                   moves to the side of the porch and steps into a
                   large enviromental suit a bulky onepiece with gloves
                   and helmet attached

             126   picard                                                       126

                   is a little relieved keeps watching

             127   ruby                                                         127

                   has now encased herself in the thick rubbery suit
                   pulls over a helmet with a gas mask she walks over to
                   an oil drum marked with a distinctive biohazard
                   symbol she carefully opens the lid takes a metal
                   pitcher reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcherfull of toxic waste she closes the lid walks
                   over to the pumpfilter contraption she pours the
                   sludgelike waste into the funnelprimes the pump
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters and then
                   turns the spigot

                   after a beat a trickle of clear liquid starts to come
                   out of the spigot ruby steps back and pulls off the
                   helmet

             128   picard                                                       128

                   watches curious about what shes doing

             129   ruby                                                         129

                   is now out of the biosuit again pulling on her
                   shirt and jeans grabs her jacket turns off the
                   lights in the house and shuts the front door behind
                   her she begins walking toward the windmill

             130   picard                                                       130

                   steps behind the girder stays very still in the
                   shadows waits quietly as ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town after shes
                   gone picard steps out from his hiding place watches
                   her go then quickly heads for rubys house

             131   front porch                                                  131

                   picard opens the front door and goes inside but he
                   doesnt notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   red light starts flashing  some sort of silent alarm

             132   int rubys house  continuous                               132

                   picard enters and closes the door behind him its
                   dark he fumbles around for a light switch finally
                   locates one and a soft golden glow fills the room

                   the house has only one room which functions as a
                   living room kitchen bedroom etc this is also
                   rubys darkroom the windows have been painted black
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo
                   equipment all around but the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large hanging clothprinted
                   photographs they vary in size and shape some are
                   hanging on walls others hang from the ceiling in mid
                   air still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture thats here the absence of paper has forced
                   ruby to print photos on anything she can find 
                   bed sheets shirts pieces of upholstery backs of
                   carpeting etc picard stands there for a moment
                   taking in the scene  hes never been in anyplace
                   quite like this the cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small intensely personal gallery

                   picard moves around the room looking from photo to
                   photo hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo and as he does we get our first close look at
                   rubys images and they tell us a great deal about
                   her

                   she has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly there are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair beauty amongst devastation there
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs 
                   a romantic almost idealistic sense of optimism

                   at one point picard finds a photograph he recognizes
                   its the rustedout hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of resurrection its an ugly decrepit piece
                   of junk but there in the center spotlighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom

                   picard takes in the image for a brief moment then
                   pushes onward goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box begins sorting through them quickly we see
                   prewar photos printed on real paper they show a
                   younger ruby with her parents resurrection the way
                   it used to look ruby with a dog

                   picard pauses frowns gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him he turns around to see

             133   himself                                                      133

                   a three foot photograph of picard is drying in the air
                   behind him

                   ruby mustve taken the photo when picard was on the
                   street talking to scrimm it was taken through a
                   telephoto lens a closeup of picards face  he looks
                   focused determined heroic its a remarkable shot of
                   the captain and even picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image shes captured the essence of the man

                   clickclack the sound of a shotgun being cocked
                   picard freezes slowly turns around to see whos
                   there

             134   rubby                                                        134

                   is standing in the open doorway a shotgun leveled at
                   picard

                                           ruby
                             you should pay closer attention to
                             those little red lights

                   picard glances down at the doorway sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb hes busted

                                           ruby
                             you know id be perfectly
                             justified in shooting you right
                             now

                   picard glances at the photograph of himself

                                           picard
                             id say you already have

                   she perches herself on the arm of a small couch holds
                   the gun loosely but never taking the aim away from
                   picard

                                           ruby

                             plutonium core will begin to

                             entire silo will become so
                             radioactive that no one will be
                             able to come near it for a hundred
                             years

                   ruby eyes him evenly

                             truth that would take five
                             minutes

                   rubys had enough  her temper flares and she gets off
                   the couch takes a threatening step toward picard

                                           ruby
                             no youre a petty burglar and a

                             walking around this town

                   picard jumps in with a quiet forceful quality

                                           picard
                             no hes a man with vision he
                             can see beyond the problems that
                             surround us he knows theres a
                             better future out there for
                             everyone a future where crime
                             poverty and war are things of the
                             past a future where we reach
                             out and seek our destiny in the
                             stars

                             will never happen

                   she eyes him for a moment  and were not sure if his
                   words have had any effect

                   ruby still has her doubts but decides to go with her
                   gutand finally hands him the photographs picard
                   glances through them  his expression tells us the
                   photo he needs is in there

                                           picard
                             you wont regret this

                   they share a look and then picard turns and walks
                   off into the night ruby watches him go and we can

                   a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized

                   riker hits another control and the outer airlock door
                   slides open revealing the vast vacuum of space they

                   as riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section its a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures with weapons at the ready

                   as they approach the edge worf gives a hand signal
                   and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
                   deployment and drops down onto their bellies they
                   crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause
                   worf looks at riker who looks a little queasy

                   theres no up or down in space and their magnetized
