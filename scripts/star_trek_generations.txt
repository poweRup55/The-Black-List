a vast and sparkling starfield a pinpoint of light appears and starts
moving toward the camera a small and distant cylindrical object
tumbling end over end but we cant determine exactly what it is yet

2	ext wheatfield day2

a vast and undulating sea of wheat we become aware that there are two
heads sticking out of the stalks of wheat two men standing and looking
up at the sky as we move towards them we can see that the two men are
scotty and chekov dressed in civilian clothing

chekov
points to sky
there he is there to the south

scotty
peers upward
what are ye blind thats a bird

as they stare up at the sky

3	ext space vfxi	 3

the cylinder tumbling through space is now closer and we can now see
that it is a bottle of some sort and it is tumbling directly toward the
camera

as before chekov and scotty staring at the sky

scotty
concerned
repelling the crystalline trench rafting down lava flows orbital
skydivingits like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the
galaxy

suddenly we hear a double sonic boom

chekov
that should be him now i think hes just crossed the sound barrier

they shield their eyes against the sun and look up

the bottle gets closer

6	ext wheatfield day6

a man in a hightech body harness and parachute lands in the wheat flat
on his back his bodysuit is charred scorched wisps of smoke still
curling off it there are small thrusters attached to his backpack and
boots scotty and chekov move to him the man removes his helmet it is
kirk he smiles broadly like a child who has just come off a
rollercoaster

kirk
right on target i jump out over the arabian peninsula and i end up
here right on the dime

kirk gets to his feet

chekov
actually captain your precise target area was thirtyfive meters
pointsthat way

kirk
thanks for pointing that out

kirk starts to pull off his suit reacts to a sudden pain in his back

kirk
oh

scotty
ive warned ye about that back of yours you should have a doctor take a
look at it

kirk waves him away and continues to remove his harness

kirk scotty and chekov as before

kirk
tomorrow i want to make a trielliptical jump thats where you jump out
over northern china and make three complete orbits before you start
reentry

chekov
captain perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening
ceremony

this strikes a nerve with kirk we see a flash of hesitation and
irritation cross his face

kirk
im not going beat scotty help me with this chute

scotty
what do you mean youre not going we promised

kirk
when i retired i swore id never set foot on a starship again and i
meant it

chekov

kirk
firm
i dont want to hear anymore about it im not going and thats final

close on a set of turbolift doors as they slide open to reveal kirk
scotty and chekov a bright light shines into their faces and they
react move to reveal that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
camera with a small bank of lights attached to it the camera is a
holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operators head
there are four journalists clustered in front of the turbolift one
associated with the camera the others using padds to make notations

also clustered around the door are the bridge crew of the
enterprisebeveryone is applauding as kirk and the others blink under
the bright lights and enter the bridge

journalists
overlapping
captain kirk how does it feel to be back on the enterprise bridge8a
captain can i have a minute captain scott do you have any comment on
commander chekov

captain john harriman pushes through the crowd

harriman
excuse me excuse me8a there will be plenty of time for questions
later

the journalists edge away and the cameraman moves to get a good angle

harriman
contd to all
im captain john harriman id like to welcome you all aboard

kirk
its our pleasure

harriman is young confident eager this is his first command and he
takes it very seriously

harriman
i just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living
legends with us on our maiden voyage beat i remember reading about
your missions when i was in grade school

the original enterprise officers all stop and give him a look harriman
looks a little embarrassed he didnt mean to insult them but kirk
gives him a little smile lets it roll off

kirk
well may we have a look around

harriman
please please

chekov sees someone in the background calls out to her

chekov
demora

chekov moves off

journalist
breezy
so captain8a this is the first starship enterprise in thirty years
withoutjames t kirk in command how do you feel about that

the journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve kirks eyes flash for
amoment the longer hes on this bridge the more he realizes he doesnt
feel good about it at all he tries to shrug it off with a smile

kirk
just fine im glad to be here to send her on her way

he tries to move away from the journalist who dogs him

journalist
what have you been doing since you retired

kirk
ive been keeping busy

at this point chekov approaches with a young midtwenties attractive
asian female ensign named demora

chekov
to kirk
excuse me captain id like you to meet the helmsman of the
enterpriseb ensign demora sulu captain james kirk

demora
its a pleasure to meet you sir my fathers told me some interesting
stories about you

kirk is shocked for a long moment he stares at her in amazement

kirk
your father hikaru sulu is your father

demora
yes sir

chekov
you met her once before but she was

chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height

kirk
but that wasnt so long ago it couldnt have been more than

chekov
twelve years sir

kirk
yes well congratulations ensign it wouldnt be the enterprise
without a sulu at the helm

demora
thank you sir to chekov let me show you the new inertial guidance
system

demora and chekov move off and kirk looks after them for a long beat
the expression on his face changes from shock to sadness something is
clearly bothering him scotty moves over to kirk with a smile on his
face

scotty
to kirk
damn fine ship if you ask me

but kirks mind is still on demora he watches her as she moves to the
helmsmans position

kirk
you know scotty it amazes me

scotty
and what would that be sir

kirk
sulu when did he find the time for a family

scotty
its like you always said if somethings important enough you make the
time

kirk nods absently scotty realizes something

scotty
so thats why youve been running around the galaxy like an
eighteenyearold finding retirement a little lonely are we

kirk gives him a look

kirk
with that kind of tact im glad youre an engineer and not a
psychiatrist

harriman interrupts

harriman
excuse me gentlemen if youll take your seats

kirk
oh of course

10	 new angle	10

revealing that three chairs have been neatly arranged to one side

scotty kirk and chekov all take their seats the journalists take
positions on the opposite side of the bridge harriman moves to the
command chair and the rest of the bridge crew go to their stations

harriman
to all
prepare to leave spacedock aft thrusters ahead one quarter port and
starboard at station keeping beat captain kirk id be honored if you
would give the order to get underway

kirk
no no thank you

harriman
please i insist

all eyes on kirk he has little choice he stands uncomfortably there
is a moment of anticipation

kirk
to all
take us out

everyone breaks into applause kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and
annoyance

chekov

a short time later harriman turns to his guests

harriman
well weve just cleared the asteroid belt our course will take us
outbeyond pluto and then back to spacedock just a quick run around the
block beat if we have time well conduct a few tests of the warp

suddenly the communications console starts to beep the com officer hits
a few commands in response

com officer
to harriman
were picking up a distress call captain

this grabs everyones attention

harriman
on speakers

we hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent

com voice
fritzed
this is the transport ship lakul were caught in some kind of
energydistortion we cant break free need immediate help it
tearing us

the voice is drowned out by static the science officer checks something
on his console the journalist with the holocamera turns on his light
and pans it around to capture the action

science officer
the lakul is one of two ships transporting elaurian refugees to earth

harriman blinks a couple of times surprised at this unexpected turn of
events kirk watches him intently harriman clears his throat then
turns to demora

harriman
can you locate them

demora
the ships are bearing at 310 mark 215 distance three light years

harriman
signal the closest starship were in no condition to mount a rescue we
dont even have a full crew aboard

the navigator checks his console

navigator
were the only one in range sir

the holocamera light is shined on harriman as he shifts in his seat
hesitant to take the plunge kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on
his leg finally harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a
bit

harriman
well then i guess its up to us to demora helm lay in an intercept
course and engage at maximum warp

kirk fidgets in his chair itching to get in on the action his
instincts taking over scotty shoots him a sidelong glance

scotty
is there something wrong with your chair captain

kirk gives him a look

13	 ext space enterpriseb vfxi	 13

the ship snaps into warp

a few minutes later demora is watching her console

demora
were within visual range of the energy distortion captain

harriman
on screen

15	 include viewscreen vfxi	 15

which now shows a huge ribbon of crackling energy directly ahead of the
enterpriseb everyone reacts to the bizarre sight

chekov
what the hell is that

demora
off console
ive found the transport ships

15a	include viewscreen vfxi	 15a

the viewscreen now shows two transport ships trapped like insects in the
violent torrent of energy the ships are being buffeted and thrown about
by large tendrils of crackling energy

demora
contd
their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress they wont survive
much longer

the ship suddenly shakes the navigator works his console

navigator
were encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy
ribbon

harriman
well have to keep our distance we dont want to get pulled in too

harriman frowns at the screen trying to figure out what to do kirk can
barely contain himself to him the answer is obvious he blurts out the
answer

kirk
tractor beam

scotty quickly elbows him in the side this isnt kirks ship kirk
shuts upharriman glances at kirk

harriman
we dont have a tractor beam

kirk
you left spacedock without a tractor beam

harriman
it wont be installed until tuesday beat ensign sulu try generating
a subspace field around the ships that might break them free

demora
aye sir

when kirk hears this order he shakes his head slightly and mouths the
word no under his breath he knows that wont work

demora
shakes her head
theres too much quantum interference captain

harriman frowns again trying to come up with another solution but it
isnt easy its his first day in command his ship is undermanned and
illprepared its a nightmare come true kirk is itching to get in on
this his fingers digging into the arms of his chair but he restrains
himself

harriman
what about8a venting plasma from the warp nacelles that might disrupt
theribbons hold on the ships

navigator
aye sir releasing drive plasma

a tense beat harriman glances over at the journalists then glances
over at kirk kirk goves him a pained smile trying to be encouraging
even though he knows this is not the right course of action

navigator
its not having any effect sir i think

demora
sir the starboard vessels hull is collapsing

15b	include viewscreen vfxi	 15b

suddenly the righthand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery
tendril of energy and it explodes the other ship continues to be thrown
about and buffeted everyone reacts with shock on the bridge

  chekov
how many people were aboard that ship

demora
two hundred sixtyfive

  harriman pales at the sight seems shellshocked by the struction
of the ship hes overwhelmed now at a genuine loss as to what to do
next

demora
urgent
the lakuls hull integrity is down to twelve percent sir

harriman looks over at kirk who has remained quiet during this entire
sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young
captain this is a delicate moment harriman doesnt want to look
incapable but at the same time he needs help

harriman
captain kirk i would appreciate any suggestions you might have

kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle he moves down to
stand next to harriman

kirk
sotto
first move us within transporter range and beam those people to the
enterprise

harriman looks at him with surprise

harriman
what about the gravimetric distortions theyll tear us apart

kirk
gently
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair

kirk gives him a supportive look harriman buckles down and grimly looks
at the image on the screen

harriman
helm close to within transporter range

kirk glances at the cameraman whos still shining the light on them

kirk
and second turn that damned thing off

chekov turns to the two journalists

chekov

the lieutenant is having problems at the aft console

lieutenant
sir im having trouble locking onto them they appear to be in some
sort of temporal flux

kirk turns to scotty

kirk

scotty quickly moves to look at the transporter console

ofthe elaurian race humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing the
survivors are in various states of shock many sit on the floor staring
into middle distance some lie on tables unconscious others are
mumbling incoherently to themselves chekov and the journalists are
moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as
the ship is rocked and flung about chekov has a tricorder

chekov
it will be all right were going to take care of you

he looks at the tricorder

chekov
off tricorder
only minor injuries so far beat but it looks like theyre all
suffering from some kind of neural shock

one journalist moves past a man sitting on a biobed with a dazed look on
his face he has a nasty looking wound on one side of his face we will
learn later that this man is named doctor soran

the journalist is about to turn away when suddenly soran grabs him
roughly clearly a man of great strength and pulls him close sorans
eyes are suddenly wild crazed

soran
why why

journalist
its all right youre safe8a youre on the enterprise

soran
no i have to go i have to get back you dont understand let me go

soran begins to attack the journalist but before he can do any real
damage chekov injects soran with a hypospray and soran falls
unconscious

journalist
what was he talking about

suddenly a woman with her back toward us stumbles nearby chekov quickly
grabs her arm and catches her before she falls

chekov
easy there

the woman turns around and we see her face for the first time its
guinan she seems dazed and confused chekov smiles at her warmly

its going to be okay here just lie down

but i do have a theory

kirk
i thought you might

scotty
an antimatter discharge directly ahead8a it might disrupt the field
long enough for us to break away

kirk

scotty
aye

kirk
quickly to demora
load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command

demora turns to him

demora
captain we dont have any torpedoes

kirk glances at harriman

kirk
dont tell metuesday

harriman heads for the turbolift and there is a moment as kirk is
sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the captains
chair one more time but he pulls himself back before harriman can exit

kirk
no8a a captains place is on the bridge of his ship beat ill take
care of it

complete with cocked hats epaulettes etc the crew is standing at
attention the wind whistles through the rigging the timbers creak

picard grimly looks over his crew then nods to riker

as worf is brought on deck by troi and la forge worf is shackled by
hand and leg irons troi and la forge hold him by either arm and shove
him toward thecaptain the drum roll stops picard moves to worf and
peers at him closely

picard
mr worf i always knew this day would come are you prepared to face
the charges

worf doesnt answer and troi jabs him in the side

troi
answer him

worf
i am prepared

picard looks to riker who then pulls out a large rolled piece of
parchment he opens the scroll and begins to read from it in the bg
la forge removes worfs shackles

riker
we the officers and crew of the uss enterprise being of sound mind
and judgment hereby make the following charges against lieutenant worf
one that he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the
call of duty on countless occasions two that he has been a good and
solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years and three
most seriously that he has earned the respect and admiration of the
entire crew

riker puts away the scroll

picard
there can be only one punishment for such crimes beat i hereby
promote you to the rank of lieutenant commander with all the rights and
privilegesthereto and may god have mercy on your soul

everyone roars in approval picard smiles at worf and shakes his hand

picard
contd
congratulations commander

worf
smiles
thank you sir

picard continues to smile at him for a moment then riker steps in

riker
extend the plank

worfs face registers surprise as everyone grabs him and hauls him
toward the side where a long plank is being pushed out over the water

crewmembers
into the sea with him feed him to the sharks walk the plank

picard gives riker a questioning look

picard
dont you think youre taking this a little too far number one

riker
when we went to ancient rome for deannas promotion we threw her to the
lions remember

picard shrugs it off its not exactly his cup of tea but hell go
along with it

worf is hustled to the rail where crusher is waiting patiently by the
plank holding a long pike worf is put on the plank and crusher prods
him with the pike until worf is nearly at the end

worf finally stops and turns around

worf
a shout
wait

everyone falls silent a moment worf looks over the side at the water
below

worf
a little embarrassed
i cant swim

la forge
calmly to worf
the holodeck safety program is engaged the computer wont let you
drown

crusher
but the sharks are quite convincing

crusher prods him with the pike and worf falls into the sea with a huge
splash everyone laughs and cheers reveal data who is standing near
the side rail looking a little confused at the reaction

data
to crusher
doctor i must confess i am uncertain as to why pushing someone into
freezing sharkinfested water is amusing
crusher
its all done in good fun data get in the spirit of things

data
ah

data thinks a moment then he lifts crusher with one hand and hold her
over the rail

crusher

data lets go and crusher plummets into the ocean data looks around no
one is laughing they all look a little surprised

data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd hes more confused than
ever

back in uniform holding phasers and palm beacons worf has a tricorder
and crusher has a medical kit the room is cramped there are fallen
bulkheads and blown out consoles the debris makes it difficult to get
a clear view of the room

worf
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors

well that narrows it to klingon breen or romulan

crusher follows her tricorder readings

that rules out klingons

riker gives him a look

they pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station and
come to the body of a starfleet science officer he has taken a
disruptor blast to the back and there is a nastylooking scorch mark on
his uniform crusher immediately takes some devices out of her medical
kit and begins to treat him

no but id stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you i still dont

data frowns troubled by this recent experience he puts spot down and
moves to a bulkhead he activates a control panel and a small

suspended in a glass and metal framework data looks at the chip for a

that is true however i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has

riker
we found two dead romulans aboard the station were analyzing their
equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from

picard nods absently

picard
theres still no indication of why they attacked the station

riker
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the
place apart

picard
hmm beat inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan
threat in this sector

riker
you want me to contact starfleet

picard
is there a problem

riker
no sir

thank you number one

picard keeps his back turned looking out the window riker hesitates

everyone else in the room picard walks up to the table

picard

soran
yes yes captain thank you for coming

the men skake hands and picard sits down soran is an imposing physical
presence but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists
consumed with his work picard waves away a waiter

picard
nothing for me brusque to soran i understand theres something
urgent you need to discuss with me

soran
yes i need to return to the observatory immediately i must continue a
critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star

picards reaction is a little impatient this doesnt sound that
imperative to him

picard
doctor were still conducting an investigation into the attack once
weve completed our work well be happy to allow you and your fellow
scientists back aboard the observatory until then

soran
the timing is very important on my experiment if it is not completed
within the next twelve hours years of research will be lost

picard
were doing the best we can now if youll excuse me

picard moves to stand but soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs
him by the arm the unexpected physical contact and the change of
intensity in sorans face stops picard in his tracks

soran
cryptically
they say time is the fire in which we burn and right now captain my
time is running out beat we leave so many things unfinished in our
lives im sure you can understand

for some reason sorans words have struck a deep chord within picard
he looks away from sorans compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment
when he finally speaks his voice is barely above a whisper

picard
ill see what i can do

picard walks away without a word before soran can thank him soran looks
after him with relief then pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens

equipment near a console worf is talking to riker

worf activates a monitor which shows a complex diagram of sensor
information

worf
one of the dead romulans had a tricorder we analyzed its sensor logs
and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound
called trilithium

riker
trilithium

worf
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on in theory a
trilithiumbased explosive would be thousands of times more powerful
than an antimatter weapon but they never found a way to stabilize it

riker
why were they looking for it on a federation observatory it doesnt

at one probe which has several odd devices attached to the side

the picards that fought at trafalgar the picards that settled the first
martian colony when my brother married and had a son

picard hesitates this is difficult for him

you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family
line

my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own
selfish needs

space its a doorway it leads to another place the nexus it doesnt
exist in our universe and it doesnt play by the same rules either

re visor
a remarkable piece of equipment but a little inelegant wouldnt you
say beat have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you
look a little morenormal

whats normal

soran
normal is what everyone else is and what you are not

what do you want

soran takes a moment

soran
as you may or may not be aware i am an elaurian some people call us a

my undivided attention i want to listen to everything you know about

its a derivative of

soran picks up the padd from the desk and activates it suddenly
something small with sharp edges can be seen moving just underneath la
forges skin near his chest la forge moves his hand to the spot but
then the protrusion is suddenly gone

soran
i dont want a science lecture you were on that observatory looking for
trilithium why

la forge
i was ordered to by the captain

on the padd in sorans hand we can now see an interior graphic of la
forges body sitting in the chair the graphic is interactive moving as
la forge moves a blinking dot represents the movement of the probe
inside his body right now the dot is in the middle of his chest

soran
lets try to move beyond the usual prisonerinterrogator banter shall
we you have information and i need it beat did the captain explain
his orders to you did he say why you were searching for trilithium

la forge
no

soran
what about guinan what has she told you about me

la forge
guinan i dont know what youre talking about

on the padd we now see the dot has moved to a position next to la
forges heart soran looks up at la forge

soran
my instincts tell me youre lying and i know that cant be easy for
you off padd i can see you have a good heart

soran taps a control on the padd suddenly la forge grabs his chest in
pain soran watches la forge for a few seconds then taps the padd
again la forge gasps and starts to breathe

soran
oh i forgot to tell you while you were unconscious i injected a
nanoprobe into your bloodstream its been navigating your
cardiovascular system and right now ive attached it to your left
ventricle smiles a little trick i picked up from the borg

la forge
gasping
yeah theyre full of great ideas

soran
i just stopped your heart for five seconds it felt like an eternity
didnt it did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten
minutes before the onset of brain damage

la forge
no i didnt know that

soran
we learn something new about ourselves every day beat now maybe i
didnt make myself clear it is very important that you tell me exactly
what captain picard knows

la forge
i told you everything you might as well just kill me right now

sorans features soften as he smiles slightly for a moment he looks
genuinely compassionate and its a disturbing contrast to his usual
dark intensity

a room filled with exoticlooking devices sensors and computers which
handle the enormous task of tracking the ships position in space the
monitors around the room display various diagrams of the energy ribbon
as seen in the beginning of the film

data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of
complex information on the screen picard is standing next to him
throughout the following data seems distracted and preoccupied

according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy
which travels through our galaxy every 391 years

picard

data doesnt answer right away

picard

data
sorry captain the ribbon has already entered the galaxy it will pass
through this sector in approximately thirtyone hours

picard moves about the room hes frustrated tired but determined to
find out whats going on

picard
guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon if thats true
then there must be some connection with the amargosa star

data
the stars destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within
this sector however none of them appear to have a connection to the
energy ribbon

picard
give me a list of those effects i want to know every single thing which
has been altered or changed no matter how insignificant

data
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information

data works the computer and then the computer begins to work data
sighs his expression becomes downcast and gloomy he sits down and puts
his head in his hands picard finally has to say something

picard

data
no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am
overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on
the observatory

picard
what do you mean

data
i wanted to save geordi i tried but i experienced something i did not
expect beat i believe it was fear

picard regards him sympathetically

picard
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome its something we all have
to learn to deal with

data
but i did not deal with it sir i let it prevent me from helping my
friend beat does that make me a coward

picard
no and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another
emotion which i believe youre beginning to experience guilt

guilt it is a most unpleasant feeling

according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa
star has had the following effects in this sector gamma emissions have
increased by 05 percent the starship bozeman was forced to make a
course correction a research project on gorik iv was halted due to
increased neutrino particles ambient magnetic fields have decreased by

picard
wait the bozemanwhy did it change course

data
matter of fact
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational
forces throughout the sector any ship passing through this region will
have to make a minor course correction

picard is starting to get an idea hes onto something here he moves to
a large table in the center of the room

finally has to lay down the law

right now i need your full attention on the task at hand if you cant
provide it then ill have to relieve you of duty until doctor crusher
can remove this emotion chip of yours im sorry but you leave me no
other choice

this snaps data back he considers this for a long moment then looks
determined

i do not wish to remove the chip sir although these emotions are
proving difficult to deal with i cannot imagine going back to a life
without them i have taken an important step toward becoming truly
human if i were to turn back now beat i would like to continue in

try to alter its path why not simply fly into it with a ship

data thinks for a moment

our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has
either been destroyed or severely damaged

picard thinks about this then has a flash of insight

gaily decorated christmas tree sparkling with hundreds of lights

a 24thcentury french living room it is beautifully decorated with
lights ornaments holly brightly wrapped presents are clustered
beneath the christmas tree there are five children standing and sitting
in the room all looking at picard with bright smiling faces waiting
for him to say something

picard stares at the scene for a moment unsure how to react then we
hear a womans voice and we move to reveal an attractive woman in her
forties standing next to picard

woman
go on say something theyre waiting

picard is stunned

picard
i dont know what to say

one of the children a young girl speaks up

girl
say merry christmas papa

picard
in a daze
merry christmas

the children break out into applause the woman kisses him on the cheek
then steers him to a large overstuffed chair picard sits down and the
children starts handing out presents with much laughter and chatting

children
this ones for you wheres mine i hope this is the book i asked for
take this one to papa

as the activity swirls around him picard begins to feel an immense
sense of satisfaction and happiness its like a drug an overwhelming
feeling of joy and contentment fills picard its a wondrous experience
he settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across his face for
reasons he cannot name and does not even want to understand at the
moment he is very very happy

girl
to picard
isnt the tree beautiful papa

picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in the world

picard
oh yes8a yes its astonishingly beautiful all of it

all of the children now crowd around the chair with a single large gift
and hand it to picard one of the younger boys speaks up

young boy
this is from all of us

picard
thank you i cant imagine what it is

picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19thcentury sextant an
oldfashioned nautical navigational instrument its a beautiful piece
with polished and gleaming brass

young boy
excited
its a sacktent

picard eyes it with delight

picard
you mean a sextant and its a handsome one at that from about 1820
id say wherever did you find it

girl
its a secret

picard
smiles
oh a secret well that makes it a doubly special gift thank you
thank you all

the children react with pleasure they cluster around him showering him
with hugs and kisses

children
merry christmas papa i love you etc

picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection the children pull
back and return to their own presents there is a swirl of activity and
commotion as a warm and heartfelt christmas morning is played out

woman
to picard
ill go get dinner ready theyll be starving in a minute

picard nods as the woman exits the room he looks around the scene
utterly happy utterly content

the children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as picards
eye falls on the glorious christmas tree he cant help but smile as he
looks over the ornaments and decorations

of the sparkling lights and ornaments a swirl of color and light

157	picard157

his eye is caught by something in particular on the tree he leans
forward slightly and stares at it

158	picards pov vfxp158

his eye has been caught by an ornament hanging near the top of the tree
it is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny light in the center
in the shape of a star as picard watches the star suddenly goes out
and it radiates a shimmering light effect that expands outward into the
glass sphere

its a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of
the star going out as seen earlier in the film but this is just
coincidence this is the way the ornament was designed and its simply
one of many ornaments on the tree

159	picard159

reacts the image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him
somewhere it has reminded him of something hed nearly forgotten a
discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene he frowns
the reverie momentarily disrupted but he tries to push it aside not
wanting the spell to be broken he stands and turns away from the tree
and looks out a nearby window its snowing and the beautiful image of
snow soothes him for a moment then he reacts to something

160	picards pov vfxp160

reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament its still
blinking picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away
he cant hide from it

picard
no this isnt right this cant be real

its as real as you want it to be

picard turns to see

standing before him she is wearing the same outfit seen in the
beginning of the film on the enterpriseb as they talk the children
and the woman continue to move about their business as if picard and
guinan arent there

picard is stunned

picard
guinan whats going on where am i

guinan
youre in the nexus

picard looks around

picard
this is the nexus

guinan
for you this is where you wanted to be

picard
but i never had a wife children a home like this

guinan
enjoy them jeanluc

picard tries to make sense of it he focuses on guinan

picard
guinan what are you doing here i thought you were on the enterprise

guinan
i am on the enterprise i am also here off his puzzled look think of
me as an echo of the person you know a part she left behind

picard
left behind

guinan
when the enterpriseb beamed us off the lakul we were partially in the
nexus the transporters locked on to us but somehow everyone left a
part of themselves behind

picard
soran

guinan
all of us

picard
where is he now

guinan
wherever he wanted to be

guinan smiles at him

boys voice
papa help me build my castle

picard glances over at the boy who is building a play castle out of the
24thcentury equivalent of lego for a moment picard is tempted to
drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy

picard
to boy
in a few minutes

picard looks around at the children the lure to stay here becoming more
powerful

picard
continuing awed to guinan
these are my childrenmy children

guinan
smiles
yeah theyre great arent they you can go back and see them born go
forward and see your grandchildren time has no meaning here

womans voice
dinners ready lets go

theres a general rush toward the adjacent dining room the youngest boy
looks at picard goes over to him and takes his hand

boy
papa are you coming

picard looks down into the face of his child his heart swells the
temptation to stay here and live this out is profound almost in a
trance he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room his
eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment
hes torn between the two images and then in one of the most difficult
moments of his life he bends down to the child

picard
go on go on without me

the boy looks at him quizzically for a moment then obeys his father and
dashes off toward the dining room to join the others picard straightens
up and tries to steel his voice

picard
guinan can i leave the nexus

guinan
why would you want to leave

picard
insistent
can i

guinan
yes where would you go

picard
i dont understand

guinan
i told you time has no meaning here if you leave you can go anywhere
any time

picard realizes the opportunity before him

picard
i know exactly where i want to go and when back to that mountaintop on
veridian iii before soran put out the star i have to stop him

guinan
what makes you think things will be any different this time

picard
youre right ill need help beat guinan will you come back with me
together we could

guinan
i cant leave im already there remember

picard looks crestfallen for a moment guinan gives him an enigmatic
smile

guinan
i know just the guy

suddenly theres the cry of a hawk from os picard turns at the sound

162	ext kirks home day 162

picard finds himself standing outside a rustic but architecturally
striking house with spectacular views in the canadian rockies a hawk is
circling overhead making the crying sound that picard heard the air is
cold frigid picard can see his breath picard is just starting to
adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood
being chopped from around the corner of the house picard moves to look
around the corner and sees james t kirk hes still in his uniform and
looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the enterpriseb
at the beginning of the film he is vigorously chopping wood with an
axe hes enjoying himself lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
labor hes never felt this good in his life theres no trace of back
pain or any other ailment picard recognizes the famous captain as
would any 24thcentury starfleet officer

picard
james kirk

kirk pauses looks up at the strange man before him his expression is
wondrous almost childlike like in picards christmas sequence kirk
is immersed in the sensual feeling of the nexus its like a dream that
has overpowered him

kirk
beautiful day isnt it

picard
yes yes it is

kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile

kirk
do you mind

it takes picard a beat before he realizes that kirk wants him to put the
log on the chopping block for him

picard
oh

picard places the log on the block and kirk gives it a vigorous chop
with the axe

picard
captain do you realize that

but kirk interrupts as he sees something oc

kirk
wait a second i think somethings burning

picard follows his look to see smoke billowing out of one of the windows
of the house kirk rushes into the house and picard follows

163	int kirks home kitchen day continuous	 163

kirk rushes in the kitchens decor is 19thcentury with a few
23rdcentury touches copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably
with computer consoles and starfleet paraphernalia picard hesitates in
the doorway a little unsure about rushing into some strangers house

kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove its very hot he
quickly sets it down near the sink waves the smoke away with his hand

kirk
looks like someone was cooking eggs to picard come on in its all
right this is my house or at least it used to be i sold it years ago

picard comes in and tries to orient kirk to whats going on

picard
im captain jeanluc picard of the starship enterprise

before kirk can react to this remark an antique clock on a shelf chimes
as it strikes the hour kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock
in surprise and wonder he is entranced by this experience beginning to
connect with things and memories from his past

kirk
this clock i gave this clock to bones

picard
pressing on
im from what you would consider the future the 24thcentury

kirk hears what picard is saying but like picard in his fantasy he is
more interested in the sights and sounds around him a dog barks from
oc they both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
kirk with enthusiasm

kirk
affectionately
jake jake you miserable old mutt how can you be here to picard
hes been dead seven years

kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a womans
voice from somewhere upstairs that stops kirk in his tracks as she
speaks we can see the shock on kirks face

antonias voice
come on jim im starving how long are you going to be rattling around
that kitchen

a beat

kirk
amazed
thats antonia

kirk looks at the food on the stove hes beginning to realize
something

kirk
wait a minute

kirk glances at picard

kirk
the futurewhat are you talking about this is the past

kirk moves to a drawer and opens it inside is a horseshoe with a tiny
red bow tied to it this confirms things for kirk he picks up the
horseshoe

kirk
this is nine years ago the day i told her i was going back to
starfleet

kirk is swept up in the moment overwhelmed by memeories sensations
feelings he goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with
a sudden burst of recognition

kirk
these were ktarian eggs her favorite i was cooking them to soften the
blow re horseshoe and i gave her this

picard steps in

picard
i know how real this must seem to you but its not this isnt really
your house weve both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus

but kirks mind is clearly elsewhere hes being swept away by the
emotion of the moment realizing the opportunity he suddenly has

kirk
dill weed

kirk indicates a shelf as if asking picard to go to it

kirk
theres a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left right
behind the nutmeg

kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs he cracks open
two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast picard
waits for a moment then goes to the shelf grabs the dill weed and
hands it to kirk

picard
how long have you been here

kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs

kirk
i dont know i was on the enterpriseb in the deflector control
roomkeep stirring these will you

kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray
picard is getting a little impatient but stirs the eggs anyway

kirk
the bulkhead in front of me disappeared then i was out there chopping
wood back to stove thanks

kirk takes the pan of eggs back from picard

picard
history records that you died saving the enterpriseb from an energy
ribbon eighty years ago

but picards words mean almost nothing to kirk he is thoroughly
enjoying himself and picard is almost a distraction kirk begins serving
the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
tray

kirk
amused
so youre telling me this is the 24thcentury and im dead

picard
not exactly as i said this is some kind of

kirk
temporal nexus yeah i heard you frowns at tray somethings missing

then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster as if on cue
two slices of toast pop out kirk grins and puts the toast on the
plates kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door

picard
captain i need your help i want you to leave the nexus with me

kirk goes out of the kitchen and picard follows

164	int kirks home living room day continuous164

kirk and picard both on the move kirk heading for a staircase

picard
we have to go back to a planet called veridian iii and stop a man from
destroying a star there are millions of lives at stake

kirk tries to keep it light hoping this man will go away

kirk
you said history considers me dead who am i to argue with history

picard
youre a starfleet officer and you have a duty to

kirk
hard
i dont need to be lectured by you i was out saving the galaxy when
your grandfather was still in diapers and frankly i think the galaxy
owes me one beat i was like you once so worried about duty and
obligations that i couldnt see anything past this uniform and in the
end what did it get me nothing not this time

kirk brushes past picard and stops at the foot of the stairs

kirk
looking up the stairs
im going to walk up these stairs march into that bedroom and tell
antonia that i want to marry her

kirk begins to climb the stairs

kirk
this time things are going to be different

he goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him picard glances
around the room in frsutration then gets a determined look on his face
and marches up the stairs after kirk grasps the doorknob opens it and
steps through the door into

165	int barn day continuous	 165

picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn
straw on the floor farm implements on the walls sunlight streaming in
through the slats there are stalls in the barn with a few horses
visible kirk is standing a short distance away he looks surprised as
well and he is no longer holding his tray of food

picard
re barn
this doesnt look like your bedroom

kirk looks around for a moment the pieces starting to fall into place
he smiles with a growing realization

kirk
no no its not its better

picard
better

kirk
this is my uncles barn in iowa

he points to a horse with a saddle on it

kirk
re horse
i took that horse out for a ride seven years ago on a spring day

kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring
day

kirk
just like this if im right this is the day i met antonia

he turns to picard

kirk
this nexus of yours is very clever i can start all over again do
things right from day one

kirk grabs the horse swings up onto the saddle and rides out of the
barn filled with excitement picard watches him for a moment then
looks at one of the other horses in the barn he makes a decision and
then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall
cut to

166	ext countryside day vfxp 166

kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside and across a stream
through a thicket of trees and finally out onto a rolling plain there
is a large ravine up ahead kirk sees it and smiles tightly he spurs
his horse faster toward the ravine the horse is tearing along comes up
to the edge of the precipice and makes a daring leap to the other side

horse and rider land together and kirk spurs the horse on but as he
rides we begin to see a change come over him a look of doubt crosses
his face somethings not right he slows the horse to a trot and then
to a complete stop he sits there for a moment and frowns turns and
looks back at the ravine which is now a fair distance away something
about that jump is nagging at him

he turns his horse around and then digs in his heels the horse breaks
into a gallop racing back toward the ravine kirk grips the reins tight
in his hands and then the horse makes the leap across yet again

this time when kirk lands he brings his horse to an immediate stop we
can see on his face that something is very wrong he turns and stares at
the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face

in the distance picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own
he stops next to kirk there is a long quiet moment as the two men sit
there side by side kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
feelings

kirk
re ravine
i must have made this jump fifty times and every time it scared the
hell out of me but not this time beat because its not real

a quiet beat kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the
distance shading his eyes against the bright sun picard follows his
gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a woman walking her horse

picard
re woman
antonia

kirk
nods
shes not real either is she nothing here is nothing here matters

all euphoria is now gone from kirk its a moment of selfrevelation he
glances around

kirk
its kinda like orbital skydiving exciting for a few minutes but in
the end you havent really done anything you havent made a
difference

kirk takes a beat then looks at picard and in a way hes truly seeing
him for the first time

kirk
captain of the enterprise huh

picard
thats right

kirk
close to retirement

picard
i hadnt planned on it

there is a passion and a fervor in kirk that we havent seen until now

kirk
well let me tell you something dont dont let them promote you
dont
let them transfer you dont let anything take you off the bridge of
that ship beat because while youre there you can make a difference

the two captains face each other for a moment picard hears what kirk is
saying but also knows thats not the whole story picard gives him a
direct look and there is something in picards eyes a glint of resolve
and determination

picard
you dont need to be on the bridge of a starship come with me help me
stop soran beat make a difference again

a long silent beat as kirk considers picard and slowly unexpectedly
a smile spreads across his face

kirk
how can i argue with the captain of the enterprise what was the name of
that planet8a veridian iii

picard
thats right

kirk
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim

picard
you could say that

kirk
musing
of course if spock were here hed say i was being an irrational
illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that

and for the first time we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us
jim kirk is back

kirk
sounds like fun

the two men turn and walk away from antonia and as they walk a roar of
color and sound washes out the screen as seen before

on the issues of life and death

picard
its not how many years youve lived will but how youve lived them

our lives but maybe time is also a companion who goes with us on our
journey and reminds us to cherish the moments of our lives because they
will never come again beat we are after all only mortal

a quiet moment riker finally smiles

riker
