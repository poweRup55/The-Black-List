                   it is snowing now and the wind wails as saavik and
                   david appear and come forward into a close shot the
                   life sign sound of their tricorder is beeping faster
                   now as they peer ahead into the snow then saavik
                   suddenly points

              85   pov  through the snowfall                                    85

                   something alive moves across the front obscured by
                   snow and terrain

              86   back to them  moving camera intercut with pov              86

                   as they start forward into the snow saavik drawing her
                   phaser they peer ahead seeing nothing but the bleep
                   of their tricorder which they follow like a beacon

                   their pov moving through the snow flurry catches an
                   occasional hint of something ahead which spurs them on

                   then with the tricorder beep indicating very close
                   proximity they stop and intuitively saavik indicates
                   to david to turn the tricorder off as the beep stops
                   they listen and hear the tiniest of whimpers amid the
                   wind they start out excitedly

                   as saavik and david approach stop tricorder back
                   on big reading they step forward through the snow
                   flurry to see

                   a wild thing with scraggly hair perhaps nine or ten
                   years old he covers his nakedness as he shivers in
                   the cold clutching an injured leg he watches the
                   strangers and their beeping machine in hypnotic fear
              
              89   the scene  in the crevice                                    89

                   at saaviks gesture david turns off his tricorder
                   saavik moves close as she touches the boys leg he
                   pulls back and she reaches out to his face and touches
                   his cheek softly he accepts watchfully then saavik
                   slides her hand slowly and parts the scraggly hair
                   the boy is a vulcan

                   saavik and david exchange and astonished look then she
                   covers the boy with spocks robe and in vulcan

                   quietly so as not to alarm the boy saavik opens her

                   suddenly the very ground on which he stands seems to
                   become an elevator he is carried rapidly upward on a
                   craggy rock formation which bursts upward out of the
                   ground kruge tumbles and kirk seizes the opportunity 

             240   the fight  series of shots                                  240

                   kirk leaps upon kruge and they roll and struggle on the
                   churning erupting ground

                   they are evenly matched kirks opening momentum holds
                   until kruges great size begins to turn the tide he
                   takes temporary command with swift vicious kicks and
                   punches kirk is down

                   kruge now looks around for his phase starts for it
                   but kirk in a series of ground rolls trips kruge up
                   with his legs and comes on

                   the offbalance kruge now takes a series of punches
                   from kirk which make him reel backward near the edge of
                   the promontory a final blow from kirk forces kruge
                   over the edge  and he

                    tumbles and rolls down the fifteen foot slope kirk
                   peers over the edge to see

                   kruge has landed on a level precipice about fifteen
                   feet in diameter beyond that is an endless drop into
                   a chasm the bottom of which has become a glowing red

                   as kruge rises to his feet kirk without hesitation
                   soars into the air from above and dives upon kruge the
                   momentum of the dive taking both men right to the edge
                   of the final drop they work their way to their feet
                   and continue the struggle anew pieces of the rock edge
                   slipping away under their feet as they scuffle kirk
                   is winning until

                   with a burst of energy kruge shoves kirk hard and kirk
                   slams into a wall of stone dazed kruge has him 
                   but as he starts to step forward the edge of the rock he
                   is standing on starts to slip

                   kruge does jump forward at the last possible instant as

                   kirk recovering his own strength sees kruge in this
                   helpless situation he comes forward to the edge
                   kneels over the klingon

                   kruge looks down measuring the terror below as if
                   considering then with sudden and explosive strength
                   vaults upward making a desperate grab for kirk he has
                   a leg suddenly kirk is fighting not to be pulled
                   over the edge he is losing that fight till he
                   lashes out with a blow the klingons grip slips yet
                   he hangs on tenaciously until  with a cry of rage

                   sarek and mccoy reach the altar and sarek departs
                   the priestess intones another short chant punctuated
                   by gongs and musical emphatics then chant and music
                   stop and we hear only the gentle sound of the wind and
                   faroff temple chimes she places a hand on bones
                   face another on spocks then eerily

                   soft music now she begins drifting into a trance like
                   mind meld chanting softly almost inaudibly

                   close on mccoy and spock their eyes are closed
                   a sense of kinetic energy somehow passing between
                   them

                   the lightning flashes are reflected in his face as we
                   move slowly in on his concerned face and very slowly

                   from where they had watched from last night here they have
                   waited lain down they are beginning to stir when the
                   sound of a gong brings them fully awake they rise
                   bleary eyed to see

             285   their pov  toward the altar                                 285

                   the high priestess exhausted is being carried out of
                   the altar area on a sedan chair as she leaves sarek
                   supporting a weary mccoy heads a procession of hooded
                   robed priests among them we now see a hooded robed
                   figure all in white

                   the procession is passing kirks party while kirk and
                   the crew can only stare in uncertainty then sarek
                   signals the others to continue while he with mccoy
                   breaks off and comes to kirk

                             what about spock

                             but at what cost your ship
                             your son

                             have been my soul
 
                   sarek looks at him with deep admiration then turns
                   and heads back to the group of priests the wind
                   blows and 

             287   kirk and group                                               287

                   they are now looking into the low sun shading their
                   eyes for a last look at the whiterobed figure

                   they are moving slowly away when suddenly the white
                   robed figure stops turns toward the enterprise group

             289   close  the white hood                                       289

                   we cannot see the features beneath but we know the
                   figure is staring after a moment the figure starts
                   back to the enterprise group as two priests reach to
                   stop him they are stayed by sarek who now watches
                   with interest

                   watching with held breath as the whiterobed figure
                   walks steadily to them reaches them

             291   the figure                                                   291

                   back lit the wind whips his garment now he lowers
                   his hood we see spock a radiant gentled spock
                   his age is as we have known it his hair his face the
                   same he would look at peace except for the eyes which
                   remain hollow filled with questions and uncertainties

                   the enterprise crew each of them stares back at spock
                   as subjective camera pans past them slowly each makes his
                   own effort to be remembered but 

                   spock remains churning but uncertain then he looks
                   hardest at all at

                   kirk the wind whips his hair

                   something triggers in spock he steps forward and
                   then in an odd rusty voice

                                           spock
                             i know you do i not

                             friend you came back for me

                                           kirk
                             you would have done the same for
                             me

                                           spock
                                     searching
                             why would you do this

                                           kirk
                                     grasping to make
                                      a connection
                             because the needs of the one
                             outweighed the needs of the many

                   spock stares at him a vague connection has been made
                    but not enough spock turns away in uncertainty
                   begins walking back to the group he left kirk raises
                   his helpless hand after spock wondering what he might
                   have said should have said  when suddenly

                   spock stops back to kirk he closes his eyes looks
                   to the sky and like someone who has found a piece of
                   a puzzle he says

                                           spock
                             i have been and ever shall
                             be your friend

                   kirk steps forward a few steps  hushed encouraging 

                                           kirk
                             yes yes spock

                                           spock
                                     half turns
                             the ship out of danger

                                           kirk
                                     deeply
                             you saved the ship spock you
                             saved us all dont you remember

                   there is an odd moment after kirks impassioned speech
                   spock cocks his head as if some vital piece of informa
                   tion had just clicked into place

                                           spock
                                     softly
                              jim your name is jim

                   kirks eyes well with tears he nods his head

                                           kirk
                              yes

                   their eyes are locked together spock gives a little
                   nod of satisfaction as if knowing he has taken the
                   first of many steps he turns to share this with
                   mccoy and then with them all we have the feeling
                   that spock has come back to his family and to us

             293   on enterprise family                                         293

                   they have gathered round kirk now beaming at spock
                   through their tears and their joy knowing they all
                   have a future together as the camera pulls up and
                   back from this we roll end credits and 

                   fade outthe end
