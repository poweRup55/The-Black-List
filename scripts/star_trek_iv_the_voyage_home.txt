                             we have a great seal to offer but
                             that is small compared to what we

                             about whales the first commonly
                             held misconception is that whales
                             are fish
                             theyre not theyre mammals like

                             most whales dont even have teeth
                             they strain vast amounts of tiny
                             shrimp for food and that is the
                             limit of their hostility un
                             fortunately their principle enemy
                             is far more aggressive

                             to put it mildly since the dawn of
                             time men have harvested whales for
                             a variety of purposes most of which
                             can be achieved synthetically at this
                             point a hundred years ago using
                             handthrown harpoons they did plenty
                             of damage  but that was nothing
                             compared to what theyve achieved

                   as gillian continues her spiel camera moves in toward
                   the whales and discovers spock  in the water swimming
                   to them he approaches one and looks it in the eye

                             the song and pass it on

                   now kirk sees spock in the water behind gillian and is

                             theyre gonna hafta take their

                                           gillian
                             it means that they will be at risk
                             from whale hunters  same as the
                             rest of the humpbacks

                             i meant 

                                           kirk
                             he meant what you were saying on the 
                             tour that if things keep on the
                             way theyre going humpbacks will
                             disappear forever

                                           gillian
                             thats not what he said farm boy
                             admiral if we were to assume these
                             whales are ours to do with as we

                             of your plexiglass need to be at 60
                             feet by 10 feet to withstand the
                             pressure of 18000 cubic feet of

                             same job but was only an inch thick
                             would that be worth something to
                             you eh
