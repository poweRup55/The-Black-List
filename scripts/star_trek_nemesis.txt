                   politics in a cavernous shadowy chamber dark 
                   figures lean together and talk seriously their hushed 
                   urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion 

                   we can’t make out the words but there is no doubt what 
                   they are talking about 

                   the three year old human boy who stands before them 
                   the boy is alone and frightened lost in the sweeping 
                   grandeur of the massive chamber

                   netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the 
                   hellish mining operations everywhere around us 

                   the human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then 
                   he looks up for a moment at the stars 

                   then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the

                   the sun is setting on the capital city of the great 
                   romulan star empire the imperial monoliths and martial
                   towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips 
                   below the horizon 

                   we slowly move down toward the most imposing building 
                   of the city the romulan senate chamber 

                   int romulan senate chamber sunset 

                   senator talaura watches the proceedings with a studied
                   look of bored indifference she glances to the famil

                   and then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to 

                   praetor hiren  the head of the romulan government 
                   presiding over the senate from a thronelike chair he 
                   is a capable politician in his 50s

                              but if we hesitate we’ll lose

                             open negotiations 

                   senator talaura grunts slightly at the word nego

                             appointment with the tholian 
                             ambassador 

                   the praetor nods  tal’ aura stands and leaves the 
                   chamber… but she had left something behind on her desk  
                   a small silver box with unusual etchings on the 
                   surface

                   the discussion continues as we focus on the silver 
                   box

                                           praetor
                             then i will call for a vote on the 
                             motion to open trade negotiations 
                             with celes ii

                   the senator at the desk next to talaura’s glances 
                   over the silver box is moving 

                   the senator watches amazed as the box begins to 
                   slowly fold open then legs appear the box unfolds
                   like a spider standing on its legs then it is still
                   for a moment the senator looks at it puzzled 

                   suddenly a bright beam of green light shoots up from 
                   the spider the senators are stunned  the beam 
                   shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and 
                   then cascades around the interior of the room 
                   enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green 
                   energy in a way it is bizarrely beautiful 

                   and then just as suddenly the light disappears 

                   a moment of silence the praetor and senators are 
                   baffled 

                                           praetor
                             would someone please tell me what 
                             that was

                   a plant behind the praetor begins to shrivel

                             and have them run a

                   the praetor stops suddenly  as the flesh begins to 
                   melt from his face 

                   every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays  
                   flesh melts from bones while the senators scream in 
                   agony every living thing in the chamber is dead 
                   within ten seconds 

                   a stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage 
                   then a transporter effect ripples around the spider
                   weapon it disappears 

                   and the romulan senate is no more we fade to

                             sir  i noticed an interesting 
                             confluence of emotion at the 
                             wedding i am familiar with the 
                             human concept of tears through 
                             laughter and its inverse 
                             laughter through tears but i 
                             could not help wondering about 
                             the human capacity for 
                             expressing both pleasure and 
                             sadness simultaneously

                             i understand why it would seem 
                             confusing certain human 
                             rituals like weddings
                             birthdays or funerals evoke 
                             strong and very complex 
                             emotions these rites carry 
                             great weight with us because 
                             they denote the passage of

                   flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold martial
                   splendor of a senate corridor 

                   commander donatra and commander suran stride through 
                   the corridor

                   suran is an elder romulan officer respected and 
                   tenacious  donatra  a key figure in this story so 
                   pay close attention to her  is a maturer beautiful 
                   woman not without a dry sense of humor

                             the fleet commanders are nervous
                             theyve agreed to remain at

                             await his orders but theyre 
                             anxious to know whats going on
                             here

                             keep them in the dark forever

                   a voice from the shadows 

                                           viceroy

                   donatra and suran stop 

                   and the viceroy steps from the shadows

                   he is a terrifying sight  a powerful monstrous alien 
                   creature a tall ashenskinned ectomorph who bears a
                   disturbing resemblance to the original nosferatu he
                   is vampiric and lethal  he is a reman 

                                           viceroy
                             dont you agree

                   he leads them along the corridor 

                   int senate chamber night 

                   we observe the romulan crest an imposing birdofprey
                   clutching a planet in either claw not unlike the 
                   kaos emblem from “get smart that dominates a wall 
                   as we hear

                                           shinzon

                             prey holds planets romulus 
                             remus their destinies conjoined…

                   and then we see him shinzon

                   he is a dynamic young human in his twenties very 
                   handsome with pale almost white skin and shining 
                   golden hair he wears a striking reman military uniform 

                   he stands in the center of the eerily deserted 
                   chamber the entire floor lis a large star chart 

                                           shinzon
                             yet for generations one of those

                             voice  we will be silent no 
                             longer

                   senator talaura the female senator who planted the 
                   weapon in the senate chamber earlier and two other 
                   romulan commanders sit  

                   cadres of shinzon’s fearsome reman warriors stand 
                   around the chamber they are his sinister children of 
                   the night even more chilling now in the flickering 
                   torch light it’s like something out of tim burton

                   donatra and suran enter the chamber with shinzons 
                   viceroy 

                                           shinzon

                             of your sincerity

                   shinzon looks at her a quick beat shinzon decides 
                   to respond with benevolence he smiles

                   worf and data climb as data scans and indicates the
                   direction

                             i think it unlikely you will 
                             need your phaser to recover the
                             cranial unit  of course it 
                             could bite you

                   then they see it 

                   datas head or the spitting image anyway lying 
                   inert in the dust before them 

                                           worf
                             its you

                             the resemblance is striking

                   then the heads eyes suddenly pop open it looks up
                   at them with a sort of blank childlike wonder 

                                           head
                             why am i looking at me

                             thank you

                   data gently picks up the head looks at it the two
                   identical faces gaze at each other

                             fascinating

                   then blam  a boulder near them explodes worf 
                   and data spin to see

                   a nomadic tribe of desert aliens swarming toward 
                   them firing primitive plasma weapons

                   data and worf race back down the canyon toward the
                   jeep  some openfield running and a bit of phaser
                   action   worf firing to distract and slow the 
                   aliens not kill them  through all of this the 
                   head is chattering away blandly

                             i have two arms and ten

                             arms are i cannot see where 
                             we are going where are we 
                             going  
                                     etc like threepio

                   the action continues then data finds himself 
                   almost surrounded 

                                           data
                             commander

                   worf turns  data throws the head to worf like a 
                   football a perfect spiral  the head is still 
                   chattering away  worf catches it 

                                           worf
                             stop talking

                   the head abruptly stops talking 

                   data hands free now quickly incapacitates the 
                   aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of 
                   his superior strength and agility 

                   meanwhile worf tucks the head under his arm and 
                   sprints like a master running back  evading 
                   aliens and occasionally firing his phaser 

                   they are closer to the jeep now but they are in 
                   trouble  the swarm of aliens almost overtaking 
                   them  

                   when a thundering blast sends up a shower of 
                   debris stopping the aliens  picard is standing 
                   in the rear of the jeep firing the phaser canon 

                   data and worf climb into the jeep as picard leaps 
                   into the front seat and roars off  

                   int ext jeep kolarus iii following 

                   worf standing at the phaser canon quickly hands 
                   the head to data in the front seat

                             thank you

                   the head looks up at picard 

                                           head
                             you have a shiny head

                   picard glances at the head

                             he is very observant

                   picard turns to see that they are being pursued 
                   the aliens are racing after them in crude desert
                   terrain vehicles  

                                           picard

                             velocities

                   he floors it  racing across the desert landscape

                   worf fires the mounted phaser canon  blasting 
                   away at the aliens not killing them just stopping
                   them  a few dramatic crashes as the alien
                   vehicles overturn  

                   meanwhile

                   they continue to speed over the landscape  
                   bouncing and flying over natural rises in the 
                   terrain  trying to evading their pursuers  

                   picard puts the pedal to the metal and races 
                   through the alien vehicles  weaving in and out 
                   avoiding their fire  worf blasts away with the 
                   phaser cannon  an exhilarating adventure  

                   finally they are within sight of the argo  but 
                   they see it is surrounded by more of the aliens 

                                           picard
                             mister data let’s make like 
                             the wind

                   data punches some buttons on a dashboard console  
                   and the argo lifts off by remote control  

                   data uses the console to swing the argo around and 
                   lower the rear cargo doors  it hovers over the 
                   surface  

                   picard floors the jeep  using a natural rise in 
                   the terrain as a ramp  the jeep flies through the
                   air  over the aliens  and into the cargo bay  

                   int argo cargo bay following 

                   picard slams on the brakes  the jeep screeches to
                   a stop as the doors shut and the argo shoots into
                   the air 

                   picard climbs from the jeep he nonchalantly rubs a
                   bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into
                   the main cabin 

                   data and worf remain in the jeep for a beat they
                   are stunned 

                                           worf 
                                     smiles

                             they are fat they traded me 
                             to a ship belonging to the 
                             bolians the bolians are 
                             blue they put me in a seat and
                             asked me questions then they 
                             were attacked by another 
                             ship

                   time passes  

                   and still the b9 is yammering blandly away he is

                   very obscure images of remans appear the crew can
                   barely make out the monstrous figures

                             we have to assume he had 
                             romulan collaborators

                             the praetors power has always
                             been the romulan fleet they 
                             must be behind him

                   picard considers this

                   the images end there are no images of shinzon

                             record we can infer he is 
                             relatively young and a 
                             capablecommander he fought

                             believe he would have wanted

                             i cant believe the captain

                             download

                             the same selfactualization 
                             parameters as myself if my

                   designed with an almost asian simplicity like the
                   rest of reman design it is spare and elegant 

                   since the remans are more comfortable in the dark
                   ness most of the light comes from the three

                   eyes from her

                   shinzon continues to stare at deanna it is
                   strangely seductive almost disquieting in its 
                   intensity deanna handles it with grace her level

                             and begin a free and open

                                           shinzon
                             right now you’re thinking 
                             this all sounds too good to 
                             be true

                                           picard
                             yes

                                           shinzon
                             and youre wondering why the 
                             scimitar is so well armed is 
                             this the ship of a peacemaker 
                             or a predator 

                   picard is startled at shinzons choice of words 

                                           shinzon
                                     contd
                             but youre also thinking the 
                             chance for peace is too 
                             promising to ignore above 
                             allyoure trying to decide if

                                           picard
                             yes

                                           shinzon
                             then perhaps the time has 
                             come to add some illumination 
                             to our discussion computer 
                             raise lighting four levels

                   lights shoot up around the room 

                   for the first time the crew can see shinzon 
                   clearly  picard actually gasps when he sees 
                   shinzons face the rest of  the crew doesnt 
                   understand his reaction 

                                           shinzon
                             allow me to tell you a story 
                             that i hope will clarify my 
                             position  when i was very 
                             young i was stricken with an 
                             odd disease i developed a 
                             hypersensitivity to sound 
                             the slightest whisper caused 
                             me agony

                   picard watches him carefully wary and strangely 
                   intense 

                                           shinzon
                             no one knew what to do 
                             finally i was taken to a 
                             doctor who had some experience
                             with terran illnesses and i 
                             was finally diagnosed with 
                             shalafts syndrome do you 
                             know of it captain

                   the crew is dumbfounded at picards unusual 
                   reaction 

                                           shinzon
                             then you know its a very 
                             rare syndrome genetic all

                             treated now i can hear as 
                             well as you can captain

                   he steps toward picard who holds his ground 

                                           shinzon
                             i can see as well as you can 
                             i can feel everything you 
                             feel 

                   he stops right before picard 

                                           shinzon

                   picard stares at him with a mixture of realization
                   and curiosity it is as if picard is looking into 
                   a strange remembered mirror shinzons face is 
                   nearly identical to his at that age 

                                           shinzon
                             do you trust me now

                   the crew is utterly confused their confusion turns
                    to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a
                    reman knife and cuts his arm drawing a little 
                   blood he hands the knife to data

                   something odd the viceroy puts his hand on 
                   shinzons chest leans very close and talks to him

                   the b9 sits placidly in a chair staring forward 

                   then as if a switch was thrown he moves he 
                   quickly rises and goes to a computer console he 
                   efficiently starts punching in commands at an 
                   amazing velocity 

                   int romulan senate chamber night 

                   picard and shinzon sit alone in a corner of the 
                   sweeping senate chamber the remains of dinner 
                   before them 

                                           shinzon

                             frankly i think they were 
                             afraid id be discovered and 
                             it would lead to war they

                             how could a mere human 
                             survive the dilithium mines 
                             it was
                                     he cant find

                             the only thing the romulan 
                             guards hated more than the

                             took pity on me the man who 
                             became my viceroy he taught 
                             me how to survive and in 
                             that dark place where there 
                             was nothing of myself i 
                             found my reman brothers

                             kindness i ever knew

                   a beat he glances to the romulan crest on the 
                   wall 

                                           shinzon
                   for thousands of years the romulan senate has met 
                   in this chamber and dictated the fate of its

                   int enterprise turbolift morning 

                   deanna is alone on the turbolift then a voice 
                   makes her spin

                             youre not here

                                     moving to her
                             very logical deanna but 
                             your heart doesnt constrain 
                             itself to mere logic 
                                     he caresses her 
                             your heart longs to discover 
                             me to know me
                                     he kisses her
                             to leave all of this behind 
                             and be with me

                   he pushes her against the wall with passion and 
                   almost violence 

                                           deanna
                             no

                             i can feel your desire 
                             deanna

                   she forces herself to concentrate to resist 
                   telepathically it is a mighty effort this 
                   romulan is hot and the world around her appears 
                   to be changing bending  

                   and she is momentarily in a cabin on the scimitar
                   although entirely a telepathic experience it is 
                   as if she has actually traveled

                   she sees shinzon kneeling over a small flame she 
                   realizes she is looking through the viceroy’s 
                   eyes

                   on the scimitar shinzon looks up at the viceroy
                   deanna

                                           shinzon
                             i can feel your hunger to know
                              the reman ways the old 
                             ways

                   then the world changes again 

                   deanna is on the turbolift shinzon is pressed 
                   against her whispering 

                                           shinzon
                             dont fear what you desire

                   she forces him away from her and  

                   she is alone she sinks to her knees overcome with
                   emotion 

                   int scimitar viceroys cabin following 

                   the viceroy in a kind of trace kneels before a 
                   small flame shinzon kneels across from him the 
                   viceroy raises his head 

                                           viceroy
                             the bond is broken

                                           shinzon
                             find her again

                                           viceroy
                             no  this is wasting time

                   he begins to go  but suddenly stops a wave of 
                   illness overtaking him 

                   the viceroy puts his hand on shinzons chest a 
                   strange i moment as the viceroy shuts his eyes and 
                   feels shinzons chest his mind probing  

                   then the viceroy looks up at him grim

                   shinzon stands with some reman engineers

                   an engineer activates a transporter and the b9 
                   materializes

                   reman engineers go to the b9 and open the panel in
                    his neck begin connecting computer conduits to 
                   the extra memory port we saw earlier 

                   note although the audience will not know it yet 
                   this is actually data pretending to be the b9 

                   shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders

                   a cup of tea appears he takes it and sips as he 
                   watches his engineers connecting the conduits to

                   she looks at picard tears in her eyes

                             it was a violation

                   riker takes her hand

                   int scimitar brig night 

                   picard stands in the reman brig his communicator pin
                   has been removed 

                   beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical 
                   apparatus is being prepared a metal chair with laser
                   scalpels iv tubes and hyposprays connected to it 
                   reman doctors work over the mysterious chair 

                   shinzon enters with the b9 following shinzon stands
                   on the other side of the force field 

                   picard notices something immediately tiny veins are 
                   now visible on shinzons face the faintest sign of 
                   an intricate spiderweb pattern of pale blue veins 

                                           shinzon
                             hello jean luc

                             i was lonely

                   shinzon realizes picard is staring at the veins on 
                   his face  

                                           shinzon

                             perhaps im not aging as well
                             as you did

                   he nods to a guard the guard deactivates the force 
                   field a reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray 
                   toward picard

                                           picard 
                                     resists
                             what are you doing

                                           shinzon
                             i need a sample of your blood
                             what do your borg friends say 
                             resistance is futile 
                                     maniacal laugh

                   the doctor takes a quick sample of picards blood as

                             refuse i learned there might 
                             be an existing prototype from
                             a cardassian historian then
                             went to a great deal of 
                             trouble to find it and 
                             scatter it about on kolarus 
                             iii i knew it would pique 
                             your curiosity and conven
                             iently make the enterprise

                             all of this so you could 
                             capture me

                             robot does  or maybe i’ll 
                             snap its ugly head off

                                     peering at picard 
                                      deeply 
                             do you see a life you might 
                             have led lost youth never

                                           picard
                             i see a young man trying 
                             desperately to deny who he is

                                           shinzon
                             i see an old man set in his 
                             ways afraid to live without 
                             a uniform to prop him up and 
                             a starfleet regulation to

                             my life is meaningless as 
                             long as youre alive what am

                             this has nothing to do with 
                             my ship and nothing to do 
                             with the federation

                                           shinzon
                             oh but it does  we will no 
                             longer bow like slaves before

                             think about what youre doing
                             shinzon are you ready to 
                             plunge the entire quadrant 
                             into war to satisfy your own 
                             personal demons

                                           shinzon
                             it amazes me how little you 
                             know yourself

                                           picard
                             im incapable of such an act
                             and so are you

                                           shinzon
                             i think the facts speak for 
                             themselves the same noble 
                             picard blood runs in our 
                             veins had you lived my life
                             youd be doing exactly as i 
                             am look in the mirror and 
                             see yourself

                   shinzon looks at him deeply 

                                           shinzon
                             consider that captain i can

                   he turns to go

                             its a mirror for you as well

                   shinzon turns back to him 

                   a beat picard gazes at him evenly 

                   picards probing gaze makes shinzon a bit uneasy he 
                   glances to the ghoulish medical preparations 

                                           shinzon
                             not for long captain

                             echo over the voice

                   picard stands in his cell peering at the edges of 
                   the security force field trying to spot any weakness 

                   then the b9 enters the brig he holds a reman 
                   disruptor weapon

                   he leads picard out

                   int scimitar corridors following 

                   the b9 leads picard through the dark corridors

                   the viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on picard

                             yet he roars so valiantly

                   he raises one taloned claw and puts a sharp fingernail
                   on picards chest

                                           viceroy

                   the b9 prods picards back roughly with the disruptor 
                   picard grimaces in pain

                   he leads picard down the corridor 

                   int scimitar generation chamber night

                   data leads picard into a massive chamber that soars
                   up like a cathedral it is the size of a small town 

                   the whole cavernous chamber pulses with glowing 
                   green light

                             this entire ship is 
                             essentially a flying 
                             thalaron generator

                             that device

                   high above them at the very top of the chamber is 
                   a gigantic version of the spiderweapon we saw kill 
                   all the romulan senators before it is breathtaking

                             it would appear so

                   data rotates his left hand and then slides it 
                   forward exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist
                   he removes a small silver disc  this is a cool new 
                   piece of federation technology called an etu

                             well find a way off together 
                             recommendations

                             there is a shuttlebay 948 
                             meters from our current 
                             location

                   data inserts the etu back into his wrist and they 
                   leave the chamber

                   shinzon looks at him confused 

                   int scimitar corridors night 

                   security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and 
                   harsh reman commands are broadcast through the 
                   corridors 

                                           data
                             this way sir

                   they sprint down the twisting dark corridors  
                   reman warriors suddenly appear before them  data 
                   fires the disruptor as picard launches himself into 
                   them 

                   a fight  picard uses a dazzlinq series of starfleet
                   handtohand maneuvers  he dramatically subdues 
                   the remans 

                   more reman warriors appear down the corridor picard 
                   grabs a disruptor 

                   and instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor a 
                   battle break out in the corridor  the energy beams 
                   and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight 
                   in strobelike bursts 

                   they run to another corridor and finally arrive at 
                   the shuttlebay door  it does not open 

                                           data

                             it seems to have an encrypted 
                             security system

                   reman warriors are closing in on them

                   data tosses his disruptor to picard  picard catches
                   it and instantly spins and fires  he uses both 
                   disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor 
                   like a western sheriff  keeping the remans at bay 

                   as data uses both hands to punch numbers into the 
                   shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate

                   the shuttlebay door slides open 

                   picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire 
                   as he and data duck into the shuttlebay 

                   int scimitar shuttlebay following

                   when the door closes behind them picard turns and 
                   fires a disruptor blast  sealing the door 
                   mechanism 

                   they turn to face

                   a fleet of very small shuttles they are uniquely 
                   designed extremely compact and streamlined a

                   gunners position 

                   they see disruptor fire trying to burn through the 
                   door to the shuttlebay   picard powers up the 
                   scorpion as 

                   picard is trying to figure out the controls

                                           picard
                             what do you imagine this is

                             like me to drive

                   picard shoots him a look and presses some controls 
                   the scorpion lifts off hovers a few feet over the 
                   deck picard elegantly swings it around toward the

                             can you open the shuttlebay

                             security overrides and erected
                             a force field around the

                             well then only one way to 
                             go

                   he swings the scorpion around again so it is facing 
                   the doors they came through the doors back into the 
                   ship 

                   data is dubious

                   a disruptor blast shatters the etched glass dome at 
                   the top of the room

                             the more i studied his dna the 
                             more confusing it got finally
                             i could only come to one
                             conclusion shinzon was 
                             created with temporal rna 
                             sequencing he was designed 
                             so that at a certain point his
                             aging process could be 
                             accelerated to reach your age
                             more quickly so he could 
                             replace you

                             but the romulans abandoned the

                             remember he was supposed to 
                             replace you at nearly your 
                             current age he was engineered 
                             to skip thirty years of life 
                             but since the rna sequencing 
                             was never activated his

                   a beat as he looks at them gravely 

                                           picard
                             he cant be allowed to use 
                             that weapon all other 
                             concerns are secondary do 
                             you understand me

                   riker knows exactly what picard is saying the 
                   enterprise is expendable

                   int enterprise various angles
 
                   we see a montage of the enterprise preparing for 
                   battle 

                   crew members assume battle stations weapons locker 
                   ring open and security officers hand out sidearms 
                   and phaser rifles

                   geordi and his engineers establish emergency force 
                   field around the warp core

                   with apprehensive young ensign

                   she watches him go 

                   int scimitar bridge night
 
                   shinzon sits in his command chair lined with veins 
                   now 

                   his viceroy again has his hand pressed to shinzons 
                   chest

                             moment

                   shinzon slams his command chair in fury the viceroy 
                   watches him carefully 

                   a beat shinzon regains his composure he sits again
                   in his command chair 

                                           shinzon

                             seven minutes

                   shinzon leans back satisfied and looks at the 
                   viewscreen

                   the image on the viewscreen is shocking 

                   the enterprise only a few hundred yards away 

                   ext enterprise space 

                   the enterprise zooms through space 

                   completely unaware of the predator directly above it

                   before him picard enters

                             approximately 40 minutes

                   the images before them change to show sector 3274 
                   we see blips denoting starfleet ships moving into 
                   position 

                   picard gazes at the projection of stars before them 
                   for a moment

                             i do not agree although you

                             looked up at the stars

                   photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the

                             defines us to be human is to
                             try to make yourself better 
                             than you are

                   picard looks at him deeply relentlessly refusing to

                   shinzon slowly backs away as picard continues to move
                   toward him relentlessly

                             him

                   shinzon is in turmoil picard senses this he proceeds
                   quietly 

                                           picard
                             and what will he do with that
                             life

                   shinzon looks at him questioning 

                                           picard
                             if i were to beam to your

                   shinzon doesnt respond 

                                           picard

                             past your history

                   very proud and my pride often hurt people i made 
                   every wrong choice a young man can but one thing 
                   saved me i had a father who believed in me who 
                   took the time to teach me a better way  you have 
                   the same father

                                           shinzon
                             yes

                             blaze of hatred as you are 
                             now or could you change 
                             could you try to remember a

                   a connection for this brief moment reconciliation is 
                   possible he proceeds quietly

                             father

                   shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness what 

                   might have been 

                                           shinzon

                   they are getting the upper hand when riker sees the

                   and sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing
                   a steady burst from his phaser rifle  

                   riker uses the cover to dive after the viceroy 
                   following him into the dark jefferies tube intent on

                   of photon torpedoes

                   a huge explosion as the viewscreen and some of the 
                   forward bridge are blown apart  the helm officer is 
                   sucked into space before a flickering emergency force

                   a massive collision as the enterprise slams into the 
                   scimitar  as it smashes and grinds into shinzons 
                   ship

                   int enterprise bridge following 

                   everyone goes flying

                   ext the rift space 

                   the two great ships are now locked together slowly 
                   rotating in space 

                   the forward part of the enterprises saucer is enmeshed 
                   in shinzons ship two scorpions with their claws 
                   locked 

                   int scimitar bridge following 

                   shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge many of his
                   bridge crew are now dead

                   ext the rift space 

                   every part of the enterprise rocks  a great lurch as 
                   the scimitar begins to tear itselc free  backing 
                   away a deafening shriek of metal both ships are
                   being torn to pieces in the process  but it is 
                   working the scimitar is ripping free wrenching 
                   itself loose

                   int enterprise jefferies tubes following 

                   the jefferies tube shudders as the scimitar continues 
                   to tear itself free  riker and the viceroy careen 
                   through the tube  the viceroy recovers quickly and 
                   coils for a final attack  riker sees that an access 
                   plate has been loosened in the collision  he 
                   desperately rips it away  knowing the relays behind 
                   will provide him with the advantage he needs 

                   bright liqht strobes from the relays and the viceroy 
                   is momentarily blinded  riker uses this opportunity 
                   to attack he dives forward slamming into the 
                   viceroy they both tumble into a long vertical 
                   access tunnel  they fall 

                   riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder  the 
                   viceroy grabs onto riker his talons digging into his
                   uniform  a long drop below them 

                   riker forces the viceroys head back  away from him 
                    a brutal struggle

                   riker glares at him  

                                           riker
                             dont worry  hell is dark

                   riker uses every ounce of strength he has left  
                   pushes the viceroy off him 

                   the viceroy falls down the long tunnel  to his death 

                   int enterprise bridge following 
                   
                   the whole enterprise bridge quakes as the scimitar 
                   continues to pull itself free 

                   picard stands steadying himself on his command chair

                   an eerie moment of silence after the explosive tear

                   picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as

                   slams into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked

                   he grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls

                   spear

                   impaling shinzon 

                   a stunned momentof silence as shinzon gazes at picard

                   picard backs against a wall  shinzon slowly walks 
                   toward picard forcing himself down the length of the
