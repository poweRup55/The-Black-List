	      uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the 
	      pendant away then a faint reprise of the vger theme 
	      music now causes the female master to look skyward 
	      she turns from this back to spock as she exchanges a

	      looks down on the still kneeling spock then she
	      casts aside the pendant she carries  it falls into

	                        interrupting
	                here at starfleet the
	                enterprise is in final preparation
	                to leave dock

	                              sonak
	                which will require twenty more
	                hours at minimum admiral

	                twelve im on my way to a meeting

	                              scott
	                admiral ive been hoping to see
	                you maybe you can get through 
	                to those thick heads in starfleet
	                that

	                              kirk
	                why arent the enterprise

	                scott

	                              scott
	                were hoping its only a temporary
	                problem admiral

	                              kirk
	                see that it is
	                        moving toward pod
	                take me over please

	      scott is now eying kirk just a little warily as he fol
	      lows him into the pod kirks determined expression
	      suggests that some chips are going to fly and scott
	      does not want to become one of them

	                power less than three days away

	      kirk hits a button on the travel pod panel  the air
	      lock doors slam closed behind them then stepping im
	      mediately to the front observation window

	                launches in twelve hours

	      scott throws kirk an appalled look but is now occupied
	      in sealing the outer pod door and manipulating drive
	      controls

	      camera continues to pull back to reveal front of the
	      pod and arms of the office complex as pod disconnects

	                equipment and the engines
	                admiral theyve yet to be even
	                tested at warp power add to

	                two and a half years as chief of
	                starfleet operations may have
	                made me a little stale mr scott
	                 but i wouldnt exactly consider
	                myself untried

	      it takes scott a moment to comprehend and kirk smiles
	      now nods

	                              kirk
	                        continuing
	                they gave her back to me scotty

	      scott peers at him genuinely surprised  and pleased
	      then

	                              scott
	                gave her back sir i doubt
	                it was that easy
	                        returns smile
	                but any man who could manage such
	                a feat i wouldna dare disappoint
	                shell launch on time sir
	                        with confidence
	                and shell be ready

	      and he clasps kirks elbow affectionately then gestures
	      kirk to look out the pod window

	      kirk as scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best
	      perspective kirk peers through the observation window

	      at the middle of the power shaft very noisy here

	      around a section of burntout circuitry are willard
	      decker captains stripes handsome in his early
	      30s scott and two technicians decker and scott
	      are working feverishly uncoupling the device 
	      probing its innards decker has discovered the problem
	      removed several transistortype parts taps them

	      as the technician prepares to install the device
	      scott glances up to see kirk

	      he looks from decker to kirk in acute embarrassment
	      so that we should realize scott hasnt mentioned
	      kirks taking over to decker decker now notices

	      as scott ad libs a glum aye sir and watches them
	      walk across the chamber

	 74   a corner of the intermix chamber                            74

	      just a little quieter here with kirk and decker arriv

	                              decker
	                all due respect sir i hope
	                this isnt a starfleet pep talk
	                im just too busy

	      kirk eyes decker  then decides the best way to say
	      it is plainly directly

	                              kirk
	                im taking over the center seat 
	                im sorry will

	                              kirk
	                im replacing you as captain of
	                the enterprise

	      decker seems shocked into silence he can only peer
	      at kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
	      paternal hand on deckers shoulder then withdraws it
	      and continues quickly

	                              kirk
	                        continuing
	                youll stay aboard as executive
	                officer a temporary grade
	                reduction to commander

	                              decker
	                       finding his voice
	                 you personally are assuming
	                command

	                              kirk
	                yes

	                              decker
	                may i ask why

	                              kirk
	                        nods
	                my experience  five years out
	                there dealing with unknowns like
	                this  my familiarity with the

	                              decker
	                admiral this is an almost totally
	                new enterprise you dont know
	                her a tenth as well as i do

	 75   another angle  to show scott in bg across the           75
	      room

	      scott working on the relay but continually glancing
	      at kirk and decker with worried concern as kirk
	      replies

	                              kirk
	                thats why youre staying aboard
	                im sorry will

	                              decker
	                no admiral i dont think you are
	                not one damned bit i remember
	                when you recommended me for this
	                command you told me how envious
	                you were and if only you could
	                find a way to get a starship
	                command again well sir it looks
	                like you found a way

	      kirk is silent a moment peering levelly at decker
	      who returns the gaze with equal intensity then

	                              kirk
	                report to the bridge commander
	                immediately

	      decker exits kirk waits collecting his composure
	      as he watches him go then kirk turns to glare at
	      scott interrupted by a flare as something shorts
	      out at the mechanism where scott and decker had been
	      working technician clearly reacts hits an inter

	      transporter sound seems wrong as if struggling to
	      overcome some problem at the console chief rand and
	      assistant are reacting in surprised nearhorror as
	      they attempt vainly to save the situation

	      suddenly from rands consolea violent glare  a

	                              starfleet voice
	                unable to retrieve their pattern
	                enterprise

	      rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
	      faintly materialize then fade away then reappear in
	      faintly misshapen form as she frantically works con
	      trols kirk enters fast steps to the console to
	      assist rand scott has also come in and moves to the
	      console brushes aside the asst chief and begins
	      manipulating the additional controls himself

	                              scott
	                were losing the pattern

	 77   closer on the transporter chamber o                       77

	      with the human forms fluttering into fuller and fuller
	      materialization frighteningly horribly misshapen we
	      recognize one form as the vulcan sonak  the other a
	      human woman they materialize we hear a moan form 
	      from the vulcan  the womans scream of pain then
	      all at once the halfmaterialized bodies are gone
	      the transporter chamber is empty

	                              kirk
	                oh my god

	 78   kirk scott and rand                                        78

	      gazing horrified at the empty chamber

	                              kirk
	                        into intercom
	                starfleet do you have them

	      a mutter of utter vacant silence  and kirk and
	      scott look at each other again their pained faces
	      presaging the answer they already know

	                              starfleet voice
	                        shaken
	                enterprise what we got back
	                didnt live long fortunately

	      another moment of stunned silence and then kirk hits
	      the transmission button  fighting to control his
	      voice as

	                              kirk
	                starfleet kirk please
	                express my condolences to their
	                families commander sonaks
	                can be reached through the vulcan
	                embassy

	                         expression
	                there was nothing you could have
	                done rand it wasnt your fault

	      and before rand can answer kirk leaves the room

	 79   int corridor  traveling with kirk                         79

	      as kirk steps out and the doors snap closed behind
	      him in the corridor the furor of the hurried depar
	      ture is as everywhere quite evident crew members
	      move back and forth but kirk does not see them his
	      mind is tormented by the transporter accident  was
	      there something he should have done could have done
	      to prevent it should he launch on schedule with the
	      starship this unready has he done right in yielding
	      to this terrible needs for starship command again
	      forcing starfleet to give her to him would deckers
	      knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci
	      dent

	      kirk reaches a corridor intersection looks around
	      realizes hes lost track of where he is a passing
	      yeoman stops in response to his puzzled expression

	      hurrying down the corridor the two face each other
	      a silent moment decker studying kirk curiously

	                              kirk
	                well have to replace commander
	                sonak id still like a vulcan

	                afraid youll have to double as

	      external view of the plantoid and the luminescent
	      cloud at about the same distance from which the
	      klingon cruisers were attacked

	      then it strikes the plantoid with full cataclysmic                
	      force the viewer image breaks up  and immediately
	      the entire starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of flar

	      epsilon 9 is gone we see only the stars and the

	      then kirk turns to the room as if to comment then he
	      stops  nothing he can say will add at all to what

	      as they snap open and there emerges a breathtakingly
	      beautiful young woman uniformed as a navigator lieu
	      tenant who strides purposefully onto the bridge a
	      stunning figure but hairless entirely bald but or
	      delicate eyebrows and eyelashes her bald head is not 
	      at all unattractive in fact exudes an aura of sensual
	      nudity indeed her whole being exudes sensuality
	      this is a racial characteristic not a deliberate
	      presence she approaches kirk

	      note throughout this sequence sulu eyes ilia with
	      unrestrained admiration

	 99   across ilia to decker                                       99

	      as ilia starts to speak suddenly stops she has just
	      then noticed decker who has stepped from his station
	      to face her for an electronic moment their eyes meet
	      hold in unquestioned recognition

	                              decker
	                hello ilia

	                              ilia
	                       surprised
	                decker

	      kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern
	      it presages possible complications decker turns to
	      kirk slightly uncomfortable at this
	                          
	                              decker
	                i was stationed on the lieutenants
	                home planet some years ago

	      ilia looks from kirk back to decker puzzled at his
	      sleeve stripes

	                              ilia
	                        eyes his rank

	                              decker
	                        bitingly
	                captain kirk has the utmost
	                confidence in me

	      kirk flashes a hard glance at decker then toward
	      ilia too

	                              kirk
	                        pointedly
	                and in you too lieutenant

	                              ilia
	                my oath of celibacy is on record
	                captain may i assume my duties

	      while respectful her tone of voice has been just as
	      firm as kirks

	                              kirk
	                by all means

	100   across kirk to uhura                                       100

	      receiving a message now relaying it

	                              uhura
	                captain starfleet reports our
	                last six crew members ready to
	                beam up
	                        puzzled
	                 but one of them is refusing
	                to step into the transporter

	      just as kirk a moment before was tense now suddenly
	      hes relaxed again he rises

	                              kirk
	                        pleased
	                oh ill see that he beams up

	      and he hurries from the bridge onto the elevator is
	      gone a moment of puzzled silence then
	      
	                              decker
	                mr sulu take lieutenant ilia
	                in hand

	                              sulu
	                        startled
	                sir
	                       then understands
	                yes of course
	                        to ilia
	                your preprogramming is already
	                set in lieutenant

	      sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair he
	      starts offering ilia his hand then thinks better of
	      it withdraws it abruptly immediately busies himself
	      punching out equations on her console ad libs
	      its all on the computer youll have no problem
	      sulu is nervous fluttery around this lovely creature 
	      now hits a wrong switch produces a beeping sound which
	      he fumbles to shut off she smiles speaks quietly
	      repeats

	                              ilia
	                im sworn to celibacy mister
	                sulu that makes me as safe
	                as any human female

	      sulu catches her eye but before he can reply decker has
	      moved in beside ilia

	                              decker
	                i now the captain meant no person
	                al insult

	                              ilia
	                        eyes on console
	                i would never take advantage of
	                a sexually immature species
	                        looks at him
	                you can assure him thats true
	                cant you

	      clearly the remark carries special personal
	      significance

	                this was your idea it was
	                your idea wasnt it

	                bones i need you badly

	      kirk extends his hand again mccoy delays some moments
	       then finally responds and once done it is the long
	      hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their
	      differences now mccoy turns to rand

	                              mccoy

	                sir the enterprise redesign
	                increases phaser power by

	      to take over the console he begins getting to his
	      feet throwing kirk a look but kirks attention is
	      totally on spock and spock is already intent on com
	      putations he is beginning to punch into the science

	      become aware of kirk and decker standing there with

	                       indicating
	                sit down
	
	      for an instant it looks like spock will refuse then
	      he complies but sits formally rigidly he ignores

	                              kirk
	                youve reported that you felt

	                vessel could you make out any

	                logic i can explain nothing
	                more i understand nothing more

	      kirk is clearly disappointed  and a bit uncomfortable
	      about what he must ask next he exchanges a glance
	      with mccoy then

	                              kirk
	                also  there was nothing in your

	                i inquired about you  learned
	                you were studying with the
	                masters

	      although spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless
	      his expression shifts slightly mccoy indicates this

	                              mccoy

	                  is my only hope of accomplishing
	                what the masters could not

	      this has been delivered with chilling blandness and

	      as chapel smiles pleased and looks at decker who

	      alive

	                              ilia

	                will

	      and she touches his hand runs her own hand over it
	      and smiles

	      decker is completely overwhelmed struggles for words
	      and looks to mccoy for some kind of help mccoy
	      realizes decker is losing himself in fantasy

	                              mccoy
	                        gently reminding
	                commander this is a mechanism

	      decker is startled and for another slitsecond hes
	      lost  but then he realizes the reality and what he
	      should do
	                              decker
	                        gently but urgingly
	                ilia help us make direct contact
	                with vger

	                              ilia
	                i cannot

	      decker looks at ilias hand still resting on his
	      then

	                              decker
	                then tell us who vger is where
	                hes from w need your help

	      for another moment ilia continues smiling at decker
	      holding his hand then abruptly the smile vanishes
	       the hand is released clearly shes again the
	      probe as

	                              ilia
	                why have two carbon units entered
	                vger

	      decker glances at mccoy who shakes his head almost
	      imperceptibly he doesnt know but decker has an
	      obvious reply

	                              decker
	                they want to make contact with
	                vger
	                        trying to revive
	                         ilias memory again
	                         touches her hand
	                ilia

	      ilia peers at him blankly allows him to continue 
	      touching her hand but obviously it means nothing to
	      her

	                              decker
	                        continuing
	                         distressed
	                         to ilia
	                does vger object to the presence
	                of the two carbon units

	                              ilia
	                the carbon units are of no
	                consequence vger will determine
	                their purpose

	                              mccoy
	                their purpose is to survive

	                              ilia
	                that is also vgers purpose

	      deckers face reflects his bemusement

	                              decker
	                you said vgers purpose was to
	                find and join with the creator

	      we can see what appear to be sparkling globules of

	      then disappearing there well see other swarms
	      occasionally too coming from different directions 
	      they will later be identified as sensor swarms on

	      kirk weighs alternatives then pushes his thruster

	      their thruster jets flash propel them toward the

	      thrusters and then forward momentum stops motionless
	      then spock sees something indicates

	305   long angle to include sensor swarm o                     305

	      now we see that they are tiny multicolored points
	      of flashing light  almost like swarms of bees
	      they approach the inner wall at this central point
	      and seem to disappear through the orifice

	306   kirk and spock  another swarm approaching o           306

	      this sensor swarm has been coming from a direction
	      that will take them close past kirk and spock then

	      he turns to kirk his hand closed on something

	      spock opens his hand retaining a hold on something
	      with his fingers he brings it up to kirks face mask
	       its a tiny sensor its multicolors flashing as it
	      tries to escape from spocks fingers and in this close
	      view we see that this is a sensor very much like the
	      one weve seen earlier embedded in the iliaprobes
	      throat hollow then spock releases it and it darts
	      to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
	      wall

	      spock turns his spacesuit turns his tricorder out to
	      ward the mediator balls takes a reading in that di
	      rection then a glance to kirk

	                              spock

	      spock touches his spacesuit controls the thruster

	                              kirk

	313   angle at mediator ball                                     313

	      spock reaching the ball halts his momentum andremovesone gauntlet baring his hand stretching the bare
	      hand toward a part of it which looks strangely alive
	      the very power generated from this area is clearly
	      affecting spocks hand meanwhile kirk has used his
	      thrusters to join him

	                              kirk
	                spock if youre right its mind
	                may beenormous

	      but spock pays him no attention his entire being now
	      focused on the pulsating glow of the alive area 
	      the camera moving in closer to spock as heforceshis
	      hand toward that surface closer closer

	      watching almost mesmerized torn between wanting to
	      pull spock away from the wall  and knowing that
	      spock must go through with it for everyones sake

	315   closer on spock                                            315

	      preparing for the ordeal moving his hand to the liv
	      ing area the invisible force even stronger  but
	      spocks strength unwavering and now hetouches thesurface and it flares with strange energy at the
	      touch and at the same moment spock body convulses
	      as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
	      charging through him

	316   close on spocks face                                      316

	      as he begins to shudder with the shock the camera
	      continues into extreme closeup as we see spocks mouth
	      open  he screams camera into extreme close shot of
	      spocks eyes

	317   camera zoom  through spocks eyes                         317

	      music in and up as we travel through abstract images
	      per con pederson discussion symbolizing vgers
	      incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge
	      these images suggest patterns of atoms molecules
	      galaxies dimensions of the universe beyond human

	      camera bridging back out through spocks eyes and into
	      angle on spocks face as he lies in a sickbay bed his
	      eyes are open he is staring straight ahead as if in a
	      catatonic state completly unaware of his surroundings
	      then doctor chapel leans into scene moving a medical
	      scanner over the brain area

	                              chapel
	                now scanning pons area at spinal

	      mccoy at a console watching readings he is getting
	      from chapels scanner kirk watches mccoy anxiously

	                              mccoy
	                indications of some neurological
	                traumathe power pouring through
	                that mindmeld must have been
	                staggering

	      before kirk can reply they hear alaugh an abrupt
	      harsh bitter laugh

	320   across them to sickbay                                     320

	      as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
	      spock who has just laughed  but there is no indication
	      of laughter from him now a startled chapel has stepped
	      back away from the bed spock seems to be attempting
	      to focus orient himself as kirk and mccoy hurry to the
	      bedside

	                              spock
	                        quiet
	                jim

	      and spock reaches out a hand weakly takes a surprised
	      kirks hand in his mccoy exchanges a surprised glance 
	      with kirk as spock  clutching kirks hand in friend
	      ship and need  struggles to summon strength to speak

	                              spock

	                        looks at kirk

	      with kirk and mccoy exchanging another surprised
	      glance at spocks emotion with mccoy gesturing kirk
	      not to question it

	                              kirk
	                        gently

	                and it considers the enterprise a

	                probe refers to our ship as an

	                              chapel

	                              decker
	                a machine then it had to be

	      just now confronting them regarding ilia with open
	      disapproval

	                              scott
	                well sir now what about all that
	                a living entity the captain says
	                entity a living thing

	      decker really hasnt heard scott hes gazing at ilia
	      attempting to digest what shes just said but quickly

	                              decker
	                thank you scotty

	      now decker and ilia move toward the exit scott gaz
	      ing after them glaringly watching ilias every
	      move suddenly almost into the corridor ilia turns
	      and looks back at the engine room she addresses
	      decker but load enough for scott to overhear

	                              ilia
	                there is no logical reason for

	      kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer
	      on which is appearingan image of vger looming ominously in orbit over earth

	                              uhura
	                the visual is a lunar monitor

	      as they begin to study it the image suddenly distorts and 
	      is replaced by signal interference  signal static lines 
	      running across the viewer screen 
	      somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
	      sometimes seen on the television screen

	                              uhura

	      uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we 
	      hear a series of carrier wave beeps spock looks up from 
	      his console listens to it

	                puzzling the interference
	                appears to be a rather simple

	      the room ilia stes toward decker is caught in the
	      light and instantly vanishes in a brilliant white glow

	      we see decker seeming to grow larger  as if his
	      molecular pattern is expanding a spectacular series
	      of visuals the spiraling light enveloping the entire
	      area

	      all this emanating from deckers body becoming larger
	       also brighter and brighter until now it is almosttransparent and the spiraling now expanding in all
	      directions and the room itself starting todissolve
	      vanishing into nothingness  and all commencing to
	      slip into the new dimension

	      kirk spock and mccoy stand transfixed another instant
	      around them vger seems to be transforming into bril
	      liant lovely patterns they all turn and race into
	      the complex in the direction of their vessel

	      the flowering effect now spreading outward vgers
	      massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting
	      graceful shapes and brilliant colors  a transcendence
	      into another dimension
	      and then all of that is left is a shimmering jewellike
	      point of light  and then it too fades  and reveals
	      there in the blueblack of space the uss enterprise

	      patterns all gaze at the viewer awed at what theyve
	      seen and undergone they exchange looks silently no
	      one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some
	      thing which is beyond mere words we hear an elevator
	      door scott and chapel enter the bridge and stand 
	      silently watching

	                              mccoy

	                              spock

	                              kirk
	                 and the foolish emotions
	                which drive us

	                              spock
	                        looks at kirk then
	                i prefer your poet dantes phrase
	                 the divine restlessness of
	                the human spirit

	                              mccoy
	                spock youre quoting poetry

	      spocks cold look at mccoy is interrupted by

	                        to scott
	                shall we give the enterprise a
	                proper shakedown mr scott

	                              scott
	                        suddenly beaming

	                i have no business on vulcan
	                engineer

	      kirk and spock exchange a look  then kirk turns to
	      the helm

	                              kirk

	                        nods gravely
	                a most logical choice captain

	      then the trace of a smile comes over spocks face
