                as a matter of cosmic history it
                has always been easier to destroy

                not anymore  now we can do both
                at the same time  according to myth

                sacrifice a vain or an empty one 
                and we will not debate his profound

        after a long moment the camera discovers kirk  he
        pours a drink then decides not to have it
        he sits wearily not knowing how to shake the ghosts
        then he sees the book
        kirk picks up the battered volume the gift from his
        friend and closes his eyes a moment  almost idly he
        starts turning pages looking for a clue

        pockets and pulls out the halfglasses 
        one of the lenses is broken  it has a deep impact on

                like it

                tricked my way out of death and patted
                myself on the back for my ingenuity
                i know nothing
                                david
                you knew enough to tell saavik that
                how we face death is at least as
                important as how we face life
