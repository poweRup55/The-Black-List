		2   ext dry lake bed  day

			camera pans an arid expanse of scorched earth jonn a
			ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien race
			toils beneath a blazing sun his back to camera he
			sinks an auguring device into the ground drilling in
			vain for water there are many hundreds of holes in the
			earth around him he suddenly straightens and squints
			into the dust storm as hoofbeats fill the soundtrack

		3   angle

			jonn releases his auguring device and hurries toward 
			his rifle

		4   jonns pov intercut  slow motion

			horse and rider dressed in a hooded cape thunder
			toward him

		5   back to scene

			the camera tilts down revealing jonns rifle as he
			cocks the weapon

			he uses stones as ammunition which slip from his hand
			and fall to the parched ground as he tries to load the
			rifle he turns and points the gun as the rider continues
			his approach

		6   jonn raises his gun as the rider reins his horse to a
			halt ten feet short of him the beast snorts and stamps
			its hooves impatiently while the rider studies the
			frightened homesteader and removes a breathing apparatus
			from his mouth finally he speaks

							rider
					i thought weapons were forbidden
					on this planet

			the rider swings down from the saddle hes tall
			powerfully built beneath his dusty robes his face
			shadowed by a hood he indicates their bleak surroundings

							rider
							continuing
					besides i cant believe youd
					kill me for a field of empty holes

							jonn
							pathetic
					its all i have

			jonn sags under the futile weight of existence the
			rider approaches him without fear its all the homesteader
			can do to keep from sobbing

							rider
					your pain runs deep

							jonn
							sobbing
					what do you know of my pain

							rider
					let us explore it together

			the rider collects himself and concentrates deeply jonn
			is immediately transfixed he begins to tremble tears
			flood his dirty cheeks

							rider
					continuing soothing tone
					each man hides a secret pain it
					must be exposed and reckoned with
					it must be dragged from darkness
					and forced into the light share
					your pain share your pain with
					me and gain strength from the
					sharing
		
		6   continued 

			jonn whimpers and cries out in anguish finally the
			catharsis ends jonn sobs and rests his head on the
			riders chest he opens his eyes and blinks in wonder 
			and amazement at the rider as he comforts jonn

							jonn
							as if reborn
					where did you get this power

							rider
					the power was within you

							jonn
					trying to find the words
					i feel as if a weight has been
					lifted from my heart how can i
					repay you for this miracle

							rider
					join my quest

							jonn
					what is it you seek

							rider
					what you seek what all men have
					sought since time began  ultimate
					knowledge but to find it well
					need a starship

							jonn
					a starship there are no starships
					on nimbus iii

							rider
					perhaps i have a way to bring one
					here

							jonn
					but how

							rider
					have faith my friend there are
					more of us than you know

			as he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic
			features hes bearded his hair is shaggy he has
			the piercing eyes of a zealot and to our surprise
			pointed ears his name is sybok

							jonn os
					youre a vulcan

			sybock nods and does something weve never seen a vulcan
			do he smiles as he does the first faint bars of
			the star trek theme well up on the soundtrack

			kirk pulls himself up balancing on a ledge barely an

			a breathtaking but vertigoinducing high angle shot of

			there is a soft whooshing sound and spock suddenly rises

							spock
					greetings captain

		15   wide shot

			spock hovers in mid air alongside the startled kirk kept
			aloft by means of levitation boots his hands are clasped
			behind his back typically spocklike

								kirk
							he gasps
					spock  what are you doing in
					this neck of the woods

							spock
					im flattered twelve hundred
					points of interest in yosemite and
					you pick me

			spock doesnt take kirks hint to get lost

							spock
					i regret to inform you that the
					record for freeclimbing el captain
					is in no danger of being broken

								kirk
							as he climbs
					im not trying to break any records
					im doing this because i enjoy it
					not to mention the most important
					reason for climbing a mountain

							spock
					and that is

								kirk
							with a smile
					because its there

							spock
					ah captain

								kirk
					mm

							spock
					i do not think you realize the
					gravity of your situation

			kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save himself
			beneath his feet a miniavalanche of rocks is dislodged
			tumbling to the valley below

								kirk
						glaring at spock
					on the contrary gravity is foremost
					on my mind look im trying to make
					an ascent here why dont you go
					pester dr mccoy for a while

							spock
					i believe dr mccoy is not in
					the best of moods

		16   campsite below

			mccoy still watching kirks progress is getting angrier
			by the second

							mccoy
							grumbling
					goddamnirresponsible
					playing games with life

		17   el capitan  kirk and spock

			kirk strains for the next handhold

							spock
					concentration is vital you must
					be one with the rock

								kirk
					spock i appreciate your concern
					but if you dont stop distracting
					me im liable to be one

			and as kirk reaches for the next crack the ledge comes
			loose underfoot and he finds himself falling

		18   angle  spock

			he dives after kirk firing boosters to increase his
			speed

		19   angle  kirk

			twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles downward
			he thrashes at the air unable to defeat gravity

		25   closer kirk and spock

			the top of kirks head is practically touching the

			blinks in disbelief

								kirk
					oh god

							spock
					perhaps because it is there is
					not sufficient reason for climbing
					a mountain

			kirk dangles  undignified but lucky to be alive

								kirk

			a 23rd century equivalent of a frontier saloon futuristic

			and boisterous talk arguments fistfights two men
			play futuristic pool on a table filled with water

		29   a sexy catwoman

			dances atop of the bar flicking her long striped tail and
			hissing seductively at her rowdy audience

		30   angle on saloon door

			a stranger coming from outside approaches familiar
			westernstyle doors but instead of swinging open like
			youd expect they whoosh apart automatically the
			stranger steps into the bar and the doors whoosh back
			into place

		31   wide shot

			talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its
			attention to the newcomer the stranger seen only from
			the back steps into the squalid bar the bartender jerks
			his thumb in the direction of the back room the stranger
			crosses to the back room and disappears inside talk and
			noise resume

			a veiwscreen is revealed bg as the cloaked stranger
			passes through the room toward the back we hear

					television announcers voice
					your dream can become a reality
					the paradise innlots to choose
					from we at the paradise inn
					attempt to create the closest thing
					to paradise in paradise city that
					is

			int back room

			the stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
			and is revealed to be a young woman a romulan her
			name is caithlin dar and she stands on the threshold of
			the room trying to adjust her eyes to the murky
			surroundings shes a little nervous and a long way
			from home

			the back room is a storage area for unwanted odds and
			ends a ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air
			around two men are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends
			of a table theyre two busy drinking to notice
			caithlins entrance

							caithlin
					gentlemen im caithlin dar

			the man seated closest to caithlin slowly swivels his head
			in her direction he wearily extracts himself from his
			chair and comes forward hes a terran specifically
			an englishman named st john talbot thin and dissipated
			alcoholic talbot is a veteran of the diplomatic corps he
			pats down his unruly hair and straightens his soiled suit
			he gives caithlin a tired smile and extends a limp hand

							talbot
					ah yes our new romulan
					representative
							continuing
					welcome to paradise city my
					dear capital of the socalled
					planet of galactic peace im
					st john talbot the federation
					representative here on nimbus iii
					my charming companion here is the
					klingon consul korrd

			caithlin regards the hulking figure at the other end of
			the table korrd is an old overweight klingon a
			oncegreat warrior past his prime he doesnt rise
			to greet caithlin instead he takes a swig from a
			flagon and emits an earthshaking belch

							caithlin
					i expect thats klingon for hello

							talbot
					wont you come in my dear

		33   ext paradise city

			jonn clambers over a dune with determination he aims
			his gun as sybock and his mount ride majestically to the

			soldiers a virtual army of ragged settlers  aliens of
			every different race the poor and the downtrodden  united
			in their devotion to sybok

		34   int back room  saloon

							caithlin
					twenty years ago our three
					governments agree to develop this
					planet together

			korrd pours a drink from a bottle into his cup

							korrd
					hmmm

							caithlin
					a new age was born

							talbot
				our new age has died a quick death
							continuing
					and the settlers we conned into
					coming here  they were the dregs
					of the galaxy they immediately
					took to fighting amongst themselves
					we forbade them weapons and they
					soon began to fashion their own

							caithlin
					well then it appears ive arrived
					just in time

			korrd looks confused

							korrd
					mmmm

			there are shouts from outside and the whine of a warning
			klaxon

			ext paradise city

			a handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate
			it suddenly gives way camera cranes up over the top of
			the arch to reveal syboks army on the threshold of the
			city in their midst towering majestically above them
			is sybok on horseback he urges his mount forward with
			quiet determination he and his army pour under the arch
			and proceed up the main drag

			townspeople scurry for protection anticipating an attack
			those who consider challenging sybok are allayed by the
			crude weapons and intimidating looks of the followers
			sybok intends to take this town by show of force without
			having to fire a shot and it looks like hell succeed

		36   ext street outside saloon

			korrd caithlin and talbot emerge to see what the hubbub
			is about when they see the approaching forces korrd
			and talbot immediately turn tail and run back inside
			after a moment caithlin follows

		37   int saloon

			korrd fearing the worst goes behind the bar and opens
			a bottle he upends it and pours the contents down his
			throat he prefers to die drunk

			talbot and caithlin hurry to the viewscreen talbot
			moves to turn off the program being broadcast

					television announcers voice
					we have spared no expense to
					create the closest thing to

			caithlin and talbot wait as a communications screen rises
			in front of them the saloon doors are forced open jonn
			rushes in

							jonn
					get away from that transmitter

			korrd lifts his drink jonn grabs him korrd pushes back
			camera pans to reveal two armed soldiers who grab korrd and
			hold him the klaxon winds down to eerie silence as sybok
			enters observing the action he is followed by several
			soldiers

							sybok
					appraising them one by one
					romulan terran klingon
					consider yourselves my prisoners

							talbot
							scoffing
					prisoners were already prisoners
					on this worthless lump of rock
					what possible value could we be
					to you

							sybok
					nimbus iii may be a worthless lump
					of rock but it does have one
					unique treasure its the only
					place in the entire galaxy that
					has the three of you

							caithlin
						to sybok boldly
					i dont know who you are or what you
					want but i can tell you this our
					governments will stop at nothing to
					insure our safety

					thats exactly what im counting on

					i am preparing to toast a marsh

			kirk climbs up as a bolt of light hits the rock before

			with a smile kirk returns the klingon salute

			he notices spock and mccoy standing at the window

							kirk
					cosmic thoughts gentlemen

					i thought you said men like us

					i was wrong

			camera pushes in on them as the three men smile their

			two cups full of bourbon and hands one to kirk who
			sets aside his marshmallow on a stick kirk and mccoy
			clink cups in a silent toast and drink distracted by
			strange plinking sounds from close by spock is
			revealed absently strumming his vulcan lute in search
			of a tune

							kirk
							with a smile
					are you just going to sit there
					and pluck that thing or are
					you going to play something

			the plinks and plunks gradually become a tune the
			unmistakable row your boat kirk and mccoy react with
			delight kirk takes a hit of bourbon and clears his
			throat

							kirk
							singing
					row row row your boat gently
					down the stream merrily merrily
					merrily merrily life is but a
					dream
							repeats

			spock jumps in

							spock
						singing overlapping
					row row row your boat gently
					down the stream merrily merrily
					merrily merrily life is but a
					dream
							repeats

			kirk sits down at the fire he reaches over and taps
			mccoy encouraging him to join the songfest

							mccoy
						singing overlapping
					row row row your boat gently
					down the stream merrily merrily
					merrily merrily life is but a
					dream
							repeats

			as they continue to sing we execute the greatest
			pullback of all time the campfire becomes a dot of
			light the dot of light joins other dots of light
			they become stars of the universe
