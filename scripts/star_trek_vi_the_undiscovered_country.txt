               good morning two months ago a
               federation starship monitored an
               explosion on the klingon moon
               praxis we believe it was caused
               by overmining and insufficent
               safety precautions the moons
               decimation means an almost eighty
               percent loss of available energy and
               a deadly pollution of their ozone they
               will have depleted their supply of
23   continued

               oxygen in less than half a century
               due to their enormous military
               budget the klingon economy does not
               have the resources with which to
               combat this catastrophe last
               month at the behest of the uh
               vulcan ambassador i opened a
               dialogue with gorkon chancellor of
               the klingon high council he proposes
               to commence negotiations at once

               stations and star bases along the
               neutral zone an end to seventy
               years of unremitting hostility
               which the klingons can no longer
               afford

                      continuing
               if the klingons sue for peace we
               could accumulate savings in defense

               federation ecomony free to grapple

               im sure our exploration and
               science programs would not be
               affected but the facts speak for
               themselves captain

                         admiral donald
               i must protest to offer the
               klingons a safe haven within
               federation space is suicide and
               if we dismantle the fleet wed be
               defenseless before a bellicose
               people with a foothold on our
               territory led by an unprincipled
               tyrant the opportunity here is to
               embargo trading force them to run

               through their own resources faster
               and bring them to their knees
               then well be in a far better
               position to dictate terms

               trustworthy im forced to agree
               with admiral donald this is
                    he gropes for tact
               a terrible a terrifying idea

     the admiral whispers to the commander in chief

                         commander in chief
               your son was killed by a klingon
               wasnt he captain

               yes sir

                         commander in chief
               im sorry but commander spock has
               persuaded the federation that this
               situation is too promising to
               ignore

                         spock
               it is imperative that we act now to
               support the gorkon initiative lest
               more conservative elements persuade
               his empire that it would be better
               to attempt a military solution and
               die fighting

               specifically requested you and your

               why in gods name

                         commander in chief
               there are some klingons who feel
               the same about a peace treaty as
               yourself and admiral donald
               theyll think twice about attacking
               the enterprise under your command

               question  which preoccupies our

               breathing room

                         kirk

                         kerla
               captain kirk i thought romulan ale
               was illegal

     it takes kirk a moment to regain his composure

                         kirk
               one of the advantages of being a
               thousand light years from

               the architects of our future

     tongues get looser gorkon watches

                         scotty
               perhaps we are looking at something
               of that future here

               commander spock mindful of all
               your work behind the scenes and
               despite the cordiality at this
               mess i do not sense an acceptance

               engrained prejudice

                         chekov

                    looks at kirk
               i believe the captain feels that
               starfleets mission has always been
               one of peace

                         kerla
               you hypocritically presume that
               your democratic system gives you a
               moral prerogative to force other
               cultures to conform to your
               politics

                         mccoy
               thats not true

                         kerla
               no

     uhura turns to the klingon next to her  all tact

               ve do not impose democracy on

               dont let them put words in your

               in the engine room of a starship
               to be accused of gunboat diplomacy

                         kerla
               in any case we know where this is
               leading the annihilation of our
               culture klingons will replace
               those on the lowest rung of the
               federation employment ladder
               taking menial jobs and performing
               them for lower pay

                         chekov
               thats economics not racism

                         uhura

               the chancellor of the high council
               is dead the result of an
               unprovoked attack while he
               travelled to see you under a flag
               of truce on a mission of peace
               captain kirk was legally arrested
               for the crime may i remind you
               that he and doctor mccoy boarded
               kronos one of their own free will
               none of these facts are in dispute
               mr president and as a matter of
               these facts the klingon people
               have a right to justice what i am
               asking now is does the federation
               plan to stand in the way of our
               justice or do you consider your
               self and all federation personnel
               above the law

     a mumbling is heard thoughout the court at this line

               can go in and rescue the hostages

                         admiral donald

               accessible the hostages will be

69   int torpedo bay uss enterprise
     spock and scotty hover over the torpedo console
     looking at numbers and lights spock thinks hard
     eight bells sound it is perfectly clear according to
     the inventory program all torpedoes are still aboard

                         scotty
               its as i said mr spock
               inventory still registers every
               torpedo

                         spock musing
               yet the data banks insist we fired
               twice one computer is lying

                         scotty
               a computer canna lie sir

                         spock
               then we must check the torpedoes
               visually

                         scotty
               that could take hours

                         spock
               nevertheless

                         scotty
               and if theyre all in place

                         spock

               one bloody tear

                         spock

     the klingon empire in all its barbaric splendor

     a cavernous stadium arranged in circlular tiers cut from
     jagged stone a place from a bygone age of savage and
     awesome beauth something between a circus and a
     cathedral

     turned for the occasion into a gigantic courtroom
     with thousands of spectators screaming kirk kirk
     kirk

     many in the audience hold spears with lighted heads

     kirk and mccoy in the dock stand in the bottom at the
     very center of the circle surrounded by a klingon
     audience in rising tiers while hooded klingon judges
     sit invisible in a darkened dugout one judge is an
     albino

     chang wears the prosecutors mantle

     in the audience is president azetbur and her advisers
     the trial is being broadcast and special cameras
     abound

     near kirk and mccoy sits their young eager klingon
     defense attorney kirk keeps his cool thoughout
     though mccoy tends to steam

     the rules are different attorneys are empowered to
     ask their witnesses a question at any time and to mix
     this up with statements and charges

     the proceedings begin in subtitled klingon kirk and
     mccoy wear headphones when they speak a translator

     as chang gets going we zoom into his mouth and he
     converts to english the judges gavel is a grotesque
     nailed glove

               the state will show that enterprise
               fired on kronos one without
               provocation the chancellor and his
               advisers having been lulled into a
               false sense of security with an
               invitation to a state dinner aboard
               captain kirks vessel at 1930 hours
               that same evening
               turns to kirk
               do you deny all this

     the mob howls kirk as the judge gavels

                         judge
               the prisoner will respond

                         kirk

                         chang
               isnt it a fact that you served
               romulan ale a beverage illegal in
               the federation because of its
               overwhelming potency

               you have known if she had come
               now captain the record clearly shows
               there were no other ships in the
               sector

                         kirk
               therewere no other ships in the
               sector

                         chang
               did you have occasion to refer to
               your ships data banks during that
               night

                         kirk
               i checked the data banks yes

                         chang
               and what did they tell you

                         kirk  reluctant
               that we fired two photon torpedoes
               but

     the mob howls

                         chang
               the witness is excused for the
               time being

     chang whirls off as the judge gavels

74   int klingon courtroom  day

     one of president gorkons guards is on the stand
     he is missing an arm

                         guard

                         defense attorney
               perhaps they merely wore starfleet
               uniforms

                         chang
               i move that remark be stricken as

               interested in facts not theories

               only a magnetic shield prevents
               beaming your new home awaits
               underground

     he blows a mechanical whistle in response two guards
     emerge from below with a screaming klingon convict

                         prisoner
               no nooooo

                         commandant
               punishment means exile from prison
               to the surface  on the surface
               nothing can survive

     the guards dump the screaming convict on the ice 
     without furs the weather immobilizes him at once 
     his cries become fainter

                         commandant
               below no one can escape work well
               and you will be treated well work
               badly and you will die

91   continued

     he leaves the box is removed by a guard and proceeds
     him through the huge door and down the steps

91a  long shot

     as the prisoners are herded after him and the door
     shuts leaving the frozen vista as it was snow
     flurries obscure the trap door almost instantly only
     the frozen corpse of the convict is left  until it too
     is covered

91b  int rura penthe

     start looking up at the closing trap door outside we
     can see snow flurries as the panel shuts with a clang

     pan down to reveal

     a huge underground labyrinth with an enormous courtyard
     surrounded by prisoners huts open to the center
     prisoners wander freely within the scum of the universe

     everyone wears furs leg irons and is freezing

     an endless scaffolding above the guards

     many of the prisoners look like they could snap kirk
     and mccoy in half with one hand

     kirk and mccoy step gingerly around the outside wall
     watching the yard a shadow falls across them

     their pov its a behemoth alien he speaks in a
     guttural incomprehensible language

     the alien nods and wanders off

                         martia  shrugs
               we dont get many presidential
               assassins

                         kirk

                         martia
               theyll make it look like an
               accident

                         mccoy
               what are you in for if you dont mind
               my asking

                         martia

               ancient and respected trade there

91b  continued

                         martia  smiles grimly
               dont you know everyone on rura
               penthe is here for life

     kirk and mccoy didnt know

92   int galley uss enterprise

     under lt valeriss watchful eye crewmen are taking the
     kitchen apart all sorts of dishes and cutlery litter
     the place spock scotty and chekov enter

                         spock
               any progress

                         lt valeris
               weve got a crew of three hundred
               turning the own quarters inside
               out but the killers may be among
               them surely theyve disposed of
               these boots by now wouldnt it
               have been logical to leave them on
               gorkons ship

                         spock
               even logic must give way to
               physics gravity hadnt been
               restored by the time they escaped
               without their boots they would not
               have stayed on the klingon
               transporter pads

                         chekov  mimes with his finger
               why not simply vaporize them

                         lt valeris
               like this

     she whips out her phaser and fires incinerating a pot
     alarms and claxons howl chekov covers his ears

                         lt valeris
               as you know sir no one can fire
               an unauthorized phaser aboard a
               starship

     she switches off the alarm and has another thought

                         lt valeris
               suppose when they returned they
               threw the boots into the garbage

92   continued

                         spock
               im having the garbage searched
               if my surmise is correct those
               boots will cling to the killers
               necks like tiberian bats they
               couldnt make their escape without
               them nor can they simply throw
               them out a window for all to see
               no theyre here somewhere

     uhura comes into the galley stepping over pots and
     pans she is not happy

                         uhura
               did someone shoot off a phaser
               mr spock

     he turns

               ive pulled out my  ah wooden shoe
               and starfleet is screaming for us

     spock coughs hard

                         scotty
               could take weeks sir

                         spock
               thank you mr scott were we to
               return to spacedock the killers
               would surely manage to dispose of
               their incriminating footwear
                     turns to uhura
               please report our situtation to
               starfleet

                         lt valeris
               a lie

                         spock
               an error

92   continued

                         uhura
               ill tell them someone threw a
               gravity boot into it

     angle on spock

     reacting he looks at lt valeris

                         lt valeris
               right a gravity boot in the warp
               drive

     she goes off shaking her head

                         uhura
               you understand that we have lost
               all contact with captain kirk

                         spock
               at present hes surrounded by a
               magnetic shield if my calculations
               are correct he should be deep into
               his escape planning by this time

93   int rura penthe penal colony

     kirk gets hit in the face its already bloody its
     a prison fight kirk and an alien are surrounded by
     prisoners who are sneering and jeering

     kirk and mccoy are distinctly grubbier

     kirk scrambles to his feet and circles the alien
     swings a large paw but kirk ducks comes in with an
     uppercut he connects but does little damage they
     circle some more the alien dives legs first and
     scissors kirk who goes down roughly wrestling kirk
     slips free

     mccoy and martia watchthe leg irons make it
     complicated they can also wrap around someones
     neck

     the alien moves in closely hits kirk again kirk
     fights back with a kick to the chest which doubles
     over the alien

     then kirk slams the alien on the neck and he goes down
     kirk starts to walk away

     but a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle kirk
     looks back and the alien is grinning drags him in
93   continued

     the alien stands and grips kirk chest to back in a
     giant bear hug surely he will crush the life out of
     kirk he lifts kirk right off of the ground kirk
     almost gone lifts his legs up high and swings down
     hard smashing the alien in the knee that does it the
     alien falls to the ground screaming and holding his
     knee kirk staggers away catching his breath

                         martia
               theyll respect him now

                         mccoy
               thats a comfort

                         kirk
               i was lucky that thing had knees

     they look back the alien is still on the ground

                         martia
               thats not his knee
                    off kirks look
               not everybody keeps their genitals
               in the same place captain

                         kirk
               anything you want to tell me

     before she can answer

                         kirk  continuing
               mccoy why dont you see what you
               can do let them know were not
               holding a grudge

                         mccoy
               suppose hes holding a grudge

     mccoy tentatively goes forward and examines the knee
     he is without any medical tools of any kind

     the alien yells but lets him look he manipulates the
     leg then ties a kind of splint with an old rag

94   angle on kirk

                         kirk
               theres gotta be a way out of this

                         mccoy
               that was the general idea i
               intended to convey

                         kirk
               i didnt mean this future

                         mccoy
               are we playing multiple choice

                         kirk
               some people are afraid of the
               future of what might happen
                       pauses
               i was frightened really
               frightened

                         mccoy
               ive looked death in the eye a
               thousand times and tried to be
               professional about it of course
               it wasnt usually my death i was
               looking at
                            pause
               what frightened you specifically

                         kirk
               no more neutral zone i was used
               to hating klingonsthats why i
               failed in our assignment it never
               even occurred to me to take gorkon
               at his word spock was right

                         mccoy
               well dont be too hard on yourself
               we all felt exactly the same

                         kirk  shakes his head
               uh uh somebody felt much worse
               and im starting to understand why

96   continued

                         mccoy
               well if youve got any bright
               ideas nows the time to

                         kirk
               times a problem you heard the
               judge the peace conference is on
               again whoever killed gorkon will
               sandbag the whole thing all over again
               unless we find a way out of here

     suddenly mccoy puts his hand over kirks mouth they
     pretend to sleep something crawls towards them in the
     dark they sweatkirk clenches his fists

                         martia whispers
               kirk its me martia

     kirk opens his eyes mccoy plays possum

                         martia  continuing
               listen no one has ever escaped
               from rura penthe

                         kirk  ready

     under the watchfull eye of furclad klingon guards

     an alien next to kirk sneaks several of the crystals
     into his garment

               many people speculated about my

               who said he was an idealist driven
               by visionary notions others said
               he had no choice that he was a
               pragmatic technocrat making the
               best of a devastating situation
               great men are seldom good men the
               truth is my father was both a
               pragmatist and an idealist if
               praxis had not exploded then quite
               possibly his idealism would not
               have found expression nor would
               mine we are a proud race we are
