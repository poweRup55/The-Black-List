     followed by a rollup which crawls into infinity

               episode vi
               revenge of the jedi
               luke skywalker has returned to his home
               planet of tatooine in an attempt to rescue
               his friend han solo from the clutches of the
               vile gangster jabba the hutt

               little does luke know that the galactic
               empire has secretly begun construction on a
               new armored space station even more powerful
               than the first dreaded death star

               when completed this ultimate weapon will
               spell certain doom for the small band of
               rebels struggling to restore freedom to the
               galaxy

     pan down to reveal a monstrous halfcompleted death star its
     massive superstructure curling away from the completed section
     like the arms of a giant octopus beyond in benevolent contrast
     floats the small green moon of endor

     an imperial star destroyer moves overhead toward the massive
     armored space station followed by two zipping tie fighters a
     small imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and
     hustles toward the death star

     the shuttle captain makes contact with the death star

3    int death star  control room                                   3

     operators move about among the control panels a shield operator
     hits switches beside a large screen on which is a display of the
     death star the moon endor and a bright web delineating the
     invisible deflector shield
     a control officer rushes over to the shield operator

                              officer
               inform the commander that lord vaders
               shuttle has arrived

                              operator
               yes sir

     the control officer moves to a view port and watches as the
     imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay a squad of
     imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft

4    int death star  main docking bay                               4

     the death star commander moff jerjerrod a tall confident
     technocrat strides through the assembled troops to the base of
     the shuttle ramp the troops snap to attention many are uneasy
     about the new arrival but the death star commander stands
     arrogantly tall

     the exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a whoosh revealing only
     darkness then heavy footsteps and mechanical breathing from
     this black void appears darth vader lord of the sith vader
     looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp

                              jerjerrod
               lord vader this is an unexpected pleasure
              were honored by your presence

                              vader
               you may dispense with the pleasantries
               commander im here to put you back on
               schedule

     the commander turns ashen and begins to shake

                              jerjerrod
               i assure you lord vader my men are working
               as fast as they can

                              vader
               perhaps i can find new ways to
               motivate them

                              jerjerrod
               i tell you this station will be operational
               as planned
                              vader
               the emperor does not share your
               optimistic appraisal of the situation

                              jerjerrod
               but he asks the impossible i need more men

                              vader
               then perhaps you can tell him when he
               arrives
                              jerjerrod aghast
               the emperors coming here

                              vader
               that is correct commander and he is most
               displeased with your apparent lack of
               progress

                              jerjerrod
               we shall double our efforts

                              vader
               i hope so commander for your sake the
               emperor is not as forgiving as i am

5    ext road to jabbas palace  tatooine                           5

     a lonely windswept road meanders through the desolate tatooine
     terrain we hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive reply
     before catching sight of artoodetoo and seethreepio making
     their way along the road toward the ominous palace of jabba the
     hutt

                              threepio
               of course im worried and you should be
               too lando calrissian and poor chewbacca
               never returned from this awful place

     artoo whistles timidly

                              threepio
               dont be so sure if i told you half the
               things ive heard about this jabba the hutt
               youd probably shortcircuit

     the two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace

                              threepio
               artoo are you sure this is the right place
               i better knock i suppose

6    ext jabbas palace  gate                                       6

     threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device then
     timidly knocks on the iron door

                              threepio instantly
               there doesnt seem to be anyone there lets
               go back and tell master luke

     a small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery
     mechanical arm with a large electronic eyeball on the end pops
     out and inspects the two droids

                              strange voice
               tee chuta hhat yudd

                              threepio
               goodness gracious me

     threepio points to artoo then to himself

                              threepio
               artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd
               mischka jabba du hutt

     the eye looks from one robot to the other there is a laugh then
     the eye zips back into the door the hatch slams shut artoo
     beeps his concern

                              threepio
               i dont think theyre going to let us in
               artoo wed better go

     artoo beeps his reluctance as threepio turns to leave suddenly
     the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic screech
     the robots turn back and face an endless black cavity the droids
     look at one another afraid to enter

     artoo starts forward into the gloom threepio rushes after his
     stubby companion the door lowers noisily behind them

                              threepio
               artoo wait oh dear artoo artoo i really
               dont think we should rush into all this

     artoo continues down the corridor with threepio following

                              threepio
               oh artoo  artoo wait for me

7    int jabbas palace  hallway                                    7

     the door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the
     dark passageway the frightened robots are met by two giant
     green gamorrean guards who fall in behind them threepio glances
     quickly back at the two lumbering brutes then back to artoo one
     guard grunts an order artoo beeps nervously

                              threepio
               just you deliver master lukes message and
               get us out of here oh my oh oh no

     walking toward them out of the darkness is bib fortuna a
     humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull

                              bib
               die wanna wanga

                              threepio
               oh my die wanna wauaga we  we bring a
               message to your master jabba the hutt

     artoo lets out a series of quick beeps

                              threepio cont
                and a gift
               thinks a moment then to artoo
               gift what gift

     bib shakes his head negatively

                              bib
               nee jabba no badda me chaade su goodie

     bib holds out his hand toward artoo and the tiny droid backs up a
     bit letting out a protesting array of squeaks threepio turns to
     the strangelooking alien

                              threepio
               he says that our instructions are to give it
               only to jabba himself

     bib thinks about this for a moment

                              threepio
               im terribly sorry im afraid hes ever so
               stubborn about these sort of things

     bib gestures for the droids to follow

                              bib
               nudd chaa

     the droids follow the tall tentacled alien into the darkness
     trailed by the two guards

                              threepio
               artoo i have a bad feeling about this

8    int jabbas throne room                                         8

     the throne room is filled with the vilest most grotesque
     creatures ever conceived in the universe artoo and threepio seem
     very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber
     light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as bib
     fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the
     leader of this nauseating crowd jabba the hutt the monarch of
     the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a
     maniacal grin chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful
     alien female dancer named oola at the foot of the dais sits an
     obnoxious birdlike creature salacious crumb bib whispers
     something in the slobbering degenerates ear jabba laughs
     horribly at the two terrified droids before him threepio bows
     politely

                              threepio
               good morning

                              jabba
               bo shuda

     the robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive loose
     skinned villain

                              threepio
               the message artoo the message

     artoo whistles and a beam of light projects from his domed head
     creating a hologram of luke on the floor the image grows to over
     ten feet tall and the young jedi towers over the space
     gangsters

                              luke
               greetings exalted one allow me to introduce
               myself i am luke skywalker jedi knight and
               friend to captain solo i know that you are
               powerful mighty jabba and that your anger
               with solo must be equally powerful i seek an
               audience with your greatness to bargain for
               solos life jabbas crowd laughs with your
               wisdom im sure that we can work out an
               arrangement which will be mutually beneficial
               and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
               confrontation as a token of my goodwill i
               present to you a gift these two droids

     threepio is startled by this announcement

                              threepio
               what did he say

                              luke cont
                both are hardworking and will serve you
               well

                              threepio
               this cant be artoo youre playing the
               wrong message

     lukes hologram disappears

     jabba laughs while bib speaks to him in huttese

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               there will be no bargain

                              threepio
               were doomed

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               i will not give up my favorite decoration i
               like captain solo where he is

     jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the
     throne hanging high flat against the wall exactly as we saw
     him last is a carbonized han solo

                              threepio
               artoo look captain solo and hes still
               frozen in carbonite

9    int dungeon corridor                                            9

     one of jabbas gamorrean guards marches artoo and threepio down a
     dank shadowy passageway lined with holding cells the cries of
     unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls
     occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars
     at the hapless droids artoo beeps pitifully

                              threepio
               what could possibly have come over master
               luke is it something i did he never
               expressed any unhappiness with my work oh
               oh hold it ohh

     a large tentacle wraps around threepios neck he manages to
     break free and they move on to a door at the end of the
     corridor

10   int boiler room                                                10

     the door slides open revealing a room filled with steam and
     noisy machinery the guard motions them into the boiler room
     where they are met by a tall thin humanlike robot named ev9d9
     eveninedenine behind the robot can be seen a torture rack
     pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid a second
     power droid is upside down  as smoking branding irons are
     pressed into his feet the stubby robot lets out an agonized
     electronic scream artoo and threepio cringe as the guard grunts
     to ev9d9

                              ninedenine
               ah good new acquisitions you are a
               protocol droid are you not

                              threepio

                              ninedenine

                              threepio
               oh well yes

                              ninedenine
               how many languages do you speak

                              threepio
               i am fluent in over six million forms of
               communication and can readily

                              ninedenine
               splendid we have been without an interpreter
               since our master got angry with our last
               protocol droid and disintegrated him

                              threepio
               disintegrated

                              ninedenine to a gamorrean guard
               guard this protocol droid might be useful
               fit him with a restraining bolt and take him
               back to his excellencys main audience
               chamber

     the guard shoves threepio toward the door

                              threepio disappearing
               artoo dont leave me ohhh

     artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes then he beeps
     angrily

                              ninedenine
               youre a feisty little one but youll soon
               learn some respect i have need for you on
               the masters sail barge and i think youll
               fit in nicely

     the poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured
     electronic scream

11   int jabbas throne room                                        11

     the court of jabba the hutt is in the midst of a drunken raucous
     party sloppy smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as oola
     and a fat female dancer perform in front of jabbas throne
     jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye
     beckons oola to come and sit with him she stops dancing and
     backs away shaking her head jabba gets angry and points to a
     spot next to him

                              jabba
               da eitha

     the lovely alien shakes her head again and screams

                              oola
               na chuba negatorie na na natoota

     jabba is furious and pulls her toward him tugging on the chain

                              jabba
               boscka

     he pushes a button and before the dancer can flee a trap door
     in the floor springs open and swallows her up as the door snaps
     shut a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream jabba and
     his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers
     hurry over to watch her fate through a grate

     threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of
     han solo but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen
     an unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering on the far
     side of the room the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow
     the approach of two guards followed by boushh an oddly cloaked
     bounty hunter leading his captive han solos copilot chewbacca
     the wookiee

     bib takes his place next to his disgusting master and whispers
     into his ear pointing at chewbacca and the bounty hunter jabba
     listens intently then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster
     and speaks a greeting in a strange electronically processed
     tongue ubese

                              boushh in ubese subtitled
               i have come for the bounty on this wookiee

                              threepio
               oh no chewbacca

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               at last we have the mighty chewbacca

     jabba lets out a loud long bloodcurdling laugh and turns to
     threepio waving him closer the reluctant droid obeys

                              threepio
               oh uh yes uh i am here your
               worshipfulness uh yes

     jabba continues speaking as threepio nervously translates
     boushh listens studying the dangerous creatures around the room
     he notices boba fett standing near the door

                              threepio
               oh the illustrious jabba bids you welcome
               and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty
               five thousand

                              boushh in ubese subtitled
               i want fifty thousand no less

     jabba immediately flies into a rage knocking the golden droid
     off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor boushh
     adjusts his weapon as jabba raves in huttese and threepio
     struggles back onto the throne the disheveled droid tries to
     compose himself

                              threepio
               uh oh but what what did i say
               to boushh
               uh the mighty jabba asks why he must pay
               fifty thousand

     the bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand
     threepio looks at it then looks at jabba then back to the
     bounty hunter the droid is very nervous and jabba is getting
     very impatient

                              threepio
               because hes holding a thermal detonator

     the guards instantly back away as do most of the other monsters
     in the room jabba stares at the silver ball which begins to
     glow in the bounty hunters hand the room has fallen into a
     tense hush jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until
     a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               this bounty hunter is my kind of scum
               fearless and inventive

     jabba continues

                              threepio
               jabba offers the sum of thirtyfive and i
               suggest you take it

     bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for
     his reaction boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator
     and it goes dead

                              boushh
               zeebuss

                              threepio
               he agrees

     the raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and
     applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch chewbacca
     growls as he is led away we spot lando calrissian disguised as
     a skiff guard in a partial face mask the band starts up and
     dancing girls take the center of the floor to the hoots of the
     loudly appreciative creatures

     boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys
     the scene his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare
     from across the room boba fett is watching him boushh shifts
     slightly cradling his weapon lovingly boba fett shifts with
     equally ominous arrogance

12   int dungeon corridor and cell                                  12

     gamorrean guards lead chewie down the same hallway we saw before
     when a tentacle reaches out at the wookiee chewies ferocious
     roar echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into
     its cell in terror it takes all the guards to hurl chewie
     roughly into a cell slamming the door behind him chewie lets
     out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door

13   ext jabbas palace                                             13

     the palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset on the
     road in front a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out
     for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction

14   int jabbas throne room  night                                14

     silence the room is deserted only the awful debris of the alien
     celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before
     several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room snoring
     loudly

     a shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the
     perimeter of the room and is revealed to be boushh the bounty
     hunter he picks his way carefully through the snoring drunken
     monsters

     han solo the frozen space pirate hangs spotlighted on the wall
     his coffinlike case suspended by a force field the bounty
     hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch
     to one side of the coffin the heavy case slowly lowers to the
     floor of the alcove

     boushh steps up to the case studying han then turns to the
     controls on the side of the coffin he activates a series of
     switches and after one last hesitant look at han slides the
     decarbonization lever the case begins to emit a sound as the
     hard shell covering the contours of hans face begins to melt
     away the bounty hunter watches as hans body is freed of its
     metallic coat and his forearms and hands previously raised in
     reflexive protest drop slackly to his side his face muscles
     relax from their mask of horror he appears quite dead

     boushhs ugly helmet leans close to hans face listening for the
     breath of life nothing he waits hans eyes pop open with a
     start and he begins coughing the bounty hunter steadies the
     staggering newborn

                              boushh
               just relax for a moment youre free of the
               carbonite

     han touches his face with his hand and moans

                              boushh
               shhh you have hibernation sickness

                              han

                              han
               who are you

     the bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head
     revealing the beautiful face of princess leia

                              leia
               someone who loves you

               i gotta get you out of here

     as leia helps her weakened lover to stand up the relative quiet
     is pierced by an obscene huttese cackle from the other side of
     the alcove

                              han
               whats that i know that laugh

     the curtain on the far side of the alcove opens revealing jabba
     the hutt surrounded by bib and other aliens he laughs again
     and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee

                              han
               hey jabba look jabba i was just on my way
               to pay you back but i got a little
               sidetracked its not my fault

     jabba laughs

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               its too late for that solo you may have
               been a good smuggler but now youre bantha

     the guards grab han and start to lead him away

                              han
               jabba ill pay you triple youre throwing
               away a fortune here dont be a fool

     han is dragged off as lando quickly moves forward and attempts
     to lead leia away

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               bring her to me

     jabba chuckles as lando and a second guard drag the beautiful
     young princess toward him threepio peeks from behind a monster
     and quickly turns away in disgust

                              leia
               we have powerful friends youre gonna regret
               this

               im sure

     inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of
     jabbas ugly blob of a head and leia turns away in disgust

                              leia
               ugh

                              threepio

15   int dungeon cell                                               15

     the heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks
     open a guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell
     and the door slams shut behind him leaving only a thin sliver of
     light from a crack in the door han is trying to collect himself
     when suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell he
     jumps back against the cell door and listens

                              han
               chewie chewie is that you

     the shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward han
     lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into
     the light revealing chewie

                              han
               ah chewchewie

     the giant wookiee barks with glee

     chewie barks an excited blue streak

               of himself much less rescue anybody

               little while everybody gets delusions of

     chewie growls insistently he holds han to his chest and pets his
     head

                              han

16   int main gate and hall  jabbas palace                        16

     noisily the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding
     light and reveal the silhouetted figure of luke skywalker he is
     clad in a robe similar to bens and wears neither pistol nor
     laser sword luke strides purposefully into the hallway two
     giant guards move to block lukes path luke halts

     luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards who
     immediately lower their spears and fall back the young jedi
     lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway

     bib fortuna appears out of the gloom he speaks to luke as they
     approach each other but luke doesnt stop and bib must reverse
     his direction and hurry alongside the young jedi in order to carry
     on the conversation several other guards fall in behind them in
     the darkness

                              luke
               i must speak with jabba

     bib answers in huttese shaking his head in denial luke stops
     and stares at bib he raises his hand slightly

                              luke
               you will take me to jabba now

     bib turns in hypnotic response to lukes command and luke
     follows him into the gloom

                              luke
               you serve your master well

     bib responds

                              luke
               and you will be rewarded

17   int jabbas throne room                                        17

     jabba is asleep on his throne with leia lying in front of him
     salacious sits by jabbas tail watching it wriggle leia is now
     dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl a chain runs
     from a manaclenecklace at her throat to her new master jabba
     the hutt threepio stands behind jabba as bib comes up to the
     gangster slug

                              threepio
               at last master lukes come to rescue me

                              bib
               master

     jabba awakens with a start and bib continues in huttese

                              bib
               luke skywalker jedi knight

                              jabba in huttese subtitled

                              bib in huttese subtitled
               he must be allowed to speak

     jabba furious clobbers bib and shoves him away

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               you weakminded fool hes using an old jedi
               mind trick

     luke stares hard at jabba

                              luke
               you will bring captain solo and the wookiee
               to me

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               your mind powers will not work on me boy

                              luke
               nevertheless im taking captain solo and his
               friends you can either profit by this or
               be destroyed its your choice but i warn
               you not to underestimate my powers

     jabbas laugh is mean and loud threepio attempts to warn luke
     about the pit

                              threepio
               master luke youre standing on

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               there will be no bargain young jedi i shall
               enjoy watching you die

     luke reaches out and a pistol jumps out of a guards holster and
     flies into lukes hand the bewildered guard grabs for it as
     jabba raises his hand

                              jabba
               bascka

     the floor suddenly drops away sending luke and the hapless guard
     into the pit the pistol goes off blasting a hole in the
     ceiling jabba laughs and his courtiers join in leia starts
     forward but is restrained by a human guard lando recognizable
     behind his mask she looks at him and he shakes his head no

18   int rancor pit                                                 18

     luke and the guard have dropped twentyfive feet from a chute
     into the dungeonlike cage luke gets to his feet as the guard
     yells hysterically for help a crowd gathers up around the edge
     of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to rumble
     open the guard screams in panic luke looks calmly around for a
     means of escape

                              threepio
               oh no the rancor

     at the side of the pit an iron door rumbles upward and a giant
     fanged rancor emerges the guard runs to the side of the pit and
     tries futilely to scramble to the top the hideous beast closes
     in on him

     the rancor moves past luke and as the guard continues to
     scramble the rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering
     jaws a few screams and the guard is swallowed with a gulp the
     audience cheers and laughs at the guards fate

     the monster turns and starts for luke the young jedi dashes away
     just ahead of the monsters swipe at him and picks up the long
     arm bone of an earlier victim the monster grabs luke and brings
     him up to his salivating mouth at the last moment luke wedges
     the bone in the monsters mouth and is dropped to the floor the
     monster bellows in rage and flails about hitting the side of the
     pit causing an avalanche

     the monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees luke who
     squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall luke looks past the
     monster to the holding cave beyond on the far side of the
     holding cave is a utility doorif only he can get to it the
     rancor spots luke and reaches into the crevice for him luke
     grabs a large rock and raises it smashing it down on the
     rancors finger

19   holding tunnel  rancor pit                                    19

     the rancor lets out a loud howl as luke makes a run for the
     holding cave he reaches the door and pushes a button to open it
     when he succeeds he sees a heavy barred gate between him and
     safety beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner
     luke turns to see the monster heading for him and pulls with all
     his might on the gate the guards move to the gate and start
     poking at the young jedi with spears laughing

     luke crouches against the wall as the monster starts to reach
     for him suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up
     the wall as the rancor moves in for the kill luke picks up a
     skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel the giant
     overhead door comes crashing down on the beasts head squashing
     it like a sledgehammer on an egg

     a startled gasp is heard from the stunned court theres
     consternation at this turn of events heads look to jabba who is
     actually turning red with anger leia cannot suppress her joy
     jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off

                              jabba in huttese subtitled
               bring me solo and the wookiee they will all
               suffer for this outrage

21   int rancor pit                                                 21

     the rancor keepers have come into the cage and are examining
     their dead beast one of them breaks down and weeps the other
     glares menacingly at luke who is unworried several guards rush
     into the holding tunnel and take luke away

22   int throne room                                                22

     the crowd of creepy courtiers parts as han and chewie are brought
     into the throne room and other guards drag luke up the steps

                              luke

     the little skiff skips around the burning sail barge which
     continues its chain of explosions as the skiff sails off across
     the desert the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one
     final conflagration

     a ferocious sandstorm blocks our view then through the roar we
     hear the voices of our heroes they emerge slowly from the veil
     of sand pressing on against the wind first come artoo and
     threepio followed by leia guiding han then luke and lando come
     into view each supporting one side of the towering chewbacca
     who hobbles from his wound

     soon they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing
     sand it is the millennium falcon and parked beside it lukes
     trusty xwing and a twoseated ywing they must shout to be
     heard

                              han
               i dont know all i can see is a lot of
               blowing sand

                              leia
               thats all any of us can see

                              han blinking
               then i guess im getting better

     as soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the falcon the
     wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather
     condition threepio hits a switch and the gangplank lowers with
     a hum

                              han turning to luke
               ive got to hand it to you kid you were
               pretty good out there

                              luke shrugging it off
               i had a lot of help think nothing of it

                              han
               no im thinking a lot about it that carbon
               freeze was the closest thing to dead there
               is and it wasnt just sleepin it was a big
               wide awake nothing

     luke nods as chewie growls affectionately at the young jedi
     warrior mussing his hair like a proud uncle and leia warmly
     hugs him

                              luke moving to his ship
               ill see you back at the fleet

                              han

     luke and artoo take off in their spacecraft

                              han
               looking dubiously at lando obviously
               remembering his friends betrayal and
               subsequent aide
               guess i owe you some thanks too lando

                              lando

               just give me bad luck the rest of my life so

               later

     the desolate yellow planet fills the screen lukes xwing
     appears and peels off to the left a moment later the falcon
     appears as a dot and grows huge to roar directly over the
     camera

45   int xwing  cockpit                                           45

     luke is at the controls with artoo attached behind him outside
     the canopy luke speaks into his comlink to the others in the
     millennium falcon

                              luke

               me now i owe you one

     a message from artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front
     of luke he smiles at the monitor and speaks to artoo as he
     pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand

                              luke
               thats right artoo were going to the
               dagobah system i have a promise to keep

     a super star destroyer and several ships of the imperial fleet
     rest in space above the halfcompleted death star and its green
     neighbor endor four squads of tie fighters escort an imperial
     shuttle toward the death star

47   int death star  corridor to docking bay                       47

     lord vader strides down the hallway accompanied by a very
     nervous death star commander

48   int docking bay  death star                                   48

     thousands of imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth
     docking bay vader and the officer walk to the landing platform
     where the shuttle is coming to rest

     the shuttles ramp lowers and the emperors royal guards come out
     and create a lethal perimeter the assembled troops move to rigid
     attention with a momentous snap

     then in the huge silence which follows the emperor appears he
     is a rather small shriveled old man his bent frame slowly makes
     its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane he wears a
     hooded cloak similar to the one ben wears except that it is
     black the emperors face is shrouded and difficult to see
     except for his piercing yellow eyes commander jerjerrod and
     darth vader kneel to him the supreme ruler of the galaxy beckons
     to the dark lord

                              emperor to vader
               rise my friend

     vader rises and falls in next to the emperor as he slowly makes
     his way along the rows of troops jerjerrod and the other
     commanders stay kneeling until the supreme ruler and vader
     followed by several imperial dignitaries pass by only then do
     they join in the procession

                              vader
               the death star will be completed on schedule

                              emperor
               you have done well lord vader and now i
               sense you wish to continue your search for
               young skywalker

                              vader
               yes my master

                              emperor
               patience my friend in time he will seek you
               out and when he does you must bring him
               before me he has grown strong only together
               can we turn him to the dark side of the
               force

                              vader
               as you wish

                              emperor
               everything is proceeding as i have foreseen

     he laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of imperial
     troops

     once again artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp
     environs of the swamp planet and hes none too happy about it
     he beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at yodas
     cottage warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to
     fight the gloom

50   int yodas house                                               50

     the tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen
     floor of the cottage our view travels up the stick to the small
     green hand that clutches it and then to the familiar face of
     yoda the jedi master his manner is frail and his voice though
     cheerful seems weaker

                              yoda
               hmm that face you make look i so old to
               young eyes

     luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and indeed his
     look has been woeful caught he tries to hide it

                              luke
               no of course not

                              yoda tickled chuckles
               i do yes i do  sick have i become old and
               weak points a crooked finger when nine
               hundred years old you reach look as good you
               will not hmm

     yoda chuckles at this coughs and hobbles over toward his bed

                              yoda
               soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned
               it i have

     yoda sits himself on his bed with great effort

                              luke
               master yoda you cant die

                              yoda
               strong am i with the force but not that
               strong twilight is upon me and soon night
               must fall that is the way of things  the
               way of the force

                              luke
               but i need your help ive come back to
               complete the training

                              yoda
               no more training do you require already know
               you that which you need

     yoda sighs and lies back on his bed

                              luke
               then i am a jedi

                              yoda shakes his head
               ohhh not yet one thing remains vader you
               must confront vader then only then a jedi
               will you be and confront him you will

     luke is in agony he is silent for a long moment screwing up his
     courage finally he is able to ask

                              luke
               master yoda is darth vader my father

     yodas eyes are full of weariness and compassion an odd sad
     smile creases his face he turns painfully on his side away from
     luke

                              yoda
               mmm rest i need yes rest

     luke watches him each moment an eternity

                              luke
               yoda i must know

                              yoda
               your father he is

     luke reacts as if cut

                              yoda
               told you did he

                              luke
               yes

     a new look of concern crosses yodas face  he closes his eyes

                              yoda
               unexpected this is and unfortunate

                              luke
               unfortunate that i know the truth

     yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth

                              yoda gathering all his strength
               no unfortunate that you rushed to face
               him that incomplete was your training not
               ready for the burden were you

                              luke
               well im sorry

                              yoda
               remember a jedis strength flows from the
               force  but beware  anger fear aggression
               the dark side are they  once you start down
               the dark path forever will it dominate your
               destiny

     he beckons the young jedi closer to him

               the powers of the emperor or suffer your
               fathers fate you will luke when gone am i

     he catches his breath a shiver runs through the ancient green
     creature and he dies luke stares at his dead master as he
     disappears in front of his eyes

     luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting artoo beeps a
     greeting but is ignored by his depressed master luke kneels
     down begins to help artoo with the ship then stops and shakes
     his head dejectedly

                              luke

     luke looks up to see the shimmering image of ben kenobi

                              luke
               obiwan why didnt you tell me

     the ghost of ben kenobi approaches him through the swamp

                              luke
               you told me vader betrayed and murdered my
               father

                              ben
               you father was seduced by the dark side of
               the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker
               and became darth vader when that happened
               the good man who was your father was
               destroyed so what i have told you was
               true from a certain point of view

                              luke turning away derisive
               a certain point of view

                              ben
               luke youre going to find that many of the
               truths we cling to depend greatly on our own
               point of view

     luke is unresponsive ben studies him in silence for a moment

                              ben
               i dont blame you for being angry if i was
               wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt
               have been for the first time you see what
               happened to your father was my fault

     ben pauses sadly

                              ben
               anakin was a good friend

     luke turns with interest at this as ben speaks luke settles on
     a stump mesmerized artoo comes over to offer his comforting
     presence

                              ben
               when i first knew him your father was
               already a great pilot but i was amazed how
               strongly the force was with him  i took it
               upon myself to train him as a jedi  i
               thought that i could instruct him just as
               well as yoda  i was wrong  my pride has
               had terrible consequences for the galaxy

     luke is entranced

                              luke
               theres still good in him

                              ben
               i also thought he could be turned back to the
               good side it couldnt be done he is more
               machine now than man twisted and evil

                              luke
               i cant do it ben

                              ben
               you cannot escape your destiny

                              luke
               i tried to stop him once i couldnt do it

                              ben
               vader humbled you when first you met him
               lukebut that experience was part of your
               training it taught you among other things
               the value of patience  had you not been so
               impatient to defeat vader then you could
               have finished your training here with yoda
               you would have been prepared

                              luke
               but i had to help my friends

                              ben grinning at lukes indignation
               and did you help them it was they who had to
               save you you achieved little by rushing back
               prematurely i fear

                              luke with sadness
               i found out darth vader was my father

                              ben
               to be a jedi luke you must confront and
               then go beyond the dark side  the side your
               father couldnt get past impatience is
               the easiest door  for you like your father
               only your father was seduced by what he
               found on the other side of the door and you
               have held firm youre no longer so reckless
               now luke you are strong and patient and
               now you must face darth vader again

                              luke
               i cant kill my own father

                              ben
               then the emperor has already won you were
               our only hope

                              luke
               yoda spoke of another

                              ben
               the other he spoke of is your twin sister

                              luke
               but i have no sister

                              ben
               hmm to protect you both from the emperor
               you were hidden from your father when you
               were born the emperor knew as i did if
               anakin were to have any offspring they would
               be a threat to him that is the reason why
               your sister remains safely anonymous

                              luke
               leia leias my sister

                              ben
               your insight serves you well bury your
               feelings deep down luke they do you credit
               but they could be made to serve the emperor

     luke looks into the distance trying to comprehend all this

                              ben continuing his narrative
               when your father left he didnt know your
               mother was pregnant your mother and i knew
               he would find out eventually but we wanted
               to keep you both as safe as possible for as
               long as possible  so i took you to live with
               my brother owen on tatooine and your mother
               took leia to live as the daughter of senator
               organa on alderaan

     luke turns and settles near ben to hear the tale

                              ben attempting to give solace with his words
               the organa household was highborn and
               politically quite powerful in that system
               leia became a princess by virtue of
               lineage no one knew shed been adopted of
               course but it was a title without real
               power since alderaan had long been a
               democracy  even so the family continued to
               be politically powerful and leia following
               in her foster fathers path became a senator
               as well  thats not all she became of
               course she became the leader of her cell
               in the alliance against the corrupt empire
               and because she had diplomatic immunity she
               was a vital link for getting information to
               the rebel cause  thats what she was doing
               when her path crossed yours for her foster
               parents had always told her to contact me on
               tatooine if her troubles became desperate

     luke is overwhelmed by the truth and is suddenly protective of
     his sister

                              luke
               but you cant let her get involved now ben
               vader will destroy her

                              ben
               she hasnt been trained in the ways of the
               jedi the way you have luke  but the force
               is strong with her as it is with all of your
               family there is no avoiding the battle you
               must face and destroy vader

     the two droids

     han peers at landos new insignia on his chest and is amused

                              han
               well look at you a general huh

                              lando
               oh well someone must have told them about
               my little maneuver at the battle of taanab

                              han sarcastic
               well dont look at me pal i just said you
               were a fair pilot i didnt know they were
               lookin for somebody to lead this crazy

               well who says they didnt  but i
               aint crazy youre the respectable
               one remember

     mon mothma signals for attention and the room falls
     silent

                              mon mothma
               the emperor has made a critical error and the
               time for our attack has come

     this causes a stir mon mothma turns to a holographic model of
     the death star the endor moon and the protecting deflector
     shield in the center of the room

                              mon mothma
               the data brought to us by the bothan spies
               pinpoints the exact location of the emperors
               new battle station we also know that the
               weapon systems of this death star are not yet
               operational with the imperial fleet spread
               throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to
               engage us it is relatively unprotected but
               most important of all weve learned that the
               emperor himself is personally overseeing the
               final stages of the construction of this
               death star

     a volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd han turns to
     leia as chewie barks his amazement

                              mon mothma cont
               many bothans died to bring us this
               information admiral ackbar please

     admiral ackbar steps forward and points to the death stars force
     field and the moon of endor

                              ackbar
               you can see here the death star orbiting the
               forest moon of endor although the weapon
               systems on this death star are not yet
               operational the death star does have a
               strong defense mechanism it is protected by
               an energy shield which is generated from the
               nearby forest moon of endor the shield must
               be deactivated if any attack is to be
               attempted once the shield is down our
               cruisers will create a perimeter while the
               fighters fly into the superstructure and
               attempt to knock out the main reactor

     theres a concerned murmur

                              ackbar cont
               general calrissian has volunteered to lead
               the fighter attack

     han turns to lando with a look of respect

                              han
               good luck

     lando nods his thanks

                              han

               we have stolen a small imperial shuttle
               disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret
               imperial code a strike team will land on the
               moon and deactivate the shield generator

     the assembly begins to mumble among themselves

                              threepio
               sounds dangerous

                              leia to han
               i wonder who they found to pull that off

                              general madine
               general solo is your strike team assembled

     leia startled looks up at han surprise changing to admiration

               uh my teams ready i dont have a command
               crew for the shuttle

     chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers  han looks up at
     him

               well its gonna be rough pal i didnt want
               to speak for you

     chewie waves that off with a huge growl

                              han smiles
               thats one

     they turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are
     more cheers the commanders part and there at the back stands
     luke han and leia are surprised and delighted

     leia moves to luke and embraces him warmly she senses a change
     in him and looks into his eyes questioningly

                              leia
               what is it

                              luke hesitant

     the pilots seat chewie in the seat next to him is trying to
     figure out all the imperial controls

     something out the window the millennium falcon leia nudges him
     gently

                              leia

     the converted control room is dimly lit except for a pool of
     light at the far end there the emperor sits in an elaborate
     control chair before a large window which looks out across the

     darth vader standing with other members of the imperial council
     cautiously approaches his master the rulers back is to vader
     after several tense moments the emperors chair rotates around

     fills the frame

     through the viewscreen the death star and the huge super star
     destroyer can be seen

                              han
               if they dont go for this were gonna have

     out the window

     lord vader stands back to us staring out a window at the death
     star now some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn
     after a moment of stillness he walks down the row of controllers
     to where admiral piett is leaning over the tracking screen of the
     controller weve seen earlier piett straightens at vaders
     approach

                              vader
               where is that shuttle going

                              vader
               do they have a code clearance

                              piett
               its an older code sir but it checks out i
               was about to clear them

     vader looks upward as he senses lukes presence

     the stolen imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moons
     dark primeval forest dwarfed by the ancient towering trees
     on an adjacent hill the helmeted rebel contingent makes its way
     up a steep trail leia and han are slightly ahead of chewie and
     luke the troops of the striketeam squad follow with artoo and
     threepio bringing up the rear artoo beeps

     suddenly to the ground signaling the rest of the group to stop
     han and luke crawl up to take a look

     their pov not far below them two imperial scouts are wandering
     through bushes in the valley below their two rocket bikes are
     parked nearby

     chewie start quietly down

     the four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not
     far from the two imperial scouts

                              han
               chewie and i will take care of this you stay

               quietly there might be more of them out
               there

                              han grins
               hey its me

     han and chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the
     scouts luke and leia exchange smiles

     han sneaks up behind one of the scouts steps on a twig and the
     scout whirls knocking han into a tree the scout shouts for his
     companion

                              scout 1
               go for help go

     the second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off but
     chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon causing the
     scout to crash into a tree han and scout 1 are in a rousing
     fistfight

                              luke sarcastic
               great come on

     luke starts for the scuffle followed by leia with her laser
     pistol drawn as they run through the bushes leia stops and
     points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder
     bikes with an unoccupied bike parked nearby

                              leia
               over there two more of them

                              luke
               i see them wait leia

     but leia doesnt hear him and races for the remaining speeder
     bike she starts it up and takes off as luke jumps on the bike
     behind her

                              luke pointing to the controls
               quick jam their comlink center switch

     luke and leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit barely
     avoiding two huge trees

                              han
               hey wait ahhh

     he flips the remaining scout to the ground

65   ext forest  the bike chase                                    65

     the two fleeing imperial scouts have a good lead as luke and leia
     pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour the fire
     from their bikes laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving
     targets

                              luke
               move closer

     leia guns it closing the gap as the two scouts recklessly veer
     through a narrow gap in the trees one of the bikes scrapes a
     tree slowing the scout

                              luke
               get alongside that one

     leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scouts bike that
     their steering vanes scrape noisily luke leaps from his bike to
     the back of the scouts grabs the imperial warrior around the
     neck and flips him off the bike into a thick tree trunk luke
     gains control of the bike and follows leia who has pulled ahead
     they tear off after the remaining scout

                              luke
               get him

     the speeding chase passes two more imperial scouts these two
     swing into pursuit chasing luke and leia firing away with their
     laser cannon the two rebels look behind them just as lukes bike
     takes a glancing hit

                              luke indicating the one ahead
               keep on that one ill take these two

     with leia shooting ahead luke suddenly slams his steering vanes
     into the braking mode lukes bike is a blur to the two pursuing
     scouts as they zip by him on either side luke slams his bike
     into forward and starts firing away having switched places with
     his pursuers in a manner of seconds lukes aim is good and one
     scouts bike is blasted out of control it explodes against a
     tree trunk

     the scouts cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts
     into turbo drive going even faster luke keeps on his tail
     far ahead leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom
     through the deathdealing trunks now leia aims her bike skyward
     and rises out of sight

     the scout turns in confusion unable to see his pursuer
     suddenly leia dives down upon him from above cannon blasting
     the scouts bike takes a glancing hit

     leia moves in alongside him the scout eyes her beside him
     reaches down and pulls out a handgun before leia can react the
     scout has blasted her bike sending it out of control leia dives
     off as her bike explodes against a tree the happy scout looks
     back at the explosion but when he turns forward again he is on
     a collision course with a giant fallen tree he hits his brakes
     to no avail and disappears in a conflagration

     another part of the forest luke and the last remaining scout
     continue their weaving chase through the trees now luke moves up
     close the scout responds by slamming his bike into lukes a
     fallen tree forms a bridge across their path the scout zips
     under luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the
     scouts both riders look ahead  a wide trunk looms directly in
     lukes path but the scouts bike beside him makes it almost
     impossible for him to avoid it luke banks with all his might
     leaning almost horizontal over the scouts bike and is able to
     make it by just clipping the tree when he straightens he and
     the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes
     and are moving as one

     another big tree looms in lukes path he reacts instinctively
     and dives off his bike the two bikes come apart a second before
     lukes explodes against a tree the scout sweeps out and circles
     back to find luke

     luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him
     and opens fire with his laser cannon luke ignites his laser
     sword and begins deflecting the bolts the scouts bike keeps
     coming and it appears that in a second it will cut luke in half
     at the last instant luke steps aside and chops off the bikes
     control vanes with one mighty slash the scouts bike begins to
     shudder then pitching and rolling it rises up to slam directly
     into a tree in a giant ball of fire

     a strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly
     into view the creature is an ewok by the name of wicket he
     seems somewhat puzzled and prods leia with a spear the princess
     groans this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her
     again leia sits up and stares at the threefoothigh ewok she
     tries to figure out where she is and what has happened her
     clothes are torn shes bruised and disheveled
     the ewok jumps up and grabs a fourfootlong spear which he
     holds in a defensive position leia watches him as he circles
     warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear

                              leia
               cut it out

     she stands up and the ewok quickly backs away

                              leia
               im not gonna hurt you

     leia looks around at the dense forest and at the charred remains
     of her speeder bike then sits down with a sigh on a fallen
     log

                              leia
               well looks like im stuck here trouble is
               i dont know where here is

     she puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness
     from her fall she looks over at the watchful little ewok and
     pats the log beside her

                              leia
               well maybe you can help me come on sit
               down

     wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy
     leia pats the log again

                              leia
               i promise i wont hurt you now come here

     more growls and squeaks from the little bear creature

                              leia
               all right you want something to eat

     she takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him
     wicket takes a step backward then cocks his head and moves
     cautiously toward leia chattering in his squeaky ewok language

                              leia
               thats right come on hmmm

     sniffing the food curiously the ewok comes toward leia and sits
     on the log beside her she takes off her helmet and the little
     creature jumps back startled again he runs along the log
     pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak leia
     holds out the helmet to him

                              leia
               look its a hat its not gonna hurt you
               look youre a jittery little thing arent
               you

     reassured wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log
     coming to investigate the helmet suddenly his ears perk up and
     he begins to sniff the air he looks around warily whispering
     some ewokese warning to leia

                              leia
               what is it

     suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on
     the log next to leia leia and wicket both roll backwards off the
     log hiding behind it leia holds her own laser gun ready while
     wicket disappears underneath the log another shot and still no
     sight of anyone in the forest then leia senses something and
     turns to find a large imperial scout standing over her with his
     weapon pointed at her head he reaches out his hand for her
     weapon

                              scout l
               freeze  come on get up

     she hands the weapon over as a second scout emerges from the
     foliage in front of the log

                              scout 1
               go get your ride and take her back to base

                              scout 2
               yes sir

     the second scout starts toward his bike as wicket crouched
     under the log extends his spear and hits the first scout on the
     leg the scout jumps and lets out an exclamation and looks down
     at wicket puzzled leia grabs a branch and knocks him out she
     dives for his laser pistol and the second scout now on his
     bike takes off leia fires away and hits the escaping bike
     causing it to crash into the first scouts bike which flies end
     over end and explodes the forest is quiet once more wicket
     pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards leia with
     new respect he mumbles his awe leia hurries over looking
     around all the time and motions the chubby little creature into
     the dense foliage

                              leia
               come on lets get outta here

     as they move into the foliage wicket takes the lead he shrieks
     and tugs at leia to follow him

                              luke
               will you take it easy lets just figure out
               a way to get out of this thing trying to
               free an arm han can you reach my
               lightsaber

                              han
               yeah sure

     artoo is at the bottommost point in the net he extends his
     cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net han is trying to
     squeeze an arm past threepio to get at lukes lightsaber the net
     continues to spin

                              threepio
               artoo im not sure thats such a good idea
               its a very long drooop

     artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the
     net crashing to the ground as they regain their senses and
     sit up they realize they are surrounded by dozens of ewoks
     each brandishing a long spear

                              han
               wha  hey  point that thing someplace
               else

     han pushes the spear wielded by teebo out of his face and a
     second ewok warrior comes up to argue with teebo the spear
     returns to hans face he grabs it angrily and starts to go for
     his laser pistol

                              han
               hey

                              luke
               han dont itll be all right

     the ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons luke
     lets them take his lightsaber chewie growls at the furry
     critters

                              luke
               chewie give em your crossbow

     artoo and threepio are just untangling themselves threepio gets
     free of the net and sits up rattled

                              threepio
               oh my head oh my goodness

     when the ewoks see threepio they let out a gasp and chatter
     among themselves threepio speaks to them in their native tongue
     the ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself
     before the droid in a moment all the ewoks have followed suit
     chewie lets out a puzzled bark han and luke regard the bowed
     creatures in wonder the ewoks begin to chant at threepio

                              luke
               do you understand anything theyre saying

                              threepio
               oh yes master luke  remember that i am
               fluent in over six million forms of
               communication

                              han
               what are you telling them

               hello i think i could be mistaken
               theyre using a very primitive dialect  but
               i do believe they think i am some sort of god

     chewbacca and artoo think thats very funny han and luke
     exchange what next looks

                              han
               well why dont you use your divine influence
               and get us out of this

                              threepio
               i beg your pardon general solo but that

                              threepio
               its against my programming to impersonate a
               deity

     han moves toward threepio threateningly

                              han
               why you

     several ewoks spears are thrust in hans face at the affront to
     their god the ewoks move in to protect their god and han is
     surrounded by a menacing circle of spears all aimed at him he
     holds up his hands placatingly

     a procession of ewoks winds through the everdarkening forest
     their prisoners  han luke chewie and artoo  are tied to long
     poles and wrapped in vines cocoonlike
     each pole is carried on the shoulders of several ewoks behind
     the captives threepio is carried on a litter like a king by
     the remaining creatures

     the procession moves along a shaky narrow wooden walkway high
     in the giant trees it stops at the end of the walkway which
     drops off into nothingness on the other side of the abyss is a
     village of mud huts and rickety walkways attached to the giant
     trees the lead ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across
     to the village square the other ewoks follow suit

     ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the
     sight of the newcomers the group stops before the largest hut
     han luke chewie and artoo are still bound to their poles han
     is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the
     others are leaned against a tree nearby threepios litterthrone
     is gently placed near the pit he watches with rapt fascination
     han luke and chewie are less than fascinated

                              han
               i have a really bad feeling about this

     chewie growls his concern

     suddenly all activity stops as logray the tribal medicine man
     comes out of the big hut he examines the captives carefully
     goes to join threepio whose throne has been placed on an
     elevated platform a larger grayhaired ewok chief chirpa is
     examining lukes lightsaber with great curiosity

     logray speaks to threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy ewoks
     pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes the ewoks begin
     filling the pit under han with firewood

                              han
               what did he say

               appears you are to be the main course at a
               banquet in my honor

     whats happening at the same moment the prisoners see her

     threepio talks to chirpa and logray who listen and shake their
     heads negatively the medicine man gestures toward the prisoners
     and barks some orders several ewoks jump up and pile more wood
     on the barbecue with vigor leia trades frantic looks with luke
     and han

     threepio speaks to the ewoks the ewoks are disturbed logray
     steps forward and challenges threepio luke closes his eyes and
     begins to concentrate

     with threepio calling out in total panic at his situation

     up at him and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to

     crashes to the ground when the ewoks set him upright the little
     droid is fighting mad artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest
     ewok and begins pursuing him finally getting close enough to
     zap him with an electric charge the ewok jumps two feet in the

     squeaky native tongue the ewoks listen carefully and
     occasionally murmur comments to each other threepio points
     several times at the rebel group and pantomimes a short history

     into an elevator and appears on a ramp on a lower level he
     walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a
     commander with luke in binders at their center the young jedi
     gazes at vader with complete calm

                              commander
               this is a rebel that surrendered to us
               although he denies it i believe there may be
               more of them and i request permission to
               conduct a further search of the area

     the commander extends his hand revealing lukes lightsaber

                              commander
               he was armed only with this

     vader looks at luke turns away and faces the commander taking
     the lightsaber from the commanders hand

                              vader

               search and bring his companions to me

     the officer and troops withdraw vader and luke are left standing
     alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place the sounds of
     the forest filter in upon them

               anakin skywalker my father

                              vader turning to face him
               that name no longer has any meaning for me

                              luke

               is why you couldnt destroy me thats why
               you wont bring me to your emperor now

     vader looks down from luke to the lightsaber in his own black
     gloved hand he seems to ponder lukes words

                              vader indicating lightsaber
               i see you have constructed a new lightsaber

     vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming
     brilliant blade

                              vader
               your skills are complete indeed you are
               powerful as the emperor has foreseen

     they stand for a moment the vader extinguishes the lightsaber

               come with me

                              vader

               must obey my master

                              luke

               kill me

                              vader
               if that is your destiny

                              luke

               of your hate

                              vader

               show you the true nature of the force he is
               your master now

     vader signals to some distant stormtroopers he and luke stand
     staring at one another for a long moment

     imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive the two
     droids duck out of sight behind the tree

     the stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids
     waiting quietly to be taken as the imperial troops move to do
     that however a band of ewoks drops down from above and
     overpowers them

     the ewok attack call all hell breaks loose as hundreds of ewoks
     throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled
     stormtroopers and their awesome twolegged walkers

     biker scouts dart about blasting ewoks only to be crushed by a
     volley of rocks tossed by ewoks from the trees above

     in the confusion of the battle han and leia break away and dive

     biker scouts race around and over the two droids blasting away
     at the little ewoks as the furries scurry for cover

     a group of ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position
     they fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers the
     walker turns and heads for the catapult blasting away with both
     guns the ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions
     just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult ewoks drop
     vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash the
     walkers head flat

     down the stairs luke stands at the top of the stairs ready to

     and realizes he is using the dark side he steps back turns off
     his lightsaber and relaxes driving the hate from his being

                              vader

     leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk

               if you will not fight then you will meet
               your destiny

     vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports
     holding the catwalk then returns to vaders hand luke tumbles
     to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under

     to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a
     vast elevator shaft each stroke of lukes sword drives his
     father further toward defeat

     the dark lord is knocked to his knees and as he raises his sword
     to block another onslaught luke slashes vaders right hand off
     at the wrist causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the
     mechanical stump vaders sword clatters uselessly away over the
     edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below luke
     moves over vader and holds the blade of his sword to the dark

     weakened arm the emperor struggles in his embrace his bolt
     shooting hands now lifted high away from luke now the white
     lightning arcs back to strike at vader he stumbles with his load

     cape he holds his evil master high over his head and walks to
     the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room with
     one final burst of his once awesome strength darth vader hurls
     the emperors body into the bottomless shaft

     the emperors body spins helplessly into the void arcing as it
     falls into the abyss finally when the body is far down the
     shaft it explodes creating a rush of air through the room
     vaders cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers and
     collapses toward the bottomless hole luke crawls to his fathers
     side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety

     ackbar and other mon calamari lean on the railing of the bridge
     watching the large screen showing the death star in the main

     an imperial shuttle with luke alone in the cockpit rockets out
     of the main docking bay as that entire section of the death star
     is blown away but as luke pilots toward the safety of the
     sanctuary moon his thoughts  enhanced by the force  turn to
     his friends aboard the millennium falcon

     the falcon flies at top speed with a single xwing as escort
     over the endless surface of the death star a series of
     explosions within the superstructure follow then swiftly
     overtake the small craft as it races for an exit

     an xwing piloted by wedge antilles races out of the exploding
     superstructure and whizzes toward the sanctuary moon but the
     millennium falcon is not fast enough as it explodes with the
     death star in a supernova of glory

     sky watching for luke

     luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where
     his fathers body lies again dressed in black mask and helmet

     singing dancing and laughing in the communal language of
