               fade in

               ext highway  night

               the wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly 
               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack 
               lights of a police car coming toward us it drops into a 
               dip reappears almost immediately hurtling down the center 
               of the deserted highway it gets closer and closer until the 
               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us

               int police car  night

               a frightened security guard is tensed forward off the back 
               seat his hands clutched into the fabric between the two 
               regular police officers in front

                                     guard
                              an edge of fear in 
                              his voice
                         its coming up slow down
                              he points out between 
                              them
                         there right there

               through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a 
               billboard announcing a new housing development

               ext highway  night

               the squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and 
               starts up a rutted dirt road the sign tells us we are headed 
               for pinewood estates a housing development financed by 
               the farmers bank of wisconsin

               int police car  night

               the security guard is becoming more agitated he wipes a 
               cold sweat off his brow the blue flashers reflect off the 
               fog onto the faces of the men suddenly the security guard 
               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren

                                     officer
                              startled
                         benny god take it easy

                                     benny guard
                         i dont want to scare them away

               the two police officers exchange an indulgent look

               ext housing tract  night

               using only its parking lights the police car creeps up the 
               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses

               int police car  night

               the windows are rolled down periodically one of the men 
               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them

                                     second officer
                         smells smoke

                                     benny
                         i told you

               ext housing tract  night

               the police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops 
               above them on the next hill a necklace of embers from a 
               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog the 
               men get out of the car

                                     benny
                              loud whisper
                         there up on the hill

               the officer steps forward for a better look benny hangs on 
               his shoulder

                                     benny
                         right in line with that burning tree

                                     officer
                         i dont see anything

                                     benny

                         but its there what do you think 
                         started those fires

               the officer strains to see through the fog

                                     officer
                         benny theres nothing there

                                     benny
                         there is they came out of the belly 
                         of the ship and then went to the 
                         first terrace and flew down into the 
                         houses

                                     officer
                         flew oh come on benny

               the second officer is peering intently at something down 
               among the houses

                                     officer
                         you hear that mike now hes telling 
                         us

                         whats that

               benny and the officer look to where mike is pointing what 
               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among 
               the houses below them further into the track another beam 
               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise 
               stationary

                                     benny
                         what did i tell you

                                     officer
                         probably kids

               one of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other 
               side

                                     mike
                              not convinced
                         probably

               ext housing tract  night

               a light shines directly into our eyes as it swings away 
               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police 
               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running 
               lights off the fire on the hill gives the fog down here a 
               red tint

               int police car  night

               the police officers are beginning to feel anxious bennys 
               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesnt help them any

                                     benny
                         dont you think you should call a 
                         backup

                                     officer
                         no we can handle this

               ext housing tract  night

               the police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is 
               on a couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills 
               over the sides of an industrial dumpster as we watch we 
               hear an eerie high pitched whistle a shaft of light slowly 
               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the 
               houses

               int finished house  night

               as a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture 
               window a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside the 
               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen it raises 
               a hand to eye level there is a sharp snap and a hardedged 
               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside 
               of the kitchen and pulls back a threedimensional image of 
               stove sink cupboards electrical fixtures and walls to the 
               silhouette

               ext housing tract  night

               the police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road 
               benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches 
               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the 
               direction of the fire on the hill the police searchlight 
               swings onto the house

                                     officer
                              over outside speakers
                         this is the police identify 
                         yourselves

               it is deathly silent

               carrying a shotgun the officer motions benny and mike to fan 
               out on either side of him and guns drawn they cut across 
               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light

               the fog quickly isolates them heightening their fear each 
               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing 
               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground they drift in 
               and out of visual contact with each other

               benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle 
               sweep by on his left he turns slowly to see through the 
               ribs of an unfinished house a shaft of the white light 
               pointing at a cement mixer

                                     benny
                              to the officers his 
                              voice cracking
                         theres one over here

               the brilliant light swings toward him benny his hands 
               trembling raises the gun

                                     benny
                         stop police

               the light fixes on benny and terrified he shakes off a couple 
               shots the light goes out immediately

                                     mike
                              in bennys direction
                         what happened

                                     benny
                         i think i shot one

                                     mike
                         jesus benny what are you doing

               int finished house bedroom  night

               we are looking at the back of the humanoid figure it crosses 
               to a high window and looks out the reddish tinge of the fog 
               outlines him

               ext housing tract  night

               the men strain to see something through the silent fog

                                     officer
                         you see anything mike

               before mike can answer a strange percussive clicking sound 
               is heard he pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and 
               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices they stop

                                     officer
                         this is the police identify 
                         yourselves

               benny his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of 
               him inches around the house looking for what he shot at he 
               gets to where it should be but its not there his light 
               searches the area there is nothing but a stack of lumber 
               shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner 
               nothing benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again

                                     benny
                              shouts to the officers
                         you wanna give me some help over 
                         here

                                     mike
                         okay

               benny continues around the house he flashes his light into 
               a doorway there is nothing but framing when he moves on a 
               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space then 
               raises its arms with a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing 
               off its wrist into its hands

               at the corner of the house benny hears the snap and stops 
               the high pitched whistle starts behind him he stumbles around 
               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him benny 
               screams in terror and fires at it the light swerves and a 
               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears bennys chest 
               and knocks him to the ground in pain holding his shoulder 
               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the 
               houses

               the officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the 
               air then crashes to the earth

                                     officer
                         mike call for backup
                              shouting
                         benny you all right

                                     benny
                         i dont think so
                              clutching his shoulder

                                     officer
                              waving the beam of 
                              his flashlight shouts
                         benny this is me im going to take 
                         a look

               bennys beam flashes back

                                     benny
                         dont leave me im coming

               the two men begin to trot toward the light it swings wildly 
               around and accompanied by the highpitched whistle starts 
               to stagger back up the hill benny and the officer break 
               into a run they are on their way up the hill when the light 
               in front of them crashes to the earth it rolls over and 
               lays still the beam shooting straight up into the air benny 
               and the officer slow their pursuit terrified of what they 
               might find suddenly a highpitched whistle is bearing down 
               on them from behind before they can turn a light rockets 
               over their heads with a rumble the hill begins to vibrate 
               as they follow its flight they see lights beginning to ripple 
               to life across the skin of a saucershaped spacecraft resting 
               at the edge of the forest on top of the hill with a rumble 
               the hill begins to vibrate frightened the officers stop

               int finished house  night

               the humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the 
               kitchen an indistinct image plays on the inside of its 
               faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive 
               language through the window over the sink we can see the 
               lights of the spaceship

               the rockets flip into the humanoids gloved hands and it is 
               airborne out the open back door

               ext housing tract  night

               from the road benny and the officer watch as the humanoid 
               figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees 
               and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the 
               spacecraft the noise from the ships power plant is deafening 
               as it begins to rise above the trees

               with mike at the wheel the police car its rack lights 
               flashing fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to 
               a bonejarring stop next to benny and the officer as they 
               jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the 
               super white beam of the figure that was in the house they 
               are between it and the ship at the angle that it is coming 
               up the hill the light looks like it is heading directly for 
               them this is too much for the officer and in terror he raises 
               his shotgun and fires wildly at it the figure veers off and 
               disappears into the fog

               with an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity 
               and hurtles into the night sky the concussion waves knock 
               benny and the officers off their feet

               ext country road  night

               the escaped figures light comes out of the fog at tree 
               height we hear the highpitched whistle of its rockets a 
               burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate

                                     subtitle

               the fires on the hillside have been renewed shaking benny

               identification light that flickers on and off inside its

               coral he is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and 
               threatens to suffocate him

               under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend 
               from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head 
               he is hairless underneath a graceful forehead transparent 
               eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes the thin lips that 
               delineate his mouth are chalkwhite

               he tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too 
               weak his hands drop limply from the suit allowing the rent 
               to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath

               behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from

               a stand of alders that border the forest through the leaves 
               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of eau claire 
               wisconsin the cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are 
               of particular interest to him

               when he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get 
               a better look at the town on the wind he can hear shouts 
               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a 
               grade school off to his right suburban houses have begun to 
               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on

               of a promontory from behind the cedars growing there he

               he takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while 
               jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves it 
               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size when it reaches 
               the dimensions of a baseball he brings it close to his

                         we always were

               ext house  night

               we are looking through the living room window at jenny 
               watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to 
               wear to work tomorrow the star man stands just outside the 
               lightfall in the back yard watching her

               a commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat man 
               in a jumpsuit touting his used cars the two words we 
               have are repeated constantly during the pitch we have 
               automatics we have sticks we have colors we have 
               financing 

               we move in close on the star mans faceplate

                                     star man
                              practicing the human

               jenny finishes the skirt unplugs the iron picks up the 
               clothes shuts off the television the light and heads 
               upstairs half way up she stops

                                     jenny
                              faint through the 
                              glass
                         damn

               she turns around and looks down indecisively then hurries 
               upstairs a light goes on in the bedroom the star man backs 
               away to look up at it he cant see anything he is on his 
               way to try and get in the side door when jenny comes clumping 
               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair 
               of jeans she disappears into the kitchen without warning 
               the door ahead of him is swung open and jenny rushes out 
               the star man barely has time to step into the shadows jenny 
               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against 
               the house and drags it down to the street when she comes 
               back for the second one we see that the star man is no longer 
               in the shadows

               int house  night

               jenny comes in and locks the door she passes through the 
               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the star man 
               steps out of the darkness in the living room a scream catches 
               in jennys throat

                                     star man
                              precise
                         wehave

               jenny bolts for the front door at the end of the hallway 
               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an 
               end table the receiver is jarred out of its cradle jenny 
               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the star 
               man she jerks it open but the guard chain stops it three 
               inches from the jamb frantically she tries again but the 
               chain holds

               the star man slams the door shut and reaches out to grab 
               her she flails back at him one of her hands strikes the 
               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on 
               inside his helmet at the sight of the star man jenny begins 
               to scream he presses her back against the wall and puts a 
               mittened hand over her mouth

                                     star man
                         wehave

               jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry the star man 
               takes his hand away from her mouth

                                     jenny
                         please dont hurt me please 
                         please

               holding her with his eyes he grasps one of jennys hands and 
               lifts it up to look at it

               he raises a piece of skin off her wrist rolls it between 
               his thumb and forefinger

               jenny lets out a bloodcurdling scream and strikes out at 
               him flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she 
               hits the ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she 
               sprints up the stairs

               the star man recovers and starts after her

               int bedroom  night

               jenny gets there two steps ahead of the star man she slams 
               the door in his face and locks it with him pounding on the 
               outside jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging 
               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats

               the pounding stops it takes her a moment to hear the silence 
               when she does she whirls toward the door expecting the worst 
               but it remains closed she waits all she can hear is the 
               sound of the rain she intensifies her search

                                     jenny
                              hysteria creeping 
                              into her voice
                         its got to be here its got to 
                         be here

               she finds it in the pocket of a down jacket the army issue 
               45 looks big in her hand she releases the safety and with 
               a wary eye on the door reaches for the phone on the night 
               table next to the bed

               long before the receiver gets to her ear she can hear the 
               bleet caused by the phone being off the hook for so long 
               in the living room she hangs up and walks around the bed to 
               sit on the corner facing the door in the distance we can 
               hear the thump of an approaching helicopter after a moments 
               indecision jenny gets up and releases the lock again she 
               waits

               nothing happens with the gun ready she turns the knob and 
               opens the door a crack the hallway is empty she kicks off 
               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom

               int hallway  night

               jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet she 
               looks in the bathroom the star man isnt there she decides 
               to go downstairs

               int house  night

               the star man isnt in the living room jenny sidles along 
               the wall for the front door at the archway to the den a 
               hissing sound stops her she peers around the molding the 
               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination

               the star man is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back 
               to her he is naked a dot of light is hissing around his 
               head the shadows in the room make it difficult for jenny to 
               tell exactly what is going on

               pointing the 45 at the star man she steps into the room 
               for a better look the floor creaks and the star man turns 
               to her jenny shudders at what she sees the star man is 
               holding an 8x10 color photograph of jenny and a man in his 
               midtwenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits

               the dot of light is copying the mans features onto the star 
               mans translucent head the top twothirds of the face is 
               already done everything is perfect even the eyes jenny 
               begins to tremble and lowers the gun

                                     jenny
                              in a small voice
                         no please dont

               she sags against the armchair racked by sobs that are drowned 
               out by the flap of the approaching helicopter the star man 
               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek gets up and 
               takes the gun from her

               he drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of 
               the helicopter now directly over the house through the 
               windows we can see the searchlight scouring the hillside 
               next to the back yard

               the star man returns to the picture and resumes his 
               transformation he completes the chin then continues downward 
               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over 
               the entire body

               we come down an electrical cord that ends in a microphone 
               then down further to dr bergen a tall thin balding man in 
               his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a 
               contamination suit

                         silicate material as is its entire 
                         endoskeleton the creature seems to 
                         have tremendous regenerative powers 
                         although it must have died within 
                         minutes of receiving the fatal wound 
                         the arm and abdomen wounds are almost

                         it has veins but no blood we think 
                         and this is just speculation that 
                         some form of energy flows from the 
                         brain which is much more 
                         sophisticated than ours throughout

                         the flesh is gelatinous the skin is 
                         very porous and very moist this is 
                         another guess but it probably comes 
                         from a planet that receives only 
                         reflected light perhaps from a ring

                         from us i know they could be 
                         dangerous but they could also be

               shermin and his crew share mixed reactions

               int jennys house  bedroom  dawnbreak

               jenny sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her 
               knees is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the 
               closet door the star man edges around the door to look at 
               himself in the glass in baggy tan cords a windbreaker and 
               a plaid shirt buttoned all the way to the neck and a button 
               in the wrong hole halfway down the front he looks like an 
               innocent abroad he notices the shirt is askew across his 
               chest and with his new hands awkwardly resets the buttons 
               he looks himself over his movements resemble a humans but 
               are noticeably more precise

               the clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect 
               his face he squeezes the skin on his cheeks examines his 
               eyes turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides 
               of his face folds his ears forward to check the skin behind 
               them and he even gives a good twofisted tug to his hair to 
               see if it is on securely

               he turns from the mirror and goes over to where the 45 and 
               a leg pouch from his lifesupport suit are lying on the bed 
               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken 
               in the picture the man is dressed exactly as the star man is 
               now the star man picks up the gun and the pouch and speaking 
               to jenny in his own language steps to the door and motions 
               for her to follow jenny consciously ignores him the star 
               man comes over reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her 
               to her feet jenny squirms back but he holds her tight she 
               looks at the hand almost touches it then up at the familiar 
               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her

               star man has become is her husband

               the star man pulls jenny down the stairs

                                     jenny
                              struggles to free

               the star man guides her into the entryway and reaches for 
               the front door realizing his intentions jenny increases 
               her struggle and manages to pull away

                                     jenny

               the star man looks intently at her then opens the front 
               door he taps his chest points to jenny and motions to the 
               dawn outside

                                     jenny

               as jenny backs into the living room the star man closes the 
               door he raises the gun examines it quickly then with his 
               finger around the trigger points it at jenny

               the star man swings the muzzle sights across jennys body

               the mustang is backing out of the driveway with jenny behind 
               the wheel and the star man perched nervously on the passenger 
               seat

               int mustang  dawnbreak

               wary of what will happen next the star man watches jenny 
               move the gear selector to the drive position

               the car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep 
               from toppling back in the seat

               during the ride up the block his head swivels from side to 
               side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape 
               as he can when the car stops at a stop sign he looks at 
               jenny questioningly

                                     star man
                         please

                                     jenny
                         which way do you want to go

               she motions ahead and he turns to look at an intersection 
               with streets running in three directions off of it his eyes 
               question jenny again

                                     jenny
                         you can go that way
                              points left
                         that way
                              straight ahead
                         that way

               she points right after another look at jenny the star man 
               presses the palms of his hands together concentrates briefly 
               then slowly draws them apart the force field appears between 
               them on it the solarized view of the united states rotates 
               until the red destination dot is on his right he drops his 
               hands and points to the right

                                     star man
                              measured
                         that way

               the satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard

                                     jenny
                              staring incredulously 
                              at the compass
                         god what are you

               she starts her right turn without looking left and fails to 
               see a little mg approaching from that direction the wail of 
               the air horn startles jenny and reflexively she slams on the 
               brakes

               the mustang stalls and the mg squeals around them jenny 
               checks the star man he has pressed himself against the 
               passenger door the gun lies on the seat next to him they 
               both look at it the star man recovers and picks it up

                                     jenny
                              starting the engine
                         im sorry

               this time when jenny puts the car into drive the star man 
               is ready for the acceleration the car completes the turn 
               and the compass rotates to its new heading looking at it 
               from this angle jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it 
               is an aerial view of the united states

                                     jenny
                         that green dot thats us isnt 
                         it and the reds where you want 
                         to go you dont understand me 
                         do you

               the star man looks at her uncomprehendingly

                                     jenny
                              to herself

               rushes toward us in the other lane jenny twists around to 
               follow the car as it goes by and we see the desperation on 
               her face

               when she returns her attention to the road she sneaks a 
               glance at the star man to see if her action has given away 
               her state of mind his expression hasnt changed jenny takes 
               a deep breath and lets it out slowly uttering a phrase in 
               his own language the star man touches the steering wheel

                                     jenny

               with the same phrase in his language he points to the gear

               he points to the dashboard jenny senses there is going to 
               be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words 
               she shakes her head no and touches the steering wheel

               truck the pilot and copilot are catching forty winks on

               major bell blearyeyed and unshaven is huddled in front of 
               the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam 
               plate on the top left screen is a satellite picture of 
               northern michigan and half of wisconsin taken with a doppler 
               radar

               on the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same

               boundaries and major cities on the screens to the right of 
               these views are blowups of smaller sections of the overview

               lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor seated 
               in front of the radio console shermin is going through the 
               telex messages next to him the radio technician is bent 
               over the desk with his head in his forearms

                         in the other parts of the country or 
                         overseas seems like a totally

                         i know but

               shermin continues on through the messages bell asks the 
               computer to change the pictures on the screens rhythmically 
               a sequence of images appears and disappears

                                     shermin

                         good at is this at least until 
                         yesterday

               bell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes 
               to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway shermin 
               stops at a point on the telex sheet he reads the message to 
               himself again

                                     shermin
                         how would you describe the sounds we 
                         heard coming out of that things

                              after trying to 
                              imitate them
                         it was kind of like clicking maybe 
                         a language wasnt it

                                     shermin
                         listen to this
                              paraphrasing the 
                              telex
                         a woman was kidnapped in eau claire 
                         this morning when a citizen went to 
                         her rescue the kidnapper threatened 
                         him with a gun and shouted at him in 
                         a strange clicking gibberish

                                     major bell
                         it was a man though right

                                     shermin
                         the police think he was high on 
                         drugs

               bell shrugs

                                     shermin
                         what do you think

               ext wisconsin forest  early morning

               with a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders 
               away

               ext jennys house  morning

               there are eau claire police cars on the street shermin is 
               out back watching bell pick his way down the hill through 
               the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room

                                     major bell
                              slides the last few 
                              feet down the hill
                         nothing up there the grass is 
                         matted down in a few places but 
                         that could have been anything

                                     shermin
                         it was the husband the police finally 
                         got a hold of the witness at work 
                         and showed him a picture of the woman

               the man standing next to her in the picture was her husband 
               and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her

                                     major bell
                         its the right area thats for sure

               throughout the above shermin has noticed a woman in the 
               house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity 
               around jennys she closes the drapes suddenly when she 
               realizes shermin has spotted her

                                     shermin
                         why the clicking language though

               ext nextdoor house  early morning

               shermin knocks and waits on the steps with bell for someone 
               to answer we hear a chain being pulled off and the door is 
               opened by a freckledface man in his late thirties dressed 
               in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from 
               around his mouth

                                     shermin

                         haydns been kidnapped were hoping 
                         you might have seen something

               a woman in a robe opens the door a little wider to include 
               herself in the conversation she is as freckled as the man 
               and about the same age

                         his arm pulling jenny down the walk 
                         to the car

               the star man staring at her over the roof she slams the 
               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies 
               room stuffing the green pouch in his pocket the star man 
               trots after her

                                     jenny
                              wheels on him as he

               the star man looks at her but doesnt move jenny snarls in 
               frustration then with the star man on her heels stalks to 
               the ladies room and throws open the door

               int ladies room  afternoon

               the star man follows jenny inside

               furious jenny steps around him and opens the door she points 
               to the sign on it

                                     jenny

               she continues out the star man goes after her

               ext restrooms  afternoon

               jenny points to the sign on the next door

                                     jenny
                         men you go in here

               she cracks the door for him

                                     jenny
                         come on

               he takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look 
               inside jenny ducks into the ladies room he is confused 
               for a moment then takes a long look at the mens room it 
               means nothing to him he backs out and tries the ladies 
               room it is locked not knowing what to do the star man 
               stands uncomfortably in front of the door then like a child 
               waiting for his mother he sits on the curb he watches the 
               attendant lift the mustangs hood and reach in for the 
               dipstick the numbers on the pumps turn over adding up the 
               gallons and the cost of the gas

               everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light 
               cast by the gas station the star man pulls the camera disc 
               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps the cone of 
               light flashes out and pulls back its threedimensional image 
               the attendant turns around and waves genially at the star 
               man who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture

               the sharp rumble of a soupedup honda motorcycle coming up 
               the offramp shatters the mood and the star man gets to his 
               feet

               he is startled by the image of the rider in a one piece 
               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space 
               traveller the star man steps cautiously forward for a better 
               look and mutters something to himself in his language the 
               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings 
               himself stiffly out of the seat

                                     rider
                         do i need a key for the head

                                     attendant
                         its open

               without taking off his helmet the rider sets out for the 
               mens room

                                     rider
                              over his shoulder
                         fill it up

                                     attendant
                         you got it

               the riders approach frightens the star man he backs up to 
               the ladies room door and knocks there is no answer he 
               tries the knob with the other hand he inches the gun slightly 
               out of his pocket

               int ladies room  afternoon

               jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the 
               corners of a paper towel her head snaps around to look at 
               the doorknob it holds

                                     jenny
                         just a minute

               ext restrooms  afternoon

               the star man tenses and forces a smile as the rider passes 
               in front of him a voice comes from behind the faceplate

                                     rider
                         howdy cant get her out

                                     star man

                         i know how she feels

               the rider enters the mens room as the door closes behind 
               him the star mans face falls and he knocks frantically on 
               the ladies room door jenny opens it under his knuckles he 
               blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside

               int ladies room  afternoon

               the star man looks around jennys eyes widen at what is 
               happening behind him the pneumatic arm above the door is 
               pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back 
               the message on it written in red lipstick reads kidnapped 
               going w on 169 jade mus licpxv237

                                     jenny

                         its still a toilet hasnt become a 
                         ballroom

               she tries to swing the door open and hide her message against 
               the wall but she is too slow the star man sees it and steps 
               forward to read

                                     star man
                         kidnapped going w on

               jenny realizes he doesnt know what it means

                                     jenny
                              on her way out
                         thats very good

               other graffiti on the door helps convince the star man jennys 
               message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at 
               it he follows her

               ext gas station  afternoon

               a can of coke clatters down the chute of a drink dispenser 
               jenny picks it up and with the star man hovering at her 
               shoulder moves on to the candy machine he watches a quarter 
               disappear into the slot and when jenny picks another one out 
               of her purse he points to it

                                     star man

               she inserts the quarter and makes her selection a reeses 
               peanut butter cup drops from its position into the pickup 
               bin

                         you bastard

               her upper lip trembles and in spite of herself she might 
               cry the star man sees the center lane is open he checks 
               his side mirror and drifts over only to be caught by a light 
               the car is still rolling when jenny makes her move she throws 
               open the door and by the time the star man turns around 
               she is out and running

                                     star man
                         jennyhaydn

               he takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car 
               lurches into the cross traffic he clambers back behind the 
               wheel regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the 
               other car waiting at the light

               ext street  sioux falls  day

               over her shoulder jenny can see the mustang coming she 
               dodges up a brick walkway toward a jc penney shopping mall 
               the mustang skids to a stop at the curb the star man jumps 
               out in time to see jenny push her way past a stream of 
               pedestrian traffic and enter the mall he leaves the car and 
               zigzags through the people in that direction

               int shopping mall  day

               as he barges in the star man accidentally knocks a cup of 
               coke out of a young mans hand

                                     young man
                         hey

               in a panic to find jenny he continues jostling past people 
               to look in the shops that border the atrium

               mezzanine

               jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over below 
               her the star man comes out of a record store she turns away 
               and gets on the escalator to the second floor

               on the ground floor

               the star man thinks he sees jenny in an electronics store 
               but when the girl turns around it is obviously not her 
               backing out of there he knocks over a sandwich board 
               advertising a restaurant the loud thwack it makes when it 
               hits the cement turns faces in his direction

               jennys is not among them his eyes raise to the mezzanine 
               maybe shes there he looks wildly around for a way up he 
               spots the escalator and trying to keep the upper floor in 
               view while he runs for it he slams into an unattended pram

               it begins to tip over the baby inside screams the star man 
               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the 
               floor he is looking for a place to put it when the mother 
               comes charging out of a plant store

                                     mother

               the star man holds the baby out to her

               she grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave

               mans way to the escalator

               fear erases the star mans tenuous grasp of english and he 
               begins to jabber in his own language this makes burt even 
               madder

                                     burt

               gets off and joins the crowd at the railing from there she 
               can see the star man trapped in a circle of people he clubs

               mall guard who has just arrived

               still shaken the star man nods jenny realizes that it is 
               comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him 
               like a child down the sidewalk to the mustang

                                     star man

               the mall guard follows them down the walkway and watches 
               them drive off he scribbles the license number in his 
               notebook

               int greyhound bus station  sioux falls  day

               at the counter jenny puts her visa card back into her wallet 
               while the clerk staples the pages of a ticket into a travel 
               folder

                                     clerk

               coffee shop he is watching a mother feed her baby in the

               out on the formica jenny plunks herself down cattycornered

               becomes the size of a soccer ball then takes two quick steps

               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in 
               her neck he concentrates on her cheek and we can see the 
               glow of his brain through his human skin

               a bit of the white light comes out of his forehead it tumbles 
               across to jennys cheek and settles into the wound the star 
               man watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly 
               for an instant then dies the flesh left behind has been 
               closed without a scar

               a larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into whats 
               left of the gash with that area suffused in a healing glow 
               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck he sends 
               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds immediately 
               they spread into halos which we can see radiating from under

               arm and sits up

               catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front she 
               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side she 
               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck across her shoulder 
               and down her side feeling for traces of the wounds she knows 
               she sustained she has been completely healed and there are 
               no scars she leans forward and looks down the hallway

               gets she picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse 
               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she 
               sees the blood and bullet holes

               her sudden rise to a standing position makes her lightheaded 
               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning 
               stops with her hands outstretched as guards against the 
               sway of the truck jenny shuffles down the hallway

               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing

               toceiling picture window

               a wail from the semis air horn jars jenny out of her reverie 
               and she goes to press her cheek against the window she is 
               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a 
               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band she 
               steps back from the window to examine it then with some 
               trepidation twists it off as it clears the end of her 
               finger the star mans voice speaks out of it

               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across 
               the floor until it hits the baseboard it looks innocent 
               enough lying there but jenny has a great deal of trouble 
               making herself approach it

               when she finally picks it up it does nothing she turns it 
               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing 
               her when she took the ring off faces her again the star 
               mans voice continues

                                     star man
                         no

                                     cook
                              takes a pack of camels 
                              out of his pocket
                         you dont get rich as a cook either 
                         believe me i got a girl going to 
                         college this fall the wife had to 
                         go back to nursing to help pay for 
                         it

               he sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the 
               star man

                                     cook
                         smoke

               the star man takes it quickly examines it then positions 
               it in his mouth at the exact angle the cook did his eyebrows 
               raise when the cook flicks his bic and puffs an ash on the 
               end of his cigarette

               the butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches 
               back before allowing the cook to singe his camel he copies 
               the cooks puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to 
               glow

                                     cook
                         she wants to become a doctor shes 
                         a bright kid hard worker i think 
                         shell make it but the damned 
                         inflations driven the tuition up so 
                         high it makes it real tough on a 
                         family like ours

               the cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke 
               at the windshield the star man mimics the inhalation then 
               chokes his eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries 
               to be cool and not cough the cook takes no notice of his 
               struggles

                                     cook
                         i got two other kids i dont know 
                         what well do when they get old enough 
                         for college

               smoke starts to dribble out of the star mans nose and mouth 
               puzzled he reexamines his cigarette

                                     cook
                         everybody blames it on the oil crisis 
                         that might be where it starts but i 
                         think a lot of people are just using 
                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of 
                         us off i see it every day in the 
                         kitchen peaches we use the gallon 
                         cans the price has gone up three 
                         times in the last year and now the 
                         cans are only half full

               the cook takes another drag as if etiquette required it 
               the star man hurries to copy him this time there are no ill 
               effects

                                     cook
                         do you have children

                                     star man
                         no

                                     cook
                         theyre damned expensive and a pain 
                         in the ass sometimes but i wouldnt 
                         trade having them for anything

               the cook flicks his ash out of the window a moment later 
               the star man mirrors his action

                                     cook
                         what do you think of america

                                     star man

               ext elmos  day

               a truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the 
               buzz of interstate 70

                                     jenny os

                         tall with brown hair and really 
                         gray eyes

               we find jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway 
               dogging an attendant while he services an 18wheeler

                                     jenny
                         he had on tan cords a plaid shirt 
                         and a baseball cap probably 
                         hitchhiking

                                     attendant

                         guys

                                     jenny
                              taking out her wallet
                         in the last hour or so

                                     attendant
                         nope

               jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her 
               husband

                                     jenny
                         this is him

                                     attendant
                              shakes his head
                         sorry

               we follow jenny as she wends her way through the trucks 
               questioning other attendants the rumble of traffic drowns 
               out their conversation but the answer is always the same 
               finally we follow the picture as jenny hands it up to an 
               attendant cleaning the windshield on a peterbilt cab

                                     second attendant
                              looking at picture

                         my way in hes long gone by now

               he hands the snapshot back to jenny she nods a thank you 
               and looks wistfully around the yard there is nothing she 
               can do fitting the picture back into her wallet she walks 
               away after a few steps she turns back

                                     jenny
                         you know if anybody heres going to 
                         wisconsin

               int elmos diner  day

               its bustling loud and smoky jenny is standing just inside 
               the entrance she licks her lips and tries to clear the frog 
               out of her throat

                                     jenny
                              small voice
                         anybody going to

               nobody pays any attention to her her voice trails off she 
               swallows hard and tries again this time booming out

                                     jenny
                         anybody going to wisconsin

               the activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in 
               the silence jenny adds in a normal voice

                                     jenny
                         i need a ride

               an older man with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather 
               waves at her from the counter

                                     older man

                         i can wait

               smiling selfconsciously she takes a seat at the end of the 
               counter and orders coffee from the waitress while she is 
               waiting for it to come she happens to glance outside and 
               sees a colorado highway patrol car stopped in the yard

               the officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the 
               attendants jenny turns away from the window and finds that 
               she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors 
               that runs around the top of the pie case the squad car leaves 
               and her coffee arrives

                                     jenny
                              to the waitress

               cars passing through the squeeze point every car trunk is 
               opened vans and campers are looked into

               lyman runs up and whispers in shermins ear shermin is 
               startled by what he hears he leaves lyman in charge and 
               hurries to the helicopter parked in the field beside the 
               roadblock

               int helicopter  day

               a technician gives shermin a headset phone as he enters

                              hand over the mouth

               shermin puts on the headset and the technician starts a tape 
               recorder

                                     shermin

               the green dot now covers the right half of the red dot he 
               presses his palms together and looks past jenny at the rugged 
               foothills

               the first light of day is starting to color the sky behind

               whomp of a helicopter the star man looks out the window for 
               its source he cant see anything the sound fades in a 
               moment it is repeated on the other side of the car and again

               this is a truism that jenny doesnt want to hear and she

               jenny and the star man steady themselves for the last leg of 
               their journey suddenly their silence is exploded by a cobra 
               dropping out of the sky in front of them its searchlight 
               bangs into their faces and with its thirtycalibre machine 
               guns blazing it comes straight at them

               jenny yanks the camaro onto the shoulder the slugs chew up 
               the asphalt beside it she fishtails back onto the road a 
               second cobra surprises them from the star mans side its 
               machine gun knocks out the back window before he can fire

               the star man crawls over his seat and arranges himself in 
               the hole that was the back window to meet the cobras next 
               firing run it doesnt take them long the first two have

               metal over the desert floor the other helicopters are jarred

               on the shoulder before they can regroup the star man blows 
               them out of the sky

               the star man slumps down into the back seat breathing hard 
               jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the 
               strain that shows on his face

               from the cobra finds them its machine guns begin to raise 
               puffs of gravel around them jenny grabs the star mans arm 
               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks the 
               star man collapses against the cool stone

               over the sagebrush they move cautiously toward the cliff 
               jenny turns back to the star man he is too weak to run 
               anymore

               the star mans ship looming over him

               ext desert  night

               the spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter the 
               whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceships underbelly 
               yanks the cobra away from jenny and the star man and whips 
               it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it 
               disintegrates and falls to the desert floor

               ext desert  night

               jenny and the star man shield their faces against the dust 
               storm that billows under the whining descent of the 
               spacecraft it settles into a landing across the dirt road 
               resting on its three pods with a crack a cone of bright 
               white light blasts from the underside

                                     jenny

               he turns from her and walks to his ship jenny watches him 
               go then remembers something

               jenny backs away as the star man walks under the ship into 
               the white light he waves one last time to jenny and is 
               swallowed into the ship by the light

               ext desert  night

               jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the spacecraft 
               lifts off when she looks again it is high and moving over 
               the foothills a banking turn brings it back the ship dips 
               low over her rocks itself in a gesture of farewell then 
               shoots off into the stars when she can no longer see it 
               jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the 
               camaro
