								flashback

6	int	new uni high  classroom  day  carmen ibanez

	is beautiful just 18 and quite pleased with herself  because
	johnny rico is clearly infatuated with her

				rasczak os
		the end of another school year and for 
		me no doubt another failure
		rico pay attention 

	the teacher jean rasczak 38 a rugged veteran who proudly
	displays his missing hand scowls at johnny bemused

				johnny
		sorry mr rasczak

	but as soon as rasczak turns back to the class johnny begins to sketch
	a cartoon on his desks touch screen

				rasczak
		here in history and moral philosophy
		weve explored the decline of 
		democracy when social scientists brought
		the world to the brink of chaos and how the	
		veterans took control and imposed a stability 
		that has lasted for generations since
		you know these facts but have i taught you
		anything of value  you
		why are only citizens allowed to vote 

	rasczak points at lanny 17 with his stump

				lanny
		its a reward what the federation gives you
		for doing federal service

	rasczak is crestfallen makes a big show of patience

				rasczak
		no something given has no value 
		havent i taught you dimwits anything 
		i guess they ought to revoke my 
		teaching credential

	laughter johnnys cartoon meanwhile is taking shape
	johnny and carmen flying round planet venus in a space ship

				rasczak
		when you vote youre exercising political
		authority youre using force and force my
		friends is violence the supreme authority
		from which all other authority derives

	carl jenkins 18 a superintelligent geek jumps in

				carl
		gee we always thought you were the
		supreme authority mr rasczak

	laughter rasczak grins

				rasczak
		in my classroom you bet whether its 
		exerted by ten or ten billion political 
		authority is violence by degree the 
		people we call citizens have earned
		the right to wield it

	dizzy flores 18 athletic pretty no nonsense chimes in

				dizzy
		my mother always says that violence
		never solves anything

				rasczak
		really  i wonder what the city fathers of
		hiroshima would have to say about that
		you

	rasczak points at carmen

				carmen
		they probably wouldnt say anything
		hiroshima was destroyed

	johnny presses ´send on his desk and the cartoon appears
	across the way on carmens screen

				rasczak
		correct naked force has settled more
		issues in history than any other factor
		the contrary opinion violence never
		solves anything is wishful thinking
		at its worst

	while rasczak looks away carmen throws johnny her wonderful
	smile and johnnys gone checked out flying round venus

				rasczak
		people who forget that always pay
		they pay with their lives and their
		freedom

	dizzy notices the dreamy look on johnnys face
	so does rasczak he points at him with his stump
	snaps johnny to

				rasczak
		you tell me the moral difference
		if any between the citizen and the civilian 

				johnny
		the difference lies in the field of civic
		virtue a citizen accepts personal
		responsibility for the safety of the body politic
		of which he is a member defending it
		if need be with his life
		the civilian does not

				rasczak
		the exact words of the text but do
		you understand it 
		do you believe it 

				johnny
		uh i dont know

				rasczak
		of course you dont i doubt if any 
		of you here would recognize civic virtue
		if it bit you in the ass

	a bell rings rasczak shrugs indifferent

				rasczak
		well thats it have a nice life

7	ext	new uni high  hallway  day  johnny and carmen

	tries to take carmens hand but she demurs johnny broods

				carmen

	carmen returns to johnny as carls heads off

				carl
		dont forget about this afternoon
			to carmen
		hes always late when he walks you home
		to fish for a kiss

	carmen blushes covers
	
				carmen
		shes flying starships 

				johnny
		who 

				carmen
		marcos sister can you imagine 
		maneuvering half a million tons through
		crwoded space lanes
		you gotta have nerves of steel 
		reflexes are critical

				johnny
		i have good reflexes

	carmen notices the way dizzys looking at johnny doesnt
	like it one bit takes johnnys arm

				carmen
		cmon johnny well be late for biology

9	int	biology lab   day  the biology teacher

	is an older woman very spry also blind johnny carmen and
	other students gather around covered lab tables

				biology teacher
		for our final today please identify the mouthparts
		the abdominal organs and for extra credit locate the
		nerve cord and count the ganglia
		you may begin

	the students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs 60
	centimeter arkellian sand beetles laid out for dissection

				carmen
		eeuch 

				johnny
		aw cmon its just a bug

				biology teacher
		just a bug eh  we humans like to think we are
		natures finest achievement im afraid it isnt 
		true this arkellian sand beetle is superior in many
		ways it has fewer moving parts can reproduce itself
		in vast numbers and unboud by concerns of ego and
		mortality makes the perfect selfless member of 
		society

				johnny
		better put your goggles on

	johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser green
	fluid sprays from the slit carmen turns away looking ill

				biology teacher
		our galaxy is teaming with insect life we have
		identified over two billion species so far
		human life it would seem is the anomaly

				carmen
		but we re intelligent human minds have invented
		art mathematics and interstellar travel

				biology teacher
		true we know of no insect society that has
		produced a shakespeare an einstein or a
		cherynkov but before you let that go to your
		head take the example of the arachnids a 
		highly organized highly evolved insect society

	she points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
	common ant and ends with a two meter tall arachnid warrior

				biology teacher
		they are relatively stupid by human standards workers
		have an iq of 12 warriors around 35  and yet the 
		arachnids have colonized planets over a million years
		of evolution nature has provided the arachnids with the 
		biological means to hurl their spore into space

	johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity 
	open with aresounding crack bug guts gush out

				johnny
		well if thats the crop that must be the gastric
		caecal

				carmen
		excuse me

	she heads for the door hand over her mouth

10	ext	civic park  day  johnny and carmen

	walk home from school together

				johnny
		35 on the math final   no one could be
		that dumb with numbers

		well at least you didnt lose your lunch
		over a bug how embarassing

				johnny
		who cares about bugs  you cant go anywhere
		if you dont know math

				carmen
		dont be so sure i like you even if you are
		dumb with numbers

				johnny
		then how come you wont hold hands with me
		at school
