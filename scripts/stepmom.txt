	a black and white backdrop  we see a white waitred in a black
	tuxedo holding glasses on a tray  a black model iman in a white
	dress glides through it all

	in the center the only dash of color is rachel  who has just

	then and a penguin juts forward and nips the model  the flash of
	the camera  we freeze for a second seeing the photo rachel just
	took  an avedonesque portrait of a model being goosed by a penguin
	colliding with a maitred who spills his tray and the penguins seem
	to be pointing and laughing uproariously  its an inspired photo

	charming disarming and smart as they come  they sit side by side
	on a couch across from ruth franklin an elementary school counselor

				mrs franklin
		mr and mrs harrison while change is
		exhilarating for adults it can be

	lukes beeper beeps  he ignores it focuses on mr franklin

				luke
		i wont get thatits fine  change
		we were talking about change

				mrs franklin
		the fact that you two are remarrying
		obviously has annabelle overjoyed

			 dumbfounded
		and shes very excited about your move to
		switzerland

				jackie
		she said were getting remarried

	suddenly  a long bell rings  jackie stands up startled

				mrs franklin
		only a fire drill  my concern is that

		work knowing shes leaving before the
		end of the semester

				jackie
		mrs franklin were not 

				luke
		planning on getting 

				jackie
		remarried  there is no move

				mrs franklin
			trying to appear unfazed
		really  well then my concern for 

	lukes beeper beeps again  they talk right over mrs franklin

				jackie
		are you here

				luke
		im here

				jackie
		because you dont really seem here

				luke
		im here  ive got a case where theyre
		this close to sequestering the jury but

				luke
		you think i didnt get that

	she cuts a look at mrs franklin

				jackie
		excuse him  he never learned how
		to turn the darn thing off

	and reaches  does it for him

				mrs franklin
		im wondering if theres anything going
		on at home that could be intensifying
		annabelles need to create this fantasy

	long pause  then suddenly they both start speaking at once

				luke
		ive been with someone for quite some
		time and didnt feel it was appropriate
		for her to move in too quickly  but
		after a lot of thought and careful
		discussion with her  and the kids i
		might add  she moved in last month

				jackie
		since our divorce luke has seen a
		number of different women in three
		short years and without a lot of
		warning for the kids hes now living
		with a woman half his age 

				luke

				luke
		jackie they come to be part of my
		life  rachelispart of that life

				mrs franklin

			suddenly fierce
		this man would walk thru fire for
		annabelle gladly any day of the week

				luke
		napalm

				jackie
		except for last thursday when rachel
		forgot to pick them up 

				luke
		jackie she was five minutes late 

				mrs franklin
		im wondering if annabelle is responding
		to the underlying hostility that exists
		between rachel and mrs harrison

				luke
		of course shes responding to it  you
		think its easy for any of us  you think
		its easy for jackie to watch her kids
		being looked after by someone who has
		half the experience she does  of course
		shes going to be hostile irrational
		and defensive

				jackie
		thank you luke

	mrs franklin doesnt quite know what to say  the bell rings

				luke
		thank you mrs franklin  jackie
			they get up
		this has been very valuable for us  and
		ill have a serious talk with annabelle
		tonight

		restaurant

	throughout annabelle is trying on jackies jewelry making a pest

	reaches for his uneaten vegetables  the waiter approaches

	that lies across the butcher block table

	he grasps the corners of the napkin  he looks scared  we get
	whats about to happen  as he

	yanks the napkin as fast as he can the cup and saucer rattle
	and

	stay put

	ben  is astounded

	and then he looks up  to a cabinet filled  with glassware and
	china

	int rachels and lukes bedroom  late afternoon

	rachels hand as a beautiful antique ring is slipped on her
	finger  she is asleep  then she

	stirs wakes  stares at her hand in shock and delight

	int annabelles room  late night

	the room of a sleeping child  rachel moves soundlessly to
	annabelles side  stares down  listens to the soft breathing

	who is climbing his way up a tall slide  crouched over as he
	inches up the shiny metal surface using the side rails  rachel
	follows jackies eyes just as

	ben reaches the top and stands up hands over his head jackies
	breath catching ben totters once and

	falls fast hitting the grass with a thump we can hear lying
	crumpled motionless as our two women

	spring up as one scrambling down the bleachers running toward
	the playground jackie initially in the lead but rachel out
	sprints her closing  on the child as he rolls over grasping his
	leg and reaching him first

	some instinct makes her hold back let jackie rush past her to
	kneel at bens side  she lifts her baby in her arms  his pants
	are torn his leg is bleeding  his own concern

	helpful duty nurse and

	heads off through the crowd down a hallway turns a corner to
	see

	luke stands by a doorway  smiling as he gazes into a hospital
	room  jackie comes to his side looks in

		look youve never liked me

				jackie
		dont flatter yourself

				rachel
		and i know checking into your life
		was inexcusable

				jackie
		nobody likes a snoop

				rachel
		but i came here to

	all the air comes out of this young woman  so vulnerable so real

				rachel
		to beg you  not to do it

	and at this  a look of intense interest crosses jackies face
	really

				jackie
		id have thought this was the
		answer to your prayers  lose the
		witch and her two brats in one
		swoop  problems solved

	rachel is clearly distraught this is no act

				rachel
		you cant take lukes children
		away from him

	jackie thinking  reading this girls face

				jackie
		bicoastal parenting  happens every
		day  luke gets the kids every other
		summer every other holiday its not

				rachel
			blurts
		we cant live like that

	and jackie straightens  cocks her head

	back

				jackie
		sure i could  if i was looking
		for one

	rachels turn to be surprised  confused

				jackie
		youre a moron kid  you guessed
		the wrong secret

	an odd almost defiant look  jackie reaches up to her own head
	and

	slowly holding eye contact all the way she slips the wig from
	her head  her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo
	therapy has left her  you can hear rachels gasp clear to kansas

				jackie
			calmly
		charlie drummond used to be a

				rachel
		okay im undeserving

				jackie
		ironic huh

	and staring in rachels eyes jackies fierceness fades

				jackie
		ironic that im gonna need you

	all the air comes out  her heart as naked as her skull

				jackie
		to be a little less  undeserving

	the look holds  and holds

				jackie
			quietly

	and turns goes to the door  turns back

	the mans head is down  we cant see lukes expression as he

				jackie
		i thought a phone call was

	no one smiles at the irony  not much to smile about

				jackie
		i could have taken you to that
		restaurant but it would have
		been a waste of money

	he loos up  she studies the pain

				jackie
			softly
		i know  i wouldnt know what to

	tears fill his eyes  none in hers

		magician

				rachel
			softly never turning
		and her

				jackie
		took 28 hours  she just wasnt

	watches the feeling well in rachels eyes

				jackie
		the doctor wanted to go in and get

	rache smiles  that jackie sensed something

				rachel
		its not about the kids

	looks over  decides whether to ask

				rachel
		that thing you said before  pushing
		the guy sleeping next to you away
		because of what you gave up for
		motherhood

				jackie
		is that what he told you

				rachel
		he wont discuss it  just calls it

	he puts his hands on her gently  but she flinches  so the hands
	come away

				luke
		you want me to show you the future
		well i cant darlin

	i cant  she searches the lovelight in his eyes  as if she could
	weigh it

				luke
		we make our lives one step at a
		time  we do the best we can  the
		truth about the future  a promise
		is only a hope

				rachel
		how about the promises we make to
		our kids  abouttheirfuture  do
		we shrug those off just that easily

	that slows him down

				rachel
		maybe annabelle deserves to find
		out whoreallybroke up her family
		while her mom is still around

	stops him  cold

				rachel
			quiet
		hey  just a thought

	flips her cigarette to the gutter  shrugs

				rachel
		you got one less for dinner

	takes a step back  only one  but it registers

				luke
		where you goin

				rachel
		im gonna get me a drink

	nods to herself

				rachel
		and im gonna drink it alone

	and she walks off  slow

	ext car pool line elementary school  day

	ben alone in the back seat  reading his beloved garfield book
	shift angle to see

	the women standing by the car  rachel looks a little anxious

				rachel
		you really didnt have to come

		straight t

				jackie
			staring at something
		who in the worldishe

	see now across the way  a gorgeous boy dressed cool stands
	holding an expensive bike  and chatting happily with annabelle
	in the distance other kids pretend they arent watching

				rachel
		looks nice enough to m

				jackie
		he looks familiar  did he do a
		calvin klein ad

	across the way the boy leans kisses annabelle sweetly on the
	cheek  waves to her  peddles off  in distance kids are dying
	annabelle pretends not to know that  just walks casually toward
	us but as she approaches she cant help breaking into a run
	straight

	into rachels arms

				annabelle
			breathless
		it workeditworkeditworked  omigod
		you cantbelievethe look on hisface

	squeezing rachel tight enough to crush her bones  and although
	rachel hugs back although she kisses annabelles hair

	her eyes are locked to jackies

	houston  we have a problem

	ext jackies yard  day

	rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set  she
	is pacing in a circle looking like a kid waiting to see the
	principal  sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen  she picks
	a bottle of beer off the grass  twists the top  settles awkwardly
	on the seat of the taller swing

	hear the screen door open  bang shut  rachel takes a sip  before
	she looks up

				jackie
			low calm
		now were going to have a fight
		you and i

				rachel
			barely audible

				rachel
		and shell fight back again  god help

	jackies voice drops  the softness makes it somehow more
	menacing

				jackie
		youve turned her into you  and
		i may not get another chance  to
		turn her back

				rachel
			suddenly fiercethatswhat it is  and thatsallit is

	the hand with its cigarette stabs out

				rachelyouwont get the chance

	jackie back on her heels  thinking  a mile a minute

				jackie
		youve got a point there for a
		change  oh yes you do

	her finger stabbing out

		play with theirbabies you fucking
		bitch i hate your guts

	the blast washes over rachel  and in the silence

				rachel
		now youre talking sense

	she looks down at her beer

				rachel
		all year long ive been watching how
		you do this  the worries the sacri
		fices the signals you give them

	thinks  really thinks  wants so much to say this right

				rachel
		and i admire you  more than youll
		ever believe  and yetthis
		thinghas been growing  inside me

	looks up  straight to her eyes

				rachel
		for better or worse  im not you

	and so she stands up  the swing shimmies in her wake

				rachel
		i cant live my life channeling the
		one true mom after youre gone  i
		cant do it  i cant do it  i cant
		do it

	sets the beer down  stabs out her smoke

				rachel
		we have to deal with that

	and walks off slowly  across the yard

	int indoor riding ring  twilight

	huge indoor space  woodsided walls dirt floor  high corrugated
	metal roof with birds flying roosting in rafters  a little girl
	under the keen eye of her trainer puts her mount through its
	paces  in the cold air steam rises from the horses body  its
	late no one else around  track now

	down a walkway  toward the stables  a barn cat is crouched
	stalking prey  we hear a soft voice speaking  one we know

				luke os
		it was like telling her

	see him now  standing awkwardly against the side of a stall

				luke
		that i didnt love her anymore

	see the horse still steaming  standing patiently

				luke
		if i could be sure id always
		stay

	circling the horse now we see annabelles back  she is slowly
	brushing out the sweat mark  where the saddle used to be  her
	movements are stiff mechanical  the soft voice continues

				luke os
		she said this thing you call a
		partnership  the schedules the
		chores all the things we have to
		work out

	our angle circling to see at last annabelles face

				luke os
			softer
		for the kids

	the tears that stand in her eyes  the set line of her small mouth

				luke os
		thats the life i dreamed of
		and its all i ever wanted it to be

	she swallows  because she will not cry

				luke os
		thats the kind of person your mom is
		shes the best

	annabelle says nothing  she drops to her knees  begins to clean
	out one of her horses hooves with a metal pick  the only sound
	against the stillness

	and her father watches  his heart pounding

				luke
		i complained a lot baby  we couldnt
		travel wed lost our privacy our
		chance to do things on the spur of the
		moment  to live forourselves  the
		way wed started out

	he goes to her  the sound of his feet on the straw

				luke
		and she said  sounds like youd be
		happier  if the kids werent around

	crouches down  very close to his child

				luke
		i said  i love them more than
		anything  but sometimes i do
		miss what ive lost

	annabelle stops working  turns her faces away

				luke
		she said she could never feel that
		way not for one single second

	so he leans closer

				luke
		she didnt want to be with someone
		who could

	silence  hes staring at the back of her head

				luke
		you know this horse smells
		really bad

				annabelle
		theres worse things

	at least she can talk  if only just above a whisper

				luke
		do you know why i never told
		you all this before

	a beat  she doesnt look at him

				annabelle
		sure  you wanted me to blame her
		instead of you

	waiting to hear

				luke
			very softly
		thats right

	she hears honesty  and heartbreak  it makes her turn

				annabelle
		how come youre telling me now

	he gets lost  looking in those eyes

				luke
		i dont want to be wrong anymore

	i dont

				luke
		i want to say im sorry because i am
		and let you hate me  if you have to

	she swallows hard  her eyes moving over his face

				luke
		see that feeling  where you feel
		two different things at once
		thats a grownup thing  its
		not a lot of fun

	she shakes her head very slightly  and her eyes water

				luke
		know why your mom never told you

	she doesnt

				luke
		she knew that you and her were
		sosolid  nothing could rock that
		but she didnt want to risk

	the hardest thing  hes ever had to say

				luke
		your hating me

				annabelle
		cos she loves you

				luke
		cos she lovesyou  she wanted you
		to have a daddy to love  even if
		he didntcompletelydeserve it

	now the tears in his eyes  and shes watching that

				luke
		you know how much love that is
		that she has for you

	do you

				luke
		theres going to come a moment
		when shell really need you to
		give that back  and youre just
		the girl that can do it

	the way he says this  makes her ask

				annabelle
		now do i know when

	he reaches  first time  strokes her hair

				luke
		that moment will come  and your
		heart is going to whisper here
		it is

	winds his fingers  around her hand

				luke
		and youll come through

	she stares in his eyes  and dead straight

				annabelle
		if i miss it daddy  you clue
		me in

	okay he nods  thats a plan

	int bar  night

	the dimly chic bar  with its soft upscale buzz  where jackie
	told luke she had cancer  tonight she waits alone  watching the
	entrance  nursing her drink  and then

	rachel comes into the place  spots jackie across the room
	weaves her way through the tables

	and she is there  slipping into her seat  not knowing what to
	say

				jackie
		thanks for coming out

				rachel
		neutral ground  whats up

	jackie stares evenly  her chin rests across the back of her
	knuckles  she looks tired but okay  fueled by adrenaline

				jackie
		luke called  he says youre
		checking out  of the heartbreak
		hotel

	the waitress appears  rachel too locked into the moment to notice
	so

				jackie
		she likes a stolie no ice

				rachel
			softly
		double

	as the woman leaves

				jackie
		whats this about  because
		wefought

				rachel
		dont flatter yourself
			beat
		i always liked that line

	signs

				rachel
		i love luke i love the children
		but there is more to life than
		even love

				jackie
		no there isnt

				rachel
		and i have looked down the road
		at what my life will be  and i
		cant handle it

	jackie unblinking  focused strong

				jackie
		what do you see  down that road

	no answer  then

				rachel
		i never wanted to be a mom  then
		sharing it with you was one thing
		carrying it alone the rest of my
		life

				jackie
		is scary  but you want it  gimme
		some truth here

	the stolie arrives  they wait a beat  the waitress disappears

				rachel
		well its the jack kennedy syndrome
		huh  you die young you always look
		golden  perfect  the memory kind of
		burnishes the image and

				jackie
		come on a wuss like me  the stiff
		who wouldnt help her own daughter
		fight back

				rachel
		maybe i was wrong on that one

	that sits there  in its sincerity

				jackie
		well maybe you werent

	and so does that  tears are forming in rachels eyes  here in
	this public place

				rachel
		look when i said i couldnt channel
		you  that didnt mean i wouldnt give
		my right arm to do just that

	shakes her head

				rachel
		maybe i dont want to be looking over
		my shoulder  every day for twenty
		years  knowing someone else would
		have done it right  the way i cant

	jackie waits  thinks

				jackie
		trade you a smoke  for a secret

	the way she said that  something weighty behind it  so rachel
	reaches into her purse

				jackie
		you know i lost ben awhile back
		in a supermarket

	rachels hand freezes  in midcourse

				rachel
		youre lying

				jackie
		i lost him  i was panicked

				rachel
		you are lying you never lost that
		kid for 4seconds you could find him
		from acoma there is no way

				jackie
			smiles
		i was running around like a chicken
		with my head chopped off  doing my
		imitation of you

	rachel still not buying

				rachel
		ben never mentioned it

				jackie
		he only remembers ifoundhim  my
		point is telling you this story would
		have been the kindest most helpful
		thing i could ever have done for you

	the smile fades

				jackie
		why didnt i

				rachel
		uh  you hate my guts

	passing the cigarettes over

				jackie
		we were competing  even then

	yes we were

				jackie
		instead of being partners  watch
		ing each others back  seeing things
		were covered

	pulls out a smoke  offers the pack

				jackie
		youre not scaredyoullthink you
		dont measure up  youre scaredtheyllthink it  thats the jfk
		thing yeh

	rachel takes one  eye contact holding

				rachel
		with good reason  they fucking
		worship you as it is

				jackie
		what do i have that you dont

				rachel
		everything  yourethe earth
		mother incarnate

				jackie
		youre the hip and fresh

				rachel
		you ride with annabelle

				rachel
		you know every story every wound
		every memory their whole lifeshappinesshas been wrapped up inyou every moment

				jackie
		i have their past

	strikes the match

				jackie
		you  have their future

	rachel stunned  by the simplicity of it all  slowly she leans to
	accept jackies flame

				jackie
		dont you get it  you look down the
		road to her wedding  youre in the
		room alone with her fitting her veil
		fluffing her dress  telling her no
		woman waseverthat beautiful

	tears now  standing in two pairs of eyes

				jackie
		and your fear is  shell be
		thinking  i wish mom were here

	jackie lights her own

				jackie
		and mine is  she wont

	her hand trembles as she takes a drag

				jackie
		now thats enough fear for either
		one of us to kill the other  and
		no jury in theworldwould convict

	jackie raises her glass

				jackie
		were guilty girl  of being human
		and we cant forgive ourselves

	holds it forward  in a toast

				jackie
		but i forgive you

	and slowly rachel lifts her own glass  clicks it with jackies

				rachel
		dont rush me  im deciding

	slow dissolve to

	int jackies living room  christmas morning

	white christmas outside the window  richly trimmed tree presents
	everywhere carols softly playing  the whole nine yards  luke and
	ben standing at a wrapped bird cage where a dove is cooing inside
	annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed nurse

	rachel enters  kisses annabelles head

				rachel
		im gonna check on mom

	goes down the hall every emotion in the world is playing across
	her face  into

	int jackies bedroom

	jackie lies on her death bed  she is beautiful and near the end
	despite the iv tube the monitor shes gotten to serenity after
	all  as close as any of us will ever get

				rachel
		hey gorgeous  time for the
		presents

	jackie licks her lips  pretty dry  rachel takes a cotton lemon
	swab from the nightstand  tenderly cleans jackies mouth

				rachel
		now edna says you shortchanged your
		last meds  you can do presents and be
		comfortable at the same time yknow

				jackie
			clears her throat
		just want to be a little sharper
		for a few minutes

	a few minutes

				jackie
		some things to say  to the kids
		huh

	smiles

				jackie
		then bring in the presents  well

	rachel cant really bear this

				rachel
		you know theres nothing you
		have to say  because they know
		your heart  you dont have t

				jackie
		just sit me up  nice and tall
		bring benjamin first

	staring at each other  then rachel reaches her arms around
	jackie and as gently as she can manage lifts her to a full
	sitting position

				jackie
		scrapbook

	rachel brings the big book  lays it on the bed  and goes

	jackie begins to turn the pages  her life with these children
	passing before her eyes  no tears   no smile  just full
	attention  fingertips touch the one she was looking for as

	the door opens  ben hesitant enters alone  his mothers face is
	fine and strong and smiling

				jackie
		find the bird cage

				ben
			standing there
		rache says its from you

				jackie
		well dont make him disappear
		before i see him

	ben nods  okay i wont  she glances to the scrapbook

				jackie
		oh look at this

	and forgetting his uneasiness he runs over climbs onto the bed
	jackie doesnt wince doesnt even blink  nothing for his memory
	bank but smiles  he looks at the photo

	jackie holding a spunky newborn

				jackie
		thats you and me  our first photo
		as a couple

	he nods  really staring at it

				ben
		did you know i was goodlooking
		right away

	she reaches to hold his face in her hand  stares in his eyes

				jackiethisgoodlooking  was beyond
		my imagination

	she leans  kisses his lips lightly  how many more times will she
	get to do this

				jackie
			a murmur
		so what do you think were gonna
		talk about

				ben
			straight back
		you dying

	she nods  her smile is right there

				jackie
		the secret of it  that only
		magicians  can ever understand

	his eyes brighten  the sadness pushed aside

				jackie
		see when we die  our body goes
		away  our body  butwewe are
		not our body are we

	he doesnt know  maybe he thought we were

				jackie
		if a soldier loses his legs in a
		war  is he the same guy  sure
		he is

				ben
		but you can still see him

				jackie
		half  of him

	this is so fucking hard  but her eyes stay dry

				jackie
		dying  is where thewholebody
		goes away  so you cant seeanyof itbut

	rests her hand tenderly  on his hair

				jackie
		what do magicians know

	leans forward  heres the secret

				jackie
		just because you cant see it
		doesnt  mean  its gone

	does it  and ben smiles  he is inside the secret

				jackie
		the worldthinksim gone  but
		only the magician  knows better

				ben
		so where are you

	she was waiting for this  for a long time  she wraps her hand
	around his fist  and puts their hands against his heart

				jackie
			a whisper
		right here  right hereinsidethe magician  shhhh

		always  always  and you wont
		hear a voice  but inhere  youll
		know  what im saying

				jackie
		i love you  and you love me

	comes closer  nose to nose

				jackie
		its worth a lot  will you keep it

	he answers  with a kiss

	int living room  moments later

	luke and annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle  ben
	runs in falls on his knees by the puzzle  without looking at
	annabelle he tells her

				ben
		your turn  it wasnt bad

	annabelle looks straight to her dad  there is a moment a silence
	that no one else could ever understand  she leans to him and
	whispers

				annabelle
		here it is

	his eyes water  he takes her in his arms  whispers close to her
	ear only the words

				luke
		here it is

	she smiles at hi  fear gone filled with resolve  gives him a
	kiss  rises to

	follow rachel down the hall  rache wraps an arm around her big
	girl  no words except a murmured

				rachel

	voice cracking  shes not as good at it as this girls mother

				rachel
		you can do anything

	at the door  open it and

	int jackies bedroom

	annabelle enters alone  the door closes behind her  her eyes
	lock with her mothers  no words  annabelles eyes filled with
	tears and jackies arms

	 reach out and annabelle runs to them

	they hold each other  for a forever moment

				annabelle
		i dont want to say goodbye

				jackie
		dont take me with you

	and annabelle looks up  tears on her face

				jackie
		thank god  i got to see you
		grown up

				annabelle
		im not

				jackie
			very softly
		let me be the judge of that

	and annabelle climbs onto the bed  their hands never stop touching
	each other  saying i love you

				jackie
		theres an amazing thing when a
		woman has a daughter  one day you
		look up and you seea sister
		someone  you can say  anything to

	anything

				jackie
		i wrote a whole lot of letters  to
		each of you  and the envelope says
		when to open it  like which
		birthday  orwhen you get your
		drivers permit  first time you see
		rome  things like that

	things like that  annabelle is beginning to lose it now  so
	jackie says only

				jackie
		keep bens for awhile okay  until
		hes old enough to not open them all
		at once

				annabelle
		until hes old enough to read

	tears on annabelles face  her mom wonders

				jackie

	she nods yes it is

				jackie

	she brushes at her babys tears  then tastes her wet fingertips
	mmmn surprisingly good  annabelle sort of smiles

				jackie
		you can miss me  and  take me
		with you

		there  when you fall in love
		have me there  you can

	said with such absolute assurance

	annabelle swallows hard

				jackie
		on your wedding night  when your
		babies are born  i want to be
		there  will you take me

	a straight question  it needs an answer

				annabelle
		always always  always

	a sigh  a shared smile

				jackie
		you made my life wonderful

				jackie
		take that with you too

	hold  on annabelle

	int jackies bedroom  later that morning

	the presents are here now they fill up the room spill over the
	bed where both children sprawl

	ben ripping the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine
	annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to
	hang it in the louvre  she holds a tank top up to her chest for
	her moms approval  jackies not sure  rachel handing up more
	boxes luke in charge of bagging trash

	bens white dove flying free around the room zipping and diving
	no one cares  its christmas

	hold  hold  and crossfade to

	ext chapel  night

	family and friends are leaving the wake exiting the softlylit
	chapel into a snowy night  they are saying goodbyes kissing one
	another going to their cars  and saying her last goodbye

	rachel turns to luke  whispers close to his ear  he looks at
	her for a beat then leads annabelle and ben toward the car as

	rachel goes back into the chapel  alone

	int funeral parlor

	the room is nearly dark  one soft spot plays on a simple casket
	no canned organ music no sound at all  as rachel enters

	she goes to the casket  stares down at it for a beat  and just
	above a whisper

				rachel
		see i told you id do this

	only

				rachel
		only  now i dont know what to say

	her hand reaches out  a finger absently traces the edge of the
	wood  it seems a gesture of unconscious affection

				rachel
		youd have written it down so you
		wouldnt blow it

	a slight smile  heres where the love shows

				rachel
		maybe we should change places

	nods slightly  maybe we should  she takes a step back now to a
	waiting chair

	sits  her hands folded in her lap  thinks

				rachel
		well  we were less than friends i
		guess  and more

	more

				rachel
		we were nevergirlfriends we
		never dished  that wasnt  what
		we had

	no apology there  its just the truth

				rachel
		we had some battles man they
		wereworld class huh
			beat
		and i dont regret a one of them

	sad little shrug

				rachel
		i miss them

	thinking  of how much more shell miss

				rachel
		weve got our secrets we have
		and ill keep em if you will

	crosses her arms  lost in the moment

				rachel
		but i wish we had one more night
		in that little bar remember
		remember that toast  sure you do

	her voice wavers  but the eyes are dry

				rachel
		know what  i forgive me too
		seeyourethe magician

	a murmur

				rachel
		dont worry partner ive got
		your back  were covered

	its what she came to say  crossfade to

	int ballroom  night

	lights and music and laughter  theyre in black tie tonight  its
	a wedding party  up on the stage at the head table some guy is
	finishing a toast and as everyone roars and claps

				best man
		so to the bride  thank god
		shes more than he deserves

	everybody shouts the bride  everybody drinks champagne

	and the bride stands up in her white gown  in her hand an
	envelope  she goes to the mike and waits for the raucous cheers
	the calls of speech to die down

	leans to the mike  flushed and happy  and oddly nervous

				rachel
		now i know the tradition so
		this isnt a toast  at least
		not for me

				rachel
		the guest list is 114  but we
		all know theres one more here
		tonight  because

	looks down the table at her children  dressed to kill  enjoying
	the party

				rachel
		my two sidekicks there always
		bring her along  wherever they go

	right  right

				rachel
		so jackie and i were sitting
		around  on new years eve  and
		she said youre not gonna talk
		at my funeral are you

	and now  it is quiet indeed

				rachel
		and i said ive never been to
		a funeral  im not sure ill know
		how to act

	her sweet smile  keeps the mood right

				rachel
		but ill probly sneak into
		where you are  just before its
		over

	nods to herself  fights back the feeling of that moment

				rachel
		say something  just to you
		get the last word in when you
		cant talk back

	there is laughter in this room  gentle loving

				rachel
		so she says no way

	holds up the envelope  holds it tight

				rachel
		she wrote this  she sealed it
		up i didnt see it  she made
		me promise to read it  at the
		wedding

	and slowly luke begins to clap  and others join  and when it
	stops

				rachel
		i told her shed better make it
		dirty or make it funny  because
		no wayon my wedding

	no way in hell

				rachel
		could she make me cry

	applause  they are loving it

				rachel
		she says its a deal

	the band plays an impromptu flourish  rachel begins to carefully
	tear open the envelope

				rachel
		now if its too raunchy we may
		have to excuse the kids

	shouts from everyone especially the children

	she has it open  she looks at it

	and everything  stops

	the world watches her sway watches her eyes fill as she stares at
	the small card in her hand  she cant believe this

				rachel
			mouths to herself
		you promised

	the tears are welling  everyone screams for her to read it  she
	leans to the mike shaking her head

				rachel
		itsno big thing really
		its justfive words its

	the place goes happily up for grabs  a joyful riot of demand
	tears streaming now rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded
	bag  as she puts the card inside we alone can read the words

	my babies  are so lucky

	hold on this  and

	fade to black  roll end credits
