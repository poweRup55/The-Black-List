			from a story by james cameron

				  august 11 1993

106 am dec 30 1999

blackness  we hear

					voice
		ready

					second voice lenny
		yeah  boot it

a burst of bright white static exploding across the
darkness  a high whine on the audio track gives way to
street sounds and rapid breathing

an image wavers and stabilizes a nervous pov  were in a
car sitting in the backseat and were nervous the view
swinging around showing the street rolling by outside the
windows then whipping back to the two guys in the front
seat

our pov looks down at a small recording device in our
hands  a red led is flashing  we slip the recorder into
a coat pocket

					our voice
		okay  its goin  im recording

the guy riding shotgun lane is just pulling a pantyhose
over his head smearing his features into a piglike mask
he turns directly to the lens pissed off

					lane
		good one dickhead  thanks for
		waitin till i get this fuckin thing
		on  you tryin ta id me or
		what

he tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it
our pov looks down into the pantyhose which comes up
over our field of view

we realize this is not some ridealong verite video

we are one of these guys  real honesttogod point of
view with no cuts no music  this is not film it is
human experience

the driver is a hispanic guy named spaz diaz  lane is a
white guy who looks very strung out  couple of
crackheads  the car is a midseventies barge piebald
with primer

					lane
		next alley just pull in slow
			   turning to us
		hurry up will ya  here

he hands us a big stainless steel revolver  the pov looks
down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder check the
rounds snap it closed

diaz pulls the barge into an alley  the headlights
illuminate overflowing dumpsters  a chicano busboy is
making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant which
he has chocked open  the busboy goes back inside

					lane
		lets go

out of the car quickly our own breathing loud in our
ears  we even hear our own heartbeat racing now
through the door after lane moving fast

into the kitchen  fluorescent glare  the busboy turning
surprised lane putting the shotgun in his face  freezing
him  lane puts a finger to his lips quiet in any
language

our hand puts the magnum in the thai cooks face  we get
them down on the greasy floor lane controlling them with
the shotgun  he looks at us snaps his eyes toward the
front room

we hear voices as we approach the swing door  go through

whip pan left then right  scoping the layout  lowrent
thai place  red wallpaper  closing time  middleaged
thai owner by the cashregister counting money  young
thai waitress cleaning up  they look up stunned as we
put the gun on them

					our voice
			   shouting edgy
		dont move dont talk dont do
		nothing

our pov is whipping around from the front door to the
owner to the kitchen where lane is standing in the doorway
covering the cook and busboy back to the owner as he
steps back from the cashregister

we scoop up the big wad of bills seven eight hundred
bucks in tens and fives

now yelling herding the owner and the waitress into the
kitchen the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
thai lane shouting at him to shut up

into the walkin cooler  the steel door closes on four
scared pair of eyes  pov looking around seeing a
dishrack  our hand pulls out a spoon drops the spoon
handle through the hole in the cooler doorlatch  locking
them in

lane heading out the back door  laughing as he looks at
the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him
we follow lane to the car  snap a look down the alley one
way then the other

shit  cop blackandwhite pulling into the far end of the
alley  heartbeat goes triple time  scrambling into the
car

door not even closed and spaz has it in reverse burning
rubber as he launches back down the alley
scrunch  the car grinds along one wall as spaz steers
wildly backward  sparks right next to us  then
kboom  as we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
into the street

the cop has his lights and siren on and is roaring at us
as spaz cranks the wheel and punches it down the street
he curses in english and spanish as he weaves between
cars  we pull off the stocking to see better

the cop car surges onto the street behind us

looking ahead  a red light  cars stopped blocking the
way  cutting to the right onto the sidewalk around the
cars into the intersection

a near miss with cross traffic then accelerating
another red light ahead

					lane
		dont stop

truck entering the intersection  everyone yelling  spaz
cuts the wheel but too late

clipping the truck and spinning
the street outside smearing past like the view from a
tiltawhirl

then kblam  hitting something godknowswhat and
launching up and over and

krunch  crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass

it gets quiet and still  tinkling glass as lane moves
then spaz is screaming  the car is upside down

crawling out of the side window  a frenzy now
whip pan to see the cops pulling up

then whipping back to the wreck  the engine is burning
flames spreading rapidly  spaz inside pinned upside
down blood pumping across his face

our hands pulling lane out  he comes up running

we run after him sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
of an alley

panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
yelling
gunshots  looking back  cops next to their car firing
ahead lane running into shadow

then a door opening a man coming out of a metal firedoor
lane grabbing him throwing him out of the way holding
the door open as we dive through into

a stairwell  lane sprinting up two steps at a time
trying the door at the second floor landing  locked
shit

running up  dizzying whirl as we run up and up

the pov is finally broken by a

									cut to

int  underground garage

but we dont know where we are yet  we see a man in
extreme closeup just his eyes and mouth  the eyes are
closed the eyeballs tracking under the lids like he is
watching a movie in there  this is lenny

					lenny
		this is great the doors are all
		locked  who are these losers
		friends of yours

									cut to

back to pov as we reach the fifth floor landing  lane is
coming unglued as he finds this door locked  we look
down see cops coming two floors below  one cranks off a
couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing
pounding up the last flight  finally  the door is
unlocked

blasting through it behind lane onto the roof  running
all out past ac units and pipes air vents  looking up
an lapd helicopter orbiting close  it flicks the xenon
onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
daylight

running along the edge of the roof  looking down  car
burning upside down in the street below  the gas tank
explodes filling the street with orange light  we dont
slow  were running all out

					lenny vo
		wow the gas tank is a nice touch
		oh oh end of the line boys

ahead in pov we see the edge of the roof coming up
beyond it is another building about ten feet lower and
separated by a 20 foot alley

but lane doesnt slow down  he leaps across the void and
makes it to the other building landing in a sprawl
we reach the edge and look down  six stories  no ladders
or fireescapes  whip to behind us  cops running across
the roof

					lane
		come on  fucking jump man

the pov backs up from the edge and then runs toward it
out into the void  moving airborne then
wham  right into the parapet wall

slipping down  brick wall right in our face  bloody
fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
the edge

looking down feet dangling over a sixty foot drop
a cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below
oblivious
breathing raspy  snapping a look up as the pipe gives
way
a keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
but
snapping a look down
walls rushing past sound of wind and our own raspy
scream
ground rushing up

split second impression of a cat looking up yowling and
running out of the way as
pavement fills frame  a burst of violent red light
sound like a gunshot but no echo

only silence  and blackness

								    cut to

int  underground parking garage

lit by miles of fluorescent  empty and echoing  close on
lenny  he has something on his head  something that
looks like a mutated set of walkman headphones except
they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
and over the forehead  playback trodes  lenny whips
off the trodes gasping as if he got gutpunched

					lenny
		goddamnit  you know i dont deal in
		snuff  how many times i hafta tell
		you

skinned creature of the night in tshirt and leather
jacket  tick is a bottomfeeder in the technounderground

better check to see if you still have your ring after you
shake with him  he is wearing an expensive italian
jacket and what he thinks of as a power tie his rolex
isnt real  his greasy hair is too long and curls around
his collar  he needs to shave  a little sleazy  but he
has energy and heavy street smarts

lenny is sitting on the hood of his 97 bmw 1035i  tick
is facing him sitting in the back of his beattoshit
70s van  there are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
inside the van  lenny has a haliburton case open next to
him like a drug dealer  in fact the whole setup looks
like a drug deal but its not  though it is illegal
the case holds lennys personal playback deck his trodes
and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals  they
are about the size of dat tapes and hold about 30 minutes
of sensory experience everything a person sees hears
and feels recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
the moment it is happening

					lenny
		howd you get the tape  why didnt
		the cops put it in evidence

					tick
		with all the blood i guess they
		didnt see the rig  guy had it
		under a wig

		yeah but howd it get to you

tick holds up a ziplock bag containing the walkmansized
stainless steel cortical resonance recorder the record
deck we saw earlier in the pov  also in the bag is the
squid net a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
human head this is different from playback trodes  the
whole works are covered with congealed blood

lenny in his bmw driving through the la streets
streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
calligraphy of light  lenny works the cellular gets
messages on his digital pager weaves in and out of
traffic  punches the buttons on his radio changing
stations all the time  raw nervous energy like a kid
who cant stay still  its a hard hustle in the big food
chain

lenny turns up the radio  selected driveby images as
the talkradio provides commentary

lennys car passing under glowing santa clauses on the
lightpoles  banners proclaiming the coming millennium
la festivities

					talkradio host

		december 30th 1999 the second to
		last day of the whole darn century
		and the phone lines are open  dan
		from silverlake youre on the air

transition to a rougher section of town  buildings roll
by endlessly tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns
some are burntout ruins

					dan from silverlake

in shopping carts

					host
		youre a glassishalfempty kind of
		guy arent you dan  well i for one
		happen to think that us making it
		2000 years is worth celebrating

lenny cuts him off punching to another station and music
blasts  something fast a rapmetal hybrid  anger and
energy

we cut in fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
weapons fire helicopters on patrol people running in the
streets buildings smoldering fists raised shouting
people paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance
korean store owners armed to the teeth a body covered by
a yellow plastic sheet blood running down the gutter
cops in riot gear with m16s on patrol in a hispanic
neighborhood

back to lenny coming out of a bar with a nervous
businessman  we dont hear the conversation  music over
lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
squid tape into the pocket of the businessmans suit
jacket  lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away
lennys beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
number

on lenny driving

ahead through the windshield we see a police checkpoint
the cops have thrown a block across the street and are
shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through
lenny slaps his id against the side window with one hand
not missing a beat in his conversation  this is just part
of life in la

					lenny
			   on cellular
		jimbo  im there jimmy  right now
		cant you hear me knockin

cut to lenny working his way through a crowded club music
pounding  strobe lights  we dont see much  he hears
his phone rings and pulls the tiny digital cellular out of
his breast pocket  sticks a finger in his other ear and
answers

cut to lenny back in the bmw on the streets  on the
move

					lenny

lenny pulls up to the security checkpoint of a gated
community  the white uppermiddle class hiding behind
walls and paid security

					lori
		if you read the bible mark youd
		know that there wont be another
		thousand years  right now we are in
		the last days as foretold in the
		book of

					host
		the last days  you mean the coming
		of the apocalypse right  the
		rapture

lenny fishes around in the glove compartment flipping
through about twenty plastic security passes for different
parts of town all bogus  he finds the right one and
flips it onto the dash

					lori
		yes thats right  you only have to
		look at the signs there are wars
		and rumors of wars

the rent a cop at the guardshack hits him with his light

					lenny
			   lying

the cop waves him through  lenny is the right color

					host
		now just so the rest of us know how
		much time is left when is the
		rapture supposed to hit exactly
		is it midnight new years eve

and we cut to a burst of news videotape enlarged noisy
distorted images of a great gathering in the desert
the faithful waiting for gods sign as the millennium
approaches

					host
		is that midnight la time or eastern
		standard or what  i mean what time
		zone is god in anyway

					lori
		i pray for you all

lennys bmw cruises past an overturned burning car  there
is noone around  he barely glances at it  common sight
these days  if it is the end of the world lennys not
going to let it break his rhythm

					lenny

lenny inside a gloomy bar  he slides into a booth with
norm skinner a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses
too young  a pretty stonedlooking girl is leaning
against skinner

					lenny

lovemaking in pointofview  we look down see our body
a womans body our hands moving over the other womans
torso  the image is dark a primal impression  sound of
harsh breathing rustling sheets

back to lenny in the booth with skinner  lenny has
skinners tape running in a playback deck clipped to his
belt next to his pager  he is hunched over the table
sampling the merchandise by touching a few of the trode
pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset
like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail

					lenny
		yeah i can use this
			   to the stoned girl
		 but honey you gotta move your
		eyes slower next time  its too
		jerky

					skinner
		it was her first time lenny  cut
		her some slack

tight slowmo shots abstract squid tapes and money
changing hands  a squid tape sliding sensuously into a
deck

tight cu lenny through the windshield of his car  neon
moving over him

news footage lapd aerospatiales circling their xenon
lights turning night into day giving the impression of a
futuristic war zone

inside the cockpit the infrared camera shows greenscreen
images of people in cars in their homes like footage
of hyenas shot at night in total darkness

the impression is of a society under siege an occupied
nation a watched society where the camera eye and the
police spotlight define our reality

					host
		go ahead caller youre on the air

		years resolution for the police

nicelooking street kid in his early 20s named eduardo

					eduardo

ext  train yard  night

a womans feet moving along the steel rail of a train
track at night  the woman has no shoes her feet bare

iris stumbles along the track clutching one shoe
pointlessly to her chest  she is swearing and crying
runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
face  despite this we see that she is attractive though
her dress and makeup seem designed to convey overt
sexiness  her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
of curly red hair

she is in her early twenties and the harshness of her
life has just begun to harden her features  she looks
lost and without hope in fear of her life  her breath
comes in hitching sobs and her eyes are wild

she runs between cold steel walls of freight cars looking
behind her frequently  a police helicopter is circling
its xenon beam plays over the train yard sweeping over
the cars  she hunches into the shadows of a freightcar
as the beam passes over  looking under the cars she sees
an lapd patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
yard its searchlight sweeping toward her  it moves on

she continues her run moving away from the direction of
the patrol car  she reaches a chainlink fence  crying
she scrambles over it cutting her hands and ripping her
dress  another patrol car passes two blocks away  she
crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
sight

								    cut to

ext  alley and street  night

iris sprints down an alley between buildings  rats
scatter into the shadows ahead of her  she doesnt seem
to notice  all she cares about are the police lights and
the sound of the helicopter droning circling

she pauses at the mouth of the alley scanning the well
lit street beyond  there are people here downtown low
life street people  a halfblock away is a brightly lit
sign marking the entrance to a redline subway station

she walks along the sidewalk her eyes on the sign
feeling exposed as she walks openly her heart pounding
she is a mess but in this section of town people barely
glance at her

low angle on her bare feet standing out amid the shoes
and boots of winter

she crosses the street and reaches the sidewalk just as a
blackandwhite rounds the corner at the end of the block
behind her

in the cruiser are two cops who are scanning the street
they look intense  revved up  they are burden spreg a
massive barrelchested streetlifer in his midforties
and dwayne engelman an aggressive hardon in his twenties
with a brush cut a nautilus body and a face like a
ferret

					engelman
		shes a hooker vicell have her in
		the book  we can pick her up later

					spreg
		no  now

iris knows the cops are behind her  she is terrified to
turn  finally she cant stand it any more  she breaks
into a run  the patrol car speeds up suddenly roaring
after her

iris sprints along in her bare feet allout like a track
runner  the blackandwhite screeches to the curb next to
her and the cops jump out

iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full
tilt boogie knocking down some poor old guy whose
groceries go flying

								    cut to

int  subway station and train

iris trips on the landing spins sprawling across the
filthy tile floor and comes up running  panting with
fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a
hurdler

the cops pound down the stairs two at a time  spreg draws
his 9mm  in his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness
a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey

street people fall back as spreg thunders through them
they arent about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
and his boy wonder

the two cops reach the platform  no iris in sight

moving with them as they slow to a walk scanning  a
couple of lowlifes standing around waiting for trains
eye them warily as spreg gets a call on his rover

					dispatcher vo
		do you request backup

					spreg
		negative  suspect is a black male
		age 35 to 40  were handling it

a train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air  a
few people board  there is only the sound of the cops
footsteps as they move along the empty platform  with a
pneumatic hiss the trains doors begin to close

suddenly iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a
full sprint  spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes
thundering along the platform to intercept her  engelman
straightarms his pistol

					engelman
		freeze

iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut  her
momentum carries her clear across the car where she slams
into the far wall and staggers back almost falling  she
gasps for breath and looks up to see

 spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
just came through as the train starts to move  he tries
to force the doors apart cant  he aims his gun
through the window

thinking fast iris dives to his side of the car and
presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
door where he cant see her

outside spreg is running next to the accelerating train
he swings his pistol smashing the window with the butt

iris screams as spreg lunges through the opening next to
her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her  he is
still running alongside pulling on her  trying to drag
her right out through the window

she struggles  bites his beefy hand  he swears and lets
go  then makes one last grab  gets his fingers into her
long mane of hair  yanks on her  she comes half out the
window screaming

then rip  the hair pulls off her head

spreg drops away behind the speeding train holding a
red wig  he looks at it stupidly then raises his pistol
and fires at iris

she jerks back through the window and drops to the floor
a couple of shots hit the metal outside  we see iris has
short hair platinum white  in it are a few of the many
pins which held the wig securely in place  she gasps for
air sobbing and hugging her knees trembling all over

spreg stands on the platform watching the train
disappear as engelman runs up  spreg looks at the wig in
his hand disgusted  he turns it and looks inside at the
cap

close on the cap inside the wig there is an intricate
network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
the wig  the sensors are connected by wires in a pattern
like the veins of a leaf bundling to a small flat metal
box the size of a cigarette case  it is a squid net

iris was wired  spreg just stares at the squid net eyes
going crazy wide

		oh shit

ext int  lennys apartment  night

its 4 am  lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
into the center court of his ratty building  the pool
furniture is in the pool  gang graffiti marks the walls
bars on all the windows  one of the doors looks like
somebody opened it with an ax  the pool lights give the
place an eerie dead glow  can out slick lenny really
live in this dump

through a barred window we see lenny approaching as we
hear the outgoing message on his answering machine in the
fg

beep  and

					iris vo
		lenny goddamn it you got to be
		there you got to help me come on
		pick up pick up

through the window we see lenny fishing in his pocket for
his keys

breaks

iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung
up  she looks desolate without hope

int  lennys apartment

lenny doesnt stop to play back iris message or any of
the twenty others on his machine  he just deadbolts the
door and locks a steel bar across the door frame then
carries his haliburton

 toward the bedroom  and we see the truth of his
reality  lennys crib is a shitbox  it is a small one
bedroom barely furnished  a couple of chairs  swapmeet
couch  cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
corners unidentified electronics components piled on a
table cables strung everywhere  god knows what this
stuff is  there is aluminum foil taped to all the
windows  fast food cartons empty coke cans pizza boxes
everywhere  the bachelor apartment from hell  hightech
lowlife

he goes into the bedroom  mattress on the floor  same
infernal interior decoration but this room is dominated
by racks of tapes squid tapes

lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle takes
off his clothes and hangs them over a chair  he sits on
the bed in his underwear looking lonely and depressed
this is the private lenny no plans  no dreams  nothing
to look forward to but another day of the hustle

he puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head
fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes
squinting at the handwritten labels they all say
faith only the dates are different

he selects one and inserts it in the deck makes some
minute adjustments  sips his vodka  leans back  closes
his eyes  and hits play

play back sequence pov

we are moving along the venice boardwalk following a
young woman on rollerblades  by our motion it is obvious
that we are on rollerblades too and not doing so well
the woman is laughing turning circles around us cracking
up at our discomfort
we hear lennys voice complaining a mile a minute and we
realize the pov is his  the girl takes our hands skating
backward towing us along the boardwalk  it is a sunny
afternoon and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
around us

the woman is faith justin a singer  lenny is desperately
in love with her  its not hard to see why  she is
beautiful in an alive dynamic way  her hair is a wild
dark mane and her eyes are spectacular intense  she
moves with a lithe sinuous grace  we are staring at her
eyes instead of concentrating on skating

whammo  the pov spins and we are sitting looking up at
faith as she circles laughing  she skates over to help
us up

cut to lenny on his bed smiling  he punches fast
forward

back to pov  a kinetic blur of digital hash then

we are following faith now holding her skates up the
steps to a beach apartment  inside it is funky and
comfortable

music from a disk player she left on  bob marley singing
three little birds  faith covered with a sheen of
sweat sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom  we
follow her

she comes out of the small bathroom with a towel starts
to dry off  sunlight comes in the window lighting up
faith like she is in a spotlight  we move up behind her
and take the towel away and now we see lenny standing
behind faith in the mirror over the dresser

he puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
music  he runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
sweaty belly  then leans down and licks the sweat off her
shoulder all the while watching her in the mirror  a
voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes so he
can replay and relive the moment

their eyes meet in the mirror

they both watch as lenny slides his hand up under her
halter and caresses her nipples  she moans softly
responding  she turns to him and our pov shifts directly
to her  she is right in front of us in tight close up
the intimacy is power

					faith
			   laughs
		hey you going to watch or you going
		to do

					lenny
		watch and see

we lean toward her until her eyes fill frame as they
close in a kiss  we lenny keeps ours open  our hands
pull her halter over her head  then she pulls up on
lennys tshirt laughing  we see it go over our eyes
blocking the view for a moment

then faith kisses lennys bare chest  we are looking down
at her looking down across our body lennys body as
faith kisses lower kneeling in front of us unbuckling
our belt and we

cut to lenny in the here and now  lost in playback memory
bliss  he inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically
recorded pleasure

back to pov  lenny pulls faith up to his face kissing
her then pushing her gently to the bed where we lie down
together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled
sheets  she looks up right at us

					faith
		i love your eyes lenny
			   she touches our
			    eyelids
		i love the way they see

cut to lenny lost in the swirl of sensation  he touches
his tongue to his fingertip

in pov we look down at faith as we enter her  she gasps
and closes her eyes grabbing the headboard with both
hands  there is only the sound of gasping breaths the
creaking bed frame  she rocks with the rhythm of our
thrusts borne away by the intensity until she cries out

cut to lenny reliving the past under the electrodes  he
reacts to the past orgasm  the tape ends lenny slowly
takes off the trodes  there is a tiny tear at the corner
of his eye

underwear searches for breakfast in the fridge which is
empty except for a redwhiteandblue 2stick popsicle

she takes a squid tape from her pocket and scribbles a
note on the label help me  iris she drops the tape
through a 2inch gap in lennys sun roof and it bounces
off the seat onto the floor

she looks through the windshield totally distraught
trying to see where the tape landed and sees the

as she hangs up she glances out the window in time to
see

lenny flying over a hedge  he lands on the sidewalk then
scrambles up and brushes himself off as two security types
loom toward him  he adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
dignity but quickly toward the car

as mace pulls out lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
trodes to his head  mace glances at him in disgust  he
hits his playback button

lennys pov as he talks to faith  back when things were
good  hes wiring her  they are playful like a couple
of kids

					faith
		i feel like youre turning me into a
		vcr

					lenny
		i just want to see what were like
		together through your eyes

he turns off the record button  static  then tape
restarts  we see the two of them standing together
reflected in a mirror

we are faith now

					faith
		i dont feel anything  is it on

					lenny
		forget its there

					faith
		make me forget it baby

he turns her to him  they begin to make love  faiths
face fills our field of view eyes closed in dreamy
passion

a sudden flash of light  lenny opens his eyes to see
maces glowing countenance

she has stopped the car torn the trodes from lennys head
and tossed them out the window  now shes yanking him out
of the car by his lapels

					lenny
		hey careful on the jacket  this is

mace starts to peel out but lenny leaps and plasters
himself on the hood  mace pretends she doesnt see him

					lenny
			   as they drive along
		can i come in please  im having a
		hard time hearing the stereo

mace jams on the brakes and lenny slides off in front of
the car  now she starts to move forward

					lenny
		i need my case  its still in the
		back

he quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
door  lenny grabs his haliburton but instead of getting
out he leans through the divider window next to mace

					lenny
		listen can we talk a little bit
		here like two rational adults

mace hits a button on the dash  the privacy divider rises
suddenly pinning lenny to the ceiling

					lenny
		that would be no

					mace
		ive had it  no more wirehead shit
		in my car  you understand  you
		want to poach your lobes do it
		somewhere else

					lenny
		okay you got my attention but this
		is cutting off the circulation to my

she lowers the divider releasing him  lenny straightens
his jacket and tie  runs a hand through his greasy hair

					lenny
		i thought we were friends

int  retinal fetish

mace accompanies lenny into the pounding din of the
retinal fetish  the place is a fringe hangout a
converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor  a
thundering labyrinth  steel cagelike partitions of
chainlink give the place a harsh concentrationcamp
atmosphere  the music is a bass techthump and the
clientele are young and on the rough side  cybergrunge

there are many large video screens running a continuous
montage of wild graphics and images a flurry of
disturbing videos mtv baptized by william burroughs

the fetish is a streettech hangout a meeting place for a
lot of digitalunderground types that lenny knows  you
can buy and sell what you want here illicit hardware and
software as well as chemicals for the wetware brain

lenny and mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
metal detectors  they barely notice as they are scanned
its routine there days  mace shows her gun a sig saur
9mm and her state carrypermit  the security guys check
her pistol like a coat giving her a claim check

through the crowd in the lounge lennys eyes go
immediately to one table  it seems to be in a pool of
light all its own or maybe this is just in lennys mind
slow motion lenny watches a man at the table holding
court with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him

it is tran vo  hes a mover and shaker in the record
business he produces he manages he tries to keep
everyone in his orbit

the woman is faith justin  we recognize her from playback
as lennys exgirlfriend  but now her hair has been dyed
jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle  she is
wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
silk top  she has on too much makeup which gives her
features a feraldoll quality  faith looks like what she
is a rock star wannabe  but the look is redhot

tran looks around the room  his eyes miss nothing  and
show nothing  his hand  unhurried graceful remarkable
 brushes past faiths cheek barely touching her  his
fingers pick up a strand of hair tuck it like a treasure
behind her ear fingers touching her head now a
moment of suspended time

 and she trembles  just a little  for a second

tran and faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
consisting of music types various hangers on and trans
personal security force of four joey corto a whippet
thin skinhead duncan a nonetoobright armbreaker in the
classic mold a massively built exjock type called wade
beemer and a sixteen year old asian stone fox cindy
minh aka vita possibly the most lethal of the four

					lenny
		whos the new side of beef in trans
		posse

					mace
		guy named wade beemer  used to be a
		running back for the rams in 96 and
		97

					lenny
		rams thats football right

he cant take his eyes off faith  mace scowls at the
tableau and pulls lenny toward the bar

					mace
		forget her

					lenny
		she still loves me

					mace
		she thinks youre a bucket of dog
		vomit  trust me on this

					lenny
		shes my destiny

					mace
		destiny  you living in a perfume
		commercial  shes a hardclimber
		that dropped you like a used tampon
		when she got a better ride

					lenny
		youll see

mace gives up shakes her head and lenny plunges into the
crowd toward faith  several patrons greet him just as
in the coral lounge but uncharacteristically lenny
virtually ignores them

approaching the main table now  ringside  tran sees him
no reaction  now faith sees him her reactions a little
tougher to read  pissed off maybe or just tense

trans security force has seen lenny coming  but they
stay casual

lenny doesnt break stride  its like a game of chicken
without cars  beemer stands covering lenny with his
shadow  vita looks up at lenny with cobra eyes  tran
gives him a glance royalty amused by lennys presumption

					tran
		you come to peddle me some tapes
		lenny  for old times sake  make a
		couple bucks for the holidays

					lenny
		youre not a client anymore tran
		i wouldnt sell you the sweat off a
		dead dogs balls

					tran
			   glancing at faith
			    back at lenny
		i already got everything i need from
		you

					faith
		cut it out tran

					lenny
		too bad about your guy jeriko
		tough break

					tran
		show a little respect nero  the
		man was an important artist

					lenny
		yeah important for your label
		which no doubt is why youre in
		mourning  dont worry his
		recordsll sell out now hes dead
		youll make out

					tran
		i always do

					lenny
		faith can i talk to you a second

					faith
		i dont think thats a good idea
		lenny

					lenny
		i just got to talk to you for one
		second

					tran
		about what

					lenny
		that would be between me and faith
		wouldnt it

tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly
in the general area between his table and lenny

					tran
		i dont feel anything between you
		see your trouble is you assume too
		much lenny  you assume theres
		something where theres nothing
		you assume you have a life  but
		youre only hustling pieces of other
		lives on tape and broken parts of
		your own

faith glances at tran then cuts her eyes to lenny

					faith
			   icy
		we have nothing to talk about
		lenny

					tran
		joey make sure mr nero gets safely
		to his car

joey smirks glances at beemer who rises like a wall

					lenny
		faith call me okay

					faith
		no lenny

wade gets lenny in a wristgrip come along hold and starts
him moving  she looks at him  slowly gaze unwavering
as beemer ushers lenny through the crowd tick greets him
coming the other way

					lenny
		tick listen i cant stop right
		now  but ill call you tomorrow
		about that thing we were talking
		about

hes working the room even as hes getting dragged
outside

					tran
		lenny the loser  panhandler of
		stolen dreams

					faith
		leave him alone tran

					tran
		hes no concern of mine as long as
		you dont talk to him  dont talk
		to anybody  you understand  not

lenny looks at the envelope which has nero handprinted
in block letters  tex takes a pull from a flask as he
takes a squiddeck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in
he puts on the headset and pushes play

in pov we are on a beach  early morning  we are running
flat out with the wind  looking down we are barefoot
on the wet sand  foaming water races up the sand and
breaks around our strong male legs  looking up again to
see our running companion a beautiful lithe woman in
shorts and tshirt  she laughs and we speed up  an
exquisite moment of pure life force

tight on texs face as a tear leaks from the corner of
his eye  he is smiling like he is listening to beautiful
music  we see the quiet magnificence of lennys gift

tex opens his eyes  looks for lenny to say thanks but

as lenny comes down the stairs from the vj booth tearing
open the envelope  an unmarked squid tape falls into his
hand

the house lights dim and the stage lights come up  and
faith is standing there  like she beamed in  she is
wearing a revealing leather outfit showing a lot of her
milkwhite skin  her black hair frames her eyes giving
her an intense feral look  faith starts to sing
beautiful unearthly clear notes

suddenly the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
sound  faith explodes into motion  her body convulses
like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her  her voice
becomes a scream an inchoate wail a police siren  the
pain and rage of an entire hellbent tormented planet on
its eve of judgment

lost in the song faith has found herself  she wheels
across the stage slashing her head up and down so that
her hair bursts in the strobeflashes like flak

a technoerotic pagan  a force of nature

lenny is mesmerized  he has seen this before many times
but it always has the same effect on him  he is
transported into another world by her a world in which
there is only the two of them

tight on mace eyes on the stage a big piece of the
puzzle suddenly fits  shes never seen faith perform
before  holy shit

faith doesnt play to the audience or engage them in any
way  she is merely taking whats in her head and letting
it out  she doesnt care if they are there or not  now
shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat and
holding the note holding it longer than you believe she
possibly could  then nothing

when it is over she just drops the microphone and walk
away  fuck you

corridors past dim rooms full of wire junkies and
playback freaks all trapped into squid nirvana post
modern opium dens  sinister and scary  he glimpses
faith going into her dressing room  he hurries

 but she doesnt even look around when his reflection
appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity
table  she is drenched with sweat  spent  chugging a
beer  this is the first time they have been alone
together in realtime for months  pain and the memory of
joy

					lenny
		hi baby  ive missed you

					faith
		i know  lenny if tran finds you
		talking to me hell hurt you

					lenny
		im already hurting

she doesnt turn  just watches him in the mirror  most
of the scene plays this way  it is a cold parody of their
lovemaking playbacks

					faith
		you have to go  i mean it

					lenny
		yeah ok whatever you say  just
		answer one question  is anything
		wrong  iris said you might be in

					faith

		no idea

he opens his briefcase pops the tape into the deck puts
the squid rig on and closes his eyes  maybe he can forget
about faith a minute  he punches play

pov sequence the first thing we notice is that the pov is
distorted visually  the colors are desaturated  almost
black and white  yet the detail is crisp and clear
almost hyperreal

we are walking down a windowless hallway at a large hotel
an apparently endless row of doors  the wearers glance
goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time

we come to a particular door  there is a do not disturb
sign on the door  the wearer moves to the room next door
looks both ways  the corridor is empty

					lenny
		its a test pattern so far

our hands appear quickly pulling on latex surgical
gloves  they look like male hands  the snapping of the
rubber is the only sound in the corridor  the pov hunches
down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with
lockpicking tools  several seconds and the lock is very
professionally picked

					lenny
		alright a little be action

we enter the dark room which is vacant  the drapes are
open and we see city lights  it is night  one gloved
hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the
moonlight coming in the window the sunset sheraton

the wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear
holding a black skimask  he pulls it on leaving the
subsequent pov seen through the eyeholes of the mask

the wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser  he has
avoided his reflection up until now  we see a man
dressed in a jogging suit and black fannypack and of
course the skimask  totally anonymous

					lenny
		hey getting good  solid suspense
		build

the wearer crosses to the balcony door  opens it quietly
and goes outside moving to the wall dividing this rooms
balcony from the one next door

the wearer climbs the railing and six stories above the
pavement slips around the wall stepping down onto the
other balcony  we hug the wall looking furtively into
the room  it is a suite  in the living room we see a
woman making herself a drink at the minibar  she
turns

it is iris  she is wearing a tshirt and panties
probably ready for bed  she looks like she cant sleep
pours the scotch shakily

cut to lenny the streetlight washing across his face  he
gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread

in pov we see iris go into the bedroom out of sight  we
can hear the television on in there  using a steel jimmy
the wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
silently opens it slipping inside

we stalk quietly to the bedroom door listening to her
movements  water running in the bathroom  we come around
the door frame  bedroom dark bathed in tv glow  iris in
the bathroom washing her face with cold water

we move toward her  crossing the room as she reaches for
a towel  we are now only a couple of feet away  she
comes out of the bathroom walking right past us drying
her face  she lowers the towel turning away her eyes
whip back  widening in terror

she reacts with surprising speed diving across the bed
we go after her

her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
automatic  she whips it around toward us but we grab it
and twist it away before she can fire  she smashes the
palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed
lightningfast

we follow her as she scrambles up running through the
bedroom door  across the living room and down the short
hall to the front door  closing rapidly on her as she
somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
hall

slam  we tackle her against the far wall of the corridor
our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
stunner  zap  we nail her right in the back between the
shoulder blades

she sags to the floor gasping  we zap her again  the
wearers glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor
nobody in sight  we clamp our hand over iris mouth and
drag her back into her room locking the door

on lenny reacting  going white

					mace
		what is it

					lenny
		go to the sunset sheraton  right
		now  just go  go

lenny goes back under the wire seeing

we are dragging a semiconscious iris into the bathroom
propping her up with her back against the white tile
wall grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one
to the steel towel rack above her  she is moaning  and
crying

					iris
			   voice distorted
		i havent seen your face i
		havent heard your voice you can
		still let me go

zap  the wearer hits her with the stunner again  she
jerks and gasps for breath  we see our latexgloved
finger come up in front of us and hear ssshhh

moving quickly now  our hands unbuckle the fanny pack
pull out something a set of playback trodes  our hands
place them on her head  she stares uncomprehending
what  we catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
the pack a record deck some wires a small metal box

					lenny
		holy shit  hes jacking her in to
		his own output  shes seeing what
		hes seeing  shes seeing herself

iris can now see herself as the wearer sees her wide
eyed with terror whitelipped weeping  helpless  and
she can feel what he feels

the wearers hand goes back into the fannypack and pulls
out something else  a black athletic headband  we slip
it over her head down over her eyes  a blindfold  now
she can only see what the wearer sees

and also from the bag we pull a yellow plastic object
with our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
knife the type with tips that can be broken off by
segments when they get dull  it extends with an ominous
clicking sound

we lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her t
shirt laying it open  exposing her torso  we then look
down and slide the knife under the side band of her
panties slicing them off  we put the knife up to her
throat and she whimpers afraid to cry out and then we
draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
tease her with the prospect of her death

mace looks at lennys expression of dawning horror and
pulls the car to the curb about a halfblock from the
sunset sheraton  lenny is hyperventilating shifting in
his seat as if ants are crawling over him  he is
experiencing the stalkers exhilaration

in pov we see the wearer pull his jogging pants down below
his knees rrated please and reach for iris  kneeling
in front of her he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
hips forward onto him pushing into her

iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels she
feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
killers exhilaration

on lenny sweating and barely able to breath  mace stops
the tape concerned by lennys reaction  he opens his
eyes mace see the fear there of what the tape may
reveal  but he shakes his head  he has to know  he
pushes her hand away and punches play

it floods into his head again  the sweaty grunting
horror  the stalker picks up her slit tshirt and quickly
wraps it around her neck  he knots it tight and twists
one powerful hand into the knot  the muscles in his
forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter

the stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
tshirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
jaw

via her trodes iris watches herself die  her death comes
at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her
blasting off the planet on total overload terror pain
death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
instant

on lenny crying out and grabbing for the trodes but he
just holds onto them as if they are sucking his brains
out of his skull

					lenny
			   like a mantra
		on my god  oh my god

back to pov a glimpse of the wearers hand relaxing the
knot  iris head lolls  her mouth is slack and open  we
remove her blindfold  her eyes are halflidded  very
dead looking  our fingers gently push them wide open

back to lenny looking like he has been gut kicked  he
gasps for breath

to pov as the killers hand calmly moves iris head from
side to side studying her dead face  her staring eyes
he leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye
the pupil wide seeing nothing

a burst of static  end of tape

lenny opens his eyes  he fumbles open the car door and
practically rolls out onto the sidewalk  the trodes pull
off his head as he lurches up reeling across the sidewalk
to a darkened storefront where he leans for support  he
doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach

mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to
his knees  she holds his shoulders while he throws up
again

					mace

follows his glance  they notice for the first time cop

the huge elevator with lenny its sole occupant descends
through the shadows toward the first floor  lenny watches
the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork
door  hes still thinking about faith

 even when the elevator reaches the first floor and
mace comes into view  shes waiting for him  he steps
forward  but he cant open the grillwork door  and the
elevator doesnt stop  it keeps going down  lenny
spooked works the door hard as mace disappears from
view above him

 and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement
with vita and the beef squad waiting for lenny stoney
faced  last stop  all out

lenny tries to keep the door shut but duncan wrenches it
open  vita grabs lenny and twists his arm painfully
behind him in one fluid move  they hustle him toward a
dank basement room near the elevator

a glimmer of hope in lennys eye as he whips it off his
wrist  corto doesnt even look at it  gets it over his
hand about midway then  using the watch like a pair of
brass knuckles  clobbers lenny in the face  watch parts
go flying as corto steps away and duncan slams lenny up
against a column

vita weighs in gutpunching lenny savagely  she works
him expertly with a series of painful jabs

he sags to his knees  not only is this painful  its
goddamn humiliating  and duncan and corto enjoy every
second of it

					corto
		we tried to find a smaller girl to
		beat the shit out of you lenny
		but it was short notice

vita grabs lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one
rockhard arm  she is cocking back the other arm for a
piledriver punch when

suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her  mace
drives vita head first into the steel column

duncan lunges in and grabs for mace  this is a mistake
mace doesnt fight fancy  and she doesnt fight fair
she fights to win  and she is awesomely fast  her moves
are street moves coupled with armlocks and comealongs
she has been trained to use as a security driver

lenny recovers enough to size up vita who is still a
little stunned  she has blood dripping in her eyes and
cant see too well

but she charges him  and  being the gent that he is 
he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair

mace drops duncan about the time vita is hitting the
ground leaving

corto who fumbles out a beretta 9mm and sticks it in
maces face  he sniggers loving the upper hand

					mace
		safetys on

and like a jerk he looks

she snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly
fast twisting the gun out of his hand  she continues to
twist his wrist brutally and corto goes down to one knee
groaning  she takes his beretta and backhands the barrel
hard across his face  mace releases his wrist and he
crumples in a heap

she and lenny back out the door  then lenny runs back in
and kicks corto in the ribs

and hits playback

squid povs strobelike images of iris rape and death
separated by burst of static

 as lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons
searching the tape for clues reacting to the feelings on
the tape trying to manage his revulsion

 until mace yanks the trodes off and lenny sags back on
the couch  he rubs his eyes  he is seeing ghosts
afterimages burned into his visual cortex  the room is
alive with them shimmering

					mace
		no more lenny

					lenny
		yeah  im ghosting pretty bad

lenny see iris terrified face  literally  it floats
iridescent on his living room wall fading slowly

		its not your fault

lenny gets up staggering to the kitchen  she goes with
him

					lenny
		sex killers act alone  so theres

		theyll never nail this guy the

lenny sucks down four tylenol with a long pull from a
bottle of vodka

					lenny
		and anyway nobody gives a shit
		about a dead hooker  theyre
		roadkill

requiem for iris  mace watches lenny rubbing his eyes
waiting for the tylenols to hit

					lenny
		see its all about what they see
		walking in  a dead hooker
		handcuffs penetration theyll
		see a trick gone wrong  random
		kill  the kind you never solve

					mace
		but that doesnt add does it

					lenny
		no it doesnt

					mace
		because iris knew somebody was after
		her

lenny wound up like a swiss movement starts pacing

					lenny
		she said if they get me  they
		which means the whole sexkiller
		thing is a cover which means
		somebody whacked her for a reason

					mace
		so the guys not a sicko

					lenny
		if he could do whats on that tape
		hes a sicko

					mace
		okay so hes a freak who thinks
		hes sane pretending to be a freak
		the point is he was a hitter
		somebody wanted to shut her up  but
		why not just put a little lead in
		her ear

					lenny
		because it had to look random  not
		connected to anything or anyone
			   he seems to run out
			    of energy
		but then why give the rape to me

					mace
		thats where it gets a little
		strange

					lenny
		and what about the guy that was
		following me

					mace
		now youre really getting paranoid

lenny collapses on the couch rubbing his temples

					lenny
		the question is not whether i am
		paranoid but whether i am paranoid
		enough  you want to rub my neck

					mace
		sure

mace sits next to him and starts to work  strong knowing
fingers  lenny starts to relax a little

					lenny
		hows zander

					mace
		ok  he asks about you all the time
		its been weeks since youve seen
		him

lenny sort of keels over  his head slumps in her lap

					mace
		im sorry about getting on your case
		earlier  i just see you getting
		sucked in deeper and deeper and i
		 anyway  im sorry

					lenny
			   drifting off

		sokay  i know you still love me

she looks down at him gently brushes his hair off his
sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture  he
is out cold

mace gazes at lennys sleeping face in a way we havent
seen before unguarded  caring  loving

and we get it she does love him  it makes no sense and
it is a great burden to her that he doesnt see her but
there it is

she shakes it off she doesnt want to deal with it now
maybe not ever  she leans her head back against the ratty
top of the couch sighs  and keeps her hand moving

envelope stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his
front window next to the door  nero is printed on the
envelope

oh shit  he opens the door looking both ways  noone is
around  he fishes out the envelope from behind the bars
and takes it inside  of course it contains a tape  he
stares at it with dread

lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck  he
picks up the trodes and places them on his head  he
notices his hands are shaking  he takes a deep breath and
punches play

pov sequence day  as expected we see the desaturated
signature look of the killers vision  the wearer is
walking through the courtyard of lennys apartment
building  we recognize it by the unkempt pool the sunken
deck furniture  we walk through a breezeway to an ally
like courtyard behind the building  we approach a door
the back door to lennys apartment

the killer picks the lock on the back door  opens the
door and enters  the apartment is dark blacked out  we
are in the kitchen  we stop and listen  water dripping
in the sink  soft snoring from the living room

moving to the other room  slowly silently  furtively
looking around the door frame to the living room  there
is lenny crashed out on the couch

now moving stealthily toward him  kneeling down beside
him  lenny burned out from the night before is deep
under  our hand comes into view holding the yellow
plastic razor knife  with his thumb the killer extends
the blade click click click click

the blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
lenny  the killer lays it gently against lennys throat
draws it slowly across not leaving a mark

the pov backs away and  static as the tape ends

lenny in the present whips off the trodes freaking  he
feels around his throat with one hand cant feel
anything

crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door he
inspects his neck minutely  there is a hairline red line
over his carotid  he looks around the room wildly his
heart hammering  slowly he gets his breathing under
control

then he hears something in the kitchen  a tiny click

his eyes go wide  hyperventilating lenny moves silently
into the bedroom  he fishes around under the bed and
pulls out a glock 22 45 auto pistol  he stalks silently
toward the kitchen

then he looks at the butt of the pistolgrip no magazine
he unstalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
under a bunch of dirty socks  he inserts it quietly
wincing as he chambers a round

heart thudding he works his way to the kitchen door  he
edges around the frame pieing the room  cop reflexes
intact

mace is sitting at the kitchen table giving him a funny
look  she is drinking a cup of coffee made from the
bottle of instant on the counter  she is dressed
casually in bicycle pants work boots and oversized nylon
jacket over a tanktop

					lenny

hands them over with obvious distaste  he throws them in
the bag starts to zip it

 then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror

ext  san pedro impound yard  dusk

605  pm

the last night of this millennium is falling  maces limo
pulls to the curb  the yard is located in the vast no
mans land of storage lots cranes and warehouses near
harbor piers  the impound office is locked  closed for
new years eve

cut to lenny and mace cutting the chain off the gate with
the longhandled boltcutters  they enter the yard  mace
is carrying a blunt object that looks like a raygun  a
tazer

right on cue a huge rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
at them growling its head low on an attack run  mace
fires and the tazer lights up the with 120000 volts low
amperage not lethal  it whines and flips over twice
then runs off behind some parked cars

					lenny
		thats a handy little attitude
		adjuster
			   sees his car
		damn  im boxed in

lenny and mace approach his bmw blocked in by ten other
cars so hes not getting it back this trip  he unlocks
the door and looks inside with a tiny maglite while mace
covers them with the tazer  a puppylike whine comes
occasionally from behind some cars nearby  we catch a
glimpse of the puzzled snuffling rottweiller eyeing them
warily

lenny finds the tape on the floormat passenger side
still wrapped in the note  he reads the note help me
iris

					mace
		whats it say

he crumples the note

					lenny
		nothing  lets go play this back

cut to lenny and mace returning to the limo  as they
reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams  it is
the two cops spreg and engelman out of uniform but
looking very serious with their pistols aimed at lenny and
mace  they have been following lenny knowing sooner or
later he would lead them to the tape

					spreg
		give me the tape  right now

					lenny
		what tape  im just trying to get
		my car back but the place is
		closed

					spreg
		shut the fuck up nero

engelman grabs a fistfull of hair at the top of maces
head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull

					mace
			   cool and even
		lenny give them the tape

					lenny
		its in my case  okay  im going
		to open my case

					engelman
		facing us where we can see it

lenny slowly opens the haliburton  he takes out the tape
and holds it out toward spreg

					lenny
		take it and turn her loose  okay

					spreg
		absolutely

and you see in his eyes that it isnt going to go that
way  spreg edges forward and takes the tape  then he
points his pistol at lennys head about to fire

which is when the pissedoff rottweiller shoots through
the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
engelmans leg  engelman screams in pain  mace twists
out of his grip  engelman shoots the dog

lenny swings up his haliburton using it as a shield and
dives for the car  the case takes three rounds from
spregs 9mm before lenny gets behind cover

mace just seems to vanish  she reappears over the trunk
of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into spregs
chest knocking him down  lenny and mace scramble into
the car starting it up

spreg sits up pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
armor stopped the slugs  no blood  he comes up firing
he and engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
pulls away  no damage  they realize the limo is a bullet
proof security model and run to their pickup truck parked
nearby to give chase

spregs face is a mask of rage  he slams the truck in
gear and accelerates after the limo before engelman even
has the door closed

int ext  limo and san pedro street  night

mace has the big car floored  she looks in the rearview
as the truck gains on them  mace is doing her thing
what shes trained for  security driving  she whips some
moves in the big car but the truck is closing on them

					lenny
			   holding on
		oh no were not being followed
		lenny dont be so paranoid lenny

they hear rounds hitting the car and look back  the
truck is right behind them

					lenny
		shit

					mace
		take it easy  the glass is bullet
		resistant

					lenny
		bullet resistant  whatever happened
		to bullet proof

					mace
		lenny  calm down  this is what i
		do

the limo slides broadly through a turn side slamming a
parked van  mace accelerates  the truck stays with them

engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
ak47 assault rifle  he rips off several burst which
riddle the limo cracking the glass in starburst patterns
the lexanlaminated windows are cracked to hell but the
rounds dont come all the way through

spregs truck comes alongside ramming them  the impact
drives them sideways  mace swerves to miss a light
standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
buildings which front the harbor

the truck stays right with them  engelman fires bursts at
the tires shredding them off the rims  the limo thunders
along on steel rims throwing roostertails of orange
sparks

mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings  no way to
turn  ahead is a short concrete pier  she hits the
brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier
stopping before it reaches the end

they are trapped

ext  san pedro pier  night

engelman and spreg jump out of the truck taking cover
behind it  they rake the limo with bursts from their ak
47s

inside the car  lenny and mace keep their heads down
below the door frame  it sounds like they are inside a
steel drum in some psychotic calypso band  but the
armored body panels hold

lenny is punching his cellular

					lenny
		goddamnit  911 is busy

					mace
		its okay lenny
			   he looks at her
			    hopefully
		theyd never get here in time
		anyway

mace has reloaded her sig and is trying to open the door
on her side away from the bad guys  it is jammed from
the sideswiping

spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
gallon gas can  he uncaps it and throws it across the
pavement  it slides under the limo glugging its contents
onto the ground  spreg grabs a roadflare from under the
seat of the truck and strikes the cap lighting it

he tosses the flare under the limo

kawhoomph  the gas can explodes in a fireball  the
continental is engulfed in flames  from the inside all
lenny and mace can see is fire  all the windows are
covered in roaring flames

					mace
			   matteroffact
		this is bad

					lenny
		the gas tanks going to go any
		second

mace slams the car into gear and floors it  the powerful
lincoln thunders forward  it crashes through a chainlink
fence and launches right off the end of the pier  a
fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
water

inside they are slammed forward by the impact  the car
sinks

underwater the car hits bottom twenty feet down sitting
there amid the junk  shafts of light play down from the
big streetlights at the end of the pier

inside lenny and mace are in a flooding black tomb

					lenny
		are you out of your fucking mind

					mace
		fires out isnt it

she scrambles into the back seat  she wrenches at the
rear seatback pulls it free and crawls halfinto the
huge trunk  water is up around their legs  she grabs her
shotgun a sawedoff tengauge

					mace
		get in here  come on lenny move
		it  move

mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in

					mace
		get ready to hold your breath

she aims the tengauge at the trunk latch mechanism

					mace
		lenny kick out hard then just
		follow me okay

he nods  blam  she blows the trunk latch into shrapnel
the trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles  lenny
and mace kick out heading toward the lights of the pier

on the surface mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
the slimy concrete wall  lenny comes up beside her
spluttering  her hand goes over his mouth  they are in
the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of railroad
ties

engelman and spreg are standing above them scanning the
black water over the barrels of their aks

					spreg
		lets get out of here

they run back to the truck and hightail it out of there

down below lenny and mace are clinging to the pier
chestdeep in the water  they hear the truck pulling
away  they let out a big exhalations of relief

cut to lenny and mace walking on the pier shoes
squishing  they leave a shiny trail behind them

					mace
		i cant believe we had to give them
		the damn tape

					lenny
		yeah me neither  it was one of my
		favorites  me and faith in a hot
		tub on my birthday  im going to

pov sequence we are iris  riding in a car  fixing our
makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor  iris
flips the sun visor back up revealing the moving street
it is night

we look down and recognize the dress iris was wearing
when we first saw her two nights ago  she puts her
lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist  iris
turns her head and we see the driver

it is jeriko one  he is laughing talking to someone in
the back seat  iris looks and we see replay jerikos
sideman and another woman diamanda  they are amorously
entwined  then they are all laughing and passing around a
bottle of jim beam  the car stereo is thumping loudly

iris pov swings around and looks down seeing jerikos
hand caressing her thigh  she puts her hand on his chest
and leans close to him  jeriko grins then looks up and
swears at a wash of redblue cop flash

					jeriko
		shit  fuckin fiveo

our pov swings to the rearview mirror and we see an lapd
car behind us with the gumball machine on  a spotlight
hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren  jeriko
pulls over but they are on an overpass no shoulder

					cop voice
			   on bullhorn
		go to the bottom of the ramp

jeriko and replay are both swearing  he pulls the car
down the ramp stopping on a deserted street in a
warehouse district  our pov looks around nervously
black shadows and concrete pillars  noone around  cars
whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on
mars  the car is stopped next to a train yard  we hear
the rumble of diesels nearby the clank of freightcars

we see the outlines of two cops advancing through the beam
of the spotlight their guns drawn

					jeriko
			   jumping out of the
			    car
		goddamn now what you pull me over
		for  if i was going any slower id
		be parked

			   to us
		put your hands on the hood of the
		car and dont move

we exchange a look with diamanda  fucking cops  but
jeriko is winding them up  not giving them the pleasure
of the humiliation  you can see it escalating

					jeriko
		i suppose you stopped us cause you

replay starts laughing  diamanda stifles a giggle  spreg
is whitelipped with rage  years of frustration coming to
a head  too many disciplinary actions too many
suspensions too little appreciation of the tough job they
do

					jeriko
		its a song about a cop who meets
		his worst nightmare a nigger with
		enough political juice to crush his
		ass like a stink bug  youre gonna
		be famous

spreg looks around the empty street  looks at engelman
down at jeriko proned out on the pavement  replays
laughter in his ears

					spreg
		i dont think so

and shoots him blam  blam  twice in the back of the
head  just like that

diamanda screams  replay tries to roll to his feet
spreg shoots him twice in the stomach  replay is
screaming  rolling around holding his guts

engelman hesitates and then spins toward us  diamanda is
screaming backing away from engelman  spreg shoots
replay four more times

we spin oneeighty and start to run  hear shots blam
blam  blam  spin back to see diamanda dropping to her
knees  engelman shoots her again  then raises his gun
toward us

we spin away  the world becomes a kinetic blur  the
sound of shots  we see puffs of dust on the ground in
front of us  missed shots  we tumble over a guardrail
and roll down an embankment get up and keep running

train tracks ahead  looking back here come spreg and
engelman down the embankment overtaking us  we hear the
thunder of a train spinning again to look forward
freighttrain doing fifty on the nearest track  almost to
us

we leap forward  over the track  the diesel roars past
behind us  looking back a black wall of moving steel
backing away from it

we see engelman and spreg crouching down trying to aim
through the wheels  hear the impotent pop of their guns
over the roar of the train

turning to run again  we see a tiny hole appear in a sign
right in front of us with a metallic spang  running and
running

looking back  no pursuit  train still rolling by  cant
see the cops  running running  heart pounding and lungs
heaving  sobbing sounds coming from somewhere seeming to
fill the night

looking down one shoe on one shoe off  iris hand
takes off the remaining shoe clutches it to her chest
we move forward into the dark trainyard as

convulsing with the divine madness of her music  beyond
her beyond the lights in the gloom lenny can just see
tran and his entourage  dressed in tuxes they look out
of place clearly on their way somewhere else as the
evening progresses

faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final
downbeat  the spotlight goes out and the set is over

on tran clapping  watching

nearby max arrives through the crowd scanning for
tran spotting him

backstage faith bathed in sweat walking along a dark
corridor backstage  we track with her as she walks
through the shadows like a fighter returning from the
ring soaked and breathing hard

a hand shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth
pulling her into the shadows  terrified for a split
second before she recognizes that it is lenny  he
pulls her into the room and closes the door  it is tex
arcanas vj control room full of monitors and constantly
changing graphic images  tex is not there

					faith
		lenny  jesus  you scared the hell
		out of me

faith sees that mace is standing there in the shadows
waiting  she turns back to lenny with a frown

					faith
		whats going on

					lenny
		faith we know about jeriko  iris
		made me a copy of the tape

					faith
		oh god lenny  i was trying to keep
		you out of this

but she seems relieved now that he knows now that there
is someone to talk to

					lenny
		how did it happen  what was iris
		doing riding around with jeriko
		wearing a wire

					faith
		we should talk alone

					lenny

him

					faith
		tran and jeriko werent getting

		getting ready to dump him but he
		wasnt sure so he started with the
		surveillance  a couple nights ago
		he wires up iris and sends her and
		the other girl diamanda over to
		jerikos table

cut to two nights ago iris wearing a wig leaves trans
table with diamanda and moves toward a booth in the
retinal fetish where jeriko one sits with replay  iris
stands over jeriko for just a moment  then he nods
smiles a little and moves over to make room for her in
the booth right next to him

					faith
		that night iris calls up freaking
		she comes over and tran watches the
		tape  he just loses it  he cant
		believe the disaster shes gotten
		him into  hes terrified the cops
		will beat it out of her who she was
		working for and come looking for
		him

cut to trans loft as a tearstreaked and frantic iris is
telling tran about how the cops tried to kill her we
dont hear  tran backhands her furiously his face thin
lipped with rage  she crumples to the floor sobbing
tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like its
poison

					lenny
		kinda guy you can count on in a
		pinch

					mace
		why didnt he just go public with
		the tape  save himself that way

cut to an image of tran burning the squid tape  it
blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like
a venomous snake

					faith
		the scandal would wipe him out  if
		it got out that he had his own
		artists under surveillance hed
		lose all his other acts  hed be
		over

now we see tran more composed comforting iris  he wipes
at her tearstreaked face  hands her a wad of bills

					faith
		so finally he gives iris some cash
		and tells her to check into the
		hotel under a wrong name till he
		figures out what to do

					lenny
		yeah he figured out what to do
		all right

					faith
		you think tran killed her

					lenny
		the killer knew right where she was

mace leads the way with lenny following gripping faiths
hand like orpheus leading eurydice out of hell  they push
through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor

trans posse rounding a corner spotting them  they
start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts knocking
protesting people out of the way

corridor

behind them duncan leads the charge  suddenly tex arcana
shoots into the hallway intentionally blocking their path
with his wheelchair  duncan crashes over him toppling
the chair and they both sprawl to the floor  vita

tex like many legless men has incredibly strong arms
lenny looks back to see him pounding duncans head against
the floor

lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they
shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobeflashes and
a wall of sound

behind them we see corto and beemer hurling partiers
aside cutting a swath while vita moves like a mongoose
through tall grass  mace drops back going tailend
charlie her bodyguard mode kicking in

on lenny and faith charging through the jostling crowd
lenny is looking back then he looks ahead and

tran is right in front of him  in the whirling shapes and
colors of the crowd he is an island of composure in a
white tux  he holds a glass of champagne in one hand the
bottle in the other  in one lightningfast move he
uppercuts with the bottle clipping lenny under the jaw
faith screams as lenny staggers  tran swings again
smashing the bottle over the back of lennys head  lenny
sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass

lenny blood flowing in his eyes rises blearily to see
faith being pulled away by tran who has her arm twisted
viciously behind her back  they go around a chainlink
divider and double back heading for the exit  lenny
staggers to the chainlink sagging to his knees again as
faith passes within a few inches of him  he slips down
the chainlink into unconsciousness as her image is lost
in the pounding darkness

mace gets to him through the crowd and then whirls like a
cat as the posse arrives  she stands guard over him like
a rabid dog her 380 auto straightarmed and covering them
expertly  corto eyes her with hatred  the stitches on
his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his
last runin with her  he backs off

					corto
			   to the others

she dumps the box of tapes on the floor  she starts
stomping on them with one heel crunching several into
junk

lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up trying to
stop her push her away  they struggle for a pathetic
tragic moment

maces tone becomes more gentle  we see that her outburst
is beneath it all coming from a place of compassion

					mace
		lenny memories were meant to fade
		theyre designed that way for a
		reason

lenny seems to crumple  he knows he has to let go  but
it is so painful

					lenny
		have you ever been in love with

		love

mace gives him a look like jeez lenny are you dumb
sometimes

					mace
		yeah  lenny  i have

					lenny

ext  street and bonaventure hotel  night

1107  pm

it is the mother of all parties  in an aerial shot we see
there must be 100000 people jamming the closed streets of
downtown la  arc lights sweep the sky  there are two
outdoor bandstands with live music pounding  there are
lasers strobelights  people are literally dancing in
the streets if they can move at all  huge projection
video screens are set up all over the place

la is connected to other cities all over the world by
satellite sharing in the celebration in different time
zones  the excitement has been building all evening as
midnight sweeps across the country toward the west coast
it looks like a u2 concert 10 blocks long a multimedia
blowout

madness in the streets  and lenny and mace are stuck in
it  the civic cant move in the middle of this millennial
mardi gras  people swarm around pounding on the civic as
they go by or press their faces against the glass  it
may be the party of the century but it looks like the
middle of a third world revolution

					mace
		thats it  lets bail

and shes out of the car leaving the keys ignoring the
protesting horns behind her  and we see that shes
wearing a short black cocktail dress  lenny comes around
the car through the wild crowd  hes in his other suit
snappy

mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg  she pulls
the dress down and you cant see the gun hidden between
her upper thighs

in fact it looks like she couldnt be concealing a
quarter anywhere on her body  the dress is cut low at the
top and high at the bottom showing plenty of muscular
legs  high heels doing great things for her calves  her
braids now loose and full like a mane

lenny glances at mace and does a double take  he is
caught by a sudden realization

					lenny
		mace youre a girl

					mace
		good lenny  i can see why the
		detective gig didnt work out  come
		on

they push their way through the swirling mass of humanity
mace moving like a wedge security training coming to the
fore  the whole street is vacuumpacked with people
filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria an
unparted red sea of man and machine

they will move through the various strata of society as
they work their way in to the partys inner sanctum  it
is like all of la from poorest to richest compressed
into a few square blocks  there are cops everywhere
cops on motorcycles cops in cars cops in riot gear

lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance
metal detectors cops plus you have to have a 500
dollaraplate ticket

					lenny
		got your ticket

					mace
		no  they must have sent it to my
		beach house by mistake

follows  they pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
feet away his back to them

lenny whips out his cellular and recalls maxs number  he
hears the phone connect  it starts to ring

lennys pov as the crowd parts for a moment  he sees
palmer strickland talking to a cityhall type  lenny
turns away before strickland sees him

					lenny
			   to the ringing
			    phone
		come on max  come on buddy
			   two more rings

he looks around now  starting to feel the creeping edge
of panic  no tran  no max

					lenny
		alright  were going up

					mace
		and do what  take on his whole
		posse

					lenny
		i still got one ace to play  trans
		got what i want and ive got what
		he wants

lenny pulls the jeriko tape out of his breastpocket and
holds it up  mace just stares at him completely outraged

					mace
		thats the original  there are no
		copies

					lenny
			   not getting it
		exactly  thats why its a make
		able deal

mace gets very very close to lenny and her voice drops
to an odd cold lethalsounding growl

					mace
		look  that tape is a lightning bolt
		from god  its worth more than you
		more than me more than faith  you
		understand  it can change things
		things that need changing before we
		all go off the end of the road  and
		you do not have the right to use it
		for currency
			   lennys eyes are
			    wide
		you go you go alone  this is
		where i draw the line  i care about
		you lenny a lot more than you
		know which makes us both pretty
		stupid  but you pawn that tape you
		mean nothing to me

lenny doesnt know what to say  tough choice  he
clenches his jaw

and turns away  he strides into the crowd heading for
the lobby and the elevators

on mace watching him go  wanting to run and stop him
but shes said what there is to say  she turns away
desolate and churning with emotion  the moment lengthens
as she wrestles with it  you see her fury her sadness
and her protective instincts  her resolve fails her
ultimately she must protect him if she can

					mace
		ah hell  lenny

she turns running toward the lobby  and
boom  slams into him  he came back

lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm
closes her fingers on it

					lenny
		see that guy
			   pointing
		the one with the ramrod up his ass
		thats strickland

mace follows his look to strickland across the room

					lenny
		take it to him

					mace
		a cop  you want me to trust a cop

					lenny
		no  trust me

he unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to
her

					mace
			   nodding slowly
		oh boy
			   she takes a deep
			    breath
		what if youre wrong

					lenny
		then well be right where we are
		now

					mace
		yeah right  fucked

balcony  watching the sea of madness below  she comes
back in carrying an empty champagne glass  she grabs a
bottle off an endtable and upends it  empty  she hurls

loudly  but then she recognizes the wearer

turn her onto her back

she has been blindfolded  the wearer goes ssshhh  a
warning  like the hiss of a snake  our hands seize her
wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
the head of the bed

the hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set
of trodes  they are placed on her head the spidery
geckohand device almost disappearing in her black hair

lennys guts have turned to water  he is shaking his head
in horror

					lenny
		no no no

in pov we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow
plastic razor knife  the blade clicks out to its full
length

our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open
starting between her breasts and going down out of sight
she groans squirming away from the cold knife  the
killers hands open the material exposing her white body
which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory  the knife
deftly cuts off her panties

we unbuckle our pants and reach for her grasping her
hips pulling her to us

on lenny gagging  overcome by revulsion and horror
mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from
the tape

back to pov as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of
our pants and wrap it around faiths neck  faith begins
to pant in tiny rapid breaths  we tighten the belt
slowly

lenny tears the trodes from his head  he clutches his
stomach gasping for breath  carrying the playback deck
he staggers into the bedroom to the bed  he stares
wildly around the room

one whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored  in the mirror
he spots a shape on the floor beyond the bed  it is
covered in the bed sheet but it is clearly a human form
propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
stand  he missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
door

lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
the figure grasping the edge of the sheet with a
trembling hand  with horrified apprehension he pulls on
the sheet

it reveals the head and upper body of tran vo

the last thing he expected  lenny leans close and sees
that tran is breathing shallowly but his eyes are vacant
he looks like tick did

lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on  the
fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
nightmarish war like the sound of the world coming to an
end  but all lenny cares about is whats on the tape  he
hits play

the pov continues where it left off  faiths body lurches
with the wearers thrusts  his hand tightens the belt

lenny feels the climax building

faiths body shakes as the killer comes she cries out
herself in pain or is it  the killers hand releases
the belt  we see faith gasping for breath and moaning

suddenly the pov whips sideways to the mirrored closet
doors along one wall  in the mirror is a reflection of
the bed and on it faith  and on her

 max

pants down her legs pulled up around him  they are both
gasping for breath spent following their shattering
orgasms  he runs his hands over her sweatslick belly

lenny is stunned beyond his power to imagine  he does not
have the strength or the will to stop the tape

in pov maxs hands remove her blindfold  she looks right
at us still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure
maxs hands undo the handcuffs freeing her  she reaches
for us her eyes glittering with sated lust  we slump
forward onto her and her face fills the pov

					faith
		i love you

lenny is reeling with these revelations  his best friend
is the killer  and the woman he loved loves him  but the
tape is not over

the pov continues as maxs eyes whip around in response to
a sound behind them  the bedroom door is opening  tran
is standing there stunned  maybe the first time hes
ever been surprised in his life  what a way to start

like lightning we are off the bed snatching our 45 from
the night stand and whipping around putting the muzzle
right in trans face  we pull him roughly across the
room too stunned to resist

					tran
		youre going to die youre both
		going to fucking die

we slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the
muzzle of the gun right in his mouth a deadly gag  using
the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor
with his back to the mirror

our eyes whip to faith  she is freaking out  we see
maxs reflection in the mirror as he talks to her talking
fast

					max
		this piece of puke hired me to kill
		you baby  do you believe that
		isnt that right tran  you
		pinhead

					faith
		oh my god  i dont believe this is
		happening

					max
		believe it  now bring me the
		trodes baby  come on quick

					faith
		whatre you going to do

still in a kind of stupor she hands him the trodes  max
puts the trodes on trans head then pulls something out
of his pocket  it is a booster box  he plugs it into the
deck  he takes the gain control and cranks it all the way
up  hes setting up a cookoff  trans eyes go wide when
he figures that out starts to splutter

					faith
		you cant just kill him

					max
		im not  just a little poach job

					faith
		jesus

					max
		hey he was going to kill you  and
		this ratfuck paid to have iris
		killed to save his own sorry ass

tran freaks at that point but max jams the gun deep into
his throat up to the trigger guard choking off his
words

					max
		you shut the fuck up right now
		im gonna pull this fuckin trigger

kbang  faith shrieks thinking max shot him  but its
just the start of the fireworks outside remember all this
has already happened relative to lenny entering the
suite

					max
		look baby its now of never the
		guy is a known input junkie so a
		little od wont surprise anybody
		its the only way we can be
		together  you know its true

					faith
		my god

we dont know if her reaction is to the horror of what is
about to happen or to the realization that she has the
capacity to let it happen

					max
		heres how much i love you baby

she stares transfixed as max reaches for the deck  he
punches play  max puts his hand over trans mouth to
muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a
screaming chainsaw of static from hell  the screaming
outside the pandemonium give the moment a special
madness

the pov turns looking out the window staring fixedly
at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks  like the
fireworks inside trans head

the tape ends

lenny takes off the trodes  he is wrung out drenched
with sweat  we see that there is a figure standing in the
doorway behind him  lenny turns not surprised to see max
there with his 45 aimed at lennys chest  maxs surgical
gloves look incongruous with his tux

					max
		dont make any assumptions about our
		friendship lenny

lenny stands up slowly

					lenny
		no  i suppose not  i didnt know
		you were colorblind max

					max
		only way i could stand your ties

max moves up to him cautiously and takes the glock out of
lennys waistband

					max
		ill have that  glock 22  nice

					lenny
		wheres faith

					max
		i sent her to the party  i figured
		id wait up here until you killed
		tran

					lenny
		what makes you think im gonna kill
		tran

max looks out the window at the fireworks  waits for a
flash knowing that the bang will follow  keeping his own
45 on lenny he aims lennys glock at the catatonic tran
blam  one right into trans forehead  the crack of
thunder from the fireworks masks the sound

					max
		you just did

					lenny
		jesus

					max
		you know statistically thats the
		second most common word people say
		right before they die  shit being
		number one

max sticks lennys glock in his waistband keeping his own
45 trained on lenny  lenny knows the next bullet is for
him  he does what he does best talk

					lenny
		so i killed tran  then you ran
		in being on his payroll and shot
		me

					max
		thats pretty much the way it
		happened

cut to faith in the living room moving silently up to the
edge of the door frame  she looks through the crack
between the door and the jam  her pov max with the gun
on lenny

					lenny
		wait a minute  now im remembering
		i killed iris too didnt i

					max
		thats right  theyll find the
		original of her snuff clip in your
		apartment  the one i left for you
		at the club was a copy

					lenny
		was i a really busy guy  did i do
		tick too

					max
		you bet  did you like it

lenny drops the cutesy role

					lenny
		so why max why dya have to do
		iris  she never hurt anybody

cu faith reacting to this

					max
		picture it i feel like i gotta
		share this with somebody  its too
		perfect

					lenny
		i wont say anything

					max
		i know  so im working for this
		puke right  and he says hell pay
		me quite large to do the hooker
		but also i gotta do his bitch
		girlfriend cause she knows the whole
		score and shes totally out of
		control

lenny nods  starting to see it

					max
		only he doesnt know about me and
		faith  so i say to myself if i
		turn the job down he just gets
		somebody else  and i lose faith
		to coin a phrase  so to buy time i
		do the skank  i still gotta do
		something about tran i figure
		its him or me but i cant cap
		him without a chump to take the
		fall  and who better than his
		girlfriends loser exboyfriend a
		known criminal who has been seen
		hassling them in public numerous
		times

					lenny
		and who was regrettably also your
		best fucking friend

					max
		no plan is perfect lenny  hey
		cheer up  worlds gonna end in ten
		minutes anyway

					lenny
		you must be so pleased i followed
		your jellybean trail right here
		like a good little chump

					max
		you got froggy on me a couple times

cut to the underground garage where tick has been
cookedoff  we see max running his number on mace and
lenny  lenny buying it

					max vo
		i thought that riff about the death
		squad was pretty good  i hadda keep
		you from bringing the cops into it

and back again to real time

					lenny
		so there never was a death squad

					max
		naawww

					lenny
		just those two loosecannon cops
		running around covering their butts

					max
		yeah  pretty zany huh  all this
		shit caused by a random traffic
		stop  hey nothing means nothing
		you know that  look around the
		whole planets in total chaos  you
		gotta take what you can while you
		can  cause some shitbird can come
		up and put a fuckin 22 in the back
		a your head any second

cut to a brief violent flash from the jeriko tape spreg
shoots jeriko

					lenny
		how did you hook up with faith

					max
		this dink hires me a month ago to
		eyeball her right  but faith knows
		me from you right so she comes up
		to me and says hey max why you
		following me i say ill buy you
		a drink and explain and she says

					faith
		so do you enjoy watching me

max turns and sees her in the doorway

					max
		you were supposed to go downstairs
		baby

					faith
		i know  i dont always do exactly
		what im told
			   she walks slowly
			    toward them
		so i said do you enjoy watching
		me  and you said  come on max

					max
		i said yeah  id even do it for
		free

					faith
		uh huh  and i said thats good
		because i like the feeling of
		someone watching me  i acquired
		the taste from lenny

lenny looks between faith and max feeling like the
asshole of the western world  faith moves up close to
max  she puts her hands lightly on his shoulders
caressing them  max grins realizing she is 100 with
him

					max
			   to lenny
		and then she said since were
		going to be spending so much time
		together

					faith
		we might as well make the best of
		it

					lenny
			   crushed
		jesus faith

faith runs her hands appreciatively over maxs shoulders
and arms  then in an eyeblink she grabs his forearm in
both hands and deflects the gun

					faith
		lenny

lenny jumps in wrestling max for the gun  faith pulls
the glock out of maxs waistband and throws it across the
room

					max
		fucking bitch

blam  blam  max fires wildly trying to hit lenny who
is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face  faith
grabs maxs hair trying to pull him away

his hair comes off in her hands  a prosthetic wig
containing the squidnet array  maxs head is shaved to a
sinead oconnor stubble  he looks demonic grimacing with
effort as he struggles with lenny

he continues firing  the shots hit the mirrors  angles
of the reflected images of them shattering  faith
screaming reflected her face fragmenting into shards
the crystal chandelier shatters reigning glassy snow on
them from above

max is stronger and heavier than lenny but lenny has one
advantage max has managed to make him really angry
lenny gives a guttural cry and drives max backward into
the doorframe  they tumble together into the living room
falling together over the couch  lenny pounds maxs hand
against the glass coffee table shattering it  he forces
maxs hand along a glass edge cutting it and max drops
the gun  lenny reaches for it but max kicks it away a
splitsecond before his hand touches it  it skitters
under the couch out of play

max punches lenny brutally in the face then in the gut
and grabs him with both hands  he hurls him against the
wall  lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
punches from max  we feel the tide turning  lenny goes
down to one knee

max pulls out his knife and flicks it open  lenny throws
a lamp  max ducks and charges through  lenny spins away
from the downthrust

the knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade sunk into
the bone  lenny punches max in the throat and jerks away
pulling the knife handle out of maxs hand  max tackles
him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
onto the balcony  explosion of flying glass

max pulls a dazed lenny to his feet and rushes him
backward toward the railing  at the last instant lenny
twists with all his strength and spins max into the
railing using his weight against him  he pushes hard and
max topples

as he is going over max grabs lennys tie pulling him
over  max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
crowd his entire weight hanging from lennys tie  lenny
has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing and he
is being strangled by the tie

lenny is starting to black out  in agony he gropes with
his free hand to his own shoulder blade finding the
handle of the knife  he jerks it out of himself  max
sees it coming a split second before it happens

lenny slashes the knife across the tie just above maxs
hands

max takes the express elevator to hell  he hits 12
stories down on top of a video truck

lenny stands there panting bleeding down the back of his
jacket  faith runs to the railing and looks down  all
the strength goes out of her legs  she sags to the floor
fireworks continue to boom across the sky

lenny looks down at her gazing at the object of his
quest  she looks up at him her wet eyes seemingly at the
bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her

he turns and walks away  its hard  but he keeps
walking

								    cut to

ext  street  night

down below in the madness of the crowd we move with
spreg as he searches for mace  he sees her from behind
walking near one of the stages  he moves up behind her
aiming his pistol at the back of her head  she turns
and

 it isnt mace  another girl in a similar dress
spreg curses and looks around

engelman catches a glimpse of mace running  he points to
her position and spreg charges after her  he has his
baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
out of the way as he runs

mace sprints barefoot through the crowd pushing people
out of her way  strobelights from the stage and flashes
from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look

spreg fires at her  people drop their screams drowned
out by the pandemonium  the gunshots dont register above
the concussions from the fireworks  no one notices the
shootings  spreg continues to fire missing her as people
block his shots  mace wont fire back in the crowd

on spreg coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
tower  he has lost sight of her  he starts to reload his
pistol  mace comes up to him silently from behind the
tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
of her pistol

spreg comes around with a roar slamming the baton across
her forearm  her 380 clatters to the ground  mace
bodyslams him back against the steel tower smashing her
palm up under his chin  his head raps off the metal
mace is like a shepanther  she rips the baton out of his
hands and cracks him once across the windpipe  he drops
to his knees gagging and unable to breathe

a shot hits the metal spaceframe next to her head  she
spins to see engelman charging toward her  before he can
fire again she drops behind the kneeling gasping spreg
using him as a human wall  she clamps an arm around his
neck controlling him and pulls his tazer from his belt

she shoots engelman in the chest from 8 feet  he
convulses and drops instantly to the pavement flopping
like a fish  she holds the current on him while she goes
over and kicks his gun away

she takes engelmans cuffs from his belt  spreg glares at
her through the blood running into his eyes  she raises
the baton

					mace
		all the way down  right now

he slowly drops to the pavement face down  now that
shes got them both proned out she quickly handcuffs one
of spregs hands to one of engelmans

the crowd of partiers stares  cant believe what theyre
seeing  mace takes spregs cuffs and attaches his other
wrist to the base of the tower  thats when three lapd
cops in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
see a black girl crouching over two of las finest with a
police baton  the cops advance toward her

					mace
		wait  let me tell you whats going
		on here

the nearest shoots her with a tazer  she spasms and goes
to her hands and knees  one of the cops kicks her down
she cries out trying to explain but she cant get the
breath as the batons start to fall  the crowd around them
watches fascinated gasping

mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff spreg

					mace
		no  no

they crack her with their batons telling her to stay
down  another one kicks her in the stomach

a black kid in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
cops

and then they come out of the crowd one then three
then half a dozen  just normal people black white
latino people that cant watch this happen any more
they jump the cops swarming them wrestling them down
it becomes a brawl

then cops are running in from everywhere  we see the
trigger point of a fullscale riot  cops in full riot
gear with lexan shields push the crowd back clearing a
space  a helicopter xenon comes straight down from above
like the divine light of god

mace hugs herself at the center of it unable to get up
within seconds there are twenty cops there and more on
the way forming a human wall  they get the crowd settled
down

through the phalanx of riot cops comes palmer strickland
and several ranking officers  he surveys the scene
strickland looks down at mace and then at spreg and
engelman who are getting to their knees though still
handcuffed to each other and the steel tower  the beat
extends strickland unreadable face stern as moses
then

he points at the two prone cops

					strickland
			   to the nearest
			    officers
		these two are under arrest for
		murder

strickland looks spreg in the eye and holds up lennys
squid tape  spreg and engelman react knowing they are
over  the helicopter xenon gives the whole moment an
otherworldly quality  like they are in some celestial
court of judgment

					strickland
		get some medical attention for this
		woman

lenny pushes through from behind strickland  he runs to
mace and kneels next to her

					lenny
		are you okay

a trickle of blood runs down her face  she nods weakly
and reaches for him  they hug then they both wince in
pain  mace sees the cops running in to arrest spreg and
engelman  one of them unhooks spreg from the tower

					mace
		i got em lenny

engelman lunges grabbing a gun from the holster of the
closest cop  he waves them back with it  then puts it in
his mouth and fires

he topples against spreg spraying him with his spurting
blood  spreg clutches him lowering him to the ground
bathing in his blood  you see him going insane right at
that moment  his face is suddenly demonic

spreg the streetmonster cop rises in slow motion  his
glare is fixed on lenny and mace  he has engelmans gun
in one blooddrenched hand

lifting the dead weight of engelman by the handcuff he
begins to drag the body lurching toward mace  he keeps
the pistol down along his side  spreg exists at the
center of a circle of cops who dont know what to do  he
has a gun so they cant rush him  but hes a cop so they
cant shoot him  several officers shout at him to drop
the weapon  you barely hear them over the pandemonium of
the crowd the helicopter the fireworks

					lenny
		shoot

like a scene from a nightmare the blooddrenched spreg
completely unhinged lurches toward them  engelmans body
slides over the ground leaving a snailtrack of blood a
foot wide

					spreg
		you fucking nigger bitch

he raises engelmans pistol points it at her and

lenny throws himself across her turning his back to take
the fire and

pow pow pow  the lapd executes spreg in a hail of fire
he drops like a sack of cement

the smoke clears  lenny blinks realizing he is alive

he faints  mace shakes him thinking he is shot  he
opens his eyes

					lenny
		yeah what

cut to several minutes later  mace and lenny are being
escorted through the crowd by strickland and a number of
cops who part the rowdy mob before them

lenny and mace are both limping bruised cut up  lennys
arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound  they
support each other like two soldiers after a battle

mace sees faith faith escorted by a couple of cops
passing near them  she is in handcuffs and her eyes are
dull  mace turns back to lenny

					mace
		are we under arrest

					lenny
		naw  they just have to ask us a
		few questions for about six
		hours

they pass death with the plastic baby still in his
arms  life out of death in the endless continuum  lenny
pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past

they reach a row of police cars and an ambulance  the emt
guys run to lenny helping him painfully out of his suit
jacket  strickland motions mace toward a waiting squad
car  lenny sees

the clock mime who smiles at him and puts his hands at
midnight  we hear a roar passing through the crowd  a
huge chanting and cheering that becomes thunderous as
everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight

					crowd
		ten  nine  eight

lenny and mace look around the wonder of it sinking in

					crowd
		seven  six  five

mace and lenny let it wash over them the deliverance
from darkness

					crowd
		four  three  two  one  happy new
		year

the exultation of the moment flows through them as the
people lift their voices in a great cheer  balloons are
released confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard
couples grab each other and kiss passionately

					mace
			   grinning
		hey lenny  we made it

					lenny
		yeah  we did

she hugs him  then pulls back  friends yes  and
always  but theres that line that she cant cross  only
he can do that

					mace
		well
			   she shrugs
		get going  youre still bleeding

					lenny
		see you downtown

					mace
		yeah  see you there

tracking with lenny as he walks toward the ambulance
they open the back door for him  the walk is
hallucinatory with confetti falling like snow and the
hysteria of the crowd  he looks back at mace as the
paramedics help him up into the ambulance  the back doors
close

on mace watching him go  a cop gently takes her arm
opening the squad car door for her  she turns away her
face sad amid the exultation of the crowd  she gets into
the back seat  the door slams  strickland gets in next
to her  the driver starts the car  they start to move
and

there is pounding on the glass startling her and
the door is wrenched open
a hand comes in grabbing her arm pulling her out

lenny  his eyes are full of emotion
he grabs her in his arms fiercely and kisses her like
theres no tomorrow  she grabs his head and wont let him
break even if he wanted to which he doesnt

strickland in the car rolls his eyes and looks at his
watch  reflex  because if theres one time you dont
need a watch its

1201  am  january 1 2000

pull back and up as lenny and mace stay locked together
while the cops wait for them and the world begins again

					the end
