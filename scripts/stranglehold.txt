of piping as they move on

a smoking projectile spirals from the roof of chemco toward the crowd

				lt jackson

people scream and crash into each other in a scramble to safety

the projectile drops and rolls toward the crowd

soldiers frantically rip gas masks from backpacks gasping air from them

a few soldiers manage to share with civilians

stockton and richter laugh as richter shoves her forwardthey head toward the ship

a couple scummylooking seamen

leer at filmore as she boards grinning looking like they just crawled out of a
dumpsterthey trade snorts from a hip flask their drunken minds filling with
ideas

they remove the last chain mooring the ship and get on board

and then we see a helicopter   
		
a storage hatch door above the landing bar slowly opens

we see cooper exit the cramped storage hatchclothes dirty and torn

he quickly gets his bearings

when all is clear he looks out at the olympiapulling out

he jumps and grabs the metal gate around the deck pulling himself on board

ext ocean  night

the olympia heads out to sea malaysia retreating in the distance

int oil fuel bunker

cooper moves in and out of shadows below deck getting his  
bearings

he sees a sailor checking an oil tank readinghe leaves

cooper moves on

int galley

seated in the galley richter stockton and filmore have been served a seafood
dinner and wine

richter and stockton voraciously eat and drink while filmore just sits and listens


				stockton

the two men laugh

int lower deck  night

cooper stealthily moves through a darkened corridor

up ahead a door opens

cooper presses himself against the wallhidden by a shadow

two seamen exit the roomclosing the door behind them




				seaman
		i was a thousand miles from my old
		lady on a free port and just got paid
		ten grand in my pocket

after a few seconds they turn a corner and their voices trail off

cooper steps out of the shadows and carefully approaches the door

he puts his ear to the door hears nothing then slowly opens the door

int supply room

cooper flips the lightswitch

we see metal shelves filled with supplies

				cooper
		merry christmas

cooper quickly scans the shelveshe finds candles takes a fewhe continues to
rummage

he approaches a shelf containing cleaning supplies grabbing a can of drain opener

suddenlywe hear the sound of footsteps approachingcooper ducks

a seasick terrorist enters the supply room looking very nauseous

cooper watches as the terrorist looks for dramaminegroaning

				seasick
		oh my godim gonna puke
		where is that shit

he finds the first aid supplies

he pulls out a packet of tablets and fumbles with the wrapper

he takes the pills and gulps them down

burping he then staggers out of the room

when its clear cooper continues searching

he finds a box containing industrial coverallsthe same things worn by stocktons
men

he quickly grabs one and rips open the plastic

int new corridor

richter escorts filmore to her quarters

				richter
		i hope you enjoy your accommodations
		helen  i want you to enjoy your time
		here with us

he keeps his eyes on filmore

				richter
		we were just saying goodnight

without another word filmore turns and enters her quarters slamming the door
behind herself right in richters face

				richter
		guard her  with your life

richter heads down the corridor toward his own quarters

the guard looks miserable and seasick

behind a corner

unseen by all cooper watches the whole thing

he nods knowing where to get her when the time comes

he looks back behind him looks back at filmores door then back again

he heads back the way he came

int radio room

stockton enters the radio room checking in

int richters quarters

richter pours brandy into a snifter whistling popeye the sailor man thinking
back on the day beside himself with insane confidence

he laughs to himself as he swirls the brandy in the snifter before taking a swig

he scans the shelf of books before him selecting a copy of moby dick

				richter
		call megoddamn ishmael

he laughs and gets comfortable turning to page one sipping his brandy 
		
int filmores quarters

having turned down the lights filmore sits up in her bed

she gazes through the shadows exhausted but defiant

the ships steady swaying pacifies her  she fights to keep her eyes open in vain
they close

she opens them again but its no usethey close again

int corridor

the two randy seamen from earlier round a corner

they see the terrorist guard at filmores door

				randy seaman1

				randy seaman2
				 quietly
		looking a little green brother

				terrorist
		i dont know how you fucking do this

				randy seaman 1
		you have to get your sea legs
		hell i used to get sick all the time

				randy seaman 2
		its easy when the boat is going up

		time its enough to

the terrorist springs up and flees down the hallway hand to his mouth

the two seamen look at each other and smile drunkenly

int filmores quarters

filmore sleeps in dim shadows on her bed

the door to her quarters opens and closes with a creak

filmore bolts to attention

				filmore
		who is it

the two seamen stand like ghostly figures in the dim shadows

concealing her fear filmore gets up and faces them

				filmore
		i want you out of here at once

they push her back on the bed with malicious intent

				randy seaman 1
		begging your pardon maambut
		your wants dont quite enter into
		it

the lunge for her and she screams trying to claw herself free

they paw at hershe defends herself kneeing one hard in the ballsseverely
scratching the other				

this only fuels their determination

				filmore
		helllp

one grabs her covering her mouth stifling her cries

the other rips open her dress

she struggles in vain as the seaman fondles her

loosening his pants the other seaman works himself up
filmore shuts her eyes trying to block out the horror

suddenly the door to the cabin bursts open

a shadowy figure of a man rushes in pulling the rapist off of her

filmore falls to the floor struggling to see whats happening

one seaman pulls a knife

the man wrenches the seamans arm yanking it hard behind his back before wrapping
his arm around his neckyanking hard on the jawbreaking his neck

the other seaman charges and catches the blade square in the heart

the two seaman collapse to the grounddead

				filmore
		cooper

snap  richter turns on the light wiping his hands as if he just swatted a couple
of flies

				richter
		im sorry what did you say

filmore pales then says nothing

richter scrutinizes her for a second

				richter
		im sorry about this  im going
		to have to have a few words with
		stocktonhis men need a lesson 
		in manners

filmore looks very sexy and vulnerable at this moment

				richter
		perhaps youll find my quarters more
		to your liking

she looks up at him in disbelief

int boiler room

cooper slinks into the boiler room

he sees an engineer manning the complicated devices that regulate the flow of steam
to the turbine blades
cooper looks through a metal screen door and sees what he needsa can of gasoline

he silently enters the room and opens the gas can

he pours the lye into the canit sizzles as he plunks the candles in

he takes the container and begins to shake it

				voiceos
		hey

cooper whips around to see an engineer

				engineer1
		what the hell are you doing

				cooper
		oh hi im one of richters men

				cooper
		yeah  he wanted to make sure the 
		boats on deck are fueled

				engineer
		they are

cooper plays it cool

				cooper
		oh

he puts the gas can down

the other engineer approaches

				cooper
		good  im beat enough as it is

he smiles at the two stonefaced engineers  cooper feigns enthusiasm for the
boiler room and walks out in the middle of it

				cooper
		goddamn

the engineers follow him

				cooper
		thats one hell of an engine

he looks at the two men

				cooper
		far cry from the old outboard back
		home you know what i mean boys

the engineers begin to warm slightly

				engineer2
		damn straight

cooper focuses on a large heavily gauged metal contraption

				cooper
		this must power the turbines huh

				engineer1
		sorta yeah

cooper walks around like a kid in a candy storethe engineers eye him like hes an
idiot

				cooper
		shit what happens when this thing
		goes down

cooper looks over at an electronic panelthe auxiliary alternator

				engineer1
		dont worry junior were prepared
		for everything

cooper nods like a dolt smiling

pow  cooper smashes the first engineer in the facea lightning combinationhe
crashes to the ground

in the split second that follows cooper whips his  
foot around and connects with the 2nd engineers skullsending him to the ground

			cooper
		yeah youre prepared alright

cooper heads over to the gas canpicks it up

he heads over to a cabinet that has a coffee machine microwave etc on it

he rips open the drawers finding a steak knifea can opener

he opens the gas can with the openerturning it upside down and shaking it

a brown substance resembling slime plops out on the counter

he glances back over at the generator

int bridge

stockton enters the bridgemeeting his first mate

				stockton
		at least some of us are  no more drinking

stockton settles back for what he anticipates will be a routine night on the high
seas

ext sea  night

the tanker makes its way through the moonlit waters

tight on a radar

showing a blip northeast of the center of the grid

he grabs her closerviolently

then

booooommmm  a huge explosion is heardthe two feel a tremor as the lights go out

filmore takes her brandy glass and smashes it over richters face making a run for
it

this enrages richter who yanks her by her arm and slams her against the wallhe
pulls out his gun and shoves it hard into her temple

				richter

he stands back and kicks the door to filmores quartersit flies open

slime

booooommm

the alternator explodes ripping stockton and several others to pieces as richter
leaps out of harms way dragging filmore into the hall

a roaring fire ensues as the ship goes black again

cooper slowly comes tocompletely disorientedhe shakes his head like a punch
drunk boxer

pov of a blurry doublevision decksmitty descending in the other launch

cooper gets up staggers falls

smitty disappears from the deck descending

ext port hull

richter and filmore land in the water as richter shoves filmore toward the bow and
fires up the outboard motor

ext 	starboard hull	

smitty is descending when suddenly

cooper leaps and lands on the deck of the launch

smitty rams him attempting to send cooper overboard

struggling to keep his bearings cooper retaliates
smashing smitty in the face

the two struggle

one of the ropes on the stern begins to break as the men jar the craft violently
pow  smitty connects with cooperagain

but cooper whips around and backhands smitty before pasting him with a withering
combination

snap  the stern line gives way as the boat swings in a diagonal slamming against
the hull

smitty tumbles backwards grabbing the outboard to keep from falling

cooper dives and yanks the ripcord

the engine roars to life the propeller grazing smittys sternum

cooper yanks the engine up

the propeller slices open smittys chest as he crashes into the water
 
the launch slowly descends

ext port hull  night

richter and filmore speed away from the tanker as an explosion goes off on deck
sending debris through the air

ext starboard hull

cooper lets the last ropes free as smitty climbs back up on the boat as it pulls
out

he pounces on cooperwho breaks free

cooper smashes smitty with a backhand

smitty charges and pushes cooper over

coopers legs hook the edge as he falls in backwards

he struggles to get up but smitty shoves his face under trying to suffocate him

cooper swallows water suffocating

smitty clenches his teeth using all his might to keep cooper under

in a desperate surge of energy cooper lifts his legs and locks smittys neck
choking him

smitty struggles to break free

underwater

we see cooper grimace and jerk

snapsmittys jaw goes askew and his neck breaks

cooper flips him overboardthe two men crash into the water

cooper splashes to the surface coughing and struggles on	board lowering the
propeller into the waterthe boat speeds off

ext sea

richter and filmore round the stern as cooper approaches from the other side

richter speeds maniacallywind ripping through his hair

from around the stern comes cooper

richter raises his gun and fires at the fastapproaching boat

cooper ducks and aims his boat at theirs

bang bang bangclick click  richter is out of ammo

filmore charges at him trying to wrench him from the steering

he cracks her across the faceshe falls to the deck

cooper jams the boat into high gear and begins to run parallel to richter

richter slams his boat into cooperscoopers into his

then cooper does the unexpected

he leaps off the boatonto richters

coopers boat begins to spiral madly

cooper pounces on richterbut richter grabs cooper by the arm and hurls him onto
the deck			

like two sinewy springs nick legs send richter airborne
richter crashes back

the boat spins furiously out of control

bleeding from the corner of her mouth filmore reaches up for the nearest thin to
keep her steadythe steering wheel

the two men exchange withering blows as they stagger around the speeding craft

in a lastchance attempt at killing cooper once for all he launches into an
offensive that has coopers ears ringing

but cooper surgessending richter crashing to the stern
cooper staggers back and looks ahead

theyre speeding toward the center of the tankerno where to turn

cooper grabs filmore and yanks her up

				cooper
		jump

they jump from the speeding boat tumbling violently into the water

richter looks up for a second

wham the boat explodes in a fireball against the hull of the shipannihilating
richter

ext tanker

booommmm  more explosions on the tanker create a domino effect

cooper swims as hard as he can drags filmore toward their boat which spirals in a
circle

				cooper
		stay clear

cooper gets hold of a mooring rope on the of the dangerously spinning boat and
struggles aboard

he runs and kills the enginethe boat slows down

cooper circles and nears filmorehe reaches out for her

she extends her hand but he misses her

cooper juices up the boat and circles around her againthis time grabbing cooper
by the hand

he yanks her safely on board

the two collapse to the deck as a series of explosions on the tanker begin to
escalate

cooper fires up the boat and heads away from the tanker as

boooommmm the tanker is blown to smithereensits huge frame begins to sink 

ext coast guard cutter

a sentry flashes a powerful beam out toward the flaming sinking shipcatching
filmore and cooper their boat a little speck in the water

				sentry
		weve got survivorsabout fifteen
		hundred feet southwest

we then see jackson step out on deck and look through his binoculars

ext sea

jackson sees cooper and filmorevery much alive

jackson lowers his binoculars in disbelief smiling
	
				jackson

int room in dc

myers is on the phone

				myers
		are you absolutely certain
		stand by

he looks to myers and sen filmore

				myers
		its over

sen filmore drops his head in despair

				myers
		cooper got her out

filmore looks up as if the clouds parted to reveal heaven itself




ext sea

passing floating barrels of the binary chemicals  they race away from the flames
and toward the rising sun  on the horizon the coast guard cutter approaches

a wounded exhausted cooper and filmore trade looks  more than gratitude there is
an attraction in their eyes  but neither really knows how to express it  

				cooper
		well filmore

				filmore
		well cooper

				cooper
		looks like youre not going to make
		that dinner after all

				filmore
		i guess not cooper 

she looks out at dawn spreading across the horizon

				filmore
		but you cant say we didnt try

the boat heads off into the distance
