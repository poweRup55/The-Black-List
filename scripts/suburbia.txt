it started with a traffic argument escalated to the firing of a 
legally carried handgun ending with the death of the man it was 
aimed at gordon riedhale claimed he couldnt escape an attacker 
who was punching him in the head concealed carry instructors 
say its that fear

chip

must make a split second judgment call

gary places twofifty on the counter and him and chip walk back 
to their patrol car as they leave the parking lot they see tim 
sitting on the side of the building

chip

hockey with two empty beer cans on the ground he shoots one at 
the dumpster and the other at tim
