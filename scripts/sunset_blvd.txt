  a29    gillis

          he stands flabbergasted  a new noise attracts his
          attention  the creak of a heavy metalandglass
          door being opened  he turns and sees

  a3o    the entrance door of the house

          there is authority in the gesture of his white
          gloved hand as he motions gillis inside

                            gillis
                 look maybe id better take my

                 for me  okay

          gillis enters


  a31    int norma desmonds entrance hall

          it is grandiose and grim  the whole place is one of
          those abortions of silentpicture days with bowling
          alleys in the cellar and a builtin pipe organ and
          beams imported from italy with california termites
          at work on them  portieres are drawn before all the
          windows and only thin slits or sunlight find their
          way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
          burning



          gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
          staircase  it has a wroughtiron rail and a worn
          velvet rope along the wall

                            max
                      from below
                 if you need help with the
                 coffin call me

          the oddity of the situation has caught gillis
          imagination  he climbs the stairs with a kind of
          morbid fascination  at the top he stops undecided
          then turns to the right and is stopped by

                            womans voice
                 this way

          gillis swings around

          norma desmond stands down the corridor next to a
          doorway from which emerges a flickering light  she
          is a little woman  there is a curious style a
          great sense of high voltage about her  she is dress
          ed in black house pyjamas and black highheeled
          pumps  around her throat there is a leopardpat
          terned scarf and wound around her head a turban of
          the same material  her skin is very pale and she
          is wearing dark glasses

                            norma
                 in here  i put him on my massage
                 table in front of the fire  he
                 always liked fires and poking at
                 them with a stick

          gillis enters the shot and she leads him into


  a32    norma desmonds bedroom

          it is a huge gloomy room hung in white brocade which
          has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
          torn in a few places  theres a great unmade gilded
          bed in the shape of a swan from which the gold had
          begun to peel  there is a disorder of clothes and
          negligees and faded photographs of oldtime stars
          about

          in an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn
          ing  on the massage table before it lies a small
          form shrouded under a spanish shawl  at each end on
          a baroque pedestal stands a threebranched cande
          labrum the candles lighted

                            norma

                 it specially lined with satin
                 white or deep pink

          she picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
          color  from under the shawl flops down a dead arm
          gillis stares and recoils a little  it is like a
          childs arm only black and hairy

                            norma
                 maybe red  bright flaming red
                 gay  lets make it gay

          gillis edges closer and glances down  under the
          shawl he sees the sad bearded face of a dead
          chimpanzee  norma drops back the shawl

                            norma
                 how much will it be  i warn you

          she leads him into


  a33    the huge living room

          it is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
          red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
          from the mark of zorro set  along the main wall
          a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years
          on the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of

          is a painting  a california gold rush scene
          carthay circle school  we will learn later that
          it hides a motion picture screen

          one corner is filled with a large pipe organ and
          as norma and gillis enter there is a grizzly
          moaning sound  gillis looks around

                            norma

          norma has led him to the card tables which stand
          side by side near a window  they are piled high
          with papers scrawled in a large uncertain hand

                 valentino said there is nothing
                 like tiles for a tango

          she opens her arms



                            gillis
                 not on the same floor with

          they start to tango  after a moment 

                            norma

                            gillis

          norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair
          and tosses them away

                 up all the tickets for a perfor
                 mance at the metropolitan and sat
                 there listening to la traviata
                 all by himself  he was afraid of
                 catching cold


                            norma
                 hold me tighter

                            gillis
                 a little

                            norma
                 is it funny that im in love
                 with you

                 with you all along

          they dance on  gillis is acutely embarrassed
          the camera slowly pulls back pans past the faces
          of the musicians who play on with a rather overe
          mphasized lack of interest  finally it winds up
          on max behind the buffet  he stands watching gillis
          a faint trace of pity in his eyes

                       and brings out a

                 that you dont want me to love
                 you  is that it

          gillis doesnt answer  norma slaps his face and
          rushes from the room and upstairs

          gillis stands paralyzed the slap burning his cheek


  c1o    the top of the staircase and corridor

          norma rushes up the last few steps down the corridor
          and into her bedroom banging the door  move the
          camera toward the closed door centering on the
          gougedout lock


  c11    gillis in the big room

          he still stands motionless  he glances around fur
          tively to see if his humiliation has been observed


  c12    the orchestra

          the musicians are playing away  they have turned
          their eyes away from gillis rather too ostentatious
          ly for comfort


  c13    gillis

          his eyes move over toward


  c14    max

          he is subtler than the musicians  he appears very
          busy at the buffet putting empty bottles and used
          glasses on a tray  he walks across the room with
          them


  c15    gillis

          he starts slowly out  as he does so his long gold
          key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
          and holds him for a second of additional embarrass
          ment  he yanks it loose and walks with as much
          nonchalance as he can muster to


  c16    the hall

          crossing towards the coat closet gillis throws a
          look upstairs  then he pulls the vicuna coat from
          its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
          entrance door  he opens the door on the darkness
          of the courtyard

          forward then stands       going  i just had to get
          for a while breathing      out of there  i had to be

          balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh
          where the slap still a     again  i thought of artie

          ward with a great          be a new years shindig
          sense of relief           going on in his apartment

          	fun on the cuff

          gillis walks to the
          street which is dark
          and empty  he starts
          down sunset in an
          easterly direction
          a car passes  he
          tries to thumb a
          ride without success
          however the second

          car a florists
          delivery wagon stops
          gillis jumps in and the
          car drives off

          it is the most modest oneroom affair jam packed
          with young people flowing over into the miniature
          bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette  the only
          drink being served is punch from a pressedglass
          bowl  but everybody is having a hell of a time
          most of the men are in slacks and sweaters and only
          a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
          party dress

          abe burroughs sits at a small guestfestooned piano
          and sings tokio rose  by the door a group of young
          men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng rinso
          white or dentyne chewing gum or something similar
          in the manner of a bach choral  artie green a dark
          haired pleasantlooking guy in his late twenties
          is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl

          the door behind some of the singers is pushed open
          jostling them out of their places  in comes gillis
          his hair and face wet the collar of his vicuna coat
          turned up  artie stops conducting but the commer
          cial goes right on

          gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
          artie push their way into the room

                            artie
                 give me your coat

                            gillis

                            gillis

                            artie
                 come on

          artie starts peeling the coat off gillis  its
          texture takes his breath away

                            artie
                 what is this  mink

          he has taken the coat  he looks at gillis standing

                 close but no cigar

          gillis stands embarrassed while artie rolls up the
          vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book
          shelf

                            artie

                 wheres the bar

          the two make their way toward the punch bowl  its
          a little like running the gauntlet for gillis  there
          are whistles and stares of astonishlnent at his tails
          when they reach the punch bowl artie picks up a
          halffilled glass and fills it

                            gillis
                 good party
