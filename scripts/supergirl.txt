ext space	

the camera pulls back   

int argo city

and reveals the inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches the city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes

the camera roams through the city observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model

					teacher
				and now who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for kryptonian covalent 
				bonding

the five year olds eagerly raise their hands the teacher points to one

child
				the cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared

the teacher smiles

teacher
				well maybe that was a bit too easy

the camera roams on through the city following the sound of a strange ethereally beautiful singing the camera discovers the source of the sound an artist sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a matterwand the wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy the artist whose name is zaltar sometimes whistles along in counterpoint 

a small girl is watching him with fascination her name is kara and she is seven

behind her the dome which encloses the city marks the edge of the limbo outside

kara
what are you making

	zaltar
its going to be a tree i think




kara 
whats a tree

	zaltar
its something they have on earth you know
 where your cousin went

	kara 
where is earth

	zaltar
didnt you study sixdimensional geometry in 
school

	kara
yes i know the equationsi just cant see it in 
my head

zaltar laughs

					zaltar
				even i have trouble with that sometimes earth is in 
outer space and were in inner space 

	kara
i dont understand

	zaltar
wait till youre older here  watch this 

zaltar takes a small omegahedron out of his pocket and holds it in his hand

					zaltar
				this is one of the four power sources of the city 
i borrowed it from the guardians look what i 
can do with it 

zaltar touches his matterwand to the omegahedron and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light he touches his wand to the tree sculptureand the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork he carefully puts down the
omegahedron at his feet takes a small flask from his belt and drinks

				zaltar
			you see a tree is a living thing

				kara
			can you create life

	
zaltar
				no no just the illusion of life a kind of 
halflife maybe a pale shadow of the real 
thing but it is lovely the way the light plays 
over the surface   

a womans voice can be heard calling in the distance

womans voice 
kara kara

kara calls out in reply

					kara 
im here mother

karas mother alura appears through the lacey architecture of the city

alura
				kara you shouldnt be so near the edge 
without a grownup

	kara
im sorry mother

	zaltar
i was keeping an eye on her


alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately showing shes not really angry together they watch zaltars latest sculpture flickering with the play of inner light and shadow

alura
				thank you zaltar but she has to obey the rules

zaltar takes another swig from his flask and lowers his voice confidentially

zaltar
				you and your husband have been kind to me 
alura i have something to tell you im going 
away soon

	alura 
but where


zaltar bends down to kara and hands her his matterwand

zaltar
				put your fingers there kara and press hard

she does and the wand makes a horrible squawk kara laughs with delight

zaltar
				good now go make something pretty

kara scampers away hardly able to believe her good fortune and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby zaltar speaks to alura in a low confidential voice

zaltar
ive discovered a new way into the phantom 
zone

	alura
but the phantom zone is for criminals

	zaltar
its big and empty im tired of limiting myself 
to  argo city i want to do something new im 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy 
glittery stuff

zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him

alura
				but zaltaryou founded the city its yours we 
were all just refugees from krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here to the inner dimension 
you cant abandon us now you have a responsibility to us

in the background kara has been modeling a spiky insectlike creature now she suddenly finds the omegahedron on the ground beside her she doesnt stop to wonder how it got there from beside zaltars feet she simply picks up the omegahedron and touches it to the spiky creature the creature suddenly flicks its wings and comes to life unnoticed by the adults kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head glittering as if it were made of diamonds

zaltar
im an artist alura my work comes first other 
people come second

	alura
how can you create beautywith a selfish heart
the spiky insectcreature flies closer and closer around the little girls head buzzing angrily her look of delight turns to fear she tries to shoo the creature away it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city

the spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it with a giant whoosh all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind she cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother the omegahedron is swept toward the hole as well kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane

zaltar 
karathe power source

kara reaches for it but it is too far from her and the omegahedron is sucked out into infinity by the wind zaltar picks up the matterwand from where kara dropped it and touches her with the wand she is instantly held fast zaltar pulls her back inside he gives her to her mother alura then zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir 

the wind dies down and all is silent except for the quiet sobbing of kara in her mothers arms zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly

kara
				im sorry i didnt know

					zaltar
				it was my fault you arent old enough to use 
the wand i shouldnt have given it to you

	alura
but the power source zaltar

	zaltar
it couldnt be helped the city will have to make do 
with three

	alura
but what will happen

	zaltar 
the guardians will be angry they may even 
send me to the phantom zone you see i didnt 
really have permission to borrow it i must go 
explain to them

zaltar hurries off nervously the camera holds on karas face as she senses this may be her last sight of zaltar

ext a springtime meadow  usa  day under titles

a beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower the blondes name is selena she is our ideal image of the girl next door who grew up into a dynamite lady

her current boyfriend follows along behind her lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth

selena 
over here george its the perfect spot nice view

george sets down the wicker basket and selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food she unpacks fried chicken hardboiled eggs potato salad cold beer and a big rich creamyfrosted devils food cake

					george
				you sure are a good cook selena man that looks 
too pretty to eat

	selena
better eat it quick it wont look too pretty when its 
all covered with ants

she hands him a chicken drumstick and a hardboiled egg

					george
				selena ive been thinking its time i settled 
downand i dont know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you

selena
				why george are you proposing

					george
marry me selena the hardware store doesnt bring 
in much now but

selena
				georgei thought youd never ask

a shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up with a loud plop and a spatter of icing the omegahedron falls into the middle of the chocolate cake

george
				what the heck is that

they look up in the boughs of the tree overhead and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth

selena
a squirrel frisbee

selena reaches out and picks up the omegahedron it comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface as if made of some substance which repels other kinds of matter

selena holds the shining omegahedron in her hand and examines it turning it around and around as if hypnotized her face takes on a new expression almost as if the simple wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe

selena
				thats funny id swear i know just what this is 
but ive never seen it before

she stands up and walks across the checkered cloth in a beeline for the pickup truck

george
				hey where you going

					selena
				     calling over her shoulder 
ive got things to do

	george 
what about my proposal

	selena 
         dismissively 
call me next week maybe we can have lunch

she gets in the pickup and drives away

george 
hey my truck

 kara s face

she is ten years older now a young lady almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen

alura
				      voice over
				but kara you are too young to go

another angle argo city dimmed

they are in the assembly amphitheater of the city where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen kara is in the centre of the ring with adults seated in scattered rows around her her parents zorel and alura are standing in front of her

kara
				i am almost an adult this is what i want

zorel
				but kara no one has ever gone from here to 
earth the journey is dangerous

	kara
it was my fault we lost the power source

	zorel
years ago and it was zaltar who stole it

	kara
i allowed it to escape the city

	alura
ever since we told you how your cousin superman 
was sent there as an infant all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place

	kara
yes i do want to go but someone must go our 
scanning shows the power source has finally 
reached the earth it could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back

	zorel 
superman will return it

	kara
why havent you been able to contact him he should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago he 
may be dead
zorel
but what can you a mere girl

	kara
ill have super powers there like him we cant wait 
our lights are fading look around you when i was a 
child the city was bright and shining look at it now

zorel and alura sigh there is no denying that the brilliance of argo city has been much dimmed since kara was a little girl

					alura
				what do your teachers think

zorel looks around the circle a beautiful woman speaks

					teacher
				it would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier but the city cannot last much 
longer without the power source it is her future shes 
fighting for zorel

	zorel
very well let it be done

alura embraces kara emotionally fighting back the tears kara too is struggling to control her own emotions

kara
				dont worry mother ill be all right ive studied 
the transmissions from earth i know their customs

kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents

alura
				but they are such strange unstable people

					kara
				then i will learn to act strange like them

kara holds up a small handbag inside we glimpse red and blue material

					kara
				i have made clothing and copies of their money i 
will be fine




her father puts his hand on her shoulder 

					zorel
				be brave my daughter be wise

					kara
				as brave as my father as wise

they embrace briefly kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city

 instantly transparent bubble forms around her

her parents watch as she floats away

she passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the city and off into an infinity of space

montage the journey of kara inside her sphere from the inner dimension to our world

her sphere moves from blackness to a dark green limbo the atmosphere thickens around her soon it is unmistakably water and she is heading toward the light above a fish darts past with a flash of silver the sphere rushes upward faster and faster it breaks the surface of the  water kara springs free of the bubble which disappears she is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin superman

she lands on a nearby beach
 
ext earth  beach beside the sea sunrise

she looks around her feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world

kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet to her astonishment she 
crushes it to powder in her hand and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath

she looks down at her feet so firmly planted on the ground she rises a few inches into the air and reacts with amazement then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing with a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward

ext high above the earth  day

kara loops and rolls swoops and circles laughing with sheer delight





ext high above mountain meadows  horses  day

kara swoops down at a herd of horses the herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away

cut to
 ext mountaintop  day

kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view the she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow she stares at it with awe

insert microscopic shot of snow crystals in all their infinite variety and beauty

back to scene  day

kara stands up smiling she flies into the air again

ext forest  day

she lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom these trees are much more impressive than zaltars imitation back in argo city she hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles she sees a baby deer hopelessly tangled in the long canes she shoots rays of heat vision from her eyes and slices through the tough stems the fawn scrambles free and scampers off into the forest kara watches it with a benevolent smile she removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape

ext mansion  garden party

a big impressive house somewhere in the middle west people mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors doeuvres off silver trays from passing waiters all the quests have a name tag on like at some kind of conference

selena the blonde who discovered the power source is circulating among the quests she has changed since we saw her last no longer the girl next door she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels she walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed and graciously accepts the homage of the quests a smile a nod a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention but we notice odd details of the party the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols at the refreshment table there is a big tenfoot wicker sculpture of a female goat covered with paper flowers and the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them bianca a tall coldeyed brunette in black silk dress whispers in selenas ear 

bianca
				be careful nigel is going to try something



					selena
				dont worry about old nigel i can take care of him 
hes just a sore loser

an elderly man in a threepiece pinstripe suit grabs her elbow

elderly man
				i dont want much selena i have simple tastes

selena 
what do you want

	elderly man 
western europe

	selena
im sorry but i already promised bianca she could 
have switzerland you know how she loves to ski

	elderly man
no problem she can have it i hate mountains

selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with bianca and strolls over to a sourfaced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette

selena 
cheer up nigel its not the end of the world

nigel
				it may well be i know how you won that election 
selena you cant fool me

	selena
i have plans nigel you could come with me
im going places

					nigel
				youre not going anywhere except back to nowheresville
youre too impatient selena look around youall 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship
some of their families have been in the craft for generations 
you cant join and take over our whole organization in a few months

selena smirks at him selfconfidently

selena
				i just did because i have the power

					nigel
				youre going to pay a terrible price the power of shadow 
is tricky use it too much and it takes over 

nigel drops his cigarette stubs it out on the lawn and takes out his platinum cigarette case

selena
biancas taught me all need to know ill be safe as 
long as i dont go too far 

	nigel
cigarette

he holds the shiny mirrorlike cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection

insert surface of the cigarette case selenas reflection she is still the glamorous beauty but looming behind herinvisible to ordinary eyesis a dark eerie shape of something hideous

back to scene

quick as a cat selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery all traces of the shadow behind her have disappeared

					nigel
				sorry forgot you were trying to quit


nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently

selena
				nigel get out of here and dont come slithering 
back
nigel shakes his head

nigel
				you need me selena im the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate

	selena
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower now 
burn rubber

nigel locks eyes with her

nigel
				make me

he takes another insolent sip of champagnearid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass

nigel spits out the champagne and drops the glass everyone laughs at him


nigel
				balefire on you selena

					selena
				    grinning
				you scorpios can never take a joke

all quests have fallen silent staring at the altercation between the two of them 

					nigel
				you think you are on top now well there is someone 
coming to challenge you i saw it in the cards this morning

	selena 
throw him out

two burly waiters seize nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking

nigel
				you wont last a year selena the cards dont lie

the crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation 

bianca stands up on a chair the crowd falls silent
	
					bianca
				lets not let one rotten apple spoil the party i give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the circle selena

applause selena steps up onto a raised dais and holds up her hands in an invocational gesture

selena
				thank you sisters and brothers of the craft it is a 
great honor you have given me and i will try to be
worthy and when my secret plans are revealed 
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when nigel was 
our leader

more applause one of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuelpot under a chafing dish the fuelpot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue  

					selena
				and now i call upon the great motherthe spirit 
of nature  to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year

a woman in the audience screams everyone looks where she is pointing the huge tenfoot tall wicker statue bursts into flames

panic and pandemonium some of the quests run for safety others try to throw water onto the blazing torchlike statue but in vain selena frowns at the spectacle and without a word turns and stalks into her house

int selenas house  living room

the camera follows selena through the french doors and into her large living room on one wall is a huge ornate goldframed mirror covered with a thick veil

selena sits down in front of a large hearth and opens a secret compartment in the floor she reaches inside and removes a finely wrought metal box in the shape of a gargoyle and a pack of cards she puts the gargoyle box on her lap and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns

the elderly man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard someone runs by in the bg with a coil of garden hose the elderly man walks over to selena timidly

elderly man 
is this nigels doing

selena
				its a warning thats for sure

					elderly man
				maybe it was just an accident

					selena
				     mysteriously
				theres no such thing as an accident everything has 
meaning if you can read the signs

the elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards selena has cast on the floor

elderly man
				then what does it mean




selena shrugs and puts aside her cards

selena
				dont ask me i cant read the signs worth spit

ext campus

a cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds the nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there

slowly the cat inches along the branch suddenly a beam of light hits the branch it bursts into flame and falls down to the ground saving the birds from any future danger the cat turns around like a felon caught in the act runs down the tree trunk and scampers away

int class

mr danvers

a tear of selfpity and homesickness wells up in lindas eyes and runs down her cheek she steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face she suddenly hears aluras voice in her mind

the sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off leaving linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight

the soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall

selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor her huge silk cape billows around her making her seem largerthanlife nurses orderlies patients scatter to get out of her way her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what shes doing there she knows exactly where shes going to she turns a corner and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her

int ethans room day

a temporary love potion

ethan

					selena 
				its the truth in twentyfour hours youll forget all

ethan reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance

					ethan
				then im not the only one who saw her you did too

selena pulls his hand away from her cloak
selena
				yes yes i saw the whole thing how could you be 
interested in that puny little girl

selena 
                continuing

selena removes the gargoyleshaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid the omegahedron inside spins and sends out a powerful force which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside the door slams shut selena closes the lid of the coffer and turns to ethan

selena
				now you see who youre dealing with

ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her backing toward the window

selena at the bed discovers his sketch of supergirl on the piece of cardboard

selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling the men stare at the ce1ling astonished ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door selena turns to look at ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge the security men run into ethans bathroom slamming the door behind them

selena ducks out into the corridor

int hospital corridor

ethan is running away down the corridor frightened patients peek out of their rooms the nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as selena emerges into the corridor

ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a heartlung machine down from the surgery selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the heartlung machine

selena
				power of shadowseize him

the heartlung machine comes to lifeits lights flash its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like medusas hair its wheels turn around and it chases  ethan down the corridor selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph ethan looks behind sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm a cart of surgical instruments rolls out of a closet in front of him its scalpels standing up and pointing at him quivering eagerly blocking his path

ethan dives through a swinging door to his left

int operating theatre

a team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table ethan runs through in the background the surgeons continue with their work the heartlung machine wheels through after him followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets

the surgical team doesnt look up from their work

several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after ethan and the other apparatus one of the nurses finally looks up

nurse
				doctor i think you re going to have a gas 
problem

	doctor
i shouldnt have had the cabbage at lunch




int xray room

ethan bursts into an empty surgical xray roomthe pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind he slams the heavy leadlined door and bolts it shut

he hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door he leans against the door panting his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat suddenly with a whir of motors the giant multiarmed cat scanner behind him comes to life its lights glowing and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him

ethan yells runs across the room climbs on a gurney rips a metal grill off the wall and dives into the air conditioning duct

int duct

ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him

selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away ducking and dodging the rain of javelins she turns too quickly and the gargoyle box slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel selena moans with despair and pauses reluctant to leave without the box this is the opportunity supergirl needs the fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around selenaeffectively imprisoning her

selena 
youre late

	eld erl y man
the president was giving a speech i couldnt just 
walk out

	selena
youre more afraid of the president than me

	elderly man 
no of course not

int selenas living room candlelit night

waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party bianca is talking to erica a redhaired female dwarf a proud barefoot american indian woman in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular young black man in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry nigel is sulking in the bar his face covered with tannisroot ointment

selena enters with the elderly man in the banker pinstripe they all form a circle in the centre of the room

					selena
				let us begin i invoke the rule of seven

others in unison 
the circle is complete

	nigel
you better have a pretty good explanation for 
this selena

	selena
we are in great danger a being has come to earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the craft

	indian woman
but superman has been away

	selena
it is not superman i speak of but his cousin kara she 
knows we exist

	elderly man
then she must be destroyed

	nigel 
how did she find out about us

	elderly man
that is unimportant now that she knows she will 
become curious and learn more when she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecutionshe will 
try to stop us

	bianca
we must destroy her first

	erica
but how can we destroy her

selena
				by the rite of ultimate power one person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all

nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at selena

nigel
you you want to take our power for yourself

selena reacts calmly speaking in low modulated tones as if to an overstimulated child

					selena
				nige1 you know the one who takes on ultimate 
power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit

selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly

					selena
	 			      continuing
				which of you is willing to make that sacrifice

					nigel
				you would you revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power

	selena
maybe youd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself 
nigel

	nigel
why get rid of her at al1 youve used the coffer 
of shadow too much  it is beginning to rule your heart

	selena
nonsense

nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror

for an instant selena sees her reflection in the mirror behind her looms the dark evil presence invisible to the others in the room and much larger than when she glimpsed it at her garden party

then bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it bianca stands challenging nigel daring him to try again selena looks at the gargoyleshaped coffer of shadow sitting beside her hearth it too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital selena wonders for a beat if maybe nigel is right can the shadow be ruling her

bianca 
enough quibbling let us vote

they all draw their sacred whitehandled knives out of concealment in their clothing nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward then one by one the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward they all look at nigel his shoulders sag with dejection

 					selena
				i invoke the rule of seven do you agree

nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence 

nigel
i have no choice

his knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward everyone joins hands in the circle a fire springs to life on the hearth someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue slowly the heavy opulent living room begins to change the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks the walls start to melt away outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon



the house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins the smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward the only thing remaining of selenas house is the hearth and the coffer of shadow selena stands up and walks out of the centre of the circle toward the coffer she opens the lid she pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the coffer

he stands up and takes her hand

ethan 
before you go

	supergirl

	ethan 
just one kiss for old times sake


	supergirl
and you can see how you feel about me right

	ethan
yes

she closes her eyes and parts her lips slowly their lips come together and touch then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking but before either one of them can go one step further ethan disappears with a flash of blinding white light a cloud darkens the sun and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by galeforce winds selenas laughter can be heard from somewhere far away

					supergirl
				ethan

supergirl flies into the air

ext tropical island sunset sky above island day

supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed searching for ethan and selena she hovers like an eagle for a moment then speeds straight upwards

ext above the ocean day

supergirl flies back to north america faster than she has ever flown before

ext above midvale day

supergirl zeros in on selenas house like an exocet

ext selenas front lawn

supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door ready for anything but what she finds the front door is ajar she pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges she walks slowly inside

int selenas mansion front hallliving room

supergirl looks around the house seems deserted and drastically neglected cobwebs hang over everything the dust has the thickness of a hundred years moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries rats cavort along the baseboards bats sleep in the chandeliers in the living room supergirl finds bianca crouched in a corner gibbering mindlessly bianca too has changed she is dressed in rags and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles when she sees supergirl she cries with fright

supergirl
				hey take it easy i wont hurt you

bianca
				i thought it was her coming back spared me 
but i thought   maybe changed her mind 
nigel warned us wouldnt listen to him

	supergirl
what are you talking about wheres selena

bianca
				no dont want to know shes bad dont go near her
				hurt you

supergirl 
i have to find her tell me

supergirl looks into biancas eyes with her calm heroic gaze and bianca comes somewhat to her senses bianca points to the adjoining bar supergirl walks over warily and sees five golden cages suspended among the bottles nigel and the four remaining members of the circle are imprisoned in them shrunken but alive nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel he sees her and calls out

nigel
				supergirl shes waiting for you on taliesen mountain 
stop her before its too late

supergirl gets a look of determination on her face she turns and flies out through the french doors and heads straight up into the air

int selenas new house a mountaintop palace 

ethan is in a dark shadowy place bound to a stake with stout cords sticks of wood are piled all around his feet selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power she looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before she offers him a glass of water to drink but he turns his head away violently

					ethan
				im wise to your tricks lady

					selena
				i could force you

					ethan
				if that worked you wouldve done it already no 
you want me to drink it of my own free will well 
let me tell you sweetheart itll be a cold day in hell 
before i fall for that one again

	selena
go on  talk big ill soon have you purring like a kitten


she puts the glass of water in a basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above there is a straw in the glass at such an angle that ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible

selena
				youve been without water for a whole day lets 
see how thirsty you get in a week

	ethan 
you vicious

	selena
careful dont make me angry i start fires when im angry


she glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away

the camera follows her revealing that she has been talking to ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room her new house is enormous where before she lived in a mansion now she dwells in a palace the fireplace is seven feet high the living room floor is wide as a football field and the french windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the north transept of chartres cathedral selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butlers pantryeach now the size of a basketball court

back in the fireplace ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby he pokes the straw with his forehead the glass swings slightly the glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm he gauges the swing of the glass and at the precise moment grabs for it with his mouth he catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done he bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth

the glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash leaving ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin he leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders a droplet of blood falls into his hand he drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it he grins and sighs with relief then spits to clear his mouth slowly he saws at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand one by one the strands part

ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps he quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace he looks around the mammoth room the coast is clear he spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth and dashes out of the doors
to the garden




ext selenas house garden  conservatory

ethan sees a green plastic garden hose which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas ethan remembers that he is very thirsty he picks up the hose rinses out his mouth hurriedly and then takes long desperate gulps of the water behind him he hears selenas laughter he drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig

insert ethans pov

the same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time the plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours at the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding selena she approaches him seductively fully confident of her power as she comes nearer the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos selena speaks and her voice is a closemiked throaty purr

selena
				i told you id win

back to scene

ethan is held by the spell of her magic and yet there is part of him that still resists you can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him and then give in as she comes closer and i touches him with her hand a zap of energy passes between them at her touch

selena
				kiss me
	
he embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss he is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply she rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure

dissolve to

ext taliesen mountain selenas new house day

supergirl flies over selenas new house for the first time we can see the enormousness of it 
a grotesque towering monstrosity that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape

ext garden behind selenas new house day

supergirl lands and walks toward the towering french doors of the living room but something distracts her she turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right


int conservatory

supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants she walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool in the bottom of the shallow pool she sees ethan securely bound his eyes stare wildly dead or drowning

supergirl
				ethan

she leaps into the shallow pool and sinks over her head a polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly it is a door to the phantom zone supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field looking out in despair ethan is not there with her his image has disappeared 

the real flesh and blood ethan appears with selena from behind the strangler fig they look in at supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the phantom zone selena laughs at her but ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall

selena notices ethans wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him

selena
				enjoy your prison supergirl its forever

supergirl calls out to ethan her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field

int phantom zone door

supergirl is seen in reverse beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison

supergirl
				ethan dont let her do this

beyond the threshold of the zone selena in her conservatory kisses ethan with fierce lust he returns her  emotion forgetting all about supergirl

supergirl
no no it isnt true

the image of selena and ethan begins to recede getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness

ext space

the flat twodimensional polygon that is supergirls prison whirls away through space behind the transparent surface we can see supergirls face stained with tears

ext phantom zone 

another kind of reality unlike anything we have ever seen the crystal prison lands on the ground of the phantom zone and shatters supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around the landscape is utterly strange and alien with a feel of stark oppressive sterility as far as the eye can see there is no sign of life supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly she hops into the air about eight inches and lands flatfootedly on the sand with a shock she realises she cant fly

she hops a few more times with no more success

she picks up a small rock from the ground she tries to crush it in her hand she cant angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away she scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand she takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away she is barely able to disturb a few grains she drops the sand and sits down on a rock forlorn and dejected

suddenly she hears aluras voice very faint and coming from a long distance away

 aluras voice 
kara where are you

	kara
mother i can hardly hear you

	alura s voice
kara youre alive we were so worried you disappeared 
from the scanners

kara
				im lost mother in some awful place i cant fly anymore 
and im weak

	aluras voice
kara you must not give up we must retrieve the 
power source the city is dying

					kara
				then send someone else i failed

					aluras voice
				we cant the dimension barrier is stronger we no 
longer have the power to push through

kara
				but mother im lost 

					alura s voice 
you must try   its cold and dark  

the rest of her sentence fades out and is lost 

kara 
motheri tried i really tried

kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly

ext united nations new york day

establishing shot 

int general assembly

the delegate from uritania is going on in esperanto denouncing the latest outrage against his peaceloving country a few bored delegates of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones the dign1fied president of the general assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate with a flash of light and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes selena appears beside the podium she is in her shimmering white robe the dozing delegates wake up with amazement the uritanian delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone 

int  translators booth  general assembly

inside the translators booth the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window the eight translators stop translating and stare at the scene below

back to general assembly

selena is about to speak in the microphone when two security gquards attempt to step onto the podium selena reaches out toward them a field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts the delegates gasp at this act of magical violence

selena
				nations of the world i bring you tidings of a new age

the president of the general assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance instantly the presidents gavel turns into a live eel the president drops it with horror selena continues her speech

selena
				i bring you a return to the ancient true worship of 
nature our sovereign queen and mother and 
i bring you myself as her representative here 
on earth

the uritanian suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on selenas shoulder a whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates the delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar

selena
				from this moment forth all science religion and other
				unnatural beliefs are forbidden and in their place i 
will teach the one true way of our ancient 
grandmothers

the president of the general assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to 
interrupt selena

					president
				you are talking about the end of civilisation as we 
know it

	selena
and its about time too

	president
i do not know who you are or what evil force 
you represent but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back 
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress

selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks he finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates

selena
				threats i dont need threats to destroy civilisation 
i have something better

she snaps her fingers in the air immediately a rain of money begins to fall all over the general assembly paper money and coins of all nations selena looks at her work with pleasure then she disappears in a flash of light

the delegates blink with astonishment the only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the airand the money one delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing the only exception is the delegate from the united kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity and looks about with mild disapproval

ext the phantom zone

supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the phantom zone we have never seen her like this before sweating her hair unkempt streaks of dirt and grit on her face exhausted and full of despair she stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope banging her head on a rock she sits there a big rip in her uniform rubbing her bruised forehead it is hard to imagine her any worse off

she hears a sound vaguely familiar she looks around for its source she follows the sound crawling slowly along the base of the ridge the sound gets louder and as she approaches it is a sound of celestial spiritual beauty the music of the spheres

suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the phantom zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine the harsh monochromatic sterility of the phantom zone gives way to a riot of bright colours a domelike building protrudes from the ground all around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of argo city a sculptor in the clothing of argo city is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand he turns and catches sight of supergirl it is zaltar

supergirl
				zaltar

zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to supergirl he kneels beside her on the sandy ground

zaltar
				kara is it you

supergirl nods she is obviously exhausted zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink she drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid and feels strength returning to her body

supergirl 
what is this place

	zaltar
this is the phantom zone but why did you 
come here from argo city

	supergirl 
i was on earth

	zaltar
earth you crossed the dimension barrier by yourself

	supergirl
yes i went there to find the lost power source


	zaltar 
shouldntve done that

	supergirl
but the person who has it tricked me and sent me 
to the phantom zone

	zaltar
its dangerous to use a power source on earth it can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces

	supergirl
i know

	zaltar
well nothing we can do about it come into my house 
you can stay with me until i build you your own 
place i expect you wont want to mix with the others
not our type of people

he helps her to her feet and over to his house a sort of argonian gothic cathedral halfburied in the sand the curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of zaltars work on argo city

					supergirl
				others

					zaltar
				criminals

zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right

					zaltar
				a few hundred parasangs that way i avoid 
them and you should too

zaltar leads supergirl past the singing sculptures she smiles as she passes them and remembers his tree in argo city

supergirl 
mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam

	zaltar 
what palace hardly

	supergirl
just feels a little like a tiny bit of argo city


zaltar
				yes cant seem to get away from that style 
must try something new

int zaltars house

he helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room in the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools models and unfinished projects

supergirl 
its lovely  

	zaltar
no no not lovely perfect did everything 
just right nobody telling you to change this 
move that around please yourself thats 
the secret of happiness

	supergirl
are you happy zaltar

zaltar
				what kind of a question is that of course i am i do 
whatever i want all the time

	supergirl
but what about other people dont you miss them

they have reached the ground floor zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall he squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction

					zaltar
				i look at them all the time every planet in the galaxy 
its quite boring here rub some of this onto that bruise

he carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp

supergirl
				you look at them how

					zaltar
				the phantom zone overlooks everywhere if you 
have the right tools

zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor



he passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a window into another world showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy

zaltar
				there you see what could be more boring than that

he waves his hand and the image disappears

supergirl
				wait couldcould i see the place i just came from

zaltar sighs with great martyrdom and starts to fiddle with his controls

					zaltar
				itll only make you sad 

he shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image

					zaltar
				this goes closer this moves it around and 
this begins

he gestures with his hand and the window opens again supergirl zooms the image in as fast as she can trembling with desperate urgency the image on the table dissolves from high above a city down to

				i heard stories  i dont think you wanna know

				theres no way out of the zone no ones ever escaped 
thats why they send the criminals here

supergirl
				if theres a way in there must be a way out

					zaltar
				no thats not truetheres wellno

he suddenly has an idea vaguely forming at the back of his drinksodden brain he toys with it while supergirl leans forward eagerly waiting he changes his mind several times about whether its possible or not each time changing his facial expression supergirl has the feeling shes watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces

zaltar 
there is a way

	supergirl 
i knew it

	zaltar
but its impossible

	supergirl
why

	zaltar
no it wouldnt work you couldnt its too

ext conservatory day

mr  mrs danvers lucy lane and jimmy olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory the ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are gigantic golden serpents their tails around an overhead beam and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages a fifth cage hangs there empty the water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow selena shows the arrangements to ethan

selena
				unless supergirl agrees to go away forever the 
serpents will drop them one by one 

selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high melodious note the fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool

insert reflecting pool

the empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples 

back to scene

				why the empty cage

selena
that one was for you but i thought id wait and 
see how you behave when supergirl gets here id 
hate to lose you ethan

he continues forward and upward firming their path with the matterwand the wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the phantom zone because of the inherent curvature of the phantom zone vortex they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now supergirl is close beside zaltar helping him along not merely following as she had before the throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed zaltar stumbles and drops the matterwand

zaltar
				oh dear

the vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards down to where they have just climbed from  supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past but now she is being swept backwards

zaltar 
the wand use it

supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her she stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion

					zaltar
				good girl thats the way

but now zaltar is being swept backwards toward her she points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide

					zaltar
				you can use the wand

					supergirl
				better than when i was a child

she hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress

zaltar
				i remember you then cute thing you were like 
your mother

int selenas new living room

selena stands watching the image of zaltar and supergirl in her mirror beside her on the floor is the coffer of shadow now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin it pulses and glows with inner light the lid of the coffer of shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out

int the phantom zonequantum vortex

flaming spheres of ball lightning begin to whizz past zaltar and supergirl zaltar is startled and he stops his forward progress

zaltar
				whats that never saw anything like that

					supergirl
				dont stop keep moving

					zaltar 
yes mustnt stop

	supergirl
       grimly 
 its selena im getting so i can recognise her work

another flaming sphere whizzes toward them it hits zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path he starts to roll backwards down the vortex


supergirl 
zaltar use the wand

zaltar
				too late too late save yourself

he is being swept faster and faster away from her receding like the image of ethan when she was trapped in the zone zaltar throws the wand to her and then is swept away out of sight downward to his death he calls out after he disappears

zaltar 
  				       voice over 
goodbye

	supergirl
zaltar

she begins to be swept backwards but she uses the wand and stops her slide gripping the wand fiercely she starts to forge ahead all the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that selena sends down the vortex

supergirl
				youre not going to win selena i wont let you

suddenly supergirl enters another area of the vortex she begins to move forward upward without clawing her way she accelerates moving faster and faster

ext grassy meadow beside a pond

supergirl lands in a deserted sunny meadow she collapses sobbing on the grass the matterwand lies beside her

supergirl
				zaltar zaltar you never had a selfish heart

she looks up at the sun shining down serenely bathing the earth in its lifegiving raysand returning her superpowers to her

supergirl
				wherever you are zaltar thank you  

she stands up and flexes her muscles she no longer looks tired or disheveled her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight she picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air flying faster than a speeding bullet

ext above selenas new house taliesen mountain

supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof

int selenas living room

supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the french doors ethan and selena are standing against the opposite wall next to the veiled mirror

supergirl
				youve had your fun selena the game is over

					ethan 
she has hostages

	selena
the danvers and two of your little friends

	supergirl
its just one more crime youll have to pay for

ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words out there selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck

insert the serpent holding jimmy olsens cage opens its mouth and the cage drops away

back to scene

supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the french doors

int conservatory

jimmy olsens cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns

jimmy
				hey what gives

the blast of superbreath blows the cages of lucy and the danvers away from the pool as well the serpents loose their grip arid the danvers and lucy land beside jimmy in the fern bank

int living room day

selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme

selena
				all right supergirl the games not over till 
the last cards dealt

selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen coffer of shadow sitting beside her on the floor the omegahedron inside spins

all the furniture in the room suddenly launches itself at supergirl huge oak refectory tables alabaster thrones marble urns iron firegrates shie1ds and armour bronze statuary and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body ethan stands in the corner ducking the stray fragments that come his way

supergirl
				youve run out of things to throw selena
	
					selena
				not yet

selena points her hand at supergirl with a gesture of attack the coffer of shadow emits a dense black mist that darkens the room a giant invisible hand seizes supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack

ethan
				its her shadowself her dark side

supergirl
				how do i fight it

					ethan
				turn it against her

supergirl raises the wand and applies it to her own body there is a flash of blinding light and supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of selenaas she was at the fairgrounds

there are now two selenas in the roomthe real one beside the coffer of shadow and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar the real selena is first astonished and then furious

real selena
				power of shadow kill her

the second selena calls out to the shadowself in selenas own unmistakable voice

second selena 
no i am your mistress do not harm me

real selena 
dont listen to her kill her shes lying

	second selena
you are my shadow you must obey me

the real selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesnt notice ethan creeping along the wall toward the coffer of shadow

ethan lunges for the shining omegahedron inside and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal ethan rolls over and over on the floor away from selena clutching the shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock

ethan
				ive got it the power source

the real se1ena cries out with despair

and then the shadow attacks her the real selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her

real selena
        terrified
no stop please


ethan hands the power source to the second selena in the bar 

					second selena
				thank you ill take this back to argo city

					ethan
				it is you then really

without a word the second selena kisses him on the lips

second selena
				well

ethan
				its you all right

					second selena
				ill make it easy for you

she again applies the wand to her own body there is a flash of light and once more supergirl stands before him clutching both the power source and the wand

					ethan
				i couldnt help what i did before she drugged me


					supergirl
				i never doubted you for a moment

					real selena
				supergirl please help im dying

supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the real selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness supergirl touches the shadow with her wand there is a cosmic musical chord and the shadow is destroyed it falls to the floor in a rain of hard dark cinders

the real selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow she looks at herself in the mirror she is changed into the softer more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the omegahedron there is no more evil shadow looming behind her in the mirror reflection she turns to supergirl and ethan

selena
				im free i can never thank you enough

supergirl
				for what

				
selena points to the glittering omegahedron supergirl holds

selena
				ever since i found that thing ive been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare you have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time

supergirl
				your nightmares are over im taking this back to 
argo city where it wont be misused
         to ethan
you could come too it might be safer for you

ethan
				no thanks i have friends in the resistance theyll 
vouch for me i figure i might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs

					supergirl
				ill come back as soon as i can

					selena
				what about me theyll make hash out of me around

supergirl and ethan exchange a glance selenas innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen

ethan
				shes right theyll string her up

supergirl
				do you want to come to argo city

selena 
				whats it like

supergirl
				its the most beautiful place in the universe

selena 
				sounds ok to me lets go

supergirl holds out the matterwand to selena

supergirl
				grab hold of this it forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space

selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the french doors

int prison day

supergirl and selena fly through the prison supergirl melts open the locks with beams of heat vision

the prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing

ext  hamburger heaven gas station day

all the people of midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street statues banners mystic symbols giant tarot cards old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze people are smiling dancing holding hands drinking the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring

ext high above the sea

sunset

selena and supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun

selena 
where is inner space

supergirl
				its everywhere but water is always 
the door

they plunge down into the suns reflection on the sea surface

ext inner space

supergirl and selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space supergirl is tired but triumphant the omegahedron glows brightly in her hand selena looks around her with awe and wonder

selena
				will they be angry with me for 
stealing the power source



	supergirl
theyll be grateful if you hadnt found 
it it would still be lost look up ahead

selena
				yes i see it shining like a jewel

					supergirl 
				thats home

pov of supergirl and selena

fade out
