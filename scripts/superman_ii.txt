the four great villains

three of these creatures are men the fourth is a woman she is tall and has a magnificent body which is shown to its best advantage in a krypton outfit that reveals more than it conceals high boots a clinging body suit and all shiny black long raven hair frames a strikingly beautiful face her eyes are almost fiery in their grace a woman whose beauty makes strong men weak she is consumed by total hatred of the male sex this is ursa

one of the men who struts and swaggers like the leader is got up in a kryptonian version of ultramilitary attire  jackboots high collar uniform all this however is belied by his pastyfaced even sickly appearance a pathological dictator as superfascist whose only quality is utter contempt for everyone but himself whose only goal is to command a world of inferiors this is general zod

eve  i just thought it was pretty

luthor         disparagingly pretty  no the question is how can we have a  silicone connector attached to a cadmium bivalve  oscillator when theoretically that wouldnt work  that is the question

eve thats your question lex mine is more basic

jorel that is a good question

luthor          confused  huh what question i didnt ask 

jorel you already know of kryptons advanced  governmental system that enabled all the  peoples of our planet to live peacefully  and harmoniously

luthor makes a rude noise

jorel unfortunately even on krypton there have appeared   once in a great while  certain antisocial elements

luthor      putting him on razzing how shocking

jorel   deviants whose upbringing or chemical balance  had gone awry what we called malcontents you  on earth call them criminals

luthor my kind of people

jorel of course we are not a primitive planet like earth  and these unhappy souls were always successfully  rehabilitated transformed into proud productive citizens

lara os  as you see kalel thanks you for your gift   

pull back to see that lara is holding the baby and standing beside jorel she attempts  a polite smile for whomever she is addressing but both she and jorel are obviously uncomfortable

lara    but he really needs his sleep now

new angle the room in which we now discover non ursa jakel and zod who is the commanding presence they do not take laras hint so she starts out dropping the rattle back in its gift box on a table and carrying the baby past them non and zod take no notice of  him when he is held out politely to ursa she instinctively turns away with a grimace of  disgust jakel makes a face he thinks will amuse a baby but just makes him cry as lara  hurries out jorel turns to zod barely concealing his disgust

continued

353continued

jorel           stiffly i am very touched by your interest in my son           he sees through him   especially at a time when you have such pressing  interests of your own             a bit sardonically im sure you havent forgotten that you all come up  for trial before the council of elders tomorrow

zod           even stiffer  actually no 

jorel         a glance at the giftwrapped          box on the table i thought not

zod        pointedly nor has it escaped our attention that the vote to  condemn us must be unanimous         more persuasively and that you have sometimes been known to  disagree with that           sneering   august body

ursa           spitting  old fools

zod            a look to her  lets put it gracefully 

jorel            bluntly lets not you want my vote

conitnued

353continued  2

zod           to the others you see i told you he was clever far too clever  for the council clever enough for the new order  my sister and i will establish on krypton but no  jorel we do not want you to vote for us            selling hard intensely we want you to join us you are not appreciated by  the council but the people admire you together we  can sway them             pontificating and when we are in power all kryptonians will serve  the state 

jorel meaning you

zod        a little bow there will be    benefits as rulers we will live  like rulers                   heading off an argument  yes yes i know you are a selfless man but        trump card but think of your son jorel he could grow up with     pleasures and palaces

then jorel speaks slowly softly as if considering 

jorel yes general zod you have a point there its true i  have had my differences with the council they  didnt always accept my point of view as for the way  i live        a wave around the room  i suppose its simple it is good enough for me but  youre quite right  what kind of a father would i be if  i didnt want my son to have the best

on the four exchanging triumphant looks its working

on doorway  lara in the doorway watching proud but frightened

on zod

zod       even whiter than usual with anger quite a speech yours will be the first voice we  silence jorel

he makes a summary gesture to the others and suddenly they start out zod turns for the last  word

zod first you then your brat

favoring jorel he strides towards zod all kryptonian cool gone a fist forming as  zod hastily retreats with his cronies

zod it isnt over jorel                   from the safety of the door some day you will bow to me

jorel the council of course condemned them to a rehabilitation center        sorrowfully but the usual techniques failed nothing we could do  would change their evil natures

luthor        offended lex luthor lex luthor what am i  chopped liver

jorel          sadly and so because of them i created the phantom zone we  had of course no death penalty 

luthor first good thing youve said highpockets

jorel   and our one prison could not hold them the solution as  i studied the problem was a mathematical equation which i  developed and presented to the council of elders the phantom  zone was constructed in space from this unbreakable irreversible  equation in it the four were imprisoned a terrible solution yes a  cruel solution but  one we were forced to make kalel there is  no mathematical equation that can free them

luthor           pondering never

jorel we have of course thought long and hard about that question

continued

354continued

luthor          pleased hey i asked the right question

jorel         a trifle uneasily no one not even the scientists or krypton can predict  all eventualities throughout all eternity the one danger  we have considered is that the phantom zone might just  might  we cannot know  be cracked by a major nuclear  explosion in space

extremely tight closeup lex luthor  he sits bolt upright his eyes shining

jorel but our computers show this possibility as 000000002  in one million earthlings cannot travel this far in space  nor would they ever have reason to cause such an explosion so i think we can consider the phantom zone secure

luthor          gleeful singing  gray skies are gonna clear up put on a happy face   

jor el i cannot say i am glad you asked me that because we do not know  what could be done if they were  to escape        this is painful for him i do not know on krypton these villains were uncontrollable on earth they would have the same powers as you do

press secretary         very serious the president has asked me to read the following statement          reading these are grave and terrible events which threaten the  very existence of our planet i have therefore as your  commander in chief placed all armed forces on emergency status all leaves and furloughs are cancelled until further  notice there is little we can do against interplanetary forces  bent on wanton destruction however we must look to a higher  power and pray that the five creatures abandon their willful activities and allow us to live in peace

but this time a new color or set of light changes occurs  something we did not see the first  time when the machine was lacking one important crystal

at last the process ends the lights in the fortress return to normal the four as well as  luthor observed all the phenomenon with curiosity but now that it seems to have ended  they are grinning with anticipation each wanting to be the one who gets the first shot
