                                     koessler
                         i might point out agent mackelway 
                         the reason we havent been able to 
                         crack those rooms is that you refused 
                         to share that information with us  
                         which is also why you were reassigned

                                     mackelway
                         i had gotten their trust we were 
                         sharing fantasies i couldnt risk 
                         it

                         the case had been inactive for ten 
                         years at that point he argued the 
                         green river killer had actually become 
                         suspect zero this master murderer

                         to have a thing about former assistant 
                         deputy director richard low it would 
                         explain the cutting not zorro zero 
                         perhaps they once had contact we

                         that got richard low and i started 
                         in this field

                         that gasbag i can imagine what he 
                         said im not ashamed to admit that 
                         most of what i know about criminal 
                         profiling started with richard low 
                         i have also over the years i admit 
                         taken credit for many of his 
                         accomplishments he was the most

                         we had every reason to believe he 
                         was on that plane he was supposed 
                         to be on the plane everything was 
                         incinerated it was two weeks before 
                         we reached the crash site we the 
                         director and i decided it was in 
                         everyones best interest to declare 
                         dick low dead that way he could

                         both in the last year i suspected 
                         only someone as brilliant as dick 
                         low could find these guys
                              beat
                         look whatever daitz told you nobody 
                         wanted to strip richard of his badge 
                         you have to get close to be good at 
                         what he did the trick is not to get 
                         too close

                         i suspected but you were the one

                         it was neither a valid concept nor a 
                         valid fact suspect zero came to 
                         represent every killer dick low had 
                         not caught the idea took root in 
                         his head like a wild irrational vine 
                         for someone like low there would 
                         always be a suspect zero we couldnt

                         him we all had our weaknesses i 
                         guess daitz wanted the money with 
                         dave it was the glory koessler saw 
                         the behavioral sciences unit as a 
                         stepping stone to bigger and better 
                         bureaucratic things he had his eye 
                         on the directors job even then 
                         catching killers was a means to an 
                         end for them

                         deputy director koessler opposed the 
                         theory because it meant pressing the 
                         legal envelope risking highprofile 
                         failure better to get rid of me

                         agent lows theory of suspect zero 
                         the undetected serial killer is
