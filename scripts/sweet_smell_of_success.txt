                 the sweet smell of success

fade in

ext int globe newspaper building  dusk  ny

a row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the
long loading bay waiting for the edition  in the foreground
a large clock establishes the time as 810 pm a rumbling
noise warns the men to take their positions a few seconds
later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes
onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto
the trucks  much noise and shouting

the front truck moves out to the city street  as it does
camera emphasizes the big poster on its side  the design
features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims  a
trademark of hunseckers it will later be seen as the
masthead of the gossip column

                     go with the globe

                            read

                   they eyes of broadway

ext broadway  dusk  ny

the truck starts on its journey along broadway  some shots
are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic taken
from a camera car  others are from the inside of the
truck as it slows down the delivery man tosses the heavy
bundle of papers onto the sidewalk  camera following the
truck holds it in foreground against the blazing electric
signs of broadway and times square

ext broadway  night

the southeast corner of the intersection of broadway and
46th street camera fairly high shoots north towards the
impressive vista of electric signs silhouetted against the
darkening sky  very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks
camera descends towards the orange juice stand on the
corner passing the booth which sells souvenir hats  it
moves through the congestion of chattering passersby
steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man who stands
at the counter of the orange juice stand  oblivious of the
hubbub around him sidney falco is concerned only with his
private problems

he turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb
behind him this is what he has been waiting for

closer angle  night

the news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the
sidewalk besides a newsstand

detail

the bundle of newspapers  it hits the sidewalk with a smack
camera pulls back as sidney falco crosses the sidewalk  the
owner of the newsstand iggy comes to pick up the bundle
he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor
sidney snaps his fingers with impatience  iggy wears
spectacles and is clearly more or less blind he has to
grope for the cord that binds the papers

                         iggy
            aw lady if i looked like you id

                         sidney
            cmoncmon

                         iggy
                   recognizing sidneys voice
            keep ya sweatshirt on sidney

majestically taking his time iggy lifts the bundle to his
stand and cuts the cord

                         iggy
            hey fresh the globe just came
            in  hey sidney want an item for
            hunseckers column  two rolls get
            fresh with a baker  hey hot hot
            hot  etc

annoyed sidney throws him a dime seizes a paper and
returns briskly to the orange juice stand

orange juice stand  night

sidneys place at the crowded counter has been taken by
newcomers  rudely he recovers his halfconsumed glass of
orange juice and sandwich  he takes them further down the
counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the
paper  camera moving with him picks up further snatches of
overheard dialogue see dialogue attached at the end of the
scene we move close enough to see sidneys hands open the
paper expertly at hunseckers column  identifiable by the
picture of the spectacled eyes  over scene there is a
babble of offstage dialogue

close up of sidney

his face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column
he is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment

ext sidneys apartment  broadway  night

camera shoots west on 46th street as sidney comes down the
side street from the newsstand in background  irritably he
jerks open the door of a shabby entrance  as the glass door
closes sidney is seen striding up the stairs

first floor  outside sidneys apartment  night

beside the top of the stairs is the door to sidneys office
on it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads

sidney falco

publicity

from inside comes the sound of desultory typing  sidney
comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door

int sidneys apartment  night

sally is on the phone as sidney strides in

                         sally

                         sally

                   then
            i told him you were sure the item
            would be in mr hunseckers column
            in tomorrows

                         sidney
                   interrupting sharply
            it isnt  ive just seen the early
            edition

                         sally
            but

            machine

he has begun to change his clothes

                         sidney
            get me joe robard

sally goes back into the outer room

                         sidney
            who else phoned

                         sally
            the renting agent and the tailor

                         sidney
            pay the rent  let the tailor wait

                         sally
            it wont leave much of a balance in
            the bank
                   to phone
            mr robard  could you locate him

sidney in a state of semiundress comes to take the phone
from her

                         sidney
                   gloomily
            watch me run a fifty yard dash with
            my legs cut off

very abruptly he comes alive on the phone  a real laughing
boy

                         sidney
                   effusively
            sidney joe  how do you like it
            im running out of alibis  no i
            asked hunsecker to withhold the
            item until he could give it a
            fine fat paragraph  the column
            was running over and i didnt want
            you kissed off with just a line

int robards club  night

robard is a stolid secure man balding and with a moustache
he has a morose sense of humor  he is speaking from a
telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar  in
background the club is open but there are few customers as
yet  some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians
are still arriving strolling past in background depositing
their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned
to them

                         robard
                   in answer to sidney
            of course
                   he listens to
                   protest from sidney
            what is this sidney a kissing
            game  youre a liar  thats a
            publicity mans nature  i wouldnt
            hire you if you wasnt a liar  i
            pay you a candahalf a week
            wherein you plant big lies about me
            and the club all over the map
                   a pause
            yeah i mean in that sense  but
            also in the sense that you are a
            personal liar too because you
            dont do the work i pay you for
                   new protests on the
                   other end of the line
            oh stop it sidney  youre from
            the country not me

resume sidney

sally is watching him unhappy on his behalf

                         sidney
                   to phone
            now wait a minute joe  when i
            saw jj last night he said

but robard has cut off  sidney hangs up  a silence  sally
tries to be comforting

                         sally
            i wish i could help in some way
            sidney

                         sidney
                   aggressively
            help me with two minutes of silence

sally hurt says nothing  presently he adds

                         sidney
            go home sally  its late

                         sally
            i hate to see you like this 

sidney with another mercurial change of manner begins some
sarcastic clowning

                         sidney
                   horsing around
            yes but as a new subscriber youre
            under no obligation to take more
            than three books  and if you mail
            the enclosed card within ten days 

                         sally
                   pleadingly
            sidney i know you by now  dont
            do a dance with me

                         sidney
                   still clowning
            you mean you dont want the extra
            free gift of a colorful giant map
            of the world

                         sally
                   distressed
            sidney please dear if you feel
            nervous

sidney is abruptly savage

                         sidney
                   with cruelty
            so whatll you do if i feel nervous
            youll open your meaty sympathetic
            arms

                         sally
                   breaking down
            sidyou got me soi dont know
            what

she is crying  sidney feels uncomfortable  not too
generously he relents

                         sidney

                         sally

                         sidney
                   with a touch of bitterness

                   going
            lock up and leave the key

the phone rings  sidney is dressed by now  as sally goes
for it he makes for the outer door

                         sally

                         sidney
            and leave a tip in every hatcheck
            room in town

he is already gone as she picks up the phone

                         sally
            sidney falco office oh miss

            column

                                            lap dissolve to

int elysian room  night

the quintet  as the dissolve clears a clatter of polite
applause greets the end of a previous number  camera is on
the bandstand moving smoothly through the group of five
musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up first the
leader a guitarist snaps his fingers giving the tempo
tothe bass who walks with the beat bringing inthe
drums which start a quiet insistent wirebrush background
forthe cello and the flute whose introductory phrases
set the stage for

steve dallas

the guitar the leader again  it comes in after this
short preamble with the first statement of melody the tune
has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the
themes of the film already heard as a phrase in the
background score of the title music camera lingers a
moment on the guitarist steve dallas  he is a youth of
pleasant intelligent appearance  he plays with the intent
air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work
very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in
the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening
audience

sidney

a close shot  sidney has just entered the club strolling
into the vestibule near the entrance  he wears an expression
of oddly unsuitable antagonism as he looks forward

dallas

seen in long shot from sidneys viewpoint  camera moves to
include sidney in foreground again  he turns as he is
accosted by rita the cigarette girl of the club  she is a
pert creature attractive and not unaware of the fact

                         rita
            dont you ever get messages
            eyelashes  i called you twice

                         sidney
                   irked
            ive been up to here  listen
            honey tell me something  you know
            susan hunsecker
                   rita nods
            has she been in  i mean lately in
            the last coupla days

                         rita
            i dont think so

                         sidney
            youre sure  find out for me

                         rita
                   with a nod
            sidney can i talk to you a minute

rita wears an injured air  sidney preoccupied with other
worries callously ignores it

                         sidney
            is frank dangelo around

                         rita
            at the bar  sidney

but sidney has moved away from her

dangelo

he is at the bar listening with satisfaction to the music
watching the performers and studying the audience  sidney
comes up behind him  we see sidneys eyes flick from
dangelo towards the bandstand and back again  then as he
takes the stool next to dangelo he assumes a different
manner a sulky resentment  dangelo sees sidney

                         dangelo
                   to the bartender
            joe give my nephew a drink

                         sidney
                   sullen
            your nephew doesnt want a drink

dangelo is still watching the quintet  the guitar can be
heard again

another angle

shooting past dangelo and sidney towards the bandstand

                         dangelo
            thats a lollipop that boy  the
            kid is only great

                         sidney
            and with ten percent of his future
            youre great too frank

dangelo looks quickly at sidney sensing the undercurrent
then he turns his back on the musicians remarking in a
quiet tone

                         dangelo
            went over to philly yesterday an
            seen the folksits nice you send
            them the fifty a month

                         sidney
                   after a pause
            see my mother

                         dangelo
                   shaking his head
            i only had a few hours

a glum moment  frank sips his highball sidney lights a
cigarette animosity on his face

                         dangelo
            thanks for the publicity spread you
            got the boys for the benefit
            tomorrow

                         sidney
                   begrudgingly
            robards my client  i did it for
            him and his club not your boys

frank again notes sidneys resentful manner  sidney looks
towards the musicians

                         sidney
                   quietly
            frank i think maybe you lied to me

                         dangelo
                   quietly
            looka sidney youre my own
            sisters son but where does that
            give you the right to call me a liar

                         sidney
                   looking towards steve
            you told me that your boy was
            washed up with susie hunsecker
            didnt you

                         dangelo
            yeah and its the truth to the
            best of my knowledge  and frankly
            im glad  for steves sake im
            glad not yours  i manage these
            boys and i got their best interests
            at heart  steve shouldnt get
            mixed up with no bimbo at his age

                         sidney
                   narrowly
            you told him that

                         dangelo
            not in those exact words  you know
            what a temper hes got

a pause  sidney is thinking

                         sidney
            when do these hotheaded boys of
            yours go on the road

                         dangelo
            coupla weeks  for eight weeks

                         sidney
            thats a nice tour  all booked
                   frank nodding
            when was susie around here last

                         dangelo
            four five nights ago  thats how i
            know the romance is off  also
            steves in a very bad mood

                         sidney
                   abruptly
            listen frank youd better make
            sure youre telling me the truth

                         dangelo
                   annoyed
            i dont like this threatening
            attitude  when it comes to it
            what the heck is it your business
            what they do this boy and girl

rita

locating sidney she comes up behind him  he turns away
from dangelo as she whispers to him  as she departs
sidney turns back

                         sidney
            if you knew hunsecker as well as i
            did you might understand why its
            my business  maybe youre walking
            around blind frank without a cane

sidney gets off his stool  casually but to effect he adds

                         sidney
            and in case you didnt know it
            susie hunseckers out there on the
            back step right now

he turns away glancing towards steve on the bandstand
behind him

dangelo

he looks disturbed

intext backstage and courtyard

from dangelos point of view  camera looks up at steve
the quintet is now reaching the end of the number a driving
rhythm of considerable excitement  a waiter passes in fg
and the camera cranes back through the curtained doorway to
the backstage part of the club  this movement is continued
as we see some other employees including jerry wiggins the
intermission pianist who is waiting in the corridor near
the fireexit  as he steps out of the door to discard a
cigarette camera again continues its movement craning back
and downward into the little courtyard  here it discovers
the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow
near the steps of the fireescape listening to the music

closer angle

this is susan hunsecker  she wears an expensive mink coat
it is oddly in contrast with her personality the face is
sensitive and intelligent but childlike and tragic  a girl
in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her
capacity  over scene the music continues  susan shifts
her position knowing that the session will soon be at an
end and that the musicians will be coming backstage

int elysian room

steve is playing the last bars of the number the whole
group now in unison

quintet

the music comes sharply dramatically to its finish  there
is some applause  the boys relax  steve reaches for the
microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of
the cool musician announces the end of the set thanking
the audience identifying the quintet by name and introducing
the intermission pianist  during this carson chico and
paul wander off the bandstand behind him

ext backstage and courtyard

chico paul and carson come through to the corridor backstage
as they do so chico glancing out of the open door sees
susan in the courtyard  he goes out onto the fireescape
paul following behind

                         chico
            hi  susie

                         susan
            hello chico  paul

                         chico
                   to paul
            throw a rope round this chick while
            i go get steve

chico goes swiftly back into the club  paul remains with
susan  there is a momentary silence paul is embarrassed
because susan is  susan makes an effort at conversation
she nods towards the club

                         susan
            full house

                         paul

int club

steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles a
muchtooearnest devotee of progressive jazz

                         devotee
            im terribly interested in jazz 
            serious jazz  you studied with
            milhaud didnt you  this is such
            an interesting fusion of the
            traditional classical form with
            the new progressive style i just
            wanted to ask you how you came to
            form the group

chico

he comes through the curtains of the doorway pausing as he
sees that steve is involved with the intellectual young woman

reverse angle

steve glancing at chico over the shoulder of the intellectual
young woman  seeing that chico has something to say to him
he wriggles out of the young womans clutches by passing the
buck to the unfortunate to fred katz who is descending from
the bandstand behind him

                         steve
            well we just sort of got together
                   turning to introduce fred
            maybe if you ask mr katzhe
            writes the stuff you know

                         fred
                   blankly
            huh

resume chico

steve joins chico and they go through the curtains into the
corridor outside

corridor

chico smiling explains

                         chico
            dont waste your time there man
            youve got something better waiting
            outside
                   as steve looks at him
            susies out there

steve

his reaction betrays some emotion over scene the
intermission pianist has begun to play a blues number
steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard
then hesitates  almost as if he was afraid to go out  he
meets chicos eye again

                         steve
            what did she say

chico

he is amused but sympathetic

                         chico
            you proposed to her not me
                   slapping him on the back
            go get your answer

courtyard

susan waiting at the foot of the iron steps turns as steve
comes out on the fire escape above  steve comes quickly
down the steps towards her slowing down when he gets a few
paces away from her

susan

she looks up at steve

steve

a close shot  in his expression we read his mute inquiry

resume susan

quite deliberately with her eyes moistened by love and
affectionshe nods

reverse angle

great relief and happiness can be seen in the boys face
after a moment he moves to her and she to him  they
embrace swiftly hold each other close and then kiss with
passion  presently when the kiss is over susan speaks
softly

                         susan
                   in a whisper
            steveillill try to make a
            good wife

steve is still too choked with relief to speak  for answer
he clasps her more tightly to him  the beam of light which
falls on the iron stairs behind them narrows and then is
extinguished

corridor

paul has closed the door  turning he shares a look with
the grinning chico and fred katz who has managed to escape
from the young woman  before there is time for either of
them to make a remark sidney comes through the curtains
from the club

                         sidney
            hi fellows  wheres the chief

sidneys manner is very friendly  but it is immediately
apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none
of them likes sidney  fred is deliberately uncomprehending

                         fred
            who

                         sidney
                   who gets the point
            dallas  is he around

chicos back is to the closed door which opens onto the
courtyard  chico nods in the opposite direction towards the
stairs

                         chico
                   unhelpfully
            yeah hes around somewhere
            upstairs maybe

                         sidney
                   coldly as he goes
            thanks

courtyard

steve and susan are still embracing  steve is exultantly
proud and happy

                         steve
                   incoherent
            this is big you know  very big
            lets go out later drink some
            firewater  with the boys  fred
            can call millie and 

                         susan
            steve id rather you didnt say
            anything for a day or twountil i
            tell my brother

steve

his sobering reaction shows this is something important

                         steve
                   gently
            you havent told him yet

susan

                         susan
            im telling him in the morning
            after breakfast

steve and susan

turning her head she makes a little gesture an unconscious
movement putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a
headache

                         steve
            he isnt going to like it

susan says nothing  she looks to steve smiling but the
smile is not too confident

                         steve
            you sure you dont want me to be
            with you

susan stoutly shakes her head  defensively she reassures
steve

                         susan
            steve my brother isnt as bad as
            hes painted  he isnt perfect
            but 

                         steve
            but he isnt going to like this
            susie  and he makes you nervous
            not me  no i take that back  he
            makes me nervous too  but i
            wouldnt give him a second thought
            if not for you

the topic evidently makes susan uneasy  in an effort to
dismiss something that she does not want to think about
susan puts her arms around steves neck again

                         susan
            lets forget him and 

but steve is not so ready to change the subject

                         steve
            his stooge falco is around  i
            saw him walk in
                   soberly
            hes been spying on me for weeks
            susie

                         susan
                   quickly perhaps too quickly
            darling i dont care  really i
            dont  sidneyd had a secret crush
            on me for years but nothing we do
            is his business 

                         steve
                   gently insisting
            but he could be reporting back to
            your brother couldnt he

                         susan
                   pleading
            steve dear please forget all of
            this  what can it matter after
            tomorrow

now steve responds  he grins holds her closer

                         steve
                   softly
            i have a message for you i love
            you
                   kissing her lightly
            may i dedicate the next number to
            youand the next and the next
            every sunday ill buy you a new
            bonnet 

                         susan
                   amused but moved
            if the stores are open 

                         steve
            and on monday ill take it off and
            stroke your light brown hair and 

                         susan
            and on tuesday  hasenpfeffer
                         steve
                   abruptly grinning
            how do you think i realized i love
            you

                         susan
            i made you write a beautiful song

                         steve
            no you had me eating that chinese
            food

they laugh and enjoyably but then as the camera moves we
realize that sidney is there on the fire escape above them
his manner is affable

                         sidney
            can more than two enjoy this joke
                   to susan
            hello susie i didnt expect to
            find you here

steve says nothing  but he obviously resents the intrusion
and finds it difficult to conceal the fact  sidney comes
down the fire escape towards them

                         sidney
            wheres those glossy prints you
            promised  tonights the latest i
            can place them 

                         steve
                   barely polite
            well thanks anyway  lets forget
            it
                   to susan
            its cold out here susie

steve makes a move to lead susan back inside  it is a
gesture which appears to dismiss sidney  sidney chooses to
take umbrage

                         sidney
                   lightly sarcastic
            let me apologize for getting you
            that press spread  its been an
            honor to serve you gratis

steve turns to sidney his manner is quiet but challenging

                         steve
                   levelly
            i get the feeling falco that
            youre always snooping around

                         susan
                   quickly intervening
            steve stop it please

another angle

frank dangelo has followed sidney out onto the fire escape
other members of the quintet have also appeared

                         dangelo
            what are you boys fighting about

aggressively indignant sidney throws up his hands he
knocks on the metal of the fire escape

                         sidney
                   sarcastic
            kill me  find me a door somewhere 
            i walked in without knocking

sidney is trying to needle steve steves temper would
normally have exploded but now he controls it

                         steve
            im feeling too good to fight with
            you but that isnt what i said  i
            said you snoop  for instance what
            were you doing around my hotel the
            other night

                         sidney
                   needling
            begging your pardon i havent been
            down the bowery in years

                         dangelo
                   soothingly
            come on boys break it up

                         steve
                   overriding dangelo
            the next time you want information
            falco dont scratch for it like a
            dog  ask for it like a man

sidney

his face tightens he appears to be mortally insulted and
controlling himself with difficulty  he turns his back
swiftly on steve addressing susan in a voice that has a
sharp edge

                         sidney
            if youre going home susie ill
            drop you off

sidney starts quickly up the fire escape  this makes steve
angry and he steps forward to follow him  but chico
contrives without seeming to interfere to obstruct steve

                         chico
                   easily
            time for the next set chief

                         steve
            just a minute chico

corridor

sidney comes inside  when he is out of sight or the group
in the courtyard his manner swiftly changes  its obvious
now that his indignation was assumed now he looks back
towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes
he is assessing steves temper  but presently seeing
dangelo and the boys returning he moves back to the
curtains into the club

courtyard

as dangelo and the other boys go inside steve turns back
to susan

                         steve
                   fondly
            just so you dont leave me in a
            minor key

int club

rita has succeeded in recapturing sidney near the entrance
to the club  sidney alert and interested listens to her
while keeping his eye on the bandstand in bg where the
intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the
quintet are returning ready to mount the bandstand again

                         sidney
            dont tell me you started a polka
            with leo bartha

                         rita
                   shaking her head
            no  thats what i mean  im being
            fired for what i didnt do

sidney is amused  rita continues in a confidential manner
which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and notvery
convincing air of injury

                         rita
                   soto voce
            he came in last week on a very dull
            rainy night  i know who he was
            but i didnt let on
                   emphatically
            he didnt take his eyes off me all
            night  listening

rita has mistaken sidneys shrewdly calculating expression
for inattention

                         sidney
            avidly  he was staring

                         rita
                   continuing
            staring  consequently when he
            approached me on his way out i
            wasnt surprised but i didnt let
            on

                         sidney
                   prompting
            he was writing a special sunday
            piece on

                         rita
                   nodding
            cigarette girls and naturally 

                         sidney
            you were thrilled to be interviewed
                   she nods
            were you interviewed

                         rita
            in his apartment 

                         sidney
            and where was his wife

                         rita
            i dont know  its a big apartment
            but i wasnt interviewed  in fact
            i was totally unprepared for what
            happened

                         sidney
                   grimacing
            were old friends chickie  quit
            it  a big columnist comes in this
            room without his ballandchain
            and you make like a delicatessen
            counter  what did you think would
            happen in his house

                         rita
                   with a nod
            but sidney darling the man must
            be out of his mind  it was only
            eleven oclock in the morning

despite himself sidney chuckles but she is distressed

                         rita
            for a moment i was so taken aback
            that i said anything that popped
            into my sleepy head  if im not
            mistaken i even ordered the man
            out of his own house

sidneys eyes have been caught by something at the other end
of the big room

steve and susan

from sidneys viewpoint  susan has come back into the club
with steve and seems to be taking leave of him  she starts
to walk through the club on her way out

resume sidney and rita

sidney with half his attention on susan and steve listens
to ritas rueful protest

                         rita
                   rapidly
            he was furious and by the time i
            could have put on a tropical island
            mood i was out on the street
                   dolefully
            that night mr van cleve calls me
            into his office here  hes got
            nothing against me he says but he
            cant afford to antagonize
            columnists  i told him i still
            have sonny at military academy but
            van cleves made of ice

aware that sidney is moving to leave her so that he can
catch susan rita detains him with an appeal

                         rita
                   tentative
            do you think you could do something
            sidney

                         sidney
                   a quick nod
            thats what im thinking rita
            maybe

rita is anxious to cement the offer  delicately she asks

                         rita
            do you still keep your key under
            the mat

                         sidney
                   eyeing her
            can you be there by twothirty

she drops her eyes nods  sidney pats her arm and is gone
she looks after him

sidney and susan

sidney overtakes susan at the front entrance in time to open
the door for her  he has now reverted to another mood in
which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to
him by steve  he goes out ahead of her

bandstand

the quintet are resuming their positions on the stand
steve lingers a moment his guitar already in his hand while
he talks to dangelo

                         steve
            frank i dont want any secrets
            from you  i proposed to susie
            tonight

dangelo hides his feelings asks

                         dangelo
            did she accept

                         steve
            you dont like it do you  i think
            she will accept but im not sure
            she may be too dependent on her
            brother

he mounts the bandstand

                         dangelo
                   solemnly
            lots of good people in this town
            are dependent on her brother

steve sits on the stool quietly gives the beat to his group
and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and
lonely melody the sage

another angle

while dangelo watches him the boy continues  camera
tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and
babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation
of the quiet melancholy of the music

outside the elysian room

susan is standing beside the poster which features steve
listening to the music from inside the club  sidney comes
to join her  he is now pretending to be hurt

                         susan
            youre touchy sidney  dont be so
            touchy

                         sidney
                   gruffly
            i wasnt looking for a brawl  i
            came to bring him a present
                   then
            wanna bite to eat

susan shakes her head  she looks up as she hears the
doormans whistle off screen  sidney moves forward to
escort her to the taxi

longer shot

they cross the sidewalk and get into the cab  it starts off
and camera pans with it

inside cab

susan is relaxed content but thoughtful  sidney flicks her
a quick anxious look  finally gloomily

                         sidney
            feels like a monday night dont
            it

                         susan
                   softly
            not to me  sometimes the world
            feels like a cage  then someone
            comes along and opens the doorand
            its never monday night again
                   turning to sidney
            i wish you and steve could like
            each other

                         sidney
                   grimacing
            we stick in each others craw

                         susan
            yes but why

                         sidney
            well for one thing he thinks jj
            is some kind of monster

susan

quizzically she studies sidney

                         susan
            dont you

sidney

he looks up sharply he is momentarily startled at susans
insight swiftly he assumes a protesting air

                         sidney
            susie your brothers one of my
            best friends and 

resume susan

she is not totally convinced by this performance  she
smiles skeptically

                         susan
            i know  but someday id like to
            look into your clever mind and see
            what you really think of him 

resume sidney and susan

sidney makes a show of indignation

                         sidney
            where do you come off to make a
            remark like that

                         susan
                   quietly
            who could love a man who keeps
            jumping through burning hoops like
            a trained poodle

sidney doesnt immediately answer  susan drops her eyes
becoming absorbed in her own problems  cautiously sidney
lets the momentary silence continue  then

                         susan
                   thoughtfully
            do you think jj likes steve

                         sidney
                   glibly
            frankly yes to my surprise  he
            thinks hes very gifted  those
            boysll go a big mile he thinks

susan says nothing  sidney watching her closely probes
further

                         sidney
                   gently
            you feel pretty strong about this
            boy

a pause  then susan nods  she is not looking at sidney and
cannot see the watchfulness in his face  sidney prompts
again

                         sidney
            wedding bells you mean

again susan nods

                         susan
            he wants me to go on the road with
            them  its an eight month tour
            all the way to oregon

sidney

the news has considerable impact on him  but he hides it
saying lightly

                         sidney
            well congratulations  but dont
            go just for the ride  or didnt
            you accept the proposal

resume susan and sidney

susan continues

                         susan
            im going to discuss it with jj
            in the morning

a pause  each is concerned with private thoughts  susan
relaxed adds quietly

                         susan
                   softly
            its given me a big lift to know
            that some people want me for
            myself not just because im my
            brothers sister

                         sidney
            chickie ill have to laugh at
            that  an attractive girl like
            you

susan ignores his remark continuing thoughtfully

                         susan
            i hope that jj really likes
            steve that it isnt an act

                         sidney
                   with an indignant edge
            why should he put on an act  your
            brother has told presidents where
            to go and what to do

the taxi has pulled to a stop  susan sits for a moment
before she remarks

                         susan
            the act would be for my sake not
            steves

realizing that they have come to their destination susan
gets up moving out of camera as she disembarks from the
taxi  camera catches a glimpse of apprehension in sidneys
eyes  quickly he decides to follow her

ext broadway

susan getting out of the taxi moves past camera  sidney
following her instructs the driver

                         sidney
                   to cabbie
            wait for me  ill be right back

sidney moves after the girl calling susie

hearing him susan turns back  sidney walks into shot to
join her

                         sidney
                   lightly
            its not my nature susie but ill
            talk to you like an uncle

                         susan
                   smiling
            but i dont need an uncle sidney

they move through the doors

sidney quickly corrects himself saying earnestly

                         sidney
            no i mean because i admire you 
            in fact more than admire you 
            although thats neither here nor
            there
                   quickly skipping to
                   the important point
            susie dont sell your brother
            short  talk this over with him i
            mean  youll find him a real friend

susan

susan looks thoughtful making no comment

resume sidney and susan

carefully again probing he prompts her

                         sidney
            any message in case i see jj
            later

susan turns away and walks out past camera  sidney watches
her

susan

she looks back at sidney quietly firm

                         susan
            yes  tell him for me that steve
            dallas is the first real man ive
            ever been in love with

she turns away and walks through the inner door going down
the corridor towards the elevators in background

resume sidney

the sincerity of the girls manner strikes home to sidney
now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain
with which he hears the statement of her feelings for
another man  angered he wheels striding out of the door
onto broadway

ext broadway

sidney returns to the cab instructing the driver

                         sidney
            the twenty one club

he climbs in and the taxi drives off down broadway

                                            lap dissolve to

ext twenty one club  night

camera high shooting west down 52nd street as sidneys cab
pulls up double parking in front of the 21 club  sidney
maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the
entrance and the camera descends to shoot along the courtyard
towards the entrance  we see the figure of jimmy weldon and
his girl friend coming out of the club

closer angle  night

jimmy weldon is coming out of the club accompanied by a
girl he is slightly tight  as he steps through the outer
doors weldon again spies sidney on the sidewalk he steps
to one side of the entrance way

sidney slips through the congestion but just as he tries to
enter the club weldons hand shoots out neatly ambushing
him pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard  sidney is
instantly resentful of this manhandling but has to adjust
himself assuming a quick smile for the benefit of weldon

                         sidney
            jimmy  this is a coincidence  i
            am just going 

                         weldon
                   overlapping
            yeah  a coincidence you should run
            into the very man youve been
            ducking all week
                   to the girl
            this is my press agent joan

weldon jibing at sidney plays his remarks off the girl
who is amused sidney of course is not

                         sidney
                   quickly
            i tried to reach you twice 

                         weldon
                   overlapping
            what do you do for that hundred a
            week  fall out of bed

                         sidney
            jimmy im on my way inside right
            now to talk to hunsecker  i can
            promise you

                   horsing
            joan call a cop  well arrest
            this kid for larceny

sidney flinches his pride touched

                         sidney
            listen when your band was playing
            at roseland 

                         weldon
                   cutting in
            that was two months ago  take your
            hand out of my pocket thief

the girl tries to quiet weldon who has gone from horsing to
loud contempt

                         the girl
            take it easy jimmy dear

                         weldon
                   indignantly
            why  its a dirty job but i pay
            clean money for it dont i

abruptly sidney bursts out giving as good as he has taken

                         sidney
            no more you dont  what is this 
            youre showing off for her  theyre
            supposed to hear you in korea

                         weldon
                   smirking to the girl
            hes intuitive  he knows hes
            getting fired

                         sidney
            if youre funny james im a
            pretzel  drop dead

weldon shepherded by the girl is already on his way across
the sidewalk

                         weldon
            it was nice knowing you sidney
            not cheap  but nice  happy
            unemployment insurance

int twenty one club  night

sidney entering the club threads his way through the
crowded foyer coming up to camera near the foot of the
staircase  there he meets a captain who turns to him

                         captain
            how are you tonight mr falco

                         sidney
                   nodding towards the restaurant
            is he inside

                         captain
            but of course

                         sidney
            alone or surrounded

                         captain
            a senator an agent and something 
            with  long  red  hair

sidney moves past camera coming a couple of paces towards
the door to the restaurant  he pauses

reverse angle

from sidneys viewpoint  shooting through the doorway into
the restaurant we can see the group at the table
hunseckers back is turned to us camera pulls back to
include sidney in foreground  he decides not to go into
restaurant and turns away out of shot

int lounge

sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks
through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the
phone booths are camera panning

phone booths

sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard
instructing her

                         sidney
            honey get me mr hunsecker

the girl reaches for a book of phone numbers then remembers

                         operator
            hes right inside mr falco

                         sidney
                   from inside the booth
            so it isnt long distance

as the girl shrugging puts through the call camera moves
closer to sidney in the booth  he hears the connection
made speaks at once

                         sidney
                   to phone
            jj  its me 

we are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a
voice on the other end  though the words are not
distinguishable it is quite clear that the speaker is not
talking to the phone  sidney seems to relax as if this is
something that happens often  he waits studying his
manicured fingertips

presently sidney hears the voice on the other end become
clearer  it asks yes camera moves closer as sidney says

                         sidney
            jj its sidney  can you come
            outside for one minute

hunseckers voice filtered through the sound of the
telephone is sharp and tiny but the words are now very
clear

                         hunsecker os
            can i come out  no

                         sidney
                   tensely
            i have to talk to you alone jj
            thats why

                         hunsecker os
            you had something to do for me 
            you didnt do it

                         sidney
            can i come in for a minute

                         hunsecker os
            no  youre dead son  get yourself
            buried

there is a click as hunsecker hangs up  sidney more
slowly also hangs up  brooding he comes out of the booth

int twenty one club  lounge

sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths walks
through the lounge to the hallway  he turns towards the
dining room

int hallway

sidney comes to the door into the dining room camera
tracking with him  here he pauses looking towards

hunsecker

from sidneys viewpoint  hunsecker is seated at a table
which is cleverly his habitual position  we see him only in
semiback view a broad and powerful back  he is listening
to a man who has paused at his table stooping over hunsecker
to whisper in his ear  as the columnist listens his hands
play with an omnipresent pad and pencil which lie on the
dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes mimeographed
sheets and a telephone  beyond hunsecker and the man
talking to him are the senator the agent and an attractive
if fatuous girl

                         hunsecker
            ill check it in the morning low 
            thanks

the man leaves hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad
meanwhile the senator whispers something to the girl who
giggles softly

reverse angle

sidney comes across to the table nervous but deliberate
camera pulls back to include hunsecker in foreground
sidney without accosting him stands a few feet from the
columnists elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette
hunsecker barely turning his head sees him  we have heard
of hunsecker as a monster but he is evidently in a mild
phase of his metabolism for he seems gentle sad and quiet
as he turns his gaze casually to the senator totally
ignoring the young man who stands behind him

                         hunsecker
                   softly
            harvey i often wish i were dead
            and wore a hearing aidwith a
            simple flick of a switch i could
            shut out the greedy murmur of
            little men

sidney

a close shot  sidney shows no reaction to this insult  he
steps in closer an indian fixity in his face

                         sidney
            jj i need your ear for two
            minutes

reverse angle

shooting across sidney onto hunsecker  jj turns  but
not to sidney  he raises his hand in a small gesture which
summons a passing captain who steps into picture at sidneys
elbow

                         hunsecker
            mac  i dont want this man at my
            table

                         sidney
                   quickly but quietly interrupting
            i have a message from your sister

the captain is already there  but now hunseckers eyes have
switched to sidneys face  for the briefest of moments
nothing happens  then hunsecker seeming to relax and
ignoring the captain whom he has summoned turns back to
casual conversation with the senator as if nothing had
happened

                         hunsecker
            forgive me harvey  we were
            interrupted before 

in foreground sidney turns to the captain with a carved
smile indicating that hunseckers change of topic is to be
interpreted as sanction for sidney to remain  the captain
not entirely convinced retreats  sidney finds himself a
chair places it and takes a seat which is near enough to
the table to establish his presence  during this

                         senator
                   who is mildly
                   surprised and faintly embarrassed
            errthe supreme court story i
            was telling you  justice black

                         hunsecker
                   nodding
            yes the justice thats right
            but i think you had it in the column

                         sidney
                   smoothly casually
            last july the lead item

sidneys interjection is quietly wellmannered  hunsecker
totally ignores it  the other members of the party are a
little astonished at the interplay  the girl in particular

            a man has just been sentenced to
            death

hunseckers face hardens aware of sidneys impertinence he
does not design to react directly he turns towards the agent

            why of course  it might for
            instance be politics

as the girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the
senator beside her camera eases back to include him  the
senator is unruffled gravely he lights a cigar  the girl
laughs

                         girl

            the clothes are trainornorell

the senator the agent and the girl

the girl and the agent are both nervously uneasy  the
senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and with
deliberation turns towards sidney

                         senator
            are you an actor mr falco

                         girl

they all look at sidney

                         girl
            hes so pretty thats how

resume sidney and hunsecker

sidney bitterly resents the adjective but contrives to hide
the fact he smiles gracefully accepting the compliment
hunsecker who knows what sidney feels is pleased he turns
towards sidney expansively

                         hunsecker
            mr falco let it be said at once
            is a man of forty faces not one
            none too pretty and all deceptive
            see that grin  its the charming
            street urchins face  its part of
            his helpless act  he throws
            himself on your mercy  i skip the
            pleading nervous bit that sometimes
            blends over into bluster  the
            moist grateful eye is a favorite
            face with him  it frequently ties
            in with the act of boyish candor
            hes talking straight from the
            heart get it  hes got about
            halfadozen faces for the ladies
            but the real cut one to me is the
            quick dependable chap  nothing he
            wont do for you in a pinch  at
            least so he says  tonight mr
            falco whom i did not invite to sit
            at this table is about to show in
            his last and most pitiful role
            pale face with tongue hanging out
            in brief gentlemen and jersey
            lilly the boy sitting with us is a
            hungry press agent and fully up to
            all the tricks of his very slimy
            trade

hunsecker has started his speech lightly but it has built
up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and
intimidate the others at the table  in conclusion
hunsecker his eyes on sidney picks up a cigarette and
waits expectantly

                         hunsecker
                   quietly
            match me sidney

                         sidney
                   coolly
            not just this minute jj

amused hunsecker lights his own cigarette turns towards a
man who comes up to the table

hunsecker

a single close up to intercut with the above

sidney

a matching single sidneys reaction to hunsecker and to the
others at the table

the agent the girl and the senator

to intercut with the above their reactions of embarrassment

group shot

a florid man comes up to the table obviously anxious to
catch hunseckers attention  hunsecker in the act of
lighting his own cigarette scarcely looks at the man as he
dismisses him

                         hunsecker
            i know  that loafer of yours opens
            at the latin quarter next week
                   more sharply
            say goodbye lester

the florid man retreats  to cover the embarrassment the
senator makes a sally in sidneys direction

                         senator
            may i ask a naive question mr
            falco  exactly how does a press
            agent work

sidney and hunsecker

sidney doesnt answer

                         hunsecker
            why dont you answer the man
            sidalee  hes trying to take you
            off the hook

                         sidney
                   to the senator
            you just had a good example of it
            a press agent eats a columnists
            dirt and is expected to call it
            manna

resume the agent the girl and the senator

                         girl

resume the agent the girl and the senator

the senator continues to sidney

                         senator
            but dont you help columnists by
            furnishing them with items

resume sidney and hunsecker

sidney leans forward indicating to the senator some of the
items of paper that litter the table in front of hunsecker
these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets
scraps of assorted items from professional and amateur
agents who supply the columnist  sidney fingers some of them

                         sidney
            sure columnists cant get along
            without us  only our good and
            great friend jj forgets to
            mention that  we furnish him with
            items 

sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet as an example

                         hunsecker
            what some cheap gruesome gags

                         sidney
                   to hunsecker now
            you print them dont you

                         hunsecker
            yes with your clients names
            attached  thats the only reason
            those poor slobs pay you  to see
            their names in my column all over
            the world  now as i make it out
            youre doing me a favor

                         sidney

                         hunsecker
            the day that i cant get along
            without press agents handouts
            ill close up shop lock stock and
            barrel and move to alaska

the agent the girl and the senator

the agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with hunsecker

                         agent
                   nodding
            sweep out my igloo here i come

camera pulls back as hunsecker leans forward across the
table  he vents upon the unfortunate agent some of the
annoyance prompted by sidneys impertinence

                         hunsecker
                   to the agent
            look manny you rode in here on
            the senators shirt tails so shut
            your mouth

the senator doesnt like this treatment of others and his
manner and face show it

                         senator
                   slowly
            now come jj thats a little
            too harsh  anyone seems fair game
            for you tonight

                         hunsecker
                   not as harsh but 
            this man is not for you harvey
            and you shouldnt be seen with him
            in public  because thats another
            part of a press agents life  he
            digs up scandal among prominent men
            and shovels it thin among the
            columnists who give him space

senator

he finds hunseckers manner disturbing but addresses him
frontally

                         senator
            there is some allusion here that
            escapes me

            why does everything you say sound
            like a threat

resume hunsecker

he leans back speaking more quietly enjoying himself

                         hunsecker
            maybe its a mannerism  because i
            dont threaten friends harvey
            but why furnish your enemies with
            ammunition  youre a family man
            someday with god willing you may
            wanna be president  now here you
            are harvey out in the open where

                   continuing
            is toting that one

hunsecker points to the girl and the camera makes a slight
crab movement to include the girl as hunsecker points in
turn to her

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            around for you

challenging the senator

he smiles disarmingly

                   continuing
            are we kids or what

hunsecker rises

group shot

as hunsecker stands up sidney follows suit  the agent
very nervous gets to his feet and the girl does likewise
the senator whose face is sober also rises from the table

                         hunsecker
                   to the senator affably
            next time you come up you might
            join me at my tv show

with sidney making way for him hunsecker walks round the
end of the table to the senator  the senator faces hunsecker
solemnly

                         senator
                   quietly and cautiously
            thank you jj for what i consider
            sound advice

hunsecker matches the senators solemnity

                         hunsecker
                   deadpan
            go thou and sin no more

hunsecker moves out of shot  sidney murmurs a pleased to
meet you to the senator then he follows hunsecker  the
senator remains looking after hunsecker  behind him the
agent and the girl watch him apprehensively  the senator
his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not
reveal to hunsecker seems unwilling to turn back to face
them

on the way to the foyer

hunsecker and sidney  hunsecker addresses the captain on
his way out of the restaurant

                         hunsecker

            check

towards the hat check stand

                         hunsecker
                   murmuring
            president  my big toe would make a
            better president

by now they are at the coatroom hunsecker smiling

            find me a good one joe

he accepts the proferred coat as he moves past camera

longer shot  night

the doorman on the sidewalk has noticed hunsecker almost
before the columnist has appeared  the doorman wheels
snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park
attendant who can be seen at some distance in the background
under the lights of the kinney car park  the attendant is
seen to react with alacrity running into the park

hunsecker

putting on his overcoat he addresses another of the captains
who has escorted him out of the club

                         hunsecker

sidney catches up with hunsecker as he moves out onto the
sidewalk

                         hunsecker
            wheres your coat sidalee  saving
            tips

sidney thinks of an impertinent reply decides not to be
drawn and says nothing

                         hunsecker
                   to sidney
            my curiosity is killing me what
            are you so rambunctious about
            tonight

sidney again does not answer this time he points across the
street

                         sidney
            theres your fat friend

longer shot  police car  night

the car is framed in foreground we can read the sign police
attached to the visor  two men in plainclothes detectives
are in the front seats  the man nearest is harry kello
wanting to look like a prosperous business man kello looks
soft fat mild and wellbarbered but he is dangerous he
knows it and enjoys it  with big shots he is playful and
kidding always says just enough not too much  he is very
relaxed and mild in manner but underneath there is not
only an animal energy but a feral pressing at you  his
voice is on the hoarse side  he measures situations
automatically and instantly

the police radio is chattering  also in evidence is the
telephone the radio link with headquarters  the detective
at the wheel nudges kello pointing across the street
kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist

                         hunsecker
                   as he approaches
            hello harry

                         kello
                   cheerfully
            bonna sera commendatore  come sta

sidney follows a couple of paces behind hunsecker he is in
no hurry to meet the detective whom he clearly dislikes

                         hunsecker
                   turning to sidney
            you see sidalee that shows that
            lt kello likes your people

reverse on kello

kello offers his hand to hunsecker

                         kello
            its my brooklyn background jj
            im good on yiddish too

hunsecker accepting the handshake winces with pretended
pain at what is clearly an overenthusiastic grip

                         hunsecker
            harry am i supposed to say uncle

kello laughs releases the grip hunsecker strolls past him
stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on
the radio

                         hunsecker

the policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window

                         phil
                   to hunsecker

                         hunsecker
                   shaking his head
                   with total dismissal
            thats show business  thanks phil
                   to kello

another angle  52nd street  night

kello gets into the police car

                         kello
                   as he does so
            hasta la vista jj  hasta luego

another angle  52nd st  night

the car moves off eastward  sidney and hunsecker walk
westward  sidney falling into step with hunsecker glances
back at the departing police car

                         sidney
            spahishthat must show he likes
            spigs too

                         hunsecker
            i like harry but i cant deny he
            sweats a little

camera now shoots down 52nd street  hunsecker back to
camera studies the evening hearing the sound of a screech
of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance
a drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints

                         hunsecker
            i love this dirty town

amused hunsecker turns back he signals across the street
to the car park indicating that the big black lincoln
continental should follow as he strolls with sidney

hunsecker  sidney following

                         hunsecker
                   after a pause
            conjugate me a verb sidney  for
            instance to promise

camera tracks with them in a close two shot  sidney is
alert now

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            you told me youd break up that
            romance  when

                         sidney
                   hesitantly
            you want something done jj but
            i doubt if you yourself know whats
            involved

                         hunsecker
                   soft and sardonic
            im a schoolboy  teach me teach me

                         sidney
                   carefully
            why not break it up yourself  you
            could do it in two minutes flat

hunsecker pauses halts

                         hunsecker
                   harshly
            at this late date you need
            explanations  susies all i
            got  now that shes growing up i
            want my relationship with her to

sidney follows quickly

                         sidney
            frankly jj i dont think you
            got the cards to blitz me

                         hunsecker

                         sidney
            correct me if im wrong but i
            dont think so

                         hunsecker
                   turning to eye him
            ill listen one more minute

sidney steps in front of hunsecker blocking his way for a
moment

                         sidney
                   very rapidly
            about a year ago you asked me to
            do a favor  it was a thing  well
            i never did a thing that dirty in
            all my life

hunsecker totally disinterested in sidneys problems of
conscience signals to his car again walks past sidney who
continues rapidly

                         sidney
            awright that brings us up to five
            weeks ago sidney i got a nasty

            column

                   scornfully
            are you finished

                         sidney
                   quickly

            shes growing up  two heads
            what i mean we got a slippery
            dangerous problem here

                         hunsecker
                   incisively
            not we sidney you

                         sidney
                   gamely

            because when im out on this very
            slippery limb for you you have to
            know whats involved

                         hunsecker
                   sardonically
            ha  my right hand hasnt seen my
            left hand for thirty years

sidney quickly moves into jjs path desperate to hold his
attention

                         sidney
            ill do it jj  dont get me
            wrong  in for a penny in for a
            pound  ill see it through but
            stop beating me around the head
            let me make a living

                         hunsecker
                   his mouth tight and mean
            what you promised  do it  dont
            finagle around  its later than
            you think

hunsecker walks past sidney now making for the car at which
the attendant still waits

                         sidney
                   as hunsecker passes him
            excuse it but its later than you
            think  that boy proposed tonight

hunsecker

hunsecker is hit he stops in his stride he pauses and he
turns slowly to look at sidney  lowering he hesitates
mind clicking

                         hunsecker
            susie told you that

reverse angle  favoring sidney

sidney his eyes bright nods  hunsecker studies sidney
then

                         hunsecker
            no wonder youve been so feisty
            tonight

a pause

                         hunsecker
                   quietly
            can you deliver

sidney nods

                         sidney
            uh huh

                         hunsecker
            when

                         sidney
            tonight  before you go to bed
            the cat is in the bag and the bag
            is in the river

hunsecker

expressionless he examines sidney  then he walks off
toward the car  he tips the attendant who thanks him but
instead of getting into the back of the car he makes a
small authoritative gesture to nikko double to move over
so that hunsecker himself may drive  while nikko does so
hunsecker turns back to sidney whom the camera now includes

                         hunsecker
                   quietly
            dont be a two time loser sidalee
            the sentence could be severe

sidney

he is satisfied

hunsecker

hunsecker gets into the drivers seat beside nikko the
japanese houseboy  camera is close on hunsecker who does
not look back but is clearly aware of the position of sidney
as he puts the car into gear revving the engine

sidney  night

the big car accelerates with impressive power  in doing so
it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in sidneys
direction  he leaps out of the way too late  camera moves
closer to him as with anger and ignominy he inspects his
precious clothing for damage  but as he looks after the
car his face hardens into grim humor he senses that this
petty gesture from hunsecker is an indication of his
vulnerability not his strength  as dusting his coat
sidney walks away camera rises watching his jaunty figure
cross the street in the direction of 51st street

                                      quick lap dissolve to

int toots shors restaurant

a long shot looking over the round bar towards the entrance
sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward
camera  his eyes search among the crowd

closer angle

                         captain
            hello sidney  wanna table

                         sidney

            yeah having supper with the mrs
            shes over there

the captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the
bar where mrs bartha is sitting alone  seeing that bartha
is not with her the captain looks around the bar

                         captain
            hes somewhere

                         sidney
                   interrupting
            thanks i see him

sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall where

bartha

bartha comes forward from the mens room passing the
captain and sidney  sidney moves to intercept him

                         sidney
            hello leo  how goes that sunday
            piece on cigarette girls

a close shot on bartha as he turns towards sidney stopping

                         bartha
                   cautiously
            who told you about it

sidney

sidney smiles at bartha but the threat is clear

                         sidney
            the cigarettes girlrita  and
            she took out all her hairpins too

resume bartha

he throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in
background  camera pulls back as sidney who has noted the
look moves closer to bartha

                         sidney
            i never had the pleasure of meeting
            your wife  you know what i wonder
            leo  could you use a hot little
            item for tomorrows column

sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to
scribble the item  but bartha faces him squarely speaking
sotto voce but with emphasis

                         bartha
            what is this blackmail  beat it

bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife
beyond

sidney

sidneys face tightens  after a pause he makes a decision
and walks towards the booth

bartha and his wife

barthas wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne
while her husband resumes eating a sandwich  these two are
antagonists in a long war  sidney comes up to the table
repeats

                         sidney
            leo ive never had the pleasure of
            meeting your wife

bartha looks up  what can he do  begrudgingly

                         bartha
            lorettasidney falco

                         wife

            minute  help yourself to a glass
            of this ny state champagne

mrs bartha pushes the champagne bottle in sidneys direction
as sidney sits pleasantly bartha concentrates on his
sandwich

                         sidney
            all the imported wines arent what
            theyre cracked up to be

                         wife
            whose side are you on mr falco
            his or mine

            observer for the united nations

                         sidney
                   over scene
            sidney

mrs bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing
column of the tabloid

                         wife
                   searching the column
            no horse running tomorrow by that
            name

bartha wife and sidney

an angle favoring bartha and sidney  bartha glowers at his
wife resenting the fact that she has permitted sidney to
join them

                         bartha
            you ought to stop this nonsense
            loretta these two dollar bets

            marginal life we lead
                   to sidney
            sidney did you hear the story
            about the cloakandsuitor who  

                         bartha
                   sharply interrupting
            thats right  tell him so i can
            read it in hunseckers column first

                         wife

                         wife
            leo he wants to give you an item 
            dont be sullen

bartha notes sidneys writing

                         bartha
                   to his wife
            will you mind your own business

                         wife
                   calmly
            hitler

she returns to her paper ignoring them sidney finishes
scribbling the item

                         sidney
            just in case youd like to print
            it leo  its a blind  no names
            mentioned  but for your private
            information the guys name is

he pushes the item to bartha who reads it briefly
meanwhile

                         wife
                   concentrating on the tabloid
            there isnt a single name here that
            gives off vibrations

bartha pushes the item back towards sidney  sidney glances
quickly at barthas stony face then significantly turns
towards his wife

                         sidney
            anything there with a name like
            cigarette girl

bartha raises his head looks squarely at sidney with
contempt and anger  his wife is unaware of this reaction
still looking at the paper she murmurs

                         wife
            mmmmmmcigarette girl no no
            horse with a name like that

sidney pushes the item back towards bartha

wife

mrs barthas attention is attracted by sidneys gesture
she looks up made aware of this strange byplay

bartha and sidney

a close two shot  sidney waits bartha is whitelipped but
pushes the item back again

                         bartha
            i dont print blind items

resume wife

she looks from sidney to her husband and back

                         wife
            what is this chess or checkers

resume bartha mrs bartha and sidney

the three shot favoring bartha and sidney  both sidney and
bartha are now aware of mrs barthas curiosity

                         sidney
                   pointedly
            neither does hunsecker
                   fractional pause
            he likes to use the real names

a moment of chill silence  then bartha gets to his feet
signals for a waiter  as sidney rises also

                         wife
            where are we running  what am i
            missing here

                   abruptly
            thats the horse  shotgun 
            shotgun in the fifth

she quickly studies her newspaper again  as quickly bartha
leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands  in
doing so he upsets the glass of champagne which contains
only a few drops

sidney and bartha

bartha turns challengingly to sidney

                         bartha
                   sternly
            what do you want to tell my wife
            sidney

wife

she is brushing her lap with her napkin

                         wife

            he wants to tell me that you poured
            champagne all over my lap

bartha ignores her again challenges sidney

            you nuts or what

the waiter arrives in picture beside them puts the check on
the table and goes  bartha picks it up

husband to speak

he glances unhappily at his wife

sidney decides to retreat  he turns starts to go  but
bartha blocks his way holding sidney and explaining to the
wife

                         bartha
            he wants me to print a dirty smear
            item for keeping his mouth shut

a momentarily pause  then

                         wife
            about what

he is uneasy ashamed of himself

resume wife

she says nothing

resume bartha sidney and mrs bartha

the angle favoring bartha and sidney mrs bartha in
foreground  bartha now turns on sidney

                         bartha
            your friend hunsecker  you can
            tell him for me  hes a disgrace
            to his profession  never mind my
            bilious private life  i print a
            decent responsible column  thats
            the way it stays  your man 
            theres nothing he wont print if
            it satisfies his vanity or his
            spite  hell use any spice to
            pepper up his daily garbage  tell
            him i said so and that like
            yourself hes got the morals of a
            guinea pig and the scruples of a
            gangster

sidney tries to brazen it out sneering

                         sidney
            what do i do now  whistle the
            stars and stripes forever

mrs bartha slides along the seat reaching for her fur

mrs bartha

camera pulls back with her as she collects her belongings
slides out between the tables and comes forward passing
sidney to her husband

                         wife
                   lightly
            what you do now mr falco is crow
            like a hen  you have just laid an
            egg

she presents her fur to her husband and turns her back
inviting him to put it around her shoulders

bartha and wife

another angle favoring bartha  he has not fully understood
the significance of his wifes gesture  he studies her
she confirms his hopes as she adds

                         wife
            leo this is one of the cleanest
            things ive seen you do in years

with the fur around her shoulders she turns and takes her
husbands arm with some pride  they walk away  camera
erases back to include sidney  he is angry at himself 
more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any
sense of shame at the attempt

otis elwell

a medium long shot  at a booth on the other side of the bar
sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes
he has been watching the altercation with keen interest and
satisfaction  elwell gives some instructions to a waiter
who is serving him with drinks pointing towards sidney

sidney

sidneys face shows a burning resentment  he glances about
him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been
observed  as he moves away the waiter walks into shot
addressing him

waiter

a waiter approaches sidney  he has a message

                         waiter
            otis elwell wants to see you sidney

the waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar
sidney his humiliation and rage still burning looks off
towards

otis elwell

from sidneys viewpoint  elwell beckons

sidney

he comes round the circular bar  he shows no eagerness to
join elwell but approaches the table  elwell makes a
gesture inviting sidney to sit  sidney doesnt accept it

                         elwell
                   pleasantly
            i see bartha gave you cold tongue
            for supper
                   as sidney starts to leave
            hey wait a minute

                         sidney
                   hesitating
            im late for a date with a dame

then returning he leans over the table addressing elwell
with quiet anger

                         sidney
            otis if youre trying to blow this
            brawl into an item for your column 
            forget it

reverse angle

across sidney and elwell  elwell is quietly enjoying
sidneys display of hurt dignity

                         elwell
                   affably
            how is dear old jj by the way

                         sidney
                   his anger relapsing
            call him up and ask  he might drop
            dead with shock

                         elwell
                   lightly
            if it were that easy you wouldnt
            find an empty phone booth for the
            next two hours

sidney

a close shot  while elwell continues he is not looking at
sidney  elwells expression of dislike of hunsecker is not
overemphatic but sidney senses nevertheless that it is
very real  and this gives him a new idea

                         elwell
                   continuing over scene
            talk of a wake  theyd club
            each other to cater the affair for
            free

resume elwell and sidney

elwell looks up at sidney as he continues

                         elwell
                   happily
            by the way did i hear something
            about jj giving you the flit gun
            treatment  he shut you out of the
            column
                   amused
            why

reverse angle

sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment in
order to exploit elwells dislike of hunsecker

                         sidney
            you dont know that lunatic yet
            whims  egotistic whims  like the
            gag  when you got him for a
            friend you dont need an enemy
                   a pause then
            thats what the fight with bartha
            was about leo i says hunsecker
            froze me out  so im eating humble
            pie this month  please print me an
            item

                         elwell
                   pleased
            and instead he printed his heel
            in your face

                         sidney
                   morose
            i see youre full of human
            feelings

elwell

he has lost interest in sidney

                         elwell
                   with a shrug
            like most of the human race
            sidney im bored  id go a mile
            for a chuckle

elwells voice fades his attention has been caught by

reverse angle

three people are passing the table squeezing their way
past a man with two very fetching young women  elwells
eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed

                         sidney
                   noting elwells preoccupation
            and two miles for a pretty
            girl

elwell

he is unembarrassed at sidneys alltooaccurate estimate

                         elwell
                   lightly
            threeeven four

elwell turns back towards the papers on his table a zippered
document case and some publications among which a columnist
might search for scandal among these is a magazine of
semipornographic nature

                         elwell
                   continuing casually
            then youre really washed up with
            hunsecker

reverse angle

the nature of elwells reading tastes is also not lost on
sidney  with his eyes glancing at the magazine sidney now
accepts the original offer to sit down  he produces the
slip of paper that bartha rejected offering it as
illustration

                         sidney
            this is how much im washed with
            jj

as elwell reads sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny 
apparently casual  to a picture of a girl on the magazine
cover

                         sidney
            look otis i make no brief for my
            bilious private life but hes got
            the morals of a guinea pig and the
            scruples of a gangster

elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item

                         elwell
                   dryly
            a fine fat dirty item
                   offering it back to sidney
            whos it about

but sidney doesnt take the paper back he explains

                         sidney
            a kid named dallas who runs a
            dinky jazz quintet
                   he leans closer
            he keeps company with jjs
            screwball sister

elwell

this does get a reaction a flicker of genuine interest
elwell reads the item for a second time

sidney and elwell

watching elwell read sidney encourages

                         sidney
            its a real goody if like me you
            wanna clobber jj

now elwell lays the item down in front of him  clearly he
is considering it  sidney prompts again

                         sidney
            hes got his tv tomorrow  hed
            read it just before rehearsals

elwell nods  but he is still reluctant

                         elwell
                   cautiously
            mmm  trouble is i cant think of
            any good reason why i should print
            anything you give me  i cant even
            think of a bad reason

sidney

sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more  he fingers
it in a preoccupied but significant way

                         sidney
                   gently
            suppose i introduce you to a lovely
            reason otis  one thats good and
            badand available

elwell

his eyes go from the magazine to sidney he gets the point
alright

                         elwell
            im not an unreasonable man

elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more

sidney and elwell

in picking it up elwell clearly implies his readiness to
accept the item  on conditions  sidney in his turn gets
this point  he turns towards the passing waiter

                         sidney
            waiter  the check

                                            lap dissolve to

int sidneys apartment  night

rita is in the bedroom  she appears to have some familiarity
to the premises she hears the doorbell  she makes swift
adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a
drink as she carries it through to answer the door

sidneys office

the outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk
rita crosses and goes to the door  sidneys shadow can be
seen through the frosted glass  at the door rita opens it
slowly and with a seductive manner

                         rita
                   coyly
            hi

sidney steps into the room  rita begins to close the door
prior to stepping into his embrace  sidney puts one arm
about her  but now she reacts to

another angle

otis elwell stands on the landing outside  in most
gentlemanly fashion he takes off his hat

rita

this new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl

                         sidney
                   unembarrassed
            rita say hello to otis elwell

                         rita
                   with no welcome whatsoever
            hello

another angle

elwell is not unaware of his cool reception  he glances at
sidney as he comes into the room  but his manner is suave

                         elwell
            friends call me otis  sometimes
            tricky otis

                         sidney
            otis was outraged when i told him
            van cleve was going to fire you
            tell him not to pay any attention
            to anything youknowwho says about
            youknowwhat
                   to otis
            right otis

                         elwell
            right

elwell sits down on the sette stretches his limbs smiles
at the girl  rita still says nothing  sidney mistakes her
attitude for acquiescence  he swallows his drink sets it
down

                         sidney
            i thought you two could talk the
            whole thing over till i got back

rita looks at him sharply

                         rita
            back

                         sidney
            one of those business meetings
            honey  always coming up in the
            middle of the night

he grins at rita  she doesnt respond  turning she goes
swiftly through the door into the bedroom

                         rita
                   sharply
            hold on  you can drop me off on
            your way

emphasizing the asperity in her voice she closes the door
behind her

another angle

elwell looks at sidney sidney looks at elwell  elwell gets
up slowly from the settee

                         elwell
                   amused by acid
            consternation reigns

sidney is uncomfortable not sure how elwell is taking the
rejection  elwell glances at his wristwatch lays down his
drink

                         sidney
                   quickly
            now otis

elwell shrugs remarks pleasantly but with significance

                         elwell
            i hate jj  but not that much at
            this moment

                         sidney
            give me a chance 

he goes into the bedroom closing the door after him

int bedroom

rita is in a flurry of indignation  sitting on the bed she
is fastening one highheeled shoe  sidney stands glaring at
her

                         sidney
            dont you know who that man is

                         rita
                   bitingly
            yeah  otis elwell  the columnist

                         sidney
                   nodding with emphasis
            yeah

                         rita
                   aggressively
            and hes a perfect stranger to me

                         sidney
                   explosively
            so take five minutes  get
            acquainted  hes an important
            man  hes lonely  dont be dumb

rita who one shoe on has begun to search for the other

                         rita
            what do you want all of a sudden 
            lady godiva  wheres my other
            shoe

                         sidney
            what kind of an act is this

rita jumps to her feet  her righteous indignation is
handicapped by the lopsided stance caused by the lack of
one shoe

                         rita
            dont you think i have any feelings
            what am i  a bowl of fruit  a
            tangerine that peels in a minute

                         sidney
                   caustic
            i beg your pardon  i turn myself
            inside out to help you and now im
            a heavy
                   stooping swiftly as
                   he discovers her shoe
            heres your shoe theres your
            coat thats the door

contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her
arms  the positive force of his manner gives the girl pause
there is a silence  rita searches for words to explain the
offense to her sensibilities

                         rita
            sidneyii dont do this sort
            of thing

                         sidney
            what sort of thing

                         rita
                   emphatic
            this sort of thing

                         sidney
                   as emphatic
            listen you need him for a favor
            dont you  and so do i  i need
            his columntonight
                   then
            didnt you ask me to do something
            about your job  dont you have a
            kid in military school

a pause  sidney has struck brutally home  ritas lower lip
trembles

                         rita
            youre a snake falco  youre a
            louse a real louse

sidneys manner becomes swiftly sympathetic  but still
urgent

                         sidney
                   persuasively
            honey  hes going to help you
            you want to lose your job

rita begins to waver her moral indignation losing ground
before sidneys reminders of her dire necessity

                         rita
                   remonstrating
            a girl needs a little romancing
            before she 

                         sidney
                   cutting in
            next time ill call in a guy to
            paint silver stars on the ceiling

                         rita
                   in a small voice
            what would you think of me if 

                         sidney
                   cutting in to
                   reassure her
            nothing i didnt think of you before

                         rita
                   dryly with significance
             thats what i mean

this attempt at humor signals to sidney that he has brought
her round  he comes to her pats her in an encouraging
manner  to which she does not respond

he turns to the door and picks up the glasses she has set
down on the table behind it

                         sidney
                   as he opens the door
            how many snorts does it take to put
            you in that tropical island mood

sidney goes out

sidneys office

elwell overhears the last remark and as sidney passes him
he winks  while sidney pours another drink elwell faces
the doorway  rita comes into it stands on the threshold
she is still far from enthusiastic

                         elwell
                   an inspiration
            havana  thats where we met

rita shakes her head morosely  sidney comes and puts a
stiff drink into her hand  elwell raises the glass toasting
the girl encouraging her to drink  rita responds dimly

                         rita
                   to otis
            heres mud in your column

sidney laughs more from relief than from the joke

                         sidney
            blessings on thee the bothwell
            gotta run now  see you two kids
            later

                         elwell
                   lightly
            hurry back

at the door sidney takes cheerful leave of them

                         sidney
            dont do anything i wouldnt do
            that gives you lots of leeway

hallway outside sidneys apartment

closing the door sidney seems pleased with himself  he
goes swiftly down the stairs

int sidneys office

rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two
rooms  there is an uncomfortable silence  elwell carries
it off by coming to the girl offering her a cigarette  she
accepts it  elwell studies her smiling affectionately
rita meets his eyes avoids them again then quietly offers
the information

                         rita
            palm springs  two years ago

elwell begins to laugh  whatever the memory it seems to
amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh

                         elwell
                   delighted
            thats right

rita drinks  she adds glumly

                         rita
            dont tell sidney

elwell continues to laugh as we

eyes and then physically follows them rising to stroll
towards the glass doors onto the terrace  he moves out and
turns aside to look in at the adjoining window which
belongs to susans bedroom

mary hunseckers secretary occupies a cubicle which is
separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition
from the big room beyond comes the hum and chatter of a big
newspaper  the walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a
big newspaper  the walls of marys cubicle are covered with
photographs filing cabinets are piled high with unopened
mail two wire service teletype machines click desultorily
mary is plain but attractive past 30 a levelheaded woman
with a sense of integrity  she is on the phone just now
bored with the insistent voice on the other end  beside her
an earnest young lawyer waits with several papers in hand

                         mary
                   to phone

            secretary  no  nor can i agree
            that can retraction is necessary
            thank you for calling

sidney has come through the newsroom in background  he
pauses tactfully seeing mary occupied with the lawyer

                         lawyer
                   huffily
            i fail to see whats amusing about
            these papers

                         mary
            ill get the boss to sign them

            youve said that six times  thats
            why im smiling

as the disgruntled lawyer leaves sidney comes in wearing
his most winning smile  with a glance after the lawyer
making sure that he is not observed sidney greets mary
assuming a brogue

                         sidney
            hello mary me darlin and phwat
            are ye up to today

sidneys hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which
indicates a certain intimacy between them

                         mary
            thats a question i usually like to
            ask you  your secretary phoned

                         sidney
            what about

                         mary
                   shrugging
            something about a frank dangelo
            trying to reach you

sidney reaches for the phone  as he does so mary hesitates
and glances at a copy of the record which lies on the desk
open at otis elwells column  she picks it up

                         mary
                   continuing
            is that the man who manages susies
            boyfriend

sidney murmurs casually yeah  why as he dials  mary
holds up the paper indicating the item

                         mary
            have you seen this  in otis
            elwells column
                   reads
            the dreamy marijuana smoke of a
            lad who heads a highbrow jazz
            quintet is giving an inelegant odor
            to that elegant east side club
            where he works  thats no way for
            a cardholding party member to act
            moscow wont like you naughty boy

sidney accepts the paper from mary examines the item while
he talks to sally on the phone

                         sidney
                   into phone
            sally  i got the message  if
            dangelo calls again tell him ill
            be at the office around noon

he hangs up continuing to read

                         mary
            could this be that boy

                         sidney
                   casually
            dallas  could be  he doesnt look
            like a reefer smoker

he discards the paper with a show of disinterest  mary
picks it up again

                         mary
                   looking at the
                   record again
            if this is true jjs going to
            hit the ceiling

sidney moves around behind mary  his eyes are fixed on a
spike which sits on marys desk  on it is impaled a proof
of hunseckers column  meanwhile he remarks

                         sidney
            can it be news to you that jjs
            ceiling needs a plaster job every
            six weeks

from sidneys viewpoint hunseckers column  the shot is
just too distant for us to be able to read the print

sidney and mary

sidney is looking at the column  mary is concentrated on
papers before her  without looking up she is clearly aware
of sidneys efforts to read the proof

                         mary
                   quietly
            sidney you know that jj doesnt
            like people to look at the column
            proof in advance

sidney caught in flagrante laughs

                         sidney
            mary im not people  theres
            falco blood sweat and tears in
            that column

he turns away changing the subject apparently

                         sidney
            how about dinner tonight

mary turns to study him

                         mary
            bribing me again

                         sidney
                   uncomfortable under
                   her scrutiny
            and why should i bribe the woman
            who holds most of my heart

mary is thoughtful  without malice in a detached sort of
way she examines sidney

                         mary
            youre a real rascal sidney  id
            certainly dislike you if i didnt
            like you  youre an amusing boy
            but there isnt a drop of respect
            in you for anything alive  youre
            too immersed in the theology of
            making a fast buck  not that i
            dont sometimes feel that you yearn
            for something better

sidney finds this analysis hard to take  again he tries to
laugh his way out of it

                         sidney
                   cynical
            mary dont try to sell me the
            brooklyn bridge  i happen to know
            it belongs to the dodgers

mary smiling decides to let him off the hook  she takes
the spike and the column and passes it across to sidneys
side of the desk as she returns briskly to her business

                         mary
                   affably
            i dont mind you looking at the
            proof of the column in advance as
            long as jj doesnt know  but
            dont do it like a boy stealing gum
            from a slot machine

sidney doesnt like this but on the other hand he does
want to look at the column  after only a momentary struggle
he picks the column off the spike and reads

                         sidney
            who put this item in about the
            comic
                   reading
            if theres a more hilarious funny
            man around than herbie temple at
            the palace youll have to pardon
            us for not catching the name  we
            were too busy screaming does this
            temple have a press agent

                         mary
            no  its one of jjs occasional
            beau gestes  evidently the fellows
            funny so he gave him a plug

he goes to the door grinning

                         sidney
            whats your favorite ribbon to go
            around your favorite chocolates

                         mary
            lets wait till christmas  its
            more legitimate then

she looks after sidney thinks about him for a moment  then
she types

confidently into the alleyway paying no attention to the
old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs
next to the entrance  the doorman turns protesting

                         doorman

hand with generous amiability

                         sidney
            no i dont mind  im busy too

                         temple
                   scowling
            good  were all off to utica so
            excuse me mr frannisonthe
            portisan

sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor  the
chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth

                         sidney
            but can i ask one impertinent
            question here  with no criticism
            intended because i know al you
            earn your ten percent how come you
            let a sock act like herbie temple
            tiptoe through town without a
            publicity build

smiling wise evans shakes his head

                         evans
            were not buying it falco  no
            fish today

sidney presses as if annoyed

                         sidney
            im not selling  im just curious
            thats all

temple turns away from sidney leaving him to evans

                         temple
            answer the man al if he asks you
            a question  quick before he
            thinks up another

evans moves to sidney trying to shepherd him out the way he
came

                         evans
            mr temple doesnt believe in press
            agents  does that answer you
            something

another angle

evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on sidneys elbow
sidney doesnt like people touching him  he reacts in
anger as we have seen before  fixes a burning eye on evans

                         sidney
            take your hand off lump
                   more politely to temple
            no one believes in press agents
            temple when they make claims they
            cant perform  i got nothing to
            sell  i didnt come here to
            peddle  but if i tell a client
            that hunsecker will give him space
            its not just talk

sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor
evans angry is stalled for a moment of delay action by
mention of the magic name of hunsecker

                         evans
                   after hesitation
            listen you bull artist  

                         temple
            let him go al

dialing

him a copy of the tabloid the record  it is folded open at

sidneys manner is a little too vigorous in adopting an
aggressive tone he is really trying to needle steve
steve though on the verge of losing his temper is sharp
enough to notice the point

sidneys reaction to the mention of susans name gives steve
food for thought  while he waits for susan to be summoned
to the phone he studies sidney

int hunseckers penthouse  susans bedroom  day

susan is on the phone  listening to what steve says she is
frightened  almost too frightened it is as if in some
curious sense she had been expecting this blow  it brings
an echo of an earlier tragedy

            smear  where are you

steve is on the phone in foreground the others watching him
in particular sally who stands near steve is studying him
with obvious sympathy  she looks slowly towards sidney

                         steve
                   to the phone
            were on our way to the elysian
            room to dicker with van cleve

he hangs up quietly looks at sidney and walks towards the
door

                         steve
            come on frank

another angle

as the door closes behind steve frank follows more slowly
as dangelo reaches the door he pauses with his hand on the
doorknob and turns back to study sidney

sidney

he feels uneasy under dangelos scrutiny  sally in
background is also watching sidney

                         sidney
                   to dangelo
            what are you looking at

dangelo

he does not answer for a moment  the unspoken accusation in
his look is very clear  then

                         dangelo
                   quietly
            the ugly world sidney

dangelo shakes his head

                         dangelo
            no  im interested in his future

dangelo goes slowly out

resume sidney

he hesitates before turning towards sally because he
realizes that this exchange with dangelo must have confirmed
sally in her suspicions

sally

her face shows that sidney is right  sally is deeply hurt
disillusioned

another angle

sidney turns to her challenging

                         sidney
            whats the matter

                         sally
                   not looking at him
            nothing

resentfully sidney moves about the room  sensing the
silent accusation against him he is aggressive

                         sidney
            you know sally sometimes i get
            the impression you think you live
            in starbright park  this is life
            kid  get used to it

sidney comes to the phone on her desk  he dials  then he
glances swiftly at sally and carrying the phone walks into
the bedroom dragging the long cord behind him

int bedroom

when the phone comes alive sidney pushes the bedroom door
shut  the gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make
it  keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard
in the other room he says

                         sidney
                   to phone
            nikko is mr hunsecker there
            this is mr falco  well have him
            call me as soon as he can  its
            important

he sets the phone down on the bedside table looks at it
thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door opens
it and goes back into the office

int office

sidney stands on the threshold studying sally  his manner
is now more sympathetic as he asks

                         sidney
            did you send my folks in philly the
            check

                         sally
            yes

leaving the bedroom door open sidney comes up to her
watches her shrewdly cautiously

                         sidney
                   softly
            i put a lotta trust in you
            chickie

                         sally
                   lowvoiced
            i know you do sidney

                         sidney
            dont judge a situation where you
            dont know whats involved

sally is putting paper in the typewriter trying to hold her
head up

                         sally
            im not judging

sidney comes closer to her  he puts his hand on the nape of
her neck carrassing her  under his touch the girl is
unhappy and yet at the same time responsive  sidney still
has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame
feeling her relaxed sidney bends and kisses her on the side
of the throat with more than negligence for something about
her always excites him his aggression tune in with her
submissiveness

                         sally
                   pathetically
            i swear sidney i cant help it 
            sometimes i wonder what i see in

the phone in the bedroom rings  sidney reacting sharply
forgets his advances to sally as he turns towards the bedroom

                         sidney
                   exhilarated

he goes into the bedroom closing the door as he goes
sally looks at the closed door

int bedroom

sidney has picked up the phone

                         sidney

overlooking the manhattan skyline  the papers are at

hunsecker pauses eyes full of cold voltage

                         hunsecker

            about

            at the tv  three oclock

he bangs down the phone tense thought in his manner

int sidneys apartment

sally is busy with her typing again but in a depressed mood
when sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down
on her desk again  he seems satisfied with himself smug
sally watches him for a moment  then

                         sally
            what are you going to do

sidney prepares to leave the apartment  his tone is full of
confidence selfassertive  for once sidney is certain
that he is smarter more cunning than even hunsecker

                         sidney
                   the wise one
            chickie a lotta people think

int hunseckers living room

jj has not moved he is thoughtful and morose  nikko the
japanese butler comes in to remove the breakfast table

                         hunsecker
            the table can wait  no calls  i
            have to think about my tv show

            later
                         hunsecker
                   abruptly
            did you put the bread out on the
            terrace for the birds

                         nikko
            yes but they dont come no more
            this time of year

smiling nikko leaves  hunsecker picks up a pencil and
makes a note on a pad about birds no doubt  abruptly he
looks up calling

                         hunsecker
            susie  come in a minute dear

she has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room  she
comes forward to him her manner is serious and wary  his
act is one of a tasteful mammy singer but he is watchful
too

                         hunsecker
            susie youre very much in my
            thoughts today

                         susan
            why

                         hunsecker
            what a question dear with that
            newspaper in your hand

                         susan
                   pausing
            did sidney tell you about it

                         hunsecker
            yes he phoned  i dont know this
            boy too well  anything in these
            charges

she shakes her head

                         hunsecker
            not being partial are you

                         susan
                   with quiet certainty
            no im not  im not

he soothes smiles indulgent but watchful

                         hunsecker
            susie take it easy  ill trust
            your judgment  you dont have to
            protest with me

with a paternal gesture of affection he holds out his arms
inviting her into his comforting embrace  not wanting to
she walks into his open waiting arms

                         hunsecker
            why are you trembling dear

                         susan
            history repeats itself  everything
            that happened to alan lesliebegan
            with a smear like this

hunsecker considers this gravely as if it was a new and
troubling thought

                         hunsecker
            yes

she leaves his arms he watches keenly

                         susan
                   incoherent
            its just as if ive seen a ghost
            today

                         hunsecker
                   quickly
            but that wasnt your fault dear
            what happened to leslie  ive told
            you that a million times

he goes to her gently she appraises both him and her
wrenched life with brooding frightened eyes

                         susan
            then whose fault was it jj  it
            was someones fault wasnt it

                         hunsecker
                   gravely
            i wouldnt have called the boy
            exactly balanced

                         susan
                   stronger
            alan was notunbalanced when i
            married him  and he was
            notindifferent to women no
            matter what they said
                         hunsecker
                   simply
            im not fighting with you puss

she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation

                         susan
            he never would have killed himself
            if i hadnt gone through with the
            annulment  dont you see that made
            all the rumors seem true  i should
            have stood up for himnot run out

she turns to hunsecker her manner firmer

                         sidney
            jj i want you to get them back
            their job steve and the quintet

                         hunsecker
                   incredulously
            you mean theyve been fired already
            on the basis of this crude smear

he walks away with a wag of indignation  but turns asking

                         hunsecker
            susie youre sure there isnt some
            fire where theres this much smoke

susan shakes her head emphatically

                         sidney
                   earnestly
            i know steve  no

                         hunsecker
            then maybe you can tell me if hes
            as solid as you say why does he
            rap me every chance he gets

                         susan
                   involuntarily
            sidney is a liar

                         hunsecker
            who said sidney

                         susan
                   defiantly
            i said sidney

staring he pauses then he deftly changes the subject

                         hunsecker
            you know dear were drifting
            apart you and i and i dont like
            that

                         susan
            i thought we were talking about
            sidney

                         hunsecker
                   with rasp
            let me finish dear  you had your
            say now let me have mine

                         susan
                   interrupting
            i havent said anything yet jj
            but if 

susan hesitates  hunsecker waits for her to continue  but
she isnt yet sure enough of herself or of the point she
means to make  she turns away

                         hunsecker
                   gently
            i started to say were drifting
            apart  a year ago in your wildest
            dreams would you have walked by
            that door without taking up this
            situation with me  today i had to
            call you in

                         susan
            im taking up the situation with
            you now

                         hunsecker
                   interrupting
            susie i want to help you
            theres nothing i wont do for you
            youre all ive got in the whole
            wide world

hunsecker strides about elaborately playing on a note of
disillusion and pain

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            well what have i got  alimony to
            a pair of tramps  theyre of no
            concern to me  its you who count
            but dont get me wrong  i dont
            intend to let you break your neck
            again

                         sidney
            jj you said you want to help
            me  prove it

                         hunsecker
                   quietly
            how

                         sidney
            get steve back his jobplease

                         hunsecker
                   pausing
            he means that much to you

                         sidney
                   simply
            yes
                   then
            with your prestige it only takes
            a minute  ten cents worth of
            american tel and tel

                         hunsecker
            youre picking up my lingo hon

                         sidney
                   levelly
            i read your column every day

he looks at her with pursed lips and for a change some
real interest  her level straightforward manner has pinned
him down completely he shows a slow charming grin as he
goes for a private phone book

                         hunsecker
            susie i like this new attitude of
            yours  youre growing up and i
            like it  i dont like it when
            youre limp and dependent when
            youre odd and wayward  this gives
            you a chance for real survival in a
            very lousy world  because dont
            forget dear you wont always have
            me with you will you

                         sidney
            no i wont

he crosses to the white desk phone delaying dialing for a
moment

                         hunsecker
            this dallas boy must be good for
            you  why not bring him around
            today before the show  this time
            ill clean my glasses for a better
            look

susan doesnt like this idea is evasive

                         sidney
            im not sure i can reach him in time

                         hunsecker
                   easily
            sure you can if you want to and i
            know youll want to
                   then
            by the way whats your beef
            against little sidney

                         susan
                   steadily
            when im certain ill let you
            know

                         hunsecker
            a man couldnt ask for a squarer
            shake
                   into phone
            let me have billy van cleve
                   then
            dont ever tell anyone susie how

ext tv theatre  day

camera shoots towards the entrance to the tv theatre  a
line of people are queuing for hunseckers tv broadcast
which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance  a
taxi drives up in foreground susan hunsecker gets out

sidney

sidney comes up sixth avenue towards the theatre  as he
reaches the corner of the building he halts having seen

susan

susan is seen in the act of paying the driver  as the taxi
pulls away susan walks camera left

tv theatre

susan pauses deciding not to enter the theatre turning she
looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside

sidney

sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach susan
he glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that
direction

sidestreet

sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance
through which are emerging some tv technicians  he slips
inside

int tv station

hunsecker is standing at a table stop watch in hand
reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and
timing  beside him sits mary busy typing more of the
material from hunseckers handwritten note  mary is calm
but he is irritable trying to concentrate despite the
bustle around him

an old movie star mildred tam sits waiting in one of the
canvasbacked chairs supplied for the guests on the show
burton a manager also waits deadpan at hunseckers elbow
hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads

                         hunsecker
            i was reminded of it this morning
            when i noticed that the birds had
            gone south  we want the same kind
            of freedom for ourselves  thats
            what the man said
                   he clicks the watch
                   pauses to underline
                   the phrase continues
            a man has the right to face his
            accusers  thats the american way
            who said  the man said  from

he turns in exasperation to burton

                         hunsecker
            burton dont stand around  if i
            go over ill cut some items off the
            tail

burton departs  mary whips a second sheet out of the
typewriter hands it to hunsecker  as he accepts it
hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium

sidney

shooting towards the auditorium from hunseckers viewpoint
sidney mounts the steps onto the stage  seeing that the
columnist is surrounded but knowing that jj wants to talk
to him privately sidney loiters so that jj can join him
as soon as he chooses to  camera pulls back to include
hunsecker  only momentarily distracted by private
considerations connected with sidneys arrival hunsecker
returns to the business of timing the script  he clicks the
watch again

                         hunsecker
            from washington through to
            jefferson from lincoln and fdr
            right up to today  the democratic
            way of life  thats what the man
            said  nowadays it doesnt export
            to well
                   then concluding
            but you knowand i knowthat
            our best secret weapon is demo
            cracy
                   dropping to a modest tone
            lets never forget it ladies and
            gentlemen

another angle

sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening
rapt to hunseckers words  sidney is less impressed with
jjs eloquence  at the conclusion mildred applauds
lightly  she stands up and moves towards jj  jj wants
to talk to sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star

                         mildred tam
            thats grand just grand jj
                   then anxiously
            is my makeup all right  you know
            despite the scads of movies ive
            made ive never appeared on tv
            yet

                         hunsecker
                   cutting her short
            of course mildred  of course
            you look fine
                   swiftly summoning mary
            mary help miss tam  anything she
            wants shes our star today

under the pretense of studying the typed script jj walks
away across the stage  sidney strolls after him

another angle

a tracking shot  sidney comes up beside hunsecker falls
into step beside him  as they cross towards a water cooler
at the back of the stage they talk in rapid undertone

                         hunsecker
            i got that boy coming over here

                         sidney
                   who is smiling faintly
            with a pocket fulla firecrackers 
            good

                         hunsecker
                   narrowly

                   shrugging
            cant hurt

                         hunsecker
                   incredulously

            his job

                         sidney

            the job

                         sidney
                   impatiently
            no thats the point  he wont
            accept your favor  the manager
            yes but not the boy

a pause  hunsecker renumerates

                         hunsecker
            well hes got her in a tizzy ill
            tell you that

                         sidney
            sure he steams her up  wants her
            to stand on her own two feet and
            all that jazz

                         hunsecker
            and whos feet is she on now

                         sidney
            presumably yours
                   a hasty addition
            thats according to st dallas

                         hunsecker
            whats this boy got that susie likes

                         sidney
            integrity  acute like indigestion

                         hunsecker
            what does that mean  integrity

                         sidney
                   repeating as before
            a pocket fulla firecrackers 
            looking for a match
                   grinning
            its a new wrinkle to tell the
            truth i never thought id make a
            killing on some guys integrity

hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration

                         hunsecker
            full of beans aint you  but you
            know that youll stand or fall by
            what youre doing now

                         sidney
                   grins confidently
            calculated risk  only we happen to
            know jj that you like me  im
            your star pupil  i reflect back
            to you your own talent

hunsecker permits himself a faint smile  burton is
approaching with script in hand

                         hunsecker
            i wouldnt like to take a bite of
            you youre a cookie full of arsenic

sidney smirks  he turns away and goes off towards the
auditorium in the background

ext tv station  day

frank dangelo pays a taxi out of which he and steve have
just emerged  frank turns towards the boy resuming a
conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the
entrance of the theatre

                         steve
                   depressed
            i still think hes responsible for
            the smear

                         dangelo
            not that im convinced but youll
            never prove it in a million years
                   gently
            steve youll do what you want but
            it cant hurt he offers you an
            olive branch  so today like olives

                         steve
            i guess youre right but 

steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head
compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult

dangelo

dangelo studies the boy with a paternal affection

                         dangelo
            steve sometimes its better not to
            look at your own honesty but to
            look the other man in the face
            not because youre my meal ticket 
            which you are  but because i like
            you and the boys please take my
            advice we 

dangelo stops halted by an expression which he sees in
steves face

steve

he is looking through the glass doors of the tv theatre no
longer listening to dangelos words his face has hardened
in anger

int tv theatre foyer

from steves viewpoint  sidney has come out of the curtained
entrance to the auditorium  camera pulls back to include
steve in foreground  with a movement that suggests his
annoyance at discovering sidney present steve jerks open
the glass door and moves in

another angle

susan is waiting in the foyer  she is standing in a position
where she has not been able to see steve until he enters
now she moves forward to greet him  as soon as she is near
him she speaks in a quiet urgent manner

                         susan
                   in an undertone
            steve before we go in  id like
            to

but she too is halted as steve lays a hand on her arm
seeing his look over her shoulder she turns

sidney

he is already strolling forward to join them  camera pans
with him to include susie steve and dangelo

                         sidney
            hey susie  this is a real
            surprise  not one but three

steve shakes the hand that the smiling hunsecker gives

                         hunsecker
            well son looks like you went out
            and bought yourself a packet of
            trouble

                         steve
            youve been very kind about it mr

            her word that there was nothing to

            have my say about smears on the
            show today  thats why id like
            your personal assurance too

                         steve
                   quietly
            mr hunsecker theres nothing to
            that smear  you have my sincere
            word

                         hunsecker
                   nodding judicially
            ill by that son  now you owe me
            a favor
                   pausing to susan
            be good to my kid sister

                         sidney
                   solemnly
            yeah shes had a peck of trouble
            for a kid

hunsecker flicks a look at sidney  no one else warier by
the minute knows what to say  hunsecker purrs onward

                         hunsecker
            susie likes to keep her girlish
            secrets  but in her heart of
            hearts i imagine dallas that she
            fancies you in an uncommon way
            now what about you son  not just
            tomcatting aroundi hope

                         susan
                   quickly
            jj steve isnt

hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature

                         hunsecker
            take it easy susie  he wouldnt
            be much of a man if he didnt
            understand my concern  would you
            son

                         steve
                   pausing quietly
            no i wouldnt

                         hunsecker
                   nodding

            like your style son  in a world
            of old rags and bones i like it
            for instance take sidney

hunsecker crosses toward sidney

                         hunsecker contd
            if sidney got anywhere near susie
            id break a bat over sidneys head
                   smiling faintly
            sidney lives so much in a moral
            twilight that when i said you were
            coming here he predicted disaster
            you wouldnt take my favor  youd
            chew up the job he said and spit
            it right back in my face
                   sniffing
            any truth in that

dangelo steve and susan

steve is thrown for a loss momentarily frank steps in

                         sidney
                   provocatively
            frank you dont listen  jj just
            told you to shut your mouth

                         steve

            shut yours  who are you to tell a
            man like frank dangelo to shut up

                   warningly
            steve that isnt important 

but steve on a heated rip has turned to hunsecker

                         steve
            does he have to be here in our hair

hunsecker

                         hunsecker
            why has he bothered you before

steve dangelo and susan

                         steve
            is it news to you

hunsecker

                         hunsecker
            son lots of people tell me im a
            gifted man but i still cant see
            around corners

group shot

                         hunsecker
                   tolerantly
            just exactly what are you so hot
            about
                   waiting
            i mean i know its a difficult
            thing to be an artist in this
            crudest of possible worlds but 

                         steve
                   impatiently
            nuts  im not here as an artist
            im here as an average joe who
            happens to love your sister susie

                         hunsecker
                   with ironic smirk
            well just be careful you dont
            knock her down huh

steve stops dead  then strangely and dangerously he picks
up hunseckers smile  on each mans face the smile broadens
and grows up into a chuckle from each but the meanness
still flickers around hunseckers mouth  steve is out of
the net

                         hunsecker
                   affably
            frankly son you lost me on that
            last hill  just give us the punch
            line

                         steve
                   agreeably
            no punch line  maybe i was just
            admiring your knowhowyours and
            falcos

hunsecker and sidney

                         hunsecker
            why do you keep coupling me with
            falco

steve dangelo and susan

                         steve
                   innocently
            hes here isnt he  do you think
            sir when he dies hell go to the
            dog and cat heaven

hunsecker and sidney

even hunsecker smiles  sidney likes neither the ridicule or
the turn of events  he moves quickly past camera

sidney steve dangelo and susan

sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack steve

                         sidney
            lets forget cats and dogs and
            other pseudoliterary remarks

            about that big rumpus in my office
            today  you were there frank
            where according to st dallas jj
            was responsible for the elwell smear

playing along nicely hunsecker looks at steve and frank and
slowly removes his arm from susan he pauses before asking
dallas

                         hunsecker
            what about that

                         dangelo
                   uneasily
            steve was excitedhe didnt mean
            it exactly the way its stated
            here

                         hunsecker

  what he likes to            jj i dont want to say

with a roar hunsecker takes them both out of play he stands
up

sidney steve dangelo

hunsecker enters from behind camera

                         hunsecker
            both of you keep quiet
                   to sidney

                   to steve quieter

steve is cornered the other completely out of play  he
pauses

            falco selling me ethics  whos the

            ask questions  and your snide
            remarks

            respect what youre saying

switching his leonine tail hunsecker looks broodingly at
susie  frank says one beseeching word steve but no
one hears him

                         hunsecker
            susie did you know about this
            accusation

            dont even have my sisters welfare
            at heart

steve and susan

steve hesitates defensively but cant resist a small smile
he moves nearer to susan

                         steve
            mr hunsecker youve got more
            twists than a barrel of pretzels

            give him creditthe boys gall is
            gorgeous

                         steve

            say

                         hunsecker
                   sardonically
            thats stout of you dallas but
            susie may not care to air her
            dismal views in public

steve walks to susie trying to lift her with his hopes and
air of gentle urging and support

                         steve
            susie

susan

she stares at the floor

resume reverse angle

hunsecker doesnt like the drift of things his mouth
tightens and he speaks to susan with veiled warning

                         hunsecker
            susie as always is free to say
            anything she thinks  go on dear
            say exactly whats on your mind
            dear

                         steve
            those dears sound like daggers
            may i suggest that you stop daring
            her to speak

                         hunsecker
            may i lift my eyebrows  what is
            this  what are you trying to do

                         steve
                   strongly
            im trying to get susie to stand up
            to you  but your manner is so
            threatening that shes afraid to
            speak

                         hunsecker
            son you raise your voice again and
            youll be outa here on your golden
            pratt

susan

suddenly susan lets loose with restrained nervous energy
she is near to tears

                         susan
            steve if only for my sake i want
            this stopped  and the same goes
            for you too jj

hunsecker

he interjects

                         hunsecker
                   contritely
            susie im sorry if

                         susan
                   bitterly
            sometimes i think all men are
            fools

restraining tears she runs up the steps to the stage

steve hunsecker and sidney

steve looks after her  sidney watches intently  hunseckers
smile is frostily taunting

                         hunsecker
            you see dallas a plague on both
            our houses
                   then
            we may have to call this game on
            account of darkness

steve turns a blankeyed stare at him  tension gone a slow
mumbling fatigue has set in  hunsecker plays it light

                         hunsecker
            if looks could kill im dead

                         steve
                   slowly
            no i dont care about you 
            youre fantastic  my whole
            interest if its not too late is
            in susieand how to undo what
            youve done to her

                         hunsecker
                   smiling
            and what have i done to her
            besides not buy her a new fur coat
            lately  sidney you were right 
            the boys a dilly

                         steve
                   stung
            why  because i dont like the way
            you toy with human lives  your
            contempt and malice  because i
            wont be the accomplice of your
            sick ego  and the way its crippled
            susie  you think of yourself 
            you and your column  you see
            yourself as a national glorybut
            to me and thousands of others like
            me you and your slimy scandal
            your phony patriotics  to me mr
            hunsecker you are a national
            disgrace

                         hunsecker
                   blandly
            son i dont fancy shooting
            mosquitoes with elephant guns  so
            suppose you just shuffle along and
            call it a day

he turns and stares away but steve stops him with

                         steve
            but my day with susie isnt over
            yet and

                         hunsecker
                   cold
            tenll get you fifty youre playing
            hookey from a padded cell

stage

hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium sidney
following closely behind  in background beyond steve and
dangelo are walking up the aisle to the exit  camera
tracks close on sidney and hunsecker  hunseckers face is
rigid  sidney close at his elbow whispers

                         sidney
                   softly
            you did it jj you did it good

sidney is full of confidence  but hunsecker barely hears
him hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boys
attack in particular by the appalling fear that what steve
has said is the kind of thing which susan may also secretly
believe

another angle

susan is still standing in the wings  mary is with her
obviously sympathetic  the girl is drying her eyes with
kleenex and mary glances at her employer with a look of
reproach  hunsecker walks round the table obviously trying
to approach susan seeing this susan turns away and moves
further from him  hunsecker stops

hunsecker

there is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the
girl  more gently he moves forward past camera

susan

sensing the approach of hunsecker behind her she moves away
again she is still crying but is trying to recover
presently hunsecker approaches her again  he speaks very
gently soothingly comforting

                         hunsecker
                   softly
            you in a mood susie to run over
            to milgrims later and buy a few
            new frocks

                         susan
                   a small voice
            no  im going home

hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her

                         hunsecker
            want sidney to drive you over

ignoring the shake of her head he calls to sidney

                         hunsecker
            drive susie home

hunsecker

again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl
his eyes flick towards the stage behind him where sidney
stands watching  he moves gently forward and then speaks in
a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her
reassurance

                         hunsecker
            susieiid have to take it
            very much amiss if you ever saw
            that boy again

susan

after a pause she turns towards him she looks him straight
in the face

                         susan
                   levelly
            ill never see him again

resume hunsecker

he seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her
now he touches her  his need for her is apparent he tries
to reach her tries to find an excuse to embrace her  she
submits to this very passively

susan

a very close shot  we see the effort with which she is
controlling herself

resume two shot

satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister
hunsecker lets her go  susan moves away still avoiding his
eyes  then she goes off towards the steps down into the
auditorium  sidney looks at hunsecker then after susan and
follows her

resume hunsecker

he goes back to mary and the script  he instructs her

                         hunsecker
            call van cleve  tell him he was
            right  tell him i said the dallas
            boys are not worthy of his club

poring over the typewritten pages he senses marys eyes on
him  he speaks to her quietly without raising his head and
there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice

                         hunsecker
                   without looking up
            maryfor susies own gooddont
            give her misplaced sympathy

mary says nothing  hunsecker gathers his papers and with a
visible effort to resume his public personality turns
towards the machinery of the television broadcast in
background

int tv theatre foyer

susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street  sidney
comes behind her watchful as he overtakes her near the
doors  he goes past her to open the door for her

                         sidney
            ill get you a cab

susan stops dead

                         susan
                   coldly
            get away from me

she goes out into the street  beyond we see a crushing cab
hesitating sidney adds

                         sidney
            jj asked me to drive you over
            and 

but susan has already moved out of shot hurrying across the
sidewalk to hail the taxi

resume sidney

uncertain what to do whether to follow her or not he moves
after her

susan

she has already opened the door of the taxi  she turns to
see sidney come up behind her  as he enters shot she
repeats

                         susan
            i told you to leave  i dont know
            if stevell ever talk to me again
            and im ready to blame it all on you

she starts to get into the cab

sidney

alert he moves to detain her anxious to know exactly the
extent of her suspicion

                         sidney
            susie

another angle

as sidney steps up he grasps at the door of the taxi
trying to hold it open but susan pulls it shut catching
his fingers in the door  sidney steps back in pain

taxi

it drives off down sixth avenue

sidney

nursing the injury to his hand he looks after the
disappearing taxi  as he recovers from the pain his
expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal
susans suspicions maybe of less importance than some other
considerations

                                            dissolve to

int twenty one club washroom  night

hunsecker and sidney are washing in adjoining basins  coat
off the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence
sidney despite his throbbing bandaged finger is feeling
satisfied and selfconfident  he hums quietly  hunsecker
throws him annoyed sideglances but sidney refuses to
catch on  the following dialogue is spaced between the
washing the drying and haircombing

                         hunsecker
            so thats what integrity looks
            like  well im always willing to
            learn
                   later
            how is that slob dangelo your
            uncle

sidney no longer hums after a moment he answers

                         sidney
            my mothers sideher brother
            that reminds me jj susie looks
            run down  she can stand a vacation
            and so can you  people say oh
            the great jj hes made of
            iron but you can use a rest guy

sidneys cheerfulness annoys hunsecker

                         hunsecker
            what are you so chipper about  if
            i put a cross on every one of your
            mistakes youd look like a
            graveyard

                         sidney
                   smiling
            but not for anything i did today

                         hunsecker
            sidney i know human nature  susie
            lied to me  shell see that boy
            again

hunsecker moves out of shot

                         sidney
            youre right jj  she wont give
            him up but it doesnt matter
            because the real money ball is
            the boy not susan  and if 

hearing the sound of the door sidney turns sharply  camera
moves to discover that hunsecker has gone out  sidney
quickly finishing the brushing of his hair follows

int dining room  21 club

two waiters are fussing over hunseckers table at which
places are already set for sidney and hunsecker  matre d
hands him an envelope as he passes

                         matre d
            mr hunsecker this was to be
            delivered to you personally 

when the columnist comes up to the table the waiters
quickly pull out the table for him  sidney comes to join
him sidney gets some attention but considerably less
camera moves closer

                         hunsecker
            these drinks are warm

                         waiter
            you said you like to have them on
            your table

                         hunsecker
            what are you a critic

                         waiter
            ill change 

                         hunsecker
            forget it
                   to sidney
            the real money ball is the boy

                         sidney
            yeah the boywere on the verge
            of a farce a real farce  as i see
            it if susie had stood behind him
            today he might have proved a threat
            but since primarily hes wedded to
            his work hes not going to be able
            to take it

a waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at hunseckers
elbow

                         hunsecker
                   to waiter
            stop tinkering pal  that horse
            radish wont jump a fence

the waiter retreats rapidly

                         sidney
            in brief jj its all over
            because any hour now the boy will
            give her up  is it a farce or not

delicately salting his oysters hunsecker looks obliquely at
sidney

                         hunsecker
            this syrup youre giving out
            sidney you pour over waffles not
            jj hunsecker  what do you mean
            that lousy kid will give up my
            sister

hunsecker with a casual gesture tugs lightly at the end of
sidneys tie

hunseckers gesture is playful but it inflicts great injury
to sidneys dignity sidney cannot bear to be touched he
finds this liberty on jjs part as intolerable as anything
he has experienced and only with great difficulty controls
himself  the shot favors sidney

sidney and hunsecker

hunsecker continues

                         hunsecker
            are you listening

                         sidney
                   warily
            how does it matter whos sister
            the main thing theyre through
            and 

hunsecker

from sidneys viewpoint  without turning hunsecker
interrupts

                         hunsecker
            am i supposed to forget how that
            boy talked to me today

resume sidney and hunsecker

sidney senses a warning in hunseckers manner  he protests

                         sidney
            jj is he worthy of a second
            glance from a man like you  is he
            i mean

hunsecker

from sidneys viewpoint  pausing during the process of
eating hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket

                         hunsecker
            brief epitaph the boy was talking
            when he should have been listening
                   then
            bite on this

camera pulls back to include sidney as hunsecker tosses in
front of him an envelope  sidney opens it extracts two
steamship tickets

                         sidney
            steamship tickets
                         hunsecker
                   as he eats
            for the next sailing of the mary
            susans run down  shes never been
            abroad and as you so cogently put
            it im not made of iron

sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to hunsecker who
leaves it lying on the table before him

                         sidney
            thats good  now that louse is
            outa susies hair for good

sidney

he has an instinct to laugh but something tells him not to

hunsecker

as sidney makes no response hunsecker slowly carefully
continues in a voice which is dangerously soft

                         hunsecker
            i want that boy taken apart

sidney and hunsecker

shooting across hunsecker onto sidney  sidney puts down his
fork  he sees now that the issue is serious and must be
faced

                         sidney
                   seriously
            why do something that would drive
            them right back into each others
            arms  not to mention that this
            time susie would know who shot the
            arrow

                         hunsecker
                   interjecting quietly
            she knows now

                         sidney
                   quickly
            why give her real proof  you
            nearly ruined her with her first
            husband  and you were right
            jj  but she almost followed him
            out the window  what do you want 
            a chronic invalid

hunsecker

he wants no advice from sidney  he interrupts with quiet
savagery

                         hunsecker
            i know how to handle susie  you
            just handle the boy sidney
                   scribbles on scratch pad
            preferably tonight
                   pushes pad across to sidney


sidney and hunsecker

shooting across hunsecker onto sidney  sidney feels sick

                         sidney
            why whats tomorrow  a holiday

camera moves closer as sidney picks scratch pad up  we can
read two words get kello

                         sidney
            i think ill go home  maybe i left
            my sense of humor in another suit

hunsecker

hunsecker finishes eating  during the ensuing speech which
he begins quietly and sensibly hunseckers venomous feelings
are unexpectedly betrayed

                         hunsecker
            youve got that godgiven brain 
            learn to use it  do you think its
            a personal matter with me this boy
            are you telling me i see things in
            terms of personal pique  dont you
            see that today that boy wiped his
            feet on the choice on the
            predilections of sixty million men
            and women of the greatest country
            in the world  if you had any
            morals yourself you would
            understand the immorality of that
            boys stand today  it was not me
            he criticized  it was my readers

camera pulls back to include sidney  hunsecker manages to
control himself he reaches with nervous fingers toward his
scribbling pad

sidney

sidneys face has tightened  he has begun now to realize
the extent of this mans megalomania  after a moment he
says

                         sidney
            im leaving jj

shooting across hunsecker onto sidney  a waiter has come to
serve the next course  hunsecker appears relaxed but
sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his
hand  he speaks with a quaver in his voice for he has
worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish

hunsecker in fg

                   interrupting
            you little boy dont know who you
            are  talking around corners with

            hoping nobody else finds it out

sidney

a close up  he knows the truth of what is said  but he
takes refuge in quiet retaliation

                         sidney
            a little hunch occurs to me  you
            have just painted a selfportrait
            you know who you are because you
            scare people  thats what youve
            got against this boy  he

hunsecker is prepared to give it out but not take it

                         hunsecker

            i told you what i want you to do

has returned to his food

            jj i swear to you on my mothers
            life i wont do it
                   he leans even closer
            if you gave me your column i
            wouldnt do a thing like that

but as he speaks the last words sidneys voice falters
because he has glanced down at the table

sidney

we see that an idea has entered his head  an idea that
takes the wind out of his indignation  his eyes lift
rapidly to hunseckers face

                         hunsecker
                   delicately touching
                   the envelope
            and who do you think writes the
            column while susie and i are away
            for three months

camera shoots across sidney again onto hunsecker  hunsecker
leans back looks at sidney

seeing that sidney has accepted the proposition he smiles

                         hunsecker
                   softly
            thank you sidney

in a pleasantly affable way he leans across the table to
tap the hand with which sidney is leaning on the table

                         hunsecker
            and sidney ill have that piece
            of paper back

helplessly sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of
paper which he had meant to keep  hunsecker takes it  with
his eyes on sidney he slowly tears it up

dangelo is buying a cigar at the counter  he turns as
steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out
steve is in a gloomy irksome mood dangelo is sympathetic
and fatherly

                         steve
            shell be down in a minute

camera tracks with them as they come out into the hallway
they move towards the side entrance away from the elevators

                         dangelo
            what does she wanna see you about

the boy shrugs impatiently

                         steve
            she didnt say

some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting
elevator barely glancing at dangelo and the boy  dangelo
feels uneasy

                         dangelo
            i could think of better places to
            meet her instead of here  he
            lives on the whole top floor

                         steve
                   carelessly
            i doubt that it matters any more

dangelo

he addresses steve soberly

                         dangelo
            steve  you made a very dangerous
            enemy of him today  matter of

            ahead  if im any judge you hurt
            him today where he lives he
            wont forget it and he wont
            forgive

steve is silent  he hears the sound of the elevator door
opening and turns

susan comes out of the elevator the one farthest from them
and looks around

                         susan
                   as she comes forward
                   to join them
            good evening mr dangelo

dangelo acknowledges her greeting touches his hat and
retires tactfully  susan faces steve  its an awkward
meeting  each does not know where the other stands  she
has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak it
will keep slipping off  he is faintly embittered a little
hurt and baffled but he is sympathetic he is involved and
concerned

med close two shot over shoulder  susan to steve

                         susan
            hello steve  im glad you could
            come

as they enter the cafe the counterman looks up from counting
the days take at the far end

                         counterman
            too late for service

                         steve

the counterman goes to the urn for the coffee

susan and steve

a closer angle  they talk in quiet undertones  steve waits
for her to speak first she starts slowly hesitantly with
difficulty

            stevewhat you tried to do
            todayyou tried to take me up on
            a high mountaini couldnt go all
            the wayi failed you
                   a pause

                   then
            have i lost you steve  have i

                         steve
            well maybe i was wrong too but
            theres no doubt susie that we
            have to face some serious things

                         susan
            no ones ever stood up to my
            brother the way you did

                         steve
                   quietly to the point
            but you didnt do much about it
            susie  you walked out and there i
            wassoloand not too good at
            that

                         susan
            i just didnt think that i could
            antagonize him steve  for our
            sake i mean

steve

                         steve
            susie i was there for our sake
            too  but what a world it would be
            if we were all afraid to learn to
            walk and talk because it might
            offend poppa  by the way i think
            your brother was completely
            responsible for the smears

susan

this accusation is made lightly in passing  but susan
reacts to it trying to interject

                         susan

                         steve
                   overriding her
            but i dont care about that now
            he knew what he was doing today
            he was laying down the conditions
            under which he might consent to our
            marriage  if i would bend to every
            whim of his like sidney  i
            couldnt do that susie

susan

after a pause she says

                         susan
            youre saying goodbye arent you

steve flares up

                         steve
            no  im saying that for your sake
            you have to make a clean break with
            your brother

                         susan
                   wrenched
            but please steve please  one
            step at a time  i was born only
            yesterday

                         steve
                   pausing softer
            i told your brother i couldnt be
            his accomplice  i cant be yours
            either susie and encourage him to
            go on pulverizing you  i know what
            type  hes my old man all over

coffee cup which she has not touched  the coat slips from
her shoulders

steve stoops to pick it up replaces it on her shoulders

                         steve
            this beautiful coat is more than
            just a coat i hate it  its a
            mink straightjacket

susan turns to him  she is deflated lacking all will power

swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward
glance  he goes past dangelo who walks quietly after him
towards the exit in background

            not that i dont like her  shes a

            thank your stars that it turned out
            this way
                   changing the subject

devoted frank he shrugs  they walk past camera

elevator man pulls open the grille  susan still in the
mood in which steve left her stands in the elevator for a
moment before she realizes that she has reached the top
floor  as she walks out the elevator man looks at her
anxiously  camera pans with susan towards the door to the
apartment  susan fumbles for her key

int hunseckers penthouse

the apartment is dark as susan enters  she does not switch
on the lights  she walks through the shadows of the big
room which has a grim and menacing atmosphere  she kicks
off her shoes and hugging the coat about her for warmth
walks to the glass windows of the terrace  after a moment
she opens them and steps out

ext terrace  night

susan walks across the terrace  at this height the wind is
very strong  camera tracks with the girl emphasizing the
dizzying panorama of new york at night  the girls manner
is strange she moves as if under compulsion a sleepwalker
when she reaches the stone parapet she leans against it
with her body slumped still hugging the fur coat as if it
were some protection against her misery

ext from the terrace  night

vertically downward  from susans point of view  the stone
sidewalks of broadway are a terrifying distance below

susan

an angle shooting sharply upwards against the night sky
wind blows the girls hair as she looks fixedly downwards
her face is blank expressionless for a moment we may fear
for her afraid that she may have suicide in mind but
presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon

cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians
overcoats are hung

as he hangs up his coat sidney identifies the other coat a
black and white check raglan which he and we saw steve
wearing when he visited hunsecker at the tv studio

for him sidney is under tension

a waiter carrying a carton of beer cans comes out of the
doorway just behind sidney moving between him and the
overcoat  thus interrupted sidney turns away

cronies  drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood
of celebration

            so if you dont mind hell
            leave after this set

information  robard clamps dangelo on the shoulder
reassuring him with warm emphasis

number is now being played in the interior goodbye baby
a black car comes swiftly under the bridge turns into the
little square opposite the club braking sharply

onto the windshield where we see the insignia police
the occupants of the car are not visible

intext robards club

sidney lingers near the doorway of the club  he is looking
across the square towards the car which can be seen in bg
now he turns and walks towards the coat rack camera tracking
with him  he takes his own coat and as he thrusts his arm
into the sleeve contrives neatly to slip some unseen object
into the pocket of steves overcoat camera notes the
gesture but only very briefly  overscene a voice addresses
sidney

                         dangelo os
            hey

sidney

a close up  as he turns in swift apprehension we note the
moment of panic in his face

reverse angle

camera shoots past sidney in foreground towards dangelo who
advances on sidney  dangelos manner is unfriendly for an
instant we feel like sidney that dangelo may have seen
sidney tampering with steves coat but then we are reassured
as dangelo deliberately using sidneys surname says

                         dangelo
                   continuing
            mr falcoi hate to give you this
            satisfaction  they broke it off
            tonight for good

fears ungrounded

                         dangelo

            tell that to hunsecker  tell him

            all the marbles

more his face goes tense he asks himself does this
development  which he himself anticipated  change the
situation he turns away moving out of shot

camera moves with sidney as he walks towards the doorway
there he hesitates again he looks back into the club

from sidneys viewpoint  a long shot of steve on the
bandstand  camera pans deliberately towards the coatrack in
fg  a group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot
setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up
their coats clearly sidney could not now return to the
coat rack  even if he decided that he did want to undo his
handiwork

comes round the hood of the car the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him identifying harry kello  camera pans
as he walks to meet sidney

            hes leaving early  after this
            set  hell be out in a couple of
            minutes

they wait for a moment listening to the sound of the music
in the distance  it is a blues number goodbye baby kello
hums nonchalantly sidney glances at him with irritation
finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner

int police car

there are two plainclothes policemen inside one at the
wheel the other in the back seat  the latter leans forward
to ask the former

                         1st policeman

                         murph

            one of the lieutenants surprise
            parties i think

murphs tone shows obvious repugnance  the 1st policeman
broods for a moment he adds in a quiet but viciously
resentful manner

                         1st policeman
            one of these days id like to turn
            in my badge and tangle with popsie

            not going to look so good right in
            front of the club

to kello this is a great joke  he laughs enjoying sidneys
uneasiness  he begins to cat and mouse sidney

                         kello
                   heavily humorous
            its nice sidney that you give me
            this tip

            appreciate a thing like that  i
            appreciate where you are looking
            out for the virtue of the city

sidney annoyed at this sarcasm moves past kello not
deigning to respond  as he goes by kello grasps him
forcibly by the arm

music of dallas last number coming to an end

int robards club

the last bars of the number  enthusiastic applause

steve

he responds to the ovation nicely but a little wearily  he
gets down off the stand  there is too much noise to hear
his parting words to his fellow musicians but it is clear
that he is urging them to stay without him  he walks off
towards the entrance to the club

empty saloon occupied only by a solitary drinker at one end
of the long bar nursing a beer and by the bartender who is
making out a dope sheet  sidney enters strides to the bar
and throws down a jangling half dollar

while the change is made sidney stands with cocked head
listening in reality or imagination to what is happening
down the street  as the barman supplies the change sidney
goes to the juke box and loads it with nickels saying over
his shoulder

            see you after tonight  youll be
            the man who drove his little
            stainless sister to suicide
reverse angle

shaken sidney decides to ridicule the implied threat

                         sidney
            honey ill just have to smile at
            that

he walks past camera

resume susan

sidney walks into shot going past her on his way to the door

                         sidney
                   as he goes
            its late and im going home

susan in foreground remains quite still says nothing  in
background sidney slows down his confidence failing him
he looks back at her

sidney

he cant go  probably shes bluffing  but he cant be
certain  he is suddenly angry

resume susan and sidney

he strides back towards her

                         sidney
            susie whatever problems you have
            with jj  i didnt invent them

            learned to let out your hatred you
            would be better off

            sisters for  dont you know yet
            that you fight fire with fire not
            with tear drops

                         susan
            i could almost forgive you if what
            you did to steve came from jealousy
            and love

                         sidney
                   quickly
            i didnt do anything

                         susan
            but you did it for greed
            sidney  and thats pathetic

she moves past him  he grips her turning her around

                         sidney
            dont run away  i was always the
            man for you  im talking to you

            six months

                   helplessly
            please sidney i cant stand this 

camera holds sidney and susan in foreground  but it is now
shooting towards the door of the apartment  a panning
movement has included a figure at the other end of the big
room

hunsecker

he is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment
we dont know how long he has been there how much he has
overheard  without appearing to be consciously spying
hunsecker is listening to sidneys voice over scene

                         sidney
                   over scene
            listen to me lunatic  all your
            life youve been doing penance for
            crimes you never committed  i
            could change that id teach you
            id show you  

camera pans round with hunsecker who strolls across the
room making his presence known  sidney breaks off drops
his hands releasing the girl  susan turns towards hunsecker
hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table  he
addresses susan without looking at her

                         hunsecker
            go to bed susie  its late

susan makes no move  hunsecker glances at her sees sidney
but treats sidney as if he were invisible

                         hunsecker
                   to susan
            what is he doing here

susan walks towards hunsecker

                         susan
            i called him

sidney moves forward also

                         sidney
                   carefully
            she was depressed  she heard about
            dallas

hunsecker still ignores his existence he walks past susan
carrying his papers to the desk  susan turns watching him

                         hunsecker
                   controlling his feelings
            that subject it might be better not
            to start me on
                   angry
            hes made all the papers tonight

hunsecker studies the item in the paper

susan

she is staring at her brother  suddenly she is unable to
suffer his authoritative air she goes to him he ignores
her

hunsecker and susan

childishly she snatches the paper from his hand throws it
to the floor  he looks at her  patiently as with a
hysterical infant he stoops recovers the paper

                         hunsecker
                   mildly
            is there something you wanted to
            say
                   as she does not
                   answer continuing
                   with growing viciousness
            ive put up with a lot of your
            guff susie because you were a
            child  but youre a woman now and
            i suspect despite my best
            intentions more than a bit of a
            slut

susan

her head comes up sharply at the insult

hunsecker and susan and sidney

hunsecker glances at sidney clearly reminding them of the
compromising situation in which they were found  sidney
moves to answer

                         sidney
                   quickly
            jj if you think 

                         susan
                   cutting in
            dont explain sidney it doesnt
            matter now

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            whose arms will i have to pry you
            out of next  not that i dont
            think you didnt invite it  i know
            that look of yours that pose of
            being wronged  and how it arouses
            the crusading instinct in even a
            sidney falco 

hunseckers rising tide of brutality is having some effect
on susan and sidney fearing for her tries to intervene

                         sidney
            i was trying to build her up not
            tear her down 

                         hunsecker
                   viciously
            is that why you were romancing her
            you mutt
                   turning back to susan
            lets call it quits my dear  id
            like it fine if you found another
            home  that means the front door is
            open  pack your things rent a
            moving van and git
                   pacing the room
            and as for marriage let me hit you
            with a few choice facts you arent
            ready for marriage  youre
            incompetent  a capricious and
            shaky frail with a sick fatality
            for frail and useless men

susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near hunseckers
feet  after a moment she turns and moves to the door of her
bedroom her walk is a little unsteady she goes inside
closes the door in hunseckers face

int bedroom

with the door closed she leans against it as if afraid of
falling  she gropes for the door handle finds the key and
turns it

int living room  hunsecker and sidney

hunsecker is studying the closed door

                         hunsecker
                   to himself
            another crisis past
                   walking away
            shell be fast asleep in five
            minutes loaded with those headache
            pills

sidney

sidney seems not to hear this remark  he is concentrated on
the door he moves hesitantly towards it apprehensive
camera includes hunsecker in background

                         hunsecker
            now well get to you sidney
                   turning to sidney
            as far as the column is concerned 
            tonight you have forfeited every
            ethical consideration i ever felt
            for you

much more concerned with his anxiety for susan sidney
interrupts

                         sidney
                   cutting in
            look jj ill grant you anything
            you want
                   as hunsecker is
                   about to interrupt
            susies off her rocker tonight  go
            in and see what shes doing  go in
            and talk to her quietly  unless
            you want a corpse

sidneys conviction is impressive  but hunsecker is
unwilling to admit the danger he continues

                         hunsecker
                   acid
            let me finish what i started to
            say 

seeing that hunsecker is not taking his advice sidney
strides swiftly to the door of susans bedroom  he knocks
on it

int bedroom

shooting towards the door  susan is sitting on the bed in
foreground  in a methodical hypnotic way she is destroying
the contents of the drawer tearing letters into small
fragments  sidneys voice is heard outside susie susan
appears not to hear it camera tracks closer to her
sidneys voice is heard again louder susie susan turns
sharply towards the door

susan

a close up  susan rises to her feet staring at the door
she begins to back away from it

resume reverse angle

camera pulls back as susan glances down at the record player
beside her  she turns the knob  we hear the clatter of a
record dropping and music begins  the tune is the sage

int living room

close shot of sidney  he hears the music starting

hunsecker

hunsecker has come forward  but now as he listens to the
gramaphone record playing in the bedroom hunsecker relaxes
assuming that this is a sign that sidneys suspicions are
unfounded

                         hunsecker
                   coming forward
            what a cornball you are sidney

camera tracks to include sidney  he does not share
hunseckers confidence he knocks again calling

                         sidney
                   anxiously
            susie
                   in growing fear
            susie

camera tracks closer to sidney  as he tries the doorknob
camera tilts down  sidneys hand tries the doorknob finds
it locked shakes it forcefully

detail

from inside the bedroom  we see the doorknob rattled

resume susan

a close up  she realizes that sidney means to insist  she
turns away towards the blowing curtains in background

resume living room

a detail shot  sidneys hand is still shaking the doorknob
he releases it  camera pulls back to a two shot of sidney
and hunsecker as sidney retreats from the door in
apprehension  now hunsecker has begun to share sidneys
anxiety  he moves to the door knocks and then pounds on it

                         hunsecker
                   with authority
            susie this is jj  open up

susan

a close up  she comes forward past the blowing curtains
the wind whips at her hair  over scene we hear the rumble
of the traffic on broadway far below

resume hunsecker

he is pounding on the door again  camera makes a quick pan
to sidney who in a split second realizes that susan may
have gone out on the balcony  he turns dashes towards the
study to look out on the terrace

resume susan

she has now started to climb onto the parapet  sidney leaps
into shot dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of
shot  we hear susan cry out a hysterical gasp  camera
looking through the windows of susans bedroom sees the
door fly open as hunsecker bursts into the room  he looks
swiftly around advances towards the open window
exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone he switches it
off he steps out onto the terrace  camera pans with him as
he turns to look back into the study where susans inanimate
figure is sprawled on the floor half across the low
upholstered footstool  sidney white and shaking is
standing over her

reverse angle

camera at floor level  susan is framed in foreground  the
lower half of sidney can be seen beside her  hunsecker is
on the terrace in background  shocked he moves quickly
into the room

hunsecker

a close up  he looks down at his sister  he is badly
shaken  the sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of
something akin to anger  but he swiftly controls it  he
moves past camera

reverse angle

hunsecker stoops into shot  tenderly he lifts the girls
body to get it into the arm chair  susan is quite lifeless
limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any
instinct for selfpreservation  but as she feels her
brothers arms and as she recognizes who it is she breaks
out in hysteria

                         susan
                   wildly
            no  no  dont touch me

                         hunsecker
                   sharply
            susan

but susan strikes at him a vicious gesture of revulsion
hunsecker lets her go  she falls into the arm chair her
face hidden from him she begins to sob

                         susan
                   her body shaking
            go awaygo away

hunsecker would like to comfort her but he dare not touch
her again for fear of inviting another rebuff  he is deeply
hurt and wounded  embarrassed that sidney should watch this
moment hunsecker rises  to cover his emotion he walks to
the tray of drinks in background he pours a brandy and
comes back  stooping he offers it to susan  her only
reaction is again to wrench herself away from him facing
the opposite direction

                         susan
                   sobbing bitterly
            go away

hunsecker sets down the drink stands up

                         hunsecker
                   in a choked voice
            talk to her sidney

                         sidney
                   hushed
            talk to her yourself

over scene the telephone rings  it is ignored  while
hunsecker looks down at the girl helplessly the telephone
continues to ring

susan

a close up  it is she who first becomes aware of the
telephone  her weeping has stopped now  slowly she raises
her head  camera eases back to include sidney beyond her
he notes this movement seeing in it a revival of the girls
will to live he is moved

another angle

the telephone is framed in foreground susan beyond  it
continues to ring  as hunsecker crosses to his desk to pick
up the instrument camera pulls back  hunsecker speaks

                         hunsecker
            yuhyuh
                   he listens
            just a minute
                   turning back to susan
            susie its mr dangelo  from the
            hospital

resume susan

a close shot  she raises her head higher still weakly  we
see in her face a mixture of terror and hope

reverse angle

hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front
of her on the footstool  hunsecker and sidney watch  she
reaches a hand which is still trembling picks up the
receiver  her voice as she speaks to the instrument is
barely audible

                         susan
            yesyesyes

presently she hangs up  when she becomes aware that
hunsecker and sidney are waiting for an explanation she
tells them

                         susan
                   speaking with difficulty
            steveis out of danger

hunsecker

hunsecker nods  he already knows this  then

                         hunsecker
                   soberly
            that means a lot to you

susan

she does not look at him she lowers her eyes but answers
with a nod  and then more positively

                         susan
            yes

resume hunsecker

he studies the girl  his face has hardened  he moves
beginning to pace and also beginning his manipulations

                         hunsecker
            but i have to warn you susie  for
            your own sake  hell still do
            time

camera follows hunsecker  it now takes in sidney who is
standing beside him  sidney has begun to stare fixedly at
hunsecker he is now realizing that hunsecker although he
has been faced with this demonstration of the girls
willingness to kill herself has still learned nothing is
still continuing in the old pattern

                         hunsecker
                   continuing warming
                   to his theme
            hes a hophead  thats a felony
            in new york  i can try of course
            to

a close up  revolted sidney breaks in

                         sidney
            youre unholy jj  youd rather
            kill this girl than let her go

group shot

hunsecker wheels on sidney bellowing

                         hunsecker
                   in blind rage
            get out of this house

sidney with equal heat spins round to susan crying out
before he has time to check himself

                         sidney
                   impulsively
            susie you get out of this house 
            get out before its too late

sidney

sidney has gone too far now to pull back  inevitably he
continues  during the speech camera pulls back to include
susan and then hunsecker

                         sidney
                   with sincerity
            listen with care  this will cost
            me everything so you know im
            telling you the truth

                         hunsecker
                   trying to stop him
            youre incapable of the truth

                         sidney
                   who will not by stopped
            susie theres nothing wrong with
            dallas
                   turning toward hunsecker
            your brother and i arranged it all
            and if the leslie boy is still a
            squooshy item in your life forget
            it  your brother arranged that
            one too  i dont usually give
            away presents but this is my gift
            to you get out of here  leave
            this man

during the latter part of the speech susan rises slowly to
her feet staring first at sidney and then with fearful
significance at her brother  hunsecker does not look at
her he is concentrated on sidney  twice he has been about
to demolish sidney but he now stops a thought in his head

hunsecker

he is perfectly controlled smiling

                         hunsecker
            like most italians sidneys got a
            big gift for dramatics  i however
            prefer the cool and stubborn facts
            sidney has not appeared in my
            column in weeks  check that fact
            with mary  that leads right to
            another fact sidney had nothing to
            lose tonight  to the contrary
            dear  only his obvious greed to
            beat his way back into the column
            explains his accusations against me
            in brief blackmail

hunsecker pauses impressively

group shot

framing hunsecker in foreground susan and sidney beyond
susan listens to hunsecker objectively with a mounting
sense of his diseased reasoning

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            mind you not that one true fact
            didnt come out of sidneys mouth
            tonight selfadmittedly he
            committed a vicious crime of
            jealousy against steve dallas
                   pausing
            now we have to clear dallas dont
            webut ill have to sacrifice
            him
                   he indicates sidney
            to do it
                   turning to susan
            am i doing right

susan

she is looking at hunsecker

                         hunsecker os
                   over scene
            yes or no susie

slowly susan nods

reverse angle

shooting across susan onto hunsecker  hunsecker turns away
from her and walks to the telephone  he picks it up and
begins to speak  while the scene continues we hear his
voice off screen speaking to the phone saying this is
jj hunsecker  i want you to get a message through to
lieutenant kello  ask him to ring me back  its urgent
susan backs slowly away from hunsecker  then she turns into
camera which tracks with her and includes sidney  susan
looks at sidney and then ashamed avoids his eye  but
sidney comes nearer to her  susan is deeply distressed

                         susan
                   very quietly
            hes sick

she looks again at sidney  deliberately sidney nods
susan walks toward her bedroom

int bedroom

susan comes into the room finding shelter from the
revelation which has so appalled her  inexorably sidney
follows her  he comes across the threshold closes the door

                         sidney
                   quietly
            yes hes sick and youre the only
            idiot alive who didnt know it

a pause  sidney moves closer to her

                         sidney
            but what are you going to do

there are some tears of pity in susans eyes  once more she
moves away from sidney  sidney senses that her compassion
for hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back
into the trap  he insists

                         sidney
                   with emphasis
            you dont owe your brother a cup of
            water

another pause  sidney again repeats

                         sidney
            what are you going to do

she moves away from sidney camera following her  after a
moment she answers

                         susan
            go to steve

sidney

sidney is moved having done his solitary act of chivalry
to hide his feelings he is harsh

                         sidney
                   sharply
            for petes sake straighten out the
            seams of your stockings  comb your
            hair  dont be so helpless all the
            time

camera pulls back to include susan  from the other room we
hear the telephone ring  sidney turns and goes quickly out
after a moment susan looks back at the door through which
sidney has disappeared

int living room

hunsecker is framed in foreground speaking into the
telephone  sidney is in background outside the door of
susans bedroom  hunsecker is fully aware of sidneys
presence as he says

producing a cigarette he lights it and then looks up
towards hunsecker

sidney turns on his heel walking out of the apartment

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            hes been trying to make my

cafe on broadway

kello is in a phone booth

                         kello
                   to phone
            oh thats serious jj  real
            reprehensible

kello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through
the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls
ahead to a position ready for him outside the door

                         kello
                   to phone
            dont worry ill get there  im
            on broadway now

kello hangs up  hurries out  we see him get into the squad
car which rapidly accelerates

int hunseckers living room

hunsecker has hung up  he stares at the telephone for a
moment  then he moves towards susans door camera tracking
with him  he comes to the threshold looks at susan who is
standing in much the same position in which sidney left her

susan

unaware that her brother is watching her she picks up the
fur coat on the bed she is about to start packing her
belongings she turns as she hears hunsecker speak

                         hunsecker
                   over scene
            thats a pretty coat

reverse angle

shooting across susan towards hunsecker  hunsecker comes
into the room

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
             but its about time you had a new
            one

susan turns squarely to face him

resume susan

she braces herself to tell him

                         susan
                   soberly
            im leaving jj

resume reverse angle

he does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone
or if he does refuses to recognize it

                         hunsecker
                   with a faint scoff
            dont kid a kidder  ill see you
            for breakfast around eleven

without waiting for a response hunsecker goes out closing
the door  susan stares at it for a moment  then she moves
to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed

terrace

hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace comes out and
looks over the parapet looking to see how far sidney has
got hoping to see kellos squad car

resume susan

she completes her simple packing closing the suitcase
with a gesture that is obviously automatic she starts to
put on the fur coat then she halts realizing what she is
doing  she pauses camera moves closer  now deliberately
she throws the coat back on the bed  camera pans down with
the gesture  she looks down at the coat the discarded
symbol of her dependence upon her brother  camera pulls
back again as she takes a quick look round then goes to
take a duffle coat from the wardrobe  she throws this over
her arm picks up the suitcase goes to the door

int living room

susan comes out of the door  she moves with a sober
determination expecting to find hunsecker in the room
camera tracks with her  but then she realizes that hunsecker
has gone out on the terrace  she takes a step or two
towards him then pauses

hunsecker

from susans viewpoint shooting through the big glass
windows  hunsecker is at the parapet  he is impatiently
looking down into broadway

susan

a close up  she now realizes that there is no point in
saying goodbye to him she has already told him that she is
leaving and if she becomes involved in further argument
with him it can do no good  yet there is some emotion on
her face as she takes a last look at her brother she turns
away

hunsecker

framing him in foreground at the parapet  susan can be seen
through the windows before she disappears to the door
hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on broadway
below

ext broadway

the squad car comes down broadway at speed

ext duffys square

sidney is walking across the square  the squad car appears
in foreground it pauses hardly at all as kello slips out of
it and starts to move after sidney  then the car
accelerates round duffy square to cut sidney off on the
other side

sidney

sidney comes up towards camera  seeing something ahead he
halts

squad car

from sidneys viewpoint  the car breaks to a stop  its
door opens and a detective gets out slowly  it is phil

resume sidney

sidney is framed in foreground the squad car beyond
sidney knows what this means  he starts to speak before he
turns to look over his shoulder

                         sidney
            hello harry

reverse angle

kello moving silently up behind sidney slows down amused
at sidneys prescience

                         kello
            hi
                   coming to join sidney
            i just been on the phone to jj

kellos manner is almost affectionate  he shakes his head
admonishing sidney

                         kello
                   mildly
            you been a bad boy sidney  jjs
            going to write about you in his
            column tomorrow

reverse angle

shooting across kello onto sidney  sidneys smile is tired

                         sidney
            i thought he would

                         kello
            yeah
                   then
            and another thing  hes gonna say
            you resisted arrest
                   as sidney nods
            you know jj

sidney turns away to look back towards phil  then taking
kello totally by surprise he wheels striking the cop
viciously across the mouth

kello

kellos head jerks back  recovering at once he guffaws
lurches into camera with a sudden vicious movement  there
is a sharp guttural cry over scene

longer angle

phil runs forward towards the figures of sidney and kello
seen beyond him  in doing so he blocks the view so that we
do not clearly see the violence with which kello strikes
sidney down  phil in foreground is seen to relax  when
he moves aside clearing the view sidney is writhing on the
ground at kellos feet

closer angle

kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief  he signals to
phil to help lift the body at his feet  phil enters shot
and they raise sidney half carrying half dragging him out
of shot

long shot

the cops carry the figure of sidney falco across duffy
square they bundle him into the police car  the pigeons in
the square circle

hunseckers terrace

camera looks down towards duffy square in the distance  the
police car can be seen moving off circling the square and
disappearing southward on broadway  camera pulls back to
include hunsecker in foreground

hunsecker

a close shot shooting sharply upward at hunsecker  he
looks down quiet impassively and there is a slightly
insane grandeur a paranoiac superiority in the way that he
turns back dismissing sidney from his thoughts

int living room

camera shoots towards the closed door of susans room
hunsecker walks into the shot stops before the door  he
begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt clearly
preparing to go to bed  as an afterthought he comes back
to the door addresses it

                         hunsecker
                   gently
            susie
                   getting no answer
            are you in bed

camera moves closer  it is at a low level still emphasizing
the mans dignity  he strolls for a few paces

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            i dont have to tell you of
            course that i cleared your
            boyfriends name i didnt let you
            down

camera has now moved so that we are shooting past hunsecker
onto susans door  he gets no answer except silence

hunsecker

a close shot reverse angle  we now see in his face a
flicker of fear  with what is clearly an effort he
reassumes a confident manner

                         hunsecker
            i was saving this news for
            breakfast but i think ill jump
            the gun  im gonna give you and
            dallas the biggest wedding this
            town has ever seen

still no answer from inside the bedroom  hunseckers forced
expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face  he
calls out

                         hunsecker
            susie

int bedroom

the room is quite empty  camera shoots across the bed
towards the door in background  susans discarded fur coat
lies on the bed  and the doors of the wardrobe are open
hunseckers voice can be heard continuing over scene

                         hunsecker os
                   outside
            im getting the mayor to perform
            the ceremony and  no i think ill
            fly the governor down from albany
                   a pause
            do you hear

a pause  then very tentatively the bedroom door is opened

                         hunsecker os
                   outside
            are you listening

now he opens the door and comes in

hunsecker

a big close up  the sight of the empty room freezes his
face for a moment  his eyes look round

int bedroom

from hunseckers viewpoint  a panning shot from the open
door of the cupboard to the fur coat  camera pulls back to
include hunsecker  he steps to the bed picks up the coat

reverse angle

there is a dazed incredulous look on his face  but as he
glances over his shoulder camera zooms past him towards a
little door in the wall behind him it is ajar showing a
couple of inches of light

resume hunsecker

once again hunsecker reassures himself that susan must be
behind the door  but his voice is even more false as he
declares

                         hunsecker
                   a note of anger
                   appearing in his voice
            susieyou wont threaten
            menobody walks out on jj
            hunsecker
camera now moves closer and closer to hunsecker  the angle
is a weird one tilting grotesquely upward

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            you need me  you all need me

hunsecker his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat
walks towards the door  camera pans with him  he stands a
few inches from the narrow opening  he seems about to push
the door open further but is afraid to do so

int bathroom

camera shoots across the bathtub showing enough of the tiny
room to make it clear that it too is completely empty
through the slit in the door we can see only a glimpse of
the movement of hunsecker outside  hunseckers voice
continues

                         hunsecker os
            the lord is my shepherd i shall
            not want
                   a sneering laugh
            thats bunk in a book  im the
            shepherd of millions of little men
            and women

int bedroom

a downward angle shooting past hunsecker to the door  as
hunsecker retreats from the door he is still clutching the
fur coat  he stands alone in the middle of the room and his
gestures are a little wild  camera rises higher to shoot
down at hunsecker alone in the little room

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            i dont ask them to get on their
            knees but they come to me for
            advice and guidance  who are you
            to reject me

with an increasingly eccentric manner hunsecker strides out
of the bedroom door into the living room again

int living room

a similar angle shooting down on hunsecker as he comes out
of the bedroom  but as he starts to roam the vast room
camera rises higher still pulling backwards and upwards to
a long shot which holds the entirety of the big room in all
its ugliness

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
            what makes you fit to sit in
            judgment on a man like me  only a
            great person understands another
            great person and that leaves you
            out

hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment no
longer pretending even to himself that the girl is still
listening  he moves off towards the windows to the terrace
where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind  he
goes out towards the terrace his voice becoming more
distant  a man shouting empty nonsense addressing no one

                         hunsecker
                   continuing
             that leaves you all out  youre
            pigmies  youre all sick weak
            midgets  im proud to be alone

ext broadway

camera shoots steeply up towards the top of the brill bldg
at this angle hunseckers terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the budweiser
sign camera pans down to pick up the figure of susan
hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
broadway

closer angle

susan pauses on the sidewalk  she stays there for a moment
she breathes in the fresh morning air looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes
then she starts up broadway  away from the times square
area  the girls step has a purpose in it she has
confidence and courage  music for the end titles is quiet
simple and lyrical

                       end of picture
