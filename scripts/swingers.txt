               ext hollywood  night

               the soundtrack opens with frank sinatras fly me to the 
               moon

               a helicopter shot of the la basin

               the pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of 
               points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the 
               city

               we are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we 
               approach hollywood boulevard below is neon and the icy thrust 
               of search lights rotating on the corner of hollywood and 
               vine

               we continue west then quickly north

               there is the momentary appearance of the moonlit hollywood 
               sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the capital records 
               building and drop into franklin avenue and over the 101

               architectural remnants of hollywoods past whip up we are 
               heading east at treetop level a warm glow in the distance 
               quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes 
               cafes bookstores and a theater

               we drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass 
               showcase window of the bourgeois pig coffeehouse which 
               holds the translucent reflection of the full moon

               a cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders mike takes 
               the last drag with great effort then crushes it out he 
               sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that 
               once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer

                                                              match cut to

               ext bourgeois pig coffeehouse  couches and table in 
               front of window  night

               rob sits down next to mike pouring himself some tea

                                     mike
                         and what if i dont want to give up 
                         on her

                                     rob
                         you dont call

                                     mike
                         but you said i shouldnt call if i 
                         wanted to give up on her

                                     rob
                         right

                                     mike
                         so i dont call either way

                                     rob
                         right

                                     mike
                         so whats the difference

                                     rob
                         the only difference between giving 
                         up and not giving up is if you take 
                         her back when she wants to come back  
                         see you cant do anything to make 
                         her want to come back you can only 
                         do things to make her not want to 
                         come back

                                     mike
                         so the only difference is if i forget 
                         about her or pretend to forget about 
                         her

                                     rob
                         right

                                     mike
                         well that sucks

                                     rob
                         it sucks

                                     mike
                         so its almost a retroactive decision  
                         so i could like lets say forget 
                         about her and when she comes back 
                         make like i just pretended to forget 
                         about her

                                     rob
                         right or more likely the opposite

                                     mike
                         right wait what do you mean

                                     rob
                         i mean first youll pretend not to 
                         care not call  whatever and then 
                         eventually you really wont care

                                     mike
                         unless she comes back first

                                     rob
                         ah see thats the thing somehow 
                         they dont come back until you really 
                         dont care anymore

                                     mike

                         the trick is to look like you dont 
                         need it then they give you shit for 
                         free

               mike points to a semicurtained semiropedoff area near 
               the baccarat tables the clientele is classier but theyre 
               still obviously overdressed

                                     mike
                              pointing

               int treasure island casino  the classy section  night

               mike is at a blackjack table with trent at his side the 
               game has paused to observe the newcomers as mike draws a 
               billfold out of his breast pocket theyre pulling it off 
               with only slightly noticeable effort

                                     mike
                         i dont know i guess ill start 
                         with three hundred in uh blacks

               mike tries to hand the dealer a handful of twenties after 
               counting them twice

                                     dealer
                         on the table

                                     mike
                         sorry

                                     dealer
                         you have to lay it on the table

                                     mike
                         uh i dont want to bet it all

               the other players grow impatient

                                     dealer
                         youre not allowed to hand me money 
                         sir youll have to lay it on the 
                         table if you want me to change it

                                     mike
                              hastily laying down 
                              the bills
                         oh right

               the dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible 
               to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead  
               trent and mike look up at it openmouthed like turkeys in 
               the rain

                                     dealer
                         blacks

               mikes attention is recaptured by the dealer but trent 
               continues trying to peer through the smoked glass

                                     mike
                         huh

                                     dealer
                         you want this in black chips

                                     mike
                         sure thatll be fine

               the dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the 
               pit boss chirps the response trents focus whips away from 
               the camera as both he and mike stare at the pit boss ten 
               feet away the dealer plunks down the measly three chips 
               which represent mikes entire cash reserve not quite the 
               effect he had hoped for

               the swingers stare at the chips the players stare at the 
               swingers the dealer stares at the pit boss

                                     mike
                         do you have anything smaller

                                     dealer
                         yes but im afraid this table has a 
                         hundreddollarminimum bet perhaps 
                         youd be more comfortable at one of 
                         our lower stakes tables

               the dealer indicates a fivedollar table across the room 
               where an hispanic woman deals to a bluehair a biker and a 
               couple in matching siegfried and roy tshirts

               the swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by 
               the pit boss

               the tense silence is broken by

                                     waitress
                         drinks
                              then to trent
                         how about you capn

               trent looks over to see that its the same waitress who 
               flashed him a smile earlier at first he begins to smile 
               then remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle 
               of wills subtly shakes her off she smirks and starts to 
               leave until she is interrupted by mike holding up a finger 
               its a balsy move but everyones watching the kids going 
               for broke

                                     mike
                              to the waitress but 
                              never breaking eye 
                              contact with the 
                              dealer
                         ill have a vodka martini straight 
                         up shaken not stirred very dry

               smooth trent is impressed but masks his pride

                                     waitress
                              under her breath 
                              cynically as she 
                              writes it down
                         one james bond

               ow she exits

                                     mike
                              regaining composure
                         no blacks will be fine

               mike throws a chip in the circle trent is shocked thats a 
               hundred bucks mike and trent share a look the dealer and 
               the pit boss exchange glances bets are all down and the 
               cards are meticulously dealt

               the dealer has a two showing mike has been dealt a five and 
               a six  eleven

                                     trent

                         down on an eleven

               the dealer the pit boss and all the players look on as 
               mike drops another black chip in the circle with a barely 
               audible yet deafening thud

                                     mike
                              with all the 
                              nonchalance he can 
                              muster
                         double down

               a bead of sweat

               the sharp snap of a dealt card

               its a seven eighteen

               disappointment twists their faces

               finally the dealer flips over his card

               its a king twelve here comes the bust

               flick  four sixteen here comes the bust

               flick  five twenty one groans all around except for the 
               swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence

               mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of 
               his stomach

                                     mike
                              to the pit boss

               trent and mike are wedged between the bluehair and the biker 
               at the five dollar table they share a pile of red chips

                                     trent

                         twenty one

               polite applause from around the table which the bluehair 
               humbly waves off mike looks at trent daggers trent shrugs

                         pause it
                              trent pauses the 
                              game

                                     mike
                         give me the money ill get it

               while sue gives mike the money trent unpauses the game and 
               checks gretsky into the boards leaving him writhing in a 
               pool of red pixels

                                     sue
                         you bitch

               sue dives onto trent they wrestle a little too rambunctiously 
               for indoors trent pulls the hockey sweater over sues head 
               and starts wailing on his back

               mike crosses the camera follows him down a shallow hallway 
               to the door he unlocks it

               a delivery man of easternhemispheric decent is out of breath 
               from four flights of stairs he hands mike a twelvepack of 
               bud cans and three packs of marlboro reds

               he can hear but not see the chaos ensuing in the living 
               room

                                                                    cut to

               int sues living room  continuous

               trent and sue are flushed they pause long enough to torment 
               mike

                                     trent
                              feigning homosexuality
                         is he cute ask him if he wants to 
                         stay for a cocktail

               int sues doorway  continuous

               mike forces an apologetic smile he is embarrassed the 
               delivery man doesnt seem to understand any of this

               mike out of guilt hands him a four dollar tip this he 
               seems to understand he smiles and leaves

               mike crosses back to the main room

                                     mike
                         you guys are such assholes

               surgical precision

               cans of beer are tossed around and cracked

                                     mike

                                     sue
                         how novel

                                                                    cut to

               ext dark alley  off of hollywood blvd  seedy  night

               mike and rob walk down the dirty deserted alleyway mike is 
               wearing baggy slacks doc martin shoes and an oversized 
               eisenhowercut jacket with a vertical stripe inset the collar 
               is large and pointy but definitely not seventies his 
               ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe

               rob hasnt been at it quite as long hes wearing wornin 
               levies over wornin boots and the nineties standby an 
               untucked flannel

               mike walks with purpose he intermittently tries to pull 
               open locked steel doors along the alley rob looks confused

                                     rob
                         so if the party starts at eight 
                         why are we first going to a bar at 
                         ten

                                     mike
                         to get a drink before we meet the 
                         guys for a bite at eleven

                                     rob
                         oh
                              beat
                         where is this place

                                     mike
                              pulling handle
                         its one of these for some reason 
                         cool bars in la have to be very 
                         hard to find and have no signs out 
                         front

                                     rob
                         that doesnt sound too good for 
                         business

                                     mike
                              pull
                         its kinda like a speakeasy kind of 
                         thing its kinda cool its like 
                         youre in on some kind of secret 
                         you tell a chick youve been some 
                         place its like bragging that you 
                         know how to find it the only way 
                         you could know where a place is is 
                         if someone who knows brought you 
                         there you have to have someone come 
                         before there is a direct line 
                         connecting you back to the original 
                         unequivocally cool club patrons 
                         its kinda like judaism

                                     rob
                         sounds more like aids

                                     mike
                         thats probably a more appropriate 
                         analogy

               at this point they come upon an unmarked black metal door 
               which mike successfully pulls open to reveal

               int the room  hollywood bar  same

               a smokefilled windowless blackwalled room there are 
               several round padded booths lining the walls the place is 
               packed and the funk standard brick house throbs over the 
               pa

               a handheld shot as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored 
               bar at the far end of the room enshrined in its center is a 
               framed photograph of sinatra smiling in approval as he 
               presides over the evenings activities

               mike proudly points out the photo to rob

                                     mike
                         kinda money huh

                              smiling
                         classy

               mike catches the attention of a cute female bartender

                                     mike

               he awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor 
               they start to dance its a slow song and they boringly rock 
               back and forth mike is selfconscious but her touch oh 
               her touch

                                                                    cut to

               the couples dance is cut short as there were only a few 
               bars left of the slow ballad mike smiles politely in relief 
               and begins to lead lorraine off the floor

               she pulls him back hes not getting off that easy she wants 
               a whole song he politely holds her poised for another slow 
               number theyre alone on the floor

               much to mikes dismay the song begins with a driving tom 
               tom solo this cues every hep cat in the derby that the big 
               ones coming they all flood the floor for the last dance of 
               the night

               mike pleadingly shakes his head at lorraine its too fast 
               her eyes narrow as her grip tightens no sympathy here

               the band breaks into the fulltilt swing number and the dance 
               floor writhes around them

               they stand motionless for what seems like an eternity

               gut check fuck it sink or swim

               mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman its just a simple 
               sixcount swing step but theyre in perfect harmony

               mike and lorraine look into each others eyes its on baby

               as mikes courage grows the moves start to flow a spin at 
               first then a double twirl its not long before hes throwing 
               her through combinations that stand out even among the pros

                                                                    cut to

               trent and sue mouths agape

               mike is whipping her smoothly through violentlooking 
               combinations without a trace of hesitation and boy can 
               she follow

               the set ends with a flourishing crescendo theyre frozen in 
               a final dip panting through a glaze of clean sweat

               mike and lorraine smile and look into each others eyes the 
               smile slowly disappears will they kiss

               theyre close

               really close

               lips almost touching

               mike tries to musterup the courage but its been so long

               he cant do it he lets her up

               the floor clears exhausted dancers push past them forget 
               it the moments gone

               what the hell they had a great time whats the hurry
