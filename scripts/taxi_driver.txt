               the whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief 
               that loneliness far from being a rare and curious phenomenon 
               is the central and inevitable fact of human existence

                thomas wolfe 
               gods lonely man

               travis bickle age 26 lean hard the consummate loner on 
               the surface he appears goodlooking even handsome he has a 
               quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from 
               nowhere lighting up his whole face but behind that smile 
               around his dark eyes in his gaunt cheeks one can see the 
               ominous stains caused by a life of private fear emptiness 
               and loneliness he seems to have wandered in from a land 
               where it is always cold a country where the inhabitants 
               seldom speak the head moves the expression changes but 
               the eyes remain everfixed unblinking piercing empty space

               travis is now drifting in and out of the new york city night 
               life a dark shadow among darker shadows not noticed no 
               reason to be noticed travis is one with his surroundings  
               he wears rider jeans cowboy boots a plaid western shirt 
               and a worn beige army jacket with a patch reading king 
               kong company 196870

               he has the smell of sex about him sick sex repressed sex 
               lonely sex but sex nonetheless he is a raw male force 
               driving forward toward what one cannot tell then one looks 
               closer and sees the inevitable the clock spring cannot be 
               wound continually tighter as the earth moves toward the 
               sun travis bickle moves toward violence

               film opens on ext of manhattan cab garage weatherbeaten 
               sign above driveway reads taxi enter here yellow cabs 
               scuttle in and out it is winter snow is piled on the curbs 
               the wind is howling

               inside garage are parked row upon row of multicolored taxis 
               echoing sounds of cabs idling cabbies talking steamy breath 
               and exhaust fill the air

               int corridor of cab company offices

               lettering on ajar door reads

               sound of office busywork shuffling typing arguing

               personal office is a cluttered disarray sheets with heading 
               marvis bw acme and so forth are tacked to crumbling 
               plaster wall it is march desk is cluttered with forms 
               reports and an old upright royal typewriter

               dishelved middleaged new yorker looks up from the desk we 
               cut in to ongoing conversation between the middleaged 
               personnel officer and a young man standing in front on his 
               desk

               the young man is travis bickle he wears his jeans boots 
               and army jacket he takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette

               the personnel officer is beat and exhausted he arrives at 
               work exhausted travis is something else again his intense 
               steely gaze is enough to jar even the personnel officer out 
               of his workaday boredom

               credits

               credits appear over scenes from manhattan nightlife the 
               snow has melted it is spring

               a rainy slick wet miserable night in manhattans theatre 
               district

               cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere welldressed 
               pedestrians are pushing running waving down taxis the 
               highclass theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows 
               are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the 
               poor and common is also falling on them

               the unremitting sounds of honking and shouting play against 
               the dull pitterpatter of rain the glare of yellow red and 
               green lights reflects off the pavements and autos

               when it rains the boss of the city is the taxi driver  
               so goes the cabbies maxim proven true by this particular 
               nights activity only the taxis seem to rise above the 
               situation they glide effortlessly through the rain and 
               traffic picking up whom they choose going where they please

               further uptown the crowds are neither so frantic nor so 
               glittering the rain also falls on the street bums and aged 
               poor junkies still stand around on rainy street corners 
               hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks and the taxis service 
               them too

               all through the credits the exterior sounds are muted as if 
               coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner 
               the listener is at a safe but privileged distance

               after examining various strata of manhattan nightlife camera 
               begins to close in on one particular taxi and it is assumed 
               that this taxi is being driven by travis bickle

               end credits

                                                                    cut to

               later we see travis taxi speeding down the rainslicked

                         i dont know  but it feels like a 
                         long time

               travis cold piercingly eyes stare out from his cab parked 
               across the street from palantine headquarters he is like a 
               lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a 
               distance a thin red dot glows from his cigarette

               tom exchanges travis gaze

                                     tom
                              determined
                         well ill go out and ask him

               as tom walks toward front door betsys eyes alternate between 
               him and the position where travis sits

               ext palantine headquarters

               tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the 
               street toward travis taxi

               travis spots tom walking toward him and quickly starts up 
               his cab then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust

               tom watches the speeding taxi quizzically

               travis taxi continues down broadway

                                                                    cut to

               int travis apartment

               he lies on his mattress and stares at the ceiling he is 
               fully clothed and appears deep in thought

               near his mattress rest several medications a large bottle 
               of vitamin pills two smaller bottles of pills a bottle of 
               peachflavored brandy

                                     travis vo
                         all my life needed was a sense of 
                         direction a sense of someplace to 
                         go i do not believe one should devote 
                         his life to morbid selfattention 
                         but should become a person like other 
                         people

               another day  late afternoon

               travis taxi is driving down broadway with the off duty 
               sign on

               campaign headquarters a few workers remain in the office 
               betsys desk is vacant

               fifth avenue  the same afternoon

               camera tracks with crowded mass of manhattanites as they 
               ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination 
               individuals are indiscernible it is simply a congested mass

                                     travis vo
                         i first saw her at palantine campaign 
                         headquarters at 58th and broadway 
                         she was wearing a yellow dress 
                         answering the phone at her desk

               suddenly cut of the congested human mass in slowing motion 
               appears the slender figure of betsy in a stylish yellow dress 
               the crowd parts like the red sea and there she is walking 
               all alone untouched by the crowd suspended in space and 
               time

                                     travis vo
                         she appeared like an angel out of 
                         this open sewer out of this filthy 
                         mass she is alone they cannot touch 
                         her

               int travis apartment

               he is at the table writing in his diary

                                                                    cut to

               it is 330 in the morning in a baconshaped all night west 
               side restaurant the thick smell hangs in the air  fried 
               grease smoke sweat regurgitated wine

               whatever doesnt flush away in new york at night turns up in 
               places like this a burly greasestained cook stands over 
               the grill a junkie shuffles from one side of the door to 
               another slouched over the small fourperson formica tables 
               are several welldressed blacks too welldressed for this 
               time and place a cluster of street people and a lost old 
               coot who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last 
               possession

               the restaurant brightly lit perfectly conveys the image 
               urban plasticity  without the slightest hint of an 
               accompanying cleanliness

               toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies wizard 
               a worn man about fifty doughboy younger family man charlie 
               t fourtyish black

               travis appears at the door he has to push aside the junkies 
               to enter without making physical contact  something travis 
               would not relish he may be repulsed with these people and 
               this place but he is too much a part of this to let his 
               feelings rise to the surface

               wizard gives travis a perfunctory wave

                                     wizard
                         travis

                         hey wizard

               travis straddles a seat at the table doughboy gives travis 
               something between a wink and an eyetwitch saying

                                     doughboy

               travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee

               ext across the street from headquarters

               travis is striding briskly across broadway toward the 
               palantine headquarters

               hes dressed the best we have seen him his pants not jeans 
               are pressed his boots shined his hair combed under his 
               army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league 
               tie he drops his cigarette steps on it and walks in

               watching travis enter palantines headquarters we are 
               surprised to realize that travis is really quite attractive 
               his deformities are psychological not physical he believes 
               he is cursed and therefore he is

               travis walks briskly into the office and heads toward betsys 
               desk tom walks over to greet him but travis ignores him

                                     travis
                              at betsys desk
                         i want to volunteer

               as the camera examines travis face more closely one can 
               see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient 
               diet

                                     tom
                              at betsys desk
                         if youll come this way

               travis elbows tom off

                                     travis

                              under his voice
                         bets

               betsy waves tom off with a short gesture indicating 
               everything is ok he walks away

                                     betsy

                         and why is that

               travis is on his best behavior he smiles slightly

                                     travis
                         because you are the most beautiful 
                         woman i have ever seen

               betsy is momentarily taken back but pleased travis presence 
               has a definite sexual charge he has those star qualities 
               betsy looks for she senses there is something special about 
               the young man who stands before her and then too there is 
               that disarming smile he is as betsy would say 
               fascinating

                                     betsy
                              smiling
                         is that so
                              pause
                         but what do you think of charles 
                         palantine

                                     travis
                              his mind elsewhere
                         who mam

                                     betsy
                         charles palantine the man you want 
                         to volunteer to help elect president

                                     travis
                         oh i think hes a wonderful man  
                         make a great great president

                                     betsy
                         you want to canvass

                                     travis
                         yes mam

               betsy is interviewing travis but she is also teasing him a 
               little leading him on in a gentle feminine way

                                     betsy
                         how do you feel about senator 
                         palantines stand on welfare

               this takes travis back a bit he obviously doesnt have the 
               slightest idea what palantines stand on welfare is in fact 
               he doesnt have any idea about politics whatsoever travis 
               thinks a moment then improvises an answer

                                     travis
                         welfare mam i think the senators 
                         right people should work for a 
                         living i do i like to work every 
                         day get those old coots off welfare 
                         and make em work for a change

               betsy does a subtle doubletake this isnt exactly 
               palantines position on welfare she remain intrigued by 
               travis

                                     betsy
                         well thats not exactly what the 
                         senator has proposed you might not 
                         want to canvass but there is plenty 
                         more other work we need done office 
                         work filing poster hanging

                                     travis

                         if you talk to tom hell assign you 
                         to something

                         work for you

                                     betsy
                         well were all working tonight

                                     travis

                         want to do

                                     travis
                              bolstering courage

                         pleased if youd go out and have 
                         some coffee and pie with me

               betsy doesnt quite know what to make of travis she is 
               curious intrigued tantalized like a moth she draws closer 
               to the flame

                                     betsy
                         why

                                     travis
                         well betsy mam i drive by this 
                         place here in my taxi many times a 
                         day and i watch you sitting here at 
                         this big long desk with these 
                         telephones and i say to myself 
                         thats a lonely girl she needs a 
                         friend and im gonna be her friend
                              smiles

               travis rarely smiles but when he does his whole face glows 
               it is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm 
               unknown even to himself betsy is completely disarmed

                                     betsy
                         i dont know

                         thank you travis

               travis nods turns and exits

               tom who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo 
               standoffish actually jealous air steps over to betsy his 
               manner demands some sort of explanation of what betsy was 
               doing

               betsy simply shrugs its really none of his business and 
               says

                                     betsy
                         im just going to find out what the 
                         cabbies are thinking

                                                                    cut to

               travis is pacing back and forth on broadway just beyond the 
               palantine headquarters he checks his watch

                         took betsy to the mayfair coffee 
                         shop on broadway

               int coffee shop

               travis and betsy are sitting in a booth of a small new york 
               coffee shop they both have been served coffee travis is 
               nervously turning his cup around in his hands

               as travis speaks vo waitress brings their orders apple 
               pie for travis fruit compote for betsy

                                     travis vo

                         with a slice of melted yellow cheese  
                         i think that was a good selection 
                         betsy had coffee and a fruit salad 
                         dish she could have had anything 
                         she wanted

               betsys conversation interrupts travis vo

                                     betsy

                         organezizied

               travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation 
               than breaks into a big friendly infectious grin the very 
               sight of it makes ones heart proud

               betsy cannot help but be caught up in travis grin travis 
               contagious quicksilver moods cause

                                     betsy

                         after the western regional planners 
                         were in town and the meeting went 
                         late the next day i was completely 
                         bushed it was unbelievable

                         truth partly fiction a walking 
                         contradiction

                         i didnt mean that travis just the 
                         part about the contradiction

                                     travis
                              more at ease
                         oh who was that again

                                     betsy
                         the singer

                              slowly
                         kris kristofferson

               travis looks at betsy intently and they exchange smiles

                                                                    cut to

               travis is walking confusedly around sam goodys at midday 
               obviously unable to locate what he desires

               travis is lost among the hip young intellectual type that 
               populate the store he watches the stylish attractive female 
               help unable to come right out and requests what he desires

               a young salesgirl sees his plight walks over and asks if he 
               needs any help travis inaudibly says a name to her although 
               the name is obviously kris kristofferson

               the salesgirl digs out kristoffersons silvertongued devil 
               album for him

               travis says something additional to the salesgirl and she 
               goes off to giftwrap the album

               travis emerges from the record store the brightly gift 
               wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm

                                                                    cut to

               lengthy pov shot from travis vantage point behind the wheel

               we see the city as travis sees it the front windshield is a 
               little dirty the lighted meter just up at the low right 
               screen the intercom crackles with static and messages

               the light turns green we take off with a start a short 
               first gear  quick shift  a long second gear the cab 
               eases to the right of the street checking out prospective 
               fares

               our eyes scan the long lines of pedestrians the regular  
               bums junkies tourists hookers homosexuals hippies  
               they mean nothing now they only blend into the sidewalks 
               and lighted storefronts

               our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the 
               curb  is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head

               in the next block there are perhaps three four fares  
               quick gasup through this yellow light  brake sharply  
               check the action the first tourist nickel tipper  let 
               the next guy pick them up let the second go also the third  
               theres a live fare middleaged local woman short fare to 
               the east side good tip

               we pull to the curb waiting for her to get in it is a long 
               wait  a black street walker crosses in front of the cab 
               we focus on as travis would a young couple embracing in 
               the distance

               as we travel we hear travis random thoughts about selecting 
               fares and tips

                                     travis vo

               string together somebody steps out to hail the cab but 
               quickly steps back again the meter is up 90 itll be a 
               140 fare

               travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the plaza

                         to remember stuff like that

               travis thoughts are with betsy as three men enter travis 
               cab he activates the meter and pulls off

                                     mans voice
                         st regis hotel

               travis checks the mirror scanning across the back seat he 
               recognizes the middle passenger it is charles palantine 
               candidate for president he must have left the hotel shortly 
               after betsy

               tom seated on the jump seat checks his watch and speaks 
               deferentially to palantine

                                     tom
                         its 1230 now youll have fifteen 
                         minutes before the actual luncheon 
                         begins

               palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an 
               earlier conversation

                                     assistant

                         until things start coming in from 
                         california

               travis recognizes his passenger he puts out his cigarette

                                     travis
                              interrupting

                         general motors

                                     tom

               reassuming canditorial mien speaks to travis

                                     palantine
                         travis what single thing would you 
                         want the next president of this 
                         country to do most

                                     travis

                         political issues much

                                     palantine
                         there must be something

                                     travis
                              thinks
                         well he should clean up this city 
                         here its full of filth and scum

                         that would clean up this whole mess  
                         flush it out

               palantine is not a hubert humphreytype professional 
               bullshitter and travis intense reply stops him dead in his 
               tracks he is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries 
               to give it some meaning

                                     palantine
                              after a pause

                         its not going to be easy were 
                         going to have to make some radical 
                         changes

                                     travis
                              turning the wheel
                         damn straight

               ext barclay hotel

               travis taxi pulls up in front of the barclay hotel

               palantine and aide get out of the cab second aide stays in 
               back seat a moment to pay travis

               palantine looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods 
               goodbye to travis

                                     palantine
                         nice talking to you travis

                         thank you sir youre a good man 
                         sir

               travis taxi departs

               palantine and aides walk up carpet to the st regis

               camera closes in on palantine as he stops turns back and 
               watches travis departing taxi

               palantine turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his 
               aides

               ext manhattan street  early morning

               travis dressed to the teeth walks brightly down the 
               sidewalk his face is freshly shaved his hair combed his 
               tie straightened

               he pauses in a store window to check his appearance

               under his arm he carries the giftwrapped kristofferson record 
               album

               outside palantine headquarters

               betsy smartly dressed waves goodbye to another campaign 
               worker and walks out the door to greet him

               a short while later travis and betsy are walking down 
               broadway toward times square betsy does not let their bodies 
               touch as they walk although travis contemplates edging closer 
               to her

               betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record  
               or rather travis sentiment behind giving it

               travis looks around himself with pride this is a moment in 
               his life  one of the few

                                     betsy
                         you didnt have to spend your money  
                         

                                     travis
                              interrupting
                         hell what else can i do with it 
                         all

               betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken

                                     betsy
                         travis you havent even played the 
                         record

                                     travis
                              evasive
                         yeah well my stereo player is broke 
                         but im sure the record is ok

                                     betsy
                         your stereo broke god i could hardly 
                         stand that i live on music

                                     travis
                         i dont follow music much id like 
                         to though
                              second thought
                         honest

                                     betsy
                              pointing to album
                         so you havent heard this record 
                         yet

                                     travis
                         no
                              sly smile
                         i thought maybe you could play it 
                         for me on your player

               betsys face backtracks a bit maybe she was wrong to go out 
               with this fellow she doesnt know

               she makes a polite laugh

               later travis and betsy are in times square turning the 
               corner from broadway to 42nd street travis carries the album 
               under his arm

               they approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno 
               theatre advertising the swedish marriage manual the box 
               office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with 
               explicit publicity stills offending portions have been 
               blocked out with black tape

               travis steps over to the window and buys two 5 tickets 
               betsy befuddled watches him she doesnt know what to say 
               travis returns with the tickets

               betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening

                                     betsy
                         what are you doing

                                     travis
                              innocent
                         i bought a couple of tickets

                                     betsy
                         but this is a porno movie

                                     travis
                         no these are the kind that couples 
                         go to theyre not like the other 
                         movies all kinds of couples go 
                         honest ive seen them

               travis seems confused he is so much part of his own world 
               he fails to comprehend anothers world compared to the movies 
               he sees this is respectable but then theres also something 
               that travis could not even acknowledge much less admit 
               that he really wants to get this pure white girl into that 
               dark porno theatre

               travis makes an awkward gesture to escort betsy into the 
               theatre betsy looks at the tickets at the theatre at 
               travis she mentally shakes her head and walks toward the 
               turnstile she thinks to herself what the hell what can 
               happen shes always been curious about these pictures 
               anyway and  like all women no matter how intelligent  
               shes been raised not to offend her date a perverse logic 
               which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like 
               these

               inside the theater

               travis escorts betsy to an empty center row travis was right 
               couples do go to films like this there are at least six or 
               seven other men with their bewigged dates

               travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch betsy 
               looks curiously from side to side

               on screen a conservativelydressed middleaged woman is 
               speaking in swedish about importance of healthy sex life in 
               a happy marriage subtitles translate her words then without 
               warning there is a direct cut to a couple copulating on a 
               sterile tablelike bed

               travis watches intently the color however is slowly 
               draining from betsys cheeks one thought fills her mind 
               what am i doing here

                                     travis
                              to himself
                         damn

                                     betsy
                         whats wrong

                                     travis
                         i forgot to get the cocacola

               that does it betsy just looks at him for a moment then 
               gets up and starts to leave travis confused hustles after 
               her

               he follows her out of the theatre

               on the sidewalk

               travis catches up with her

                                     travis
                         where are you going

                                     betsy
                         im leaving

                                     travis
                         what do you mean

               betsy looks at travis trying to understand him

                                     betsy
                         these are not the kind of movies i 
                         go to

                                     travis
                         well i dont follow movies too 
                         much

                                     betsy
                         you mean these are the only kind of 
                         movies you go to

               the ticket girl watches expressionlessly from the booth

                                     travis
                         this is sort of high class

                                     betsy
                         i mean porno movies

                                     travis
                              hesitant
                         well mostly

                                     betsy
                         my god

                                     travis
                         we can go to another movie if you 
                         like i dont care i got money  
                         theres plenty

               travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd street marquees 
               but is interrupted by betsy

                                     betsy
                         if you just wanted to fuck why didnt 
                         you just come right out and say it

               travis is flabbergasted by betsys blunt language his arm 
               still gestures toward the marquees his lips continue to 
               move but words do not come out

               unable to respond to betsys question travis picks up where 
               he left off

                                     travis
                         theres plenty of movies around

               around and is watching his small portable tv which rests on 
               the upright melon crate

               a cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap 
               travis pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the

               she motions for him to go away and keeps on walking

               travis protesting follows

                         like a union

               travis tries to push his way past tom but tom grabs him 
               travis says something sharply to tom and the two scuffle 
               tom by far the taller and stronger quickly overcomes travis 
               wrenching his arm behind his back

               travis kicks and protests as tom leads him to the front door

               on the sidewalk

               travis efforts quickly subside when tom motions to a nearby 
               policeman travis quiets down and walks off

                                                                    cut to

               andy holds the magnum out for travis inspection theres a 
               worshipful closeup of the 44 magnum it is a monster

               it is built on michelangelos scale the magnum belongs in 
               the hand of a marble god not a slight taxi driver travis

                         practical use in which case id

                         splatter it against the wall the 
                         movies have driven up the price of 
                         the magnum anyway everybody wants 
                         them now but the wesson 38  only

                                     andy
                         some of these guns are like toys 
                         but a smith and wesson man you can 
                         hit somebody over the head with it 
                         and it will still come back dead on 
                         nothing beats quality

               travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills 
               and counts off eight

                                     andy

               a twenty and five

                                     travis

                                     travis
                              intensely

                              gestures to pistols

               travis is like a light switch for long periods he goes along 
               dark and silent saying nothing then suddenly the current 
               is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of 
               his personality travis inner intensity sets andy back a 
               bit but he quickly recovers

                                     andy
                         sure

               andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed he wraps the gun in 
               the sheet in the bag and zips it up an identical gym bag 
               can be partially seen under the bed he hands travis the 
               bag

                                     andy
                         you like ball games

                                     travis

                         nah i aint interested

               andy closes and locks the suitcases

                                     andy
                         okay okay

               travis turns to leave

                                     andy
                         wait a second travis ill walk you 
                         out

                                                                    cut to

               several weeks later the face of travis apartment has 
               changed the long blank wall behind the table is now covered 
               with tackedup charts pictures newspaperclippings maps 
               camera does not come close enough to discern the exact 
               contents of these clippings

               travis is in cu in the middle of the floor doing pushups 
               he is bareback wearing only his jeans there is a long scar 
               across his left side

                                     travis vo
                         may 29 1972 i must get in shape  
                         too much sitting has ruined my body  
                         twentyfive pushups each morning 
                         one hundred situps one hundred 
                         kneebends i have quit smoking

               travis still bareback passes his stiff arm through the 
               flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle

                                     travis vo
                         total organization is necessary  
                         every muscle must be tight

               int firing range

               the cracking sound of rapidfire pistol shots fills the musty 
               air of the firing range the walls are heavily soundproofed 
               and sawdust is spread over the floor

               travis stands rock solid firing the 44 magnum at an arms 
               length with each blasting discharge from the magnum travis 
               body shudders and shakes his arm as if each recoil from the 
               giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity

               travis fires the magnum as quickly as he can reset reaim 
               and refire the magnum is empty he sets it down picks up 
               the 38 special and begins firing as soon as he can aim  
               after the 38 comes the 25 it is as if he were in a contest 
               to see how quickly he can fire the pistols after all the 
               guns are discharged he begins reloading them without a 
               moments hesitation

               downrange the red and white targets have the black outline 
               of a human figure drawn over them the contourman convulses 
               under the steady barrage of travis rapidfire shots

               int apartment

               travis now wearing an unfastened green plaid western shirt 
               sits at the table writing in his diary the vial of bennies 
               is on the table

                                     travis vo
                         my body fights me always it wont 
                         work it wont sleep it wont shit 
                         it wont eat

               later travis his shirt still revealing his bare chest 
               sits on his straightbacked chair watching the tv the 44 
               magnum rests on his lap

               the tv is broadcasting rock time a late afternoon local 
               teenage dance and rock show on screen young teenyboppers 
               are dancing and the tv cameraman as any devotee of the 
               genre knows is relentlessly zoomingin on their firm young 
               breasts fannies and crotches  a sensibility which reflects 
               travis own these supperhour rock dance shows are the most 
               unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has 
               yet developed

               the hard rock number ends and the tv camera cuts to the 
               local disc jockey a hirsute plasticlooking man about 35 
               five scrumptious teenyboppers are literally hanging on his 
               shoulders and arms their faces turned up to him in droolish 
               awe out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey 
               blather he is the complete asshole i dont know who is 
               currently performing this function in new york but in los 
               angeles his name is real don steele

                         it you got it flaunt it

               travis watches the show his face hard and unmoving he is 
               as the scriptures would say pondering all these things in 
               his heart why is it the assholes get all the beautiful young 
               chicks he takes a swig of peach brandy

                                                                    cut to

               early evening about 630 pm travis taxi with off duty 
               light on sits near the curb somewhere in midtown manhattan

               travis runs his hand down the left side of his jacket 
               attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath

               travis opens his jacket partially checking underneath  
               there rests the nickelplated 38 special in its holster

               pov down the street where travis taxi is parked several 
               blocks ahead the red white and blue campaign headquarters 
               of charles palantine are visible

               travis eyes resume their watch

               travis starts the car and drives toward the palantine 
               headquarters

               tracking pov shot of row of storefronts leading up to 
               palantine headquarters pov passes headquarters it is

               charles palantine

               travis off duty light goes off as he speeds up and heads 
               toward a prospective fare

               later that night about 930 uptown  128th and amsterdam 
               the jungle travis taxi pulls up to an address lets off 
               young black man

               travis receives fare and tip takes off

               pov as travis works his way through harlem back down

               crashes in our path  taxi swerves to avoid it

               camera tracks through sidewalk crowds with the roving 
               suspicious antagonistic eye of a taxidriver

               later that night about 1230 travis is on the lower east 
               side somewhere on b street east of tompkins square

               the sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once 
               was the hippie movement teenage streetwalkers junkies 
               thugs emaciated loners on the prowl

               travis taxi pulls over letting out a fare

               travis pockets his fare but the rear right door doesnt 
               slam  instead there is the sound of another person jumping 
               into the cab

               travis checks the back seat in the rearview mirror there 
               sits a pale hippie prostitute

               the girl is at best 14 or 15 although she has been made 
               up to look older she wears floppy janis joplin clothes  
               her face is pallid she wears large bluetinted sunglasses 
               and multicolored leg stockings

               her name as we shall learn later is iris

               travis hesitates looking at her in the mirror

                                     iris
                         come on mister lets get outta 
                         here  quick

               travis moves to activate the meter when the rear door opens

               iris is helped out of the cab by a man travis cannot see

                                     sport
                              to iris
                         come on baby lets go this is all 
                         a real drag

               iris lets herself be taken out of the cab the rear door 
               closes

               sport leans partially in the front window throwing something 
               on the front seat travis looks it is a crumpled 20 bill

                                     sport
                         just forget all about this cabbie  
                         its nothing

               travis cannot see the sports face lime green completely 
               but notices he is wearing a jacket the voice is that of a 
               man in his early twenties

               travis turns to catch a glimpse of sport as he walks off 
               with iris

               travis shrugs and turns around

               travis taxi pulls away

                                                                    cut to

               early morning 600 am quitting time  travis pulls into 
               taxi garage

               int garage

               travis pulls into his stall

               travis sits in drivers seat thinking a moment he looks to 
               his right the crumpled 20 bill still lies there untouched 
               since it was thrown there six hours previously

               travis reluctantly picks up the 20 bill and stuffs it into 
               his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab he gathers up 
               his time report and heads toward bookin table

               a short while later travis is walking down the sidewalk 
               near the taxi garage his hands are in his jacket pockets 
               obscuring the slight bulge on his left side

               travis turns into the box office of porno theater he reaches 
               into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls 
               out crumpled 20 bill seeing the 20 bill he decides not 
               to use it and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead

               travis walks past concession stand en route to the darkened 
               theater auditorium a young man is now sitting listlessly 
               behind the concessions counter

               int porno theater auditorium

               travis slouches down into his seat his face glowing in the 
               reflected light from the screen

                                     female movie voice os

                              a beat
                         mmm thats good ahh ahh more

               travis averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too 
               graphic placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes 
               travis can by turning it inward shut off or open up his 
               field of vision by small degrees

               movie voice diminishes replaced by sound of travis voice 
               over

               tracking shot to wall of travis apartment camera moves 
               slowly across wall covered with clippings notes maps 
               pictures we now see their contents clearly

               the wall is covered with charles palantine political 
               paraphernalia there are pictures of him newspaper articles 
               leaflets bumper stickers as the camera moves along it 
               discovers a sketch of plaza hotel kennedy airport and cut
               up sections of city maps with notations written in there is 
               lengthy ny times clipping detailing the increased secret 
               security protection during the primaries a section pertaining 
               to palantine is underlined further along there is a sheet

                         the kings men cannot put it back 
                         together again

               as the camera reaches the end of its track it finds travis 
               standing his shirt open by the mattress he is wearing the 
               empty holster and the 44 is in his hand

               in the shots that follow travis gives the audience a lesson 
               in gunmanship

               travis practices fastdrawing the 38 special from his holster 
               and firing it

               he hooks the 44 into his pants behind his back and practices 
               withdrawing it he holds the 44 firmly at an arms length 
               tightening his forearm muscles

               he has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his 
               inner forearm whereby the colt 25 can rest hidden behind 
               the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated 
               sending the 25 flying down the gliders into his palm he 
               has cut open his shirt to accommodate the gun mechanism and 
               now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden

               he straps an army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit 
               in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly

               he now tries on various combinations of shirts sweater and 
               jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide 
               all the handguns he wishes to carry finally wearing two 
               western shirts a sweater and jacket he manages to obscure 
               the location of all three guns although he resembles a hunter 
               bundled up against the arctic winter

               he sits at the table dumdumming the 44 bullets  cutting 
               xs across the bullet heads

               pov he scans the objects of his room through the scope 
               of the 38

               travis stands in the middle of his apartment staring at his 
               palantine wall his eyes are glazed with introspection he 
               sees nothing but himself

               travis lies on his mattress all bundled up in his shirts 
               sweater jacket and guns his face is turned toward the 
               ceiling but his eyes are closed although the room is flooded 
               with light he is finally catching some sleep

               the big furry animal drifts into his own world

               night the taxis are roaming the slick streets

               sometimes after 200 am travis pulls his cab to the curb 
               near an allnight delicatessen in spanish harlem the streets 
               are relatively deserted

               travis waves to storekeeper as he walks past counter

                                     travis
                         hey melio

               spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio

               travis walks over to dairy counter in rear of store picks 
               out a pint of chocolate milk goes over to the open cooler 
               and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches he 
               overhears a voice as he looks at the sandwiches

               when travis returns to the counter with the chocolate milk 
               and a sandwich in one hand he sees a young black man holding 
               a gun on melio the stickup man is nervous hoppedup or 
               both he bounces on the balls of his cheap worn black tennis 
               shoes  a strungout junkie on a desperation ride the stick
               up man a thorough unprofessional doesnt notice travis

               melio watches the stickup man closely deciding what to do 
               himself

                                     stickup man
                              shaking gun
                         come on man quick quick quick 
                         hand over that bread

               it doesnt take travis long to decide what to do without 
               hesitation he pulls his 32 from his jacket pocket

                                     travis
                         hey dude

               the stickup man surprised turns toward travis finding 
               only an exploding 32 the mans lower jaw bursts open with 
               blood as he reels and crashes to the floor there is no 
               emotion on travis face

               as the stickup man falls melio leans over the counter 
               wielding his battered 38 he is about to fire when he 
               realizes the man is already dead

               melio charged up turns his gun toward travis then 
               realizing the danger is over lowers it again

               travis exits melio picks up the phone and starts dialing 
               the bloody body lies on the floor unmoving

               travis still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and 
               sandwich walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab 
               the street is deserted

               direct cut to pornographic movie this is the first time we 
               have actually seen the porno movie itself

               several actors and actresses are dallying on screen in

               whatever the action the movies decor is strictly zodys  
               ersatz landscape paintings tufted bedspreads as in most

               to receive instructions studio grunts groans and moans of 
               pleasure have been dubbed in

               action on screen begins to go into slow motion the actors 
               and actresses gradually transforming obscenity into poetry

                                                                    cut to

               afternoon soap opera he is cleaning his 38 and eating from 
               a jar of applesauce soap opera audio continues

               he watches the soap opera without expression

               sound track of film also slows down gradually mixing with 
               and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon tv soap 
               opera

               a young girl and boy are talking in those familiar soap opera 
               voices and a third party the girls mother who had tried 
               to terminate their relationship

                                                                    cut to

                              hesitantly
                         well jim its just that  i dont 
                         know how to say this  its that 
                         she thinks your parents arent 
                         good enough i guess

               travis through cleaning his gun begins to play a game with 
               the television set

               he places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate 
               which supports the tv then slowly rocking his heel back 
               and forth he sees how far he can tip the melon crate without 
               knocking it over

               the tv still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama rocks 
               back and forth

               travis pushes the tv farther and farther until finally the 
               inevitable happens  the crate tips backward sending the 
               portable tv crashing to the floor

               there is a short flash and the tv screen turns white

               travis realizing what he has done bends over turns the tv 
               upright on the floor fiddles with the knobs slaps it and 
               tries to reactivate the vanished image travis efforts are 
               futile a tube has broken and the tv will not come back to 
               life

                                     travis
                              to himself
                         damn damn

               travis bends over in the chair and places his head in his 
               hands despairing of himself

                                                                   fade to

               about 1 am travis pulls his cab behind a line of empty 
               taxis parked outside the bellmore cafeteria a cabbie hangout 
               on park avenue south

               he locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis he 
               sidesteps two drunken fighting bums and enters the bellmore

               a loud buzzer rings as travis steps into the bellmore he 
               pulls a ticket from the dispenser silencing the buzzer and 
               walks toward the walllength counter

               an assortment of cabbies are seated around a formicatopped 
               table near the rear of the cafeteria some are barely awake 
               some are eating the rest are swapping stories and small

               travis follows wizard out onto the sidewalk travis follows 
               wizard as he walks toward his cab he has something on his 
               mind something he wants to talk to wizard about

                                     travis
                              walking
                         hey wiz

               wizard leans back against the cab travis is about to speak 
               when he spots a group of black and puerto rican street punks 
               ages 1215 jiving down the sidewalk toward him one tosses 
               a spray paint can around his back basketball style another 
               mocks as if hes going to scratch a key along one of the 
               cabs

               wizard has no visible reaction a flash of controlled anger 
               crosses travis face he stares at the boy with the poised 
               key it is the same look that crossed his face in the harlem 
               deli we are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just 
               beneath travis surface

               the black punk must instinctively realize this too because 
               he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket 
               and bebopping around travis and wizard

               the young meanstreeters continue down the street and travis 
               turns back to wizard

               across the street in the background a junkie nestles in a 
               doorway

               betsy excuses herself and walks across the platform with 
               tom as they stand to the rear of the platform tom 
               secretively makes a gesture with his eyes and says out of 
               the side of his mouth

                                     tom

                         you around the office about a month 
                         ago

               betsy putting on her glasses looks closely she tries not 
               to make her stare too obvious

                                     betsy

                         the eyes and chin see see there

               camera closes in on travis bickle standing in the crowd he 
               has shaved his head to a short stubble there he is brush 
               cut wearing a giant grin and a large palantine 72 button

               although it is a pleasant sunny day travis wears a bulky 
               bulgedout army jacket

               travis looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the 
               crowd

               a short while later travis walks up to a secret service man 
               standing near the fringes of the crowd the secret service 
               man  in sun glasses grey suit everroving eyes  is 
               immediately identifiable

               whenever travis confronts a symbol of authority he becomes 
               like a young boy this time is no exception although one 
               suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish 
               exterior the secret service man for his part is about as 
               talkative as the sphinx

                                     travis
                         are you a secret service man

                                     travis

               secret service man glances at travis momentarily

               secret service mans gaze follows travis finger for a second 
               then return to travis

                                     travis contd

               the secret service man is starting to get interested in 
               travis he definitely ranks as a suspicious character

                                     secret service man

               the secret service man motions to a secret service 
               photographer to catch a picture of travis travis notices 
               this and quickly slips away into the crowd

                                                                    cut to

               travis sits at his desk in his apartment writing he wears 
               jeans western shirt and empty holster

                         days the time is coming

                                                                    cut to

               night travis taxi picks up a fare in the midtown area and 
               heads downtown

               lower east side travis lets off fare on b street and cuts 
               across toward tompkins square

               travis turns the corner when skreetch he suddenly hits the 
               brakes causing the cab to rock back and forth

               he has almost hit a young girl recklessly crossing the street  
               she thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance 
               and stares in shock through the front window cu girls 
               face

               travis recognizes her face its iris the girl in his taxi 
               a week or so before iris looks at travis sharply then turns 
               and continues walking

               travis eyes follow her and she rejoins a girlfriend they 
               are both dressed as hippie hookers sloppy clothes boots 
               jeans floppy hats and the old comehither walk is 
               unmistakable

               travis follows iris and her girlfriend slowly as they walk 
               down the sidewalk

               travis pov he examines them from bottom to top  boots 
               legs thighs breasts faces hats

               as travis rolls astride the girls he notices the familiar 
               fringe of a suede jacket standing in the shadows the girls 
               look toward the shadowed figure smile acknowledge some 
               unheard comment and continue on

               iris looks back uneasily at travis taxi and continues on

               on the corner stand two welltodo college students somewhat 
               out of place in this environment but making every attempt 
               to groove on it they are high on something or another

               the girls spot the college students and walk over to them 
               they exchange some small talk and walk off together there 
               is little subtlety involved it is obviously a pickup

               travis must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to 
               continue following the girls and their collegiate johns 
               this is not so easy since the traffic is heavy

               as travis slows down to make the turn he notices another 
               hippie hooker who had been watching him watching iris and 
               her girlfriend she walks over to the taxi leans in the 
               open left front window and gives travis the comeon disguised 
               as an innocent question

               cu hippie hooker

                                     hippie hooker
                         hey cabbie you comin or goin

               travis quickly turns his face away from her in a combination 
               of shock embarrassment and revulsion he is the child caught 
               with his hand in the cookie jar the very presence of this 
               crassly openly sexual human being frightens and sickens 
               him

               travis takes off with a skreetch his taxi shoots down the 
               block

                                                                    cut to

               a hot june day travis taxi the off duty sign on is 
               parked against the curb somewhere in harlem white cops 
               secret service men and reporters punctuate the otherwise 
               black crowds which walk to and fro in the bg

               charles palantines voice can be heard coming from a distant 
               loudspeaker system it is a political rally

               travis sits behind the wheel coldly staring at something in 
               the distance his hair of course is still clipped short 
               and he wears mirrorreflecting sunglasses even though a 
               drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek travis wears 
               his army jacket with the bulge on the left side  the 38 
               smith and wesson bulge

               a block away palantine stands on a platform outside his 
               uptown campaign headquarters on the platform sit an array 
               of black dignitaries nearby we recognize the secret service 
               man travis spoke to at the earlier rally he scans the crowd 
               anxiously

               palantine is speaking animatedly he is an excellent speaker 
               and captures our attention he drives hard toward his 
               arguments crashes down on his points his strained voice 
               rings with sincerity and anger

               cu of palantine as he speaks he is dressed in rolledup 
               shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face

                                     palantine
                         the time has come to put an end to

                         poverty way  and to those persons 
                         who seek to divide us never have i 
                         seen such a group of high officials 
                         from the president to senate leaders 
                         to cabinet members

               cut to travis no expression palantines words are barely 
               distinguishable from a block away

                         all their games are over now is the 
                         time to stand up against such 
                         foolishness propaganda and 
                         demagoguery now is the time for one 
                         man to stand up and accept his 
                         neighbor for one man to give in 
                         order that all might receive is 
                         unity and love of common good such a 
                         lost thing

               all live sound ceases as travis narration begins he is 
               reading from a letter or card he has just written

               as he speaks we see shots of palantine speaking a seated 
               row of young black palantine red white and blue bedecked 
               cheerleaders secret service agents examining the crowd and 
               so forth  these shots have no direct relationship to the 
               narration

                         and it will be me love travis

               travis at his desk examines the card upon which he has 
               just written this letter

               cu cover of card it is a 25 wedding anniversary card 
               with a fourcolor embossed cover the design could only be 
               described as urkitsch a cartoon mr and mrs allamerica 
               stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill clicking salt and 
               pepper shakers in a toast sentiment reads

               happy anniversary to a couple who have found the perfect 
               combination for marriage

               the card opens to read

               love

               underneath the word love begins travis short message to 
               his parents a message which extends to the back cover of 
               the card

                                                                    cut to

               night on the lower east side travis sits parked in the dark 
               shadows of a side street the lone wolf waits

               travis watches the slum goddesses as they work the section 
               of the street reserved for hippie hookers

               travis pov some of the young street girls are arrogant 
               almost aggressive others are more insecure and inexperienced

               a black man charges down the sidewalk across the street from 
               travis he walks at a fast maniacal clip looking only at 
               the sidewalk in front of him out of his mouth comes a

               continuous stream of invective thatcocksuckingcrazyno 
               goodassholebitchwhenigetmyfuckingfingersonhernigger
               titsimgonnaringemandshitupherass and so on  
               he is out of control nobody seems to notice or care

               travis takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake
               out

               finally travis spies the object of his search iris walks 
               down the sidewalk with her girlfriend iris wears her large 
               blue sunglasses

               travis checks to see if his 38 is in place it is opens 
               the door and exits from the cab

               flipping up the collar of his army jacket travis slouches 
               over and walks toward iris he sort of sidles up next to her 
               and walks beside her travis always looks most suspicious 
               when hes trying to appear innocent

                                     travis
                              shy

                         all right

                         ill wait here

               travis eyes follow iris nod until they reach sport standing 
               in a doorway in his lime green jacket travis walks toward 
               him

               sport a thirtiesh white greaser has the affections of a 
               black pimp his hips are jiving his fingers softly snapping

                         you name sport

               sport immediately takes travis for an undercover cop he 
               extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed

                         catch you later copper

               travis freezes not saying anything he turns back toward 
               sport

                              laughs

               travis walks back to iris

               iris motions for travis to follow her and he does

               iris and travis turn the corner and walk about a block saying 
               nothing iris turns into a darkened doorway and travis follows 
               her

               at the top of the dark stairs iris and travis enter a dimly 
               lit hallway on either side are doors with apartment numbers 
               iris turns toward the first door no 2

                                     iris
                         this is my room

               at the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge old man 
               his face is obscured by shadow travis is about to enter the 
               room when the old man speaks up

                                     old man
                         hey cowboy

               travis turns his head toward the old man who has stood up 
               and is advancing toward him

                                     old man
                              motioning to travis

                              a beat
                         gimme the rod cowboy

               travis hesitates a moment uncertain what to do the old man 
               reaches in travis jacket and pulls out the 38 special

                                     old man

               travis enters no 2 with iris

               travis looks around iris room although dimly lit the room 
               is brightly decorated there is an orange shag carpet deep 
               brown walls and an old red velvet sofa on the walls are 
               posters of mick jagger bob dylan and peter fonda a neil 
               young album is playing on a small phonograph

               this is where iris lives it bears the individual touch of a 
               young girl

               iris lights a cigarette takes a single puff and places it 
               in an ashtray on the bedstand

                                     travis
                         why you hang around with them

                                     iris
                         a girl needs protection

                         that cigarette burns out your time 
                         is up

               iris sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and 
               coat she takes off her bluetinted sunglasses  her last 
               defense without the paraphernalia of adulthood iris looks 
               like a little girl she is about 14 15

               by her partial nudity

               iris tries to unzip travis fly this only unnerves travis 
               more sexual contact is something hes never really 
               confronted

               travis is getting increasingly panicked but iris only thinks

               iris lowers her head to go down on travis travis seeing 
               this jumps up in panic

               travis stands several feet from iris his fly is still open 
               and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans he 
               is starting to come apart

                                     travis
                         fuck it fuck it fuck it fuck it 
                         fuck it fuck it fuck it

                         dont you understand anything

               iris says nothing after a moment travis again sits on the 
               bed beside iris she no longer tries to make him

               there is a moment of silence iris puts her arm around his 
               shoulder

                                     iris
                         you dont have to make it mister

               travis rests a moment collecting himself finally he says

                                     travis
                              slowly

               there is a pause travis smiles and shrugs apologetically 
               travis looks at iris cigarette its burning down to the 
               butt

               travis exits

               travis closes the door to no 2 and stands in the corridor 
               for a moment

               the old man slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway 
               with travis 38 in his hand old man stands near travis 
               and checks his watch

               travis reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar 
               crumpled 20 bill he makes a big show of stuffing the 
               wrinkled bill into the old mans hand the old man doesnt 
               understand the significance of it

                                     travis

               travis cab is parked near a neighborhood bickfords

               travis and iris are having late breakfast at a middleclass 
               east side coffee shop it is about 130 pm

               iris is dressed more sensibly wearing jeans and a maroon 
               sweater her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out

               seen this way iris looks no different than any young girl 
               in the big city other patrons of the coffee shop most likely 
               assume she is having lunch with her big brother

               they are both having an allamerican breakfast ham and eggs 
               large glasses of orange juice coffee

               outside here environment iris seems the more pathetic she 
               seems unsure schizy unable to hold a subject for more than 
               thirty seconds her gestures are too broad her voice too 
               mannered we sympathize with travis paternal respect this 
               girl is in trouble

                                     iris

                         where is home

               iris removes her large bluetinted sunglasses and fishes 
               through her bag for another pair

                                     iris
                         i got so many sunglasses i couldnt 
                         live without my shades man i must 
                         have twelve pair of shades

               she finds a pinktinted pair and puts them on

                         up go to school play with boys 
                         you know that kinda stuff

               iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and 
               folds the bread over like a hotdog

                                     iris

                         youre not much with girls are you

                                     travis
                              thinks
                         well iris i look at it this way a 
                         lot of girls come into my cab some 
                         of them very beautiful and i figure 
                         all day long men have been after 
                         them trying to touch them talk to 
                         them ask them out and they hate 
                         it so i figure the best i can do 
                         for them is not bother them at all 
                         so i dont say a thing i pretend 
                         im not even there i figure theyll 
                         understand that and appreciate me 
                         for it

               it takes iris a moment to digest this pure example of negative 
               thinking i am loved to the extent i do not exist

                                     iris
                         do you really think i should go to

                         i think you should go home but 
                         otherwise i think you should go it 
                         would be great for you you have to

               mumbling something about her shades again iris fishes 
               through her bag until she comes up with another 99 pair of

               a platform outside a brooklyn union hall a dixieland band 
               is playing on the platform

               cu charles palantines feet climb out of a limousine  
               there is a roar from the nearby crowd

               of him pushes his way through the crowd toward the platform 
               still cameras click and tv cameras purr

               indistinguishable

               cu of travis boots walking they make their way past one 
               person then two then a cluster of three or four sounds of 
               rally increase

               we see a full figure shot of travis he is standing alone in 
               an opening near the fringes of the crowd

               travis looks like the most suspicious human being alive his 
               hair is cropped short he wears mirrorreflecting glasses 
               his face is pallid and drained of color his lips are pursed 
               and drawn tight he looks from side to side one can now see 
               the full effect of travis lack of sleep and sufficient diet  
               he looks sick and frail

               shirt sweater and army jacket buttoned from top to bottom 
               under his jacket are several large lumps causing his upper 
               torso to look larger than it should he is slightly hunched 
               over and his hands shoved into his pockets

               anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon travis 
               and think there is an assassin

               travis pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and 
               swallows a couple

                                                                    cut to

               palantine steps back smiling and receiving the applause 
               then nodding at the secret service man he descends the 
               stairs and prepares to work his way through the crowd

               travis unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket opening 
               access to his holster with the other hand he checks the 44 
               hooked behind his back

               palantine smiles and shakes a few of the many hands 
               outstretched toward him

               points in travis direction

               the second secret service man converges on travis from the 
               side

               travis and palantine draw closer to each other

               secret service man walking just behind palantine grabs the 
               candidates hand and pulls him backward palantine looks 
               sharply back at secret service man who motions for him to 
               take a slightly altered route

               travis is being propelled by an inner force a force which 
               takes him past the boundaries of reason and selfcontrol

               sport looks into travis eyes saying nothing he realizes 
               the seriousness of the situation

               travis pulls his 38 special and holds it on sport pushing 
               him even further back against the wall

                                     travis

                              demanding
                         show it to me

               sport reluctantly pulls a 32 caliber pistol a purse gun 
               from his pocket and holds it limply

               travis sticks his 38 into sports gut and discharges it 
               there is a muffled blast followed by a muted scream of pain

                                     travis
                         now suck on that

               agony and shock cross sports face as he slumps to the floor 
               travis turns and walks away before sport even hits

               as travis walks away sport can be seen struggling in the 
               bg

               travis he gun slipped into his jacket walks quickly up the 
               sidewalk

               around the corner travis walks into the darkened stairway 
               leading to iris apartment

               as he walks up the stairs travis pulls the 44 magnum from 
               behind his back and transfers the 38 special to his left 
               hand he walks up the steps a pistol dangling from each 
               hand

               at the top of the stairs travis spots the old man sitting 
               at the far end of the dark corridor the old man starts to 
               get up when travis discharges the mighty 44 at him blaam 
               the hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder

               the old man staggers at the end of the corridor his right 
               hand has been blown off at the forearm

               there is the sharp sound of a gunshot behind travis his 
               face grimaces in pain a bullet has ripped through the left 
               side of his neck blood flows over his left shoulder

               travis 44 flies into the air

               travis looks down the stairway there sport lies choking in 
               a puddle of his own blood he has struggled long enough to 
               fire one shot

               falling travis drills another 38 slug into sports back 
               but sport is already dead

               travis slumps to his knees down the corridor the old man 
               with a bloody stump is struggling toward him travis turns 
               his 38 toward the old man

               the door to no 2 opens iris scream is heard in the bg  
               the bulky frame of the private cop fills the doorway his 
               blue shirt is open in his hand hangs a 38 service revolver

               the private cop raises his gun and shoots travis travis 
               blood gushing from his right shoulder sinks to the floor 
               his 38 clangs down the stairs

               the old man grows closer travis smashes his right arm against 
               the wall miraculously the small colt 25 glides down his 
               forearm into his palm

               travis fills the private cops face full of bullet holes

               the private cop screaming crashes back into the room

               the old man crashes atop travis the 25 falls from travis 
               hand

               both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into iris 
               room iris hides behind the old red velvet sofa her face 
               frozen in fright

               travis trapped under the heavy old man reaches down with 
               his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right 
               calf

               just as travis draws back the knife the old man brings his 
               huge left palm crashing down on travis the old mans palm 
               is impaled on the knife

               old man screams in pain

               police sirens are heard in bg

               with great effort travis turns over pinning the old man to 
               the floor the bloody knife blade sticks through his upturned 
               hand

               travis reaches over with his right hand and picks up the 
               revolver of the new dead private cop

               travis hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the 
               old mans mouth

               the old mans voice is full of pain and ghastly fright

                                     old man
                         dont kill me dont kill me

                         him

               travis fires the revolver blowing the back of the old mans 
               head off the silencing his protests

               the police sirens screech to a halt sound of police officers 
               running up the stairs

               travis struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa 
               his bloodsoaked body blending with the velvet

               iris retreats in fright against the far wall

               first uniformed police officer rushes in room drawn gun in 
               hand other policemen can be heard running up the stairs

               travis looks helplessly up at the officer he forms his bloody 
               hand into a pistol raises it to his forehead and his voice 
               croaking in pain makes the sound of a pistol discharging

                                     travis
                         pgghew pgghew

               out of breath fellow officers join the first policeman they 
               survey the room

               travis head slumps against the sofa

               iris is huddled in the corner shaking

               live sound ceases

               overhead slow motion tracking shot surveys the damage

                from iris shaking against the bloodspattered wall

                to travis bloodsoaked body lying on the sofa

                to the old man with half a head a bloody stump for one 
               hand and a knife sticking out the other

                to police officers staring in amazement

                to the private cops bulletridden face trapped near the 
               doorway

                to puddles of blood and a lonely 44 magnum lying on the 
               hallway carpet

                down the bloodspecked stairs on which lies a nickle 
               plated 38 smith and wesson special

                to the foot of the stairs where sports body is hunched 
               over a pool of blood and a small 32 lies near his hand

                to crowds huddled around the doorway held back by police 
               officers

                past red flashing lights running policemen and parked 
               police cars

                to the ongoing nightlife of the lower east side curious 
               but basically unconcerned looking then heading its own way

                                                                   fade to

               slow tracking shot across int apartment room appears pretty 
               much the same although there is a new portable tv and an 
               inexpensive easy chair

               visual track begins at table and works across the room to 
               the mattress

               we see these items

                on the table rests the diary closed a desk calendar 
               stands on the table it is october

                across the wall where the palantine clippings once hung 
               there are now a series of new newspaper clippings right to 
               left they read

               1 the first is a full back page from the ny daily news  
               headline reads cabbie battles gangsters there are large 
               photos of police standing in iris room after the slaughter 
               and a picture of travis cabbie mug shot

               2 underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo 
               from the ny times twocolumn headline reads cabbie 
               shootout three dead

               3 a followup story from the news twocolumn photo shows 
               plain middleaged couple sitting in middleclass living room 
               twocolumn headline reads parents express shock gratitude

               4 a twocolumn daily news story without photo headline 
               reads taxidriver hero to recover

               5 a onecolumn twoparagraph news story stuck on an obscure 
               page headline reads cabbie returns to job

                at the end of the clippings a letter is tacked to the 
               wall it is a simple letter handwritten on plain white paper 
               the handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and 
               orderly we recognize that it is the same letter that is 
               being read in voice over

                when we finally arrive at the mattress we find it is 
               barren a pillow and blanket new purchases are folded at 
               the head of the mattress

               audio throughout the track we hear the voice of a middle 
               aged uneducated man reading in voice over

               it is the voice of iris father and he is reading a letter 
               he sent to travis and which travis has tacked to his wall

                                     iris father vo
