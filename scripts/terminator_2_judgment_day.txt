	revised final shooting script



1	ext city street  day

	downtown la  noon on a hot summer day  on an extreme long lens the
	lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity  in slow motion
	they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to
	bumper  heat ripples distort the torrent of faces  the image is
	surreal dreamy and like a dream it begins very slowly to

						dissolve to

2	ext city ruins  night

	same spot as the last shot but now it is a landscape in hell  the
	cars are stopped in rusted rows still bumper to bumper  the
	skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
	unimaginable force like a row of kickeddown sandcastles
	wind blows through the desolation keening with the sound of ten
	million dead souls  it scurries the ashes into drifts stark
	white in the moonlight against the charred rubble
	a title card fades in

			los angeles july 11 2029

3	angle on a heap of fireblackened human bones  beyond the mound is a
	vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete  the rush hour crowd
	burned down in their tracks

4	we dissolve to a playground where intense heat has halfmelted the
	jungle gym the blast has warped the swing set the merrygoround
	has sagged in the firestorm  small skulls look accusingly from the
	ashdrifts  we hear the distant echo of childrens voices playing
	and laughing in the sun  a silly singsongy rhyme as we tracks
	slowly over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch
	lines are still visible

	camera comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle next to the
	tiny skull of its owner  hold on this image as a female voice speaks

				voice
		3 billion human lives ended on august 29th 1997
		the survivors of the nuclear fire called the war
		judgment day  they lived only to face a new
		nightmare the war against the machines

	a metal foot crushes the skull like china

	tilt up revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle
	it looks like a chrome skeleton a hightech death figure  it is
	the endoskeleton of a series 800 terminator  its glowing red eyes
	compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain hunting

	the sounds of roaring turbines  searchlights blaze down as a
	formation of flying hk hunterkiller patrol machines passes
	overhead  pan with them toward the jagged horizon beyond which we
	see flashes and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in
	progress

5	ext battlefield  night

	the battle  human troops is desperate combat with the machines for
	possession of the dead earth  the humans are a ragtag guerrilla
	army  skynets weapons consist of ground hks tanklike robot
	gunplatforms flying aerial hks fourlegged gunpods called
	centurions and the humanoid terminators in various forms

	sequence of rapid cuts
5a      explosions  beamweapons firing like searing strobelight
5b      a gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a law rocket at a
	pursuing aerial hk bringing it down in a fiery explosion
5c      another apc is crushed under the treads of a massive ground hk

5d      a team of guerrillas in a intense firefight with terminator
5e      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building  three terminator
5f      endoskeletons advance firing rapidly  another complete cyborg
	with flesh ripped open and back broken gropes for a rifle on the
	ground

5g      a centurion overruns a human firing position  soldiers are cut
	down as they run  fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing
	machines

6	in a blasted gun emplacement at the edge of battle a man watches
	the combat with nightvision binoculars  he wears the uniform of a
	guerrilla general and a black beret  he is still amid running
	shouting techs and officers

	cu man pushing slowly in as the battle rages os  he lowers the
	binoculars  he is fortyfive years old  features severe  the left
	side of his face is heavily scarred  a patch covers that eye  an
	impressive man forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war  the name
	stitched on the band of his beret is connor  we push in until his
	eyes fill frame then

						dissolve to

	fire  slow boiling enormous  filling frame

				voice sarah connor
		skynet the computer which controlled the machines
		sent two terminators back through time  their
		mission to destroy the leader of the human
		resistance john connor  my son

		the first terminator was programmed to strike at
		me in the year 1984 before john was born
		it failed

		the second was set to strike at john himself
		when he was still a child  as before the
		resistance was able to send a lone warrior  a
		protector for john  it was just a question of
		which one of them would reach him first

7	ext truckstop  night

	wild fingers of bluewhite electric arcs dance in a steel canyon
	formed by two tractor trailers parked side by side in the back lot
	of an allnight truck stop  then

	the strange lightning forms a circular opening in midair and in
	the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy
	then the frame whites out with an explosive thunderclap

	through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly a naked man
	terminator has come through  physique massive perfect  face
	devoid of emotion  terminator stands and impassively surveys its
	surroundings

8	int truck stop diner  night

	on a back route to north la  a handful of local truckers hunch over
	chilisizes cat hats pushed back on their heads  three bikers are
	playing a game of pool in the back their miller empties lining the
	tables rail  the dives owner lloyd a fat aging bikertype in a
	soiled apron stands behind the bar  nothing much going on

	then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in  that
	doesnt happen every night  all eyes simultaneously swivel toward
	terminator  its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it
	walks calmly through the room  everyone frozen not sure how to
	react

8a      terminator pov  a digitized electronic scan of the room overlaid
	with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye
	can follow  in pov we move past the staring truckers past the
	owner and the awestruck waitress and approach a large nastylooking
	biker puffing on a cigar  his body is outlined or selected and
	thousands of estimated measurements appear  his clothing has been
	analyzed and deemed suitable

8b			      terminator
		i need your clothes your boots and your
		motorcycle

	the big bikers eyes narrow  he takes a long draw on this cigar
	the tip cherryred hot

				cigar biker
		you forgot to say please

	he grinds the cigar out on terminators chest  which produces not
	the slight reaction of pain  terminator calmly and without
	expression grabs cigar by his meaty upper arm
	cigar screams from the hydraulic grip

	terminator doesnt see cigars friend behind him holding his pool
	cue by the narrow end like a louisville slugger  the heavy send
	whistles in a powerful swing and cracks in two across the back of
	terminators head

	terminator seems not to notice  doesnt even blink  without
	releasing his grip on cigar he snaps his arm straight back and grabs
	pool cue by the front of his jacket  suddenly the heavyset biker
	finds himself flying through the nearest window  craassh

	terminator hurls cigar all 230 pounds of him clear over the bar
	through the serving window into the kitchen where he lands on the
	big flat grill  we hear a sound like sizzling bacon as cigar
	screams flopping jerking  he rolls off in a smoking heap

	the third biker whips out a knife with a eightinch blade and slashes
	at terminators face

	terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand  holding it by
	the razorsharp blade he jerks is from the guys hand
	ultrafast here he flips it  grabs the handle like youre supposed
	to hold a knife  grabs the biker and slams him facedown over the
	bar  then brings the knife whistling down pinning the bikers
	shoulder to the bar top with his own steel

9	int kitchen

	the doors bangs open and terminator strides in
	the mexican cook does a fast fade as terminator walks toward cigar
	who is cursing in pain on the floor

	with his deepfried fingers he struggles to get out the 45 auto
	tucked under his leather jacket  but he cant even hold onto it
	terminator takes it from him  instead of pointing it at him
	terminator carefully examines weapon analyzing its caliber and
	operating condition  terminator never threatens thats a human
	thing  he just takes

	cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to
	him  he slides the keys to his bike across the floor to terminators
	foot  then painfully starts getting out of his jacket

10      int truck stop

	terminator strides from the kitchen fully clothed now in a black
	leather jacket leather riding pants and heavy clean boots  he
	moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table  without
	slowing his stride he jerks the knife out  the guy slumps to the
	floor groaning behind him

	terminator continues toward the front of the diner passing lloyd
	the owner  at the door he comes abreast of two truckers who sit
	frozen like a snapshot in midbite  one of the truckers finally
	nods

				trucker
		evening

	terminator impassively stares back  then moves on out the door

11      ext truck stop

	terminator walks out surveying the parked harleys  sticks the 45
	in his belt and swings one leg over a massive custom electroglide
	he slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition  kicks
	over the engine  it catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron
	into gear with a klunk

	lloyd appears at the diners door with a sawedoff 10gauge
	winchester leveraction shotgun  he fires into the air and jacks
	around round in fast aiming at terminators back

				lloyd
		i cant let you take the mans wheels son
		now get off or ill put you down

	terminator turns and considers by coldly  he eases the shifter up
	into neutral  rocks the bike onto its kickstand  swings him leg
	over and walks calmly toward the guy

	terminator strides right up to lloyd staring straight into the
	shotguns muzzle  lloyd starts sweating trying to decide is hes
	going to kill a man in cold blood  hes still trying to decide when
	terminators hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow
	suddenly holding the shotgun

	lloyd gapes knowing hes screwed  then
	terminator reaches toward him  oh shit
	and slips the sunglasses out of lloyds shirt pocket  puts them on
	strides back to the harley and roars off in a shower of gravel

12      ext freeway  night

	terminator roars down the freeway heading for la  cold neon flares
	across the chrome of the big bike  the 10gauge is jammed through
	the clutch and brake cables across the handlebars  the lights flow
	over terminators wraparound sunglasses like the tracks of tracer
	rounds

13      ext overpass  night

	the first street bridge  rusting chainlink fence and graffiti
	covered walls  an lapd blackandwhite cruises the empty street

	a tremendous bluewhite glare suddenly spills out between the columns
	of the overpass  the young uniformed cop in the car whips his head
	around at the source of the light  he pulls over quickly in time
	to see

13a     the powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between
	the columns  lightning climbs the chainlink fence and light
	standards lighting up the night and papers swirl in a blasting
	whirlwind

13b     the cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades
	he sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the
	strange light  he draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the
	shadows between the rows of pillars

	a naked man glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop  nothing
	special about him  certainly not built like a terminator  the flash
	of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he
	just arrived from the future  his features are handsome bordering
	on severe  his eyes are gray ice  penetrating  intelligent

	the cop spins at a sound  too late  mr x is already on him  the
	blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand

	low angle as the unconscious cop hits the deck his beretta 9mm
	automatic clattering next to him  a hand enters frame and picks up
	this pistol

13c     highly polished black shoes rounding the rear tire of the police
	cruiser  follow the shoes to the cruisers door then move up as
	mr x dressed now in lapd blue climbs behind the wheel  he
	looks and acts exactly like a cop  cool alert confident in his
	power his expression emotionless and judgmental
	mr x now officer x puts the car in gear and drives into the night

19      int hospital  maximum security wing

	sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall  the room
	is empty of all furnishings save the bed a stainless steel sink

	leads a group of young interns  following laconically are three
	burly attendants

	comes over the tinny speaker

				silberman
		morning sarah

	reverse angle as she turns slowly into close up
	sarah connor is not the same woman we remember from last time  her
	eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered
	animal  defiant and intense but skittering around looking for
	escape at the same time  fight or flight  down one cheek is a long
	scar from just below the eye to her upper lip
	her voice is a low and chilling monotone

				sarah
		good morning dr silberman  hows the knee

22      int corridor

	silbermans smug composure drops a second  then returns

				silberman
		fine sarah
			he switches off speaks to
			the interns
		she uh stabbed me in the kneecap with a
		screwdriver a few weeks ago

	sarah watches them talking about her through the glass but cant
	hear them  she feels like a lab animal  the interns look in at her
	through the glass as silberman talks  with her face drawn eyes
	haggard and hair wild she looks like she belongs where she is

				silberman
		the delusional architecture is interesting
		she believes a machine called a terminator
		which looks human of course was sent back
		though time to kill her  and also that the
		father of her child was a soldier sent to
		protect her he was from the future too
			he smiles
		the year 2029 if i remember correctly
			the interns chuckle
		lets move on shall we

	as the interns walk on silberman steps close to douglas the head
	attendant and speaks low

				silberman
		douglas i dont like seeing the patients
		disturbing their rooms like this  see that she
		takes her thorazine would you

	douglas is 64 250 pounds and warmhearted at a rattlesnake  he
	nods catching silbermans meaning and gestures for the other
	attendants to hang back as silberman moves on in his rounds

23      int cell

	sarah looks up as the cell door opens  douglas walks in slowly
	idly tapping his police baton against the door in a ominous rhythm
	the other two orderlies ease in behind him  one of them carries a
	stun baton like a sawedoff cattle prod  the other has a tray with
	cups of red liquidthorazine

				douglas
		time to take you meds connor

	sarah faces him weight centered  feral eyes darting from one to the
	other

				sarah
		you take it

	douglas grins casual 

				douglas
		now you know you got to be good cause you up
		for review this afternoon

				sarah
		im not taking it  now i dont want any
		trouble

				douglas
		aint no trouble at all 

	he whips the baton in a whistling backhand which 
	whap  takes her square in the stomach  she doubles over and drops
	to her knees unable to breathe  douglas tips the bed and it slams
	down with a crash right new to her  he takes her stun wand from
	the other attendant and walks forward

	tight on sarah grimacing and struggling to breathe

				sarah
		you son of a aaarrgh

	the stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise
	it drives her to the floor pinning her like a bug  little
	electric arcs crackle as the baton makes her writhe in pain
	douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees  holds
	the cup of thorazine in front of her lips

				douglas
		last call sugar

	gasping she chokes the zombie juice down

	some kind of blackbox electronics unit hes got in his everpresent

	sarah staggers from her cell  reese is already impossibly a
	hundred feet away striding down the dim corridor  a silhouette
	in a long coat disappearing around a corner

	sarah runs after him her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum
	her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dreamruns along the
	seemingly infinite corridor  she reaches the corner slides around
	it and

30a     slams right into the arms of douglas and his three helpers  they
	grab her as she struggles and screams  the silberman is there
	smiling soothingly  they force her down and she is pinned to
	the floor screaming  a new figure approaches one even more
	menacing

	terminator walks toward her with heavy measured steps  backlit
	eyes concealed by the sunglasses it stands over her like the angel
	of death itself  it reaches down and
	takes her hand  lifts her up  leads her to a door  they go through
	together  emerging into

30b     a beautiful sunlight morning  children are playing nearby sliding
	down slides clambering through a jungle gym  sarah knows this
	dream know its is the worst of all her nightmares  she starts
	to scream but no sound comes out

30c     the sky explodes into white light  everything is seared by the unholy
	glare hotter than a thousand suns  the children ignite like
	match heads  sarah is burning screaming silently everything silent
	and overexposed  terminators flesh and clothing are burning
	silently  it grips her hand virgil to her dante in this tour of the
	nuclearage inferno

30d     the blast wave hits a nearsolid wall of compressed air followed
	by 250mph winds  the children charcoal statues frozen in positions
	of play explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away  sound
	hit now with a thunderous roar  sarahs scream merges with the
	howl of the wind as the blast hits her exploding the flesh from her
	bones  beside her terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh
	becoming a smoking skeleton of steel

30e     then she wake up in her cell shackled to the bed  sunlight hurts
	her eyes  she looks desperate and defeated  she knows the war is
	coming  it visits her every time she closes her eyes  lost and
	alone sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity

	silberman gives a calculated paternal smile

				silberman

	sarah looks up at him  her voice is hopeful

				sarah
		it has helped me a lot to have a goal something
		to look forward to

				silberman
		and what it that

	as she answers we pull back revealing that we have been looking
	through a oneway mirror from an adjacent observation room  in the
	shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the
	earlier rounds and a couple of staff psychologists  they smoke and
	make the occasional note

				sarah
		you said i could be transferred to the minimum
		security wing and have visitors if i showed
		improvement in six months  well its been six
		months and i was looking forward to seeing my
		son

				silberman
		i see  lets go back to what you were saying
		about these terminator machines  now you think
		they dont exist

	close on sarah  her voice sounds hollow

				sarah
		they dont exist  i see that now

	silberman leans back studying her  toying with her

				silberman
		but youve told me on many occasions about how
		you crushed one in a hydraulic press

				sarah
		if i had there would have been some evidence
		they would have found something at the factory

				silberman
		i see  so you dont believe anymore that the
		company covered it up

	some hopeful guy with a hot date

43c     the cop is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the
	multicinema  he walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized
	combat  cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise

43d     john is shooting down migs at mach 2  his friend tim slides up next
	to him  taps him on the shoulder trying to play it cool

				tim
		some cop is scoping for you dude

	john looks around the corner of the afterburner ride  sees the cop
	showing a picture to some of the kids  the kids point his way

	john ducks just as the cop glances over  he slinks out the other side
	of the ride and heads for the back of the store instinctively
	retreating  sarah has taught him that cops are bad news

	the cop scans the crowded arcade  glimpses john looking back as he
	moves around a row of machines  starts toward him

	john sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast  looks back
	the cop is shoving through clots of kids  one of them is slammed to

	crushes the flowers as it moves forward

	john transfixed by terror is trapped in the narrow featureless
	shooting gallery of the corridor  the shotgun comes up  terminator
	expressionlessly strides forward  jacks a round into the chamber
	slow and fluid

	john looks behind him for a place to run  sees the cop coming toward
	him pulling his beretta pistol  incredibly john realizes the cop
	is aiming his gun at him
	john looks back at terminator  he is starting into the black muzzle
	of the 10gauge now  aimed right at his head  he realizes hes
	screwed  then something crazy happens

				terminator
		get down

	john instinctively ducks  terminator pulls the trigger kaboom

	the cop catches the shotguns blast square in the chest just as he
	fires the pistol  the pistols shot goes wild

	terminator pumps another round into him  the another  and another
	advancing a step each time he fires he empties the shotgun into the
	cop blowing his backward down the corridor  the sound is deafening
	then silence

	the cop lies still on his back

44a     terminator is now standing right over john  they both watch as the
	cop incredibly sits up unharmed and gets to his feet  terminator
	grabs john roughly by his jacket  clutches the kid to his chest
	then spins around at the cop opens fire with the beretta

44b     the cop who not only isnt a cop he clearly isnt even human
	pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machinepistol

	on terminators back as the 9mm slugs slam into it punching bloody
	holes in the motorcycle jacket

	john is bugeyed with fear but completely unscratched  terminators
	body has blocked the bullets

	the beretta clacks empty  terminator turns at the sound
	shoves john behind a coke machine  drops the empty shotgun  starts
	walking toward the cop
	the empty magazine clatters to the floor
	the cop inserts another one  snaps back the slide
	terminator still has twenty feet to go
	he doesnt break his purposeful stride

	the cop opens fire  bullets rake terminators chest  he doesnt
	even flinch
	ten feet to go  blam blam blam blam  neither the cop nor terminator
	show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips terminators
	wardrobe to shreds

	clack  the pistol empties again  terminator stops two feet in front
	of the cop  the appraise each other for a second

	we realize now that the cop is a terminator too  we dont know the
	details yet but lets call him the t1000 since thats what he is
	a newer model than the one weve come to know so well the 800
	series arnold  this guys a prototype and hes got quite a
	few surprises

	t1000 and terminator size each other up  terminator moves first
	he grabs t1000 in his massive hands but the t1000 snaps back with a
	countergrip  after about two seconds of intense slamming the walls
	on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in and
	the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and
	disappeared

	john totally stunned by all this remembers to move  he staggers to
	his feet  stumbleruns toward the parking garage

44c     third level concourse  a plate glass window explodes and terminator
	crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the
	screaming crowd

44d     t1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after
	john accelerating slowly into a loping predatory run

44e     terminator is totally still  a japanese tourist cautiously steps
	forward and takes a picture of the body  suddenly terminators
	eyes snap open  the stunned tourist backs away

	he sits up and looks around  gets his bearings  rises smoothly to
	his feet  all servos seem to be working fine  the tourists camera
	whirs as the motordrive runs on by itself taking shot after show
	the owner isnt even looking through the eyepiece hes so shocked

45      int parking garage

	john is frantically pumping the kickstart of his bike scared
	shitless and the damned thing wont start  his hands are shaking so
	badly he cant find the choke  he looks up to see 
	the t1000 running down the corridor toward him
	john fumbles with the choke  the bike catches  he slams it in gear
	and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage

	john looks back the t1000 is behind him running  he twists the
	throttle and guns the little bike forward  incredibly the t1000
	is gaining  this nightmare isnt happening  john races out the exit
	ramp and charges right into the street

46      ext street

	john shoots into the busy traffic  cuts off a bigrig tow truck
	the driver swears  hits his air horn  what the driver doesnt see
	is the cop running faster than oj simpson at the airport who
	emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck

46a     in the truck  the driver hears a thump as something slams against his
	door then feels himself pulled right out  t1000 slides in and
	takes his place  the truck is still rolling along about 25 mph
	t1000 accelerates after john without missing a beat  it can see him
	up ahead weaving through traffic

46b     out of the garage entrance terminator roars onto the street on the
	harley
	he accelerates after the others

47      ext flood control channel

	john slides his bike down the service ramp faster than hes ever done
	it before  he races along the bottom of the canal turning into a
	narrower tributary which has vertical sides

	he looks back  no sign of pursuit
47a     suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow
	the kenworth towtruck big as a house all chrome and roaring
	diesel engine crashes through the fence and launches itself right
	into the center of the canal

	it crashes down 15 feet to the ground going about 60 hits at an
	angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of
	metal  it ricochets back and forth between the walls then bellowing
	like a gunshot stegosaurus it just keep on plowing forward gathering
	speed

47b     john looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow
	concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike
	has  the kenworth is all muscle tearing along the canal like a train
	in a tunnel  its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray
	backlit in the setting sun  it looks like some kind of demon  and
	its gaining

47c     above them on the service road running parallel terminator is
	fighting to overtake them  he looks down and sees john with the tow
	truck from hell catching up to him  it is only about twenty feet
	behind him and still gaining

47d     angle in the canal looking back past a desperate john at the wall
	of metal filling frame behind him

47e     above terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left leaving the
	road  hitting an earth embankment just right he jumps the bike into
	the air like steve mcqueen in the great escape and vaults the fence
	bordering the canal  it slams down at the edge of the canal and tears
	along inches from the dropoff on a dirt path accelerating past the
	truck in the canal below

47f     john hits some water and slews momentarily loosing speed  the
	massive pushplate on the front of the truck slams into his back
	fender  panicked he pulls a little ahead  all this is happening at
	about sixty miles and hour  top speed for the little dirt bike

47g     slow motion as terminator jumps the bike again  this time the 700
	pound harley sails out into space and drops into the canal  it arcs
	down between the truck and john hitting on its wheels  it bottoms
	out an explosion of sparks under the frame  only the ultrafast
	reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright  terminator fights
	for control

47h     he guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside johns tiny
	honda
	terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him
	onto the harley in front of him  johns honda weaves and falls
	smashing instantly under thundering tires

	the harley roars ahead  it hits eighty  ahead is an overpass and
	supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two
	channels  the harley thunders into one channel which is essentially
	a short tunnel

47i     the truck cant fit on either side  neither can it stop at that
	speed  tires locked it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into
	the concrete abutment at seventy

47j     terminator and john emerge from the tunnel looking back to see a
	fireball blasting through behind them as the trucks sidetanks
	explode

	terminator stops the harley  john peers around his body to see the
	destruction  a burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in
	the mud  terminator revs the bike and they roar away down the canal
	disappearing around a bend

47k     angle on the fire as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass
	smoke boils from the tunnel as well and inside it is a solid wall of
	flame  a figure appears in the fire
	just an outline  walking slowly calmly
	the figure emerges from the flames

	it is humanshaped but far from human  a smooth chrome man  not a
	servomechanism like terminator is underneath with its complex
	hydraulics and cables this thing is a featureless liquid chrome
	surface bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks  it
	reminds us of mercury  a mercury man  its face is simple unformed
	unruffled by thousanddegree heat it walks toward us

	with each step detail returns
	first the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid
	chrome surface then finer details buttons facial features
	ears

47k     but its still al chrome  with its last step the color returns to
	everything  it is the cop again handsome young face blond hair
	mustache  icy eyes  it stops and looks around

	it is a perfect chameleon  a liquid metal robot  a killing machine
	with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society

47l     angle nearby as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up
	t1000 climbs out of the canal behind them  more cops arrive  t1000
	blends in perfectly  there are always cops at diasters and scenes of
	violence  we now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so
	perfect
	it walks among the other cops unnoticed
	gets into one of the squad cars  starts it and drives away

48      ext side street  night

	terminator with john in front of him on the harley roars down the
	empty street  john cranes his neck around to get a look at the
	personthing he is riding with  the image is strangely reminiscent
	of fatherson out for an evening ride

	john is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and
	hes just a tenyear kid but hes also john connor who will someday
	rise to greatness and we see a bit of that in him even know

				john
		whoa time out  stop the bike

	terminator immediately complies  he leans the bike into a turn
	they head into a nearby alley

49      ext alley

	terminator and john rolls into the alley and come to a stop  john
	slides off the gas tank  terminator impassively stares at him  john
	checks him out  tentatively speaks

				john
		now dont take this the wrong way but you are
		a terminator right

				terminator
		yes  cyberdyne systems model 101

				john
		no way

	john touches terminators skin  then the blood on his jacket
	his mind overloads as the reality of it hits him

				john
		holy shit youre really real  i mean
		whoah
			stepping back
		youre uh like a machine underneath right
		but sort of alive outside

		im a cybernetic organism  living tissue over

				john
		yeah  who sent you

		you did  thirty years from now you reprogrammed
		me to be your protector here in this time

	john gives him an amazed look

				john
		this is deep

50      ext street  night

	john and terminator on the bike again weaving through the side
	streets  they blend into the evening traffic  in the darkness
	terminators wounds are not readily visible  john cranes his head up
	and back

				john
		so this other guy  hes a terminator too
		right like you

				terminator
		not like me  a t1000  advanced prototype
		a mimetic polyalloy

				john
		what does that mean

				terminator
		liquid metal

				john
		radical

				terminator
		you are targeted for termination  the t1000
		will not stop until it complete its mission

	john mulls that over

				john
		where we going

		avoid the authorities

	in the voights kitchen  todd comes through the kitchens back door
	just home from work  he ignores janelle and opens the fridge  grabs

	tight on janelle as todd growls around the kitchen behind her  he
	passes out of frame next to her  janelle switches the phone to her
	other hand then thunk  her free hand seems to do something out of

53      int voight housekitchen

	janelle hangs up the phone  her expression is neutral  calm

	pan over along her arm which is stretched out straight from the
	shoulder  partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into
	something else a metal cylinder which tapers into a swordlike
	spike  now we see todd voight pinned to a kitchen cabinet by the
	spike which has punched through his milk carton through his mouth
	and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door  his eyes are
	glassy and lifeless

	the spike is withdrawn  swiishhtt  so rapidly todd is actually
	standing there a second before he slumps out of sight  thump
53a     janelle doesnt bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and
	color transforming back into a hand and then

53b     janelle changes rapidly into the cop we now know as the t1000  the

	this is all too weird

				john
		i need a minute here okay  youre telling me
		it can imitate anything it touches

				terminator
		anything it samples by physical contact

	john thinks about that trying to grasp their opponents parameters

				john
		like it could disguise itself as anything
		a pack of cigarettes

				terminator
		no  only an object of equal size

	johns still reeling from meeting one terminator which now seems
	downright conventional next to the exotic new model

				john
		well why doesnt become a bomb or something to
		get me

				terminator
		it cant form complex machines  guns and
		explosives have chemicals moving parts  it
		doesnt work that way  but it can form solid

	could lead it to its target  t1000 finds a box of audio cassettes
	marked messages from mom  in it are some letters and envelopes

				john

		i hated her for that
			he looks up
		but everything she said was true
			he stands
		we gotta get her out of there

				terminator
		negative  the t1000s highest probability for

		wait for you to make contact with her

				john
		oh great  and what happens to her

	terminators reply is matteroffact

				terminator
		typically the subject being copied is
		terminated

				john

				terminator
		negative  she is not a mission priority

	john struggles against the grip  which doesnt do him much good

				john
		hey goddammit  whats your problem

	starts dragging john back to the bike  john spots a couple of

	to his surprise terminators hand opens so fast john falls right on
	his butt
	he looks up at the open hand

				john
		oww  whyd you do that

				terminator

	john stares at him in amazement as he realizes

				john
		you have to do what i say

				terminator
		that is one of my mission parameters

				john
		prove it stand on one foot

	terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg
	john grins  hes the first on his block

				john
		cool  my own terminator  this is great

	the two guys get there and look at terminator standing there calmly
	with one leg up in the air  this big guy in black leather and dark
	glasses standing like a statue

				first jock
		hey kid  you okay

	john turns to him  no longer needing to be rescued

				john
		take a hike bozo

				first jock
		yeah  fuck you you little dipshit

				john
		dipshit  did you say dipshit
			to terminator

	terminator complies instantly hoisting him onehanded by the collar
	the guys legs are pinwheeling

				john
		now whos the dipshit you jock douchebag

	immediately things get out of hand  the guys friend jumps behind
	terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson 
	terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car 
	grabs the second by the hair whips out his 45 in a quick blur and
	aims the muzzle at the guys forehead
	john grabs terminators arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger 
	johns weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches  the
	guy flinches stunned by the kboom next to his ear  he stares
	shocked  pissing himself  john is freaking out too
	he screams at terminator

				john
		put the gun down  now

	terminator sets the 45 on the sidewalk  john scoops it up fast then
	turns to the shocked civilians who cant believe what just happened

				john
		walk away

	they do  fast  john grabs terminator by the arm and tugs him toward
	the bike  john still holds the gun reluctant to give it back

				john
		jesus you were gonna kill that guy

				terminator
		of course  im a terminator

	john stares at him  having your own terminator just became a little
	bit less fun to him

				john
		listen to me very carefully okay  youre not

		you cant just go around killing people

				terminator

				john
		whattaya mean why  cause you cant

				john
		you just cant okay  trust me on this

	terminator doesnt get it  john just stares at him  frightened at
	what just almost happened  he gets a glimpse of the responsibility
	that comes with power  finally he hands the 45 back to terminator

	later the floor starts to move
	it shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass still retaining the
	twotone checkerboard of the tile  it hunches up silently into a

66d     up ahead we hear typing  the night nurse has her back to us working
	the guard stops as the drinking fountain  bends to take a sip
	behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to
	resolve rapidly into a human figure  it loses the color and texture
	of the tile and becomes the guard

	t1000s mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over

	pulling up to form the figure of the guard

	the t1000guards feet are the last to form the last of the liquid
	floor pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes  the shoes detach
	with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the t1000guard
	takes its first step

66e     the real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see himself
	he has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of
	that  then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and
	inexplicably points his right index finger directly at the real
	guards face about a foot away  in a split second the finger
	spears out elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a
	stiletto slamming into the guards eye

	terminator coming up behind them  it is exactly her nightmare
	she screams in utter hopelessness

	terminator holding the shotgun in one hand reaches down and grabs
	one of the orderlies with his other hand  he hurls the 200pound
	guys against the far wall of the corridor  smack  he drops to the
	floor
	the other two orderlies react instantly leaping onto the intruder
	terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys
	then there is an explosion of whiteclad figures as the orderlies are
	flung outward like they stepped on a land mine
	one crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a
	twostory fall by the outer steel bars  the other crashes through an
	office door splintering it into kindling

	silberman has jumped to hold sarah  he is grabbed by a roll of skin
	at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat  the doctor feel his
	feet pedaling above the ground  he looks into the expressionless
	face  and it hit him  sarah was right this guy isnt human
	he feels the fabric of reality crumbling
	then he feels himself flying through the air  the wall smacks him
	then the floor kicks him in the face  he decides to lie there a
	second

	sarah blinks staring up at the figure looming over her
	john kneels next to her

				john
		mom are you okay

	she looks from terminator to john  back to terminator
	is this a nightmare  or has she finally gone truly bad

	incredibly terminator politely reaches his hand down to her offering
	to help her up  the last thing she ever expected to see

				terminator
		come with me if you want to live

	the orderlies are stirring

				john
		its all right mom  hes here to help

	sarah is a daze takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers
	terminator lifts her to her feet

73d     john sees a guard standing thirty feet away on the other side of the
	walls of bars  john doesnt know what we know but he knows
	somethings not right with this guy  terminator turns to follow
	johns gaze
	the t1000 had its pistol in its hand at its side
	terminator pushes john behind him  they start backing up

73e     the t1000 walks forward reaching the bars  it doesnt stop
	its body divides like jello around the bars  as it squeezes itself
	through like metal playdough its surface reforms perfectly on our
	side  we see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste
	forced past an obstacle
	silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this
	that faint snapping sound is his mind
	there is a clank and we see that the guards gun has caught against
	the bars the only solid object  the t1000 turns its wrist and
	tries again slipping the gun endwise through the gap

73f     sarah is agape  not reacting  its been a heavy day for her
	terminator grabs john by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto
	his back  john grabs him around the neck  terminator raises the
	shotgun and starts backing up

				terminator
		go  run

	sarah doesnt need to be told twice
	t1000 walks toward them opening fire with the browning hipower
	terminator straightarms the 12guage like a pistol and fires
	the stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is
	filled with highvelocity lead  one of them stupidly running for the
	crosscorridor gets hit by the t1000

	terminator is hammered by several slugs and the t1000 is cratered
	by two buckshots hits  it staggers but comes on  in the craters
	we see bright mercury before they close and reseal disappearing in a
	second

73g     terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run  ahead
	sarah is already at the elevator  terminator and john pile in and
	john slaps the button for garage level

	the doors start to close  t1000 clears the corner
	terminator slams john and sarah back against the side walls as the
	t1000 charges at them rapid firing the browning
	the rounds hit the steel doors as they close
	t1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap
73h     inside they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that
	are punching holes in the other side

73i     the browning locks open empty  t1000 drops it without a glance
	back  the doors close  kwham  the t1000 hits them a split second
	later  the elevator hasnt moved yet  sswwikk

73j     a swordlike blade rams through in between the doors forcing them
	open  terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap  punches
	the muzzle right into t1000s face  boom
73k     we get a glimpse of the t1000s head blown apart by the blast  it
	is hurtled back  the doors close  the car descends

73l     on the t1000 outside the elevator  its head which is blown apart
	into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders reforms quickly
	there is no trace of the injury  it sees the closed door and jams its
	hands between them its fingertips becoming prybars  it pulls the
	doors apart with inhuman strength
73m     and leaps into the open shaft
	it falls two floors and

74      in the elevator  out trio hears a loud thump on the roof
	terminator reloading the shotgun looks up
	sarah grabs the 45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling
	beat
	then clangg a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears
	down four feet into the elevator car
	it is inches from sarahs face
	she opens fire bambambam  right through the roof
	lightingfast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again slashing
	terminators jacket and missing john by inches
	terminator chambers a round and kboom the 12guage opens a hole in
	the ceiling
	terminator rocks out in a fury of firingcockingfiring as the metal
	shafts slash down again and again  sarah yells in pain as one of them
	slices open her upper arm

75      the doors open  sarah pulls john out as soon as the gap is wide
	enough
	they emerge into the basement  we see the harley parked nearby

	terminator in a rearguard action fires another blast through the
	ceiling and runs out  he throws his leg over the harley kicks it to
	life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the
	inner pocket of his jacket  he throws it to john  a road flare

76      in the elevator the t1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big
	enough to
	pour itself through
	a massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening  the mass drops
	through the hole down out of frame then comes back up into frame
	as officer x

	it seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after
	doing this king of taffypull with itself  it opens its eyes and
	sees 

77      terminator the shot gun held in his teeth astride the roaring
	harley twenty feet away  terminator twists the throttle and pops the
	clutch
	the back tire screams on the concrete  the front wheel lifts off the
	ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie

	terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator
	the harley slams the t1000 square and smashes it right through the
	back wall of the elevator
	terminator rolls to his feet
	johns strikes the flare on the concrete  tosses it
	terminator catches the life flare with one hand
	levels the shotgun with the other
	with his last round he blows a big hole in the bikes gas tank
	gas splashes everywhere covering the struggling t1000
	terminator tosses the flare  kavooom

	the explosion knocks terminator backward off his feet enveloping him
	in the fireball  he gets up smoking and runs after john and sarah
	toward the exit ramp

78      at the exit ramp  they are partway up when a blueandwhite hospital
	security car comes screeching down the other way
	without breaking stride sarah runs right at the car  it skids to a
	shrieking halt  shes in the guys face with the 45 in both hands

				sarah
		out of the car

	the patrol guy is thinking what he can try when blam she puts a round
	through the glass next to his head

				sarah
		right now

	the door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as
	terminator arrives  the cyborg flings the rentacop out of the way
	and slides behind the wheel  sarah gets john into the back seat and
	dives into the front passenger seat as 

78a     terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it lighting up the
	tires on the slick ramp
	terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to john and tells him
	to reload  john pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket
	and starts feeding them in
	terminator power backward up the ramp scraping along one wall barely
	in control  because

79      the t1000 is running at them out of the inferno below
	this guy wont quit  shifting from chrome mode to copform as it
	runs
	it sprints up the ramp after the retreating car  t1000 is gaining

80      terminator hands sarah another magazine for the 45  she snatches
	it drops the other out and slaps in the new one  cocks the slide
	the car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate
	john hands the shot gun back to terminator
	he leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer
	the t1000s face is right in the headlights
80a     terminator fires blowing a hole in its shoulder  shiny liquid metal
	visible in the hole which then closes
80b     sarah half out the passenger window opens fire
	the car crashes backward through the security barricade

				terminator
			calmly
		hang on

	he cuts the wheel hard  the car slews into a reverse 180 swapping
	ends with a screech
	t1000 is almost on them
	terminator punches it  the car accelerates forward

80c     t1000 leaps  lands on the trunk
	its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid
	feet dragging on the pavement it slams its other hand down
	punching another metal hook into the trunk lid pulling itself up
	terminator turns to sarah

				terminator
		drive

	terminator heaves himself half out the drivers window  sarah slaps
	her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side

80d     t1000 fully on the car now holds on with one hookhand while it
	slams the other into the back window sweeping away the glass and
	missing john by inches as he ducks
	it draws back for another swing lunging forward as 

80e     terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car
	fires pointblank
	hits the t1000s arm just above the hand which anchors it to the
	car  the 12guage blows the arm apart severing the hookhand

80f     t1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car
	john looks out the back window his eyes wide
	he sees the t1000 roll to his feet and continue running
	but hes dropping way behind now  sarah has the car floored and the
	liquidmetal killer wont catch them on foot

80g     john watches in awe as the crowbar hand stuck into the trunk
	right in front of him reverts to the neutral polyalloy a kind of
	think mercury  the gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and
	falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob

80h     the car speeds off into the night
	reverse on the t1000 walking now coming right up into closeup
	watching the tail lights recede  it looks down

80i     angle on blacktop tight on the liquid metal blob  next to it is the
	t1000s shiny cop shoe  the mercury blob crawls and rejoins the
	main mass disappearing into the shoe

	in the shattered windows as terminator drives the car easily by
	electronic nightvision  his eyes glow faintly red

99      int dyson house  day

	miles dyson sits at the huge desk in his study  he is deep in
	thought tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal
	next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear  on a sunday morning
	when most men are relaxing spending time with their families dyson
	is hard at work

	in a profile closeup we see him in deep concentration his mind
	prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor

	a womans face enters frame soundlessly behind him  he doesnt hear
	her  his wife tarissa extends her tongue and traces it down the
	back of his neck  he smiles and turns to kiss her good morning
	shes still in her bathrobe holding coffee  hes been up for hours
	he turns and goes back to work forgetting instantly that she is
	standing there

	she watches him work the arcane symbols moving across the screen
	we see her frustration her inability to truly enter the magic box
	of his world

				tarissa
		you going to work all day

				dyson
		im sorry baby  this thing is just kicking my
		ass  i thought we had it with this one

	he points to a metal box on his desk about two feet long  as
	assembly of small cubes  it looks like a dinosaur version of
	terminators cpu

				dyson
		 but the output went to shit after three
		seconds  im thinking now its the way im
		matrixing the command hierarchies

				tarissa
		you need a break  youll see it clear when you
		come back

				dyson
		i cant

				tarissa
		miles its sunday  you promised to take the
		kids to raging waters today

				dyson
		oh  i cant honey  im on a roll here

	he takes her hands  we see a childlike excitement in his face  he
	wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery
	the satisfaction of creation

				dyson
		baby this thing is going to blow em all away
		its a neuralnet process 

				tarissa
		i know  you told me  its a neuralnet
		processor  it thinks and learns like we do
		its superconducting at room temperature
		other computer are pocket calculators by
		comparison
			she pulls away from him
		but why is that so goddamn important miles
		i really need to know cause i feel like im
		going crazy here sometimes

				dyson
		im sorry honey its just that im thiiis
		close

	he holds up his thumb and index finger a fraction of an inch apart
	she picks up the prototype  it doesnt look like much

				dyson
		imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes
		a mistake never gets tired never shows up to
		work with a hangover
			he taps the prototype
		meet the pilot

				tarissa
		why did you marry me miles  why did we have
		these two children  you dont need us  your
		heart and your mind are in here
			she stares at the metal box
			in her hands
		but it doesnt love you like we do

	he takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down  then he
	puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently  she acquiesces
	to his kiss

				dyson
		im sorry

	tarissa glances over his shoulder  she nods her head toward the
	doorway to the study  dyson turns and sees their two kids standing
	there  danny 6 and blythe 4 look rumpled and adorable in their
	pjs  dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions

				tarissa
		how about spending some time with your other
		babies

	dyson grins the forces of darkness have lost this round  he holds
	out his hands and his kids run to him cheering

	bathed in sweat and it runs into her eyes  blinking she wipes it
	fast with one hand then gets it back on the gun  the 45 is
	trembling

	tight on sarah as we see the forces at war behind her eyes
	she looks into the faces of dyson tarissa blythe danny
	sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract
	as she tenses to fire
	but her finger wont do it
	she lowers the gun very slowly  it drops to her side in one hand

	all the breath and energy seems to go out of her
	she weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture like stay
	where you are dont move  as if should they move the fragile
	balance might tip back the other way
	she backs away from them slowly panting  its as if shes backing
	away in terror from what she almost did  she reaches a wall and
	slumps against it  slides down to her knees  the gun falls limply
	from her fingers
	she rests her cheek against the wall

	tarissa looks around at the bizarre tableau  terminator has
	wordlessly ripped open dysons shirt and examined the wound

				terminator
		clean penetration  no shattered bone

	he takes tarissas hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and
	exit wounds

				terminator
		do you have bandages

				dyson
		in the bathroom  danny can you get them for
		us

	danny nods and runs down the hall
	john disengages from sarah  she wipes her tears the instinct to
	toughen up taking over again  but the healing moment has had its
	effect nevertheless

	john walks toward dyson and terminator

	from what is about to happen

	below the elbow  in one smooth motion terminator cuts all the way
	around his arm  with a second cut he splits the skin of the forearm
	from elbow to wrist

	terminator grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a
	surgeon rips off a rubber glove  it comes off with a sucking rip
	leaving a bloody skeleton

	but the skeleton is made of bright metal and is laced with hydraulic
	actuators  the fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts they
	flex into a fist and extend  terminator holds it up palm out in
	almost the exact position of the one in the vault at cyberdyne

	hes seen one of these before

				terminator
		keep your eyes closed  dont move
			they nod eyes squeezed shut
		ill be back

	he slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into
	the corridor

173b    blam  a teargas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down
	the corridor  it skids to rest in front of terminator throwing out
	a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor
173c    in the elevator sarah and john are choking handing the breathing
	mask back and forth desperately  theyre scarred  this looks like
	it
173d    angle on the swat team gripping their weapons at the mouth of the
	corridor  they watch the boiling cloud waiting

173e    their pov  on the wall of boiling smoke  a figure appears  walking
	totally unaffected  terminator emerges from the smoke  not even
	mistyeyed  not what they expected

				leader
			through megaphone
		stop where you are  lie down on the floor
		face down  down on floor now

	he continues to stride toward them
	the swats tense up  theyve never seen anything like this  theyre
	not sure what to do  closer and closer

				leader
		drop him

	they open fire  the corridor is filled with cracking thunder  the
	rounds tear into terminators chest  stomach  face  thighs  his
	leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him  the swats
	think the guys wearing body armor or something  they keep firing
	the rounds tear into him staggering him slightly but he keeps
	moving

				leader
		youre not hitting him

				swat 1
			getting scared
		yes i am

	terminator draws his 45 smoothly  unhurried  he shoots the nearest
	man in the left thigh  as he screams and drops terminator shoots
	him in the right thigh  terminator bends down and picks up the 
	shrieking mans weapon the teargas launcher

	it is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum
	terminator shoots the next swat in the chest with the teargas
	launcher  the gas canister hits the guys body armor and doesnt
	penetrate  but its like getting slugged in the stomach with a full
	swing from a baseball bat  the swat fold double and hits the tiles
	gasping

	terminator is an image from hell a tall figure in shredded black
	leather streaked with blood  one eye is a bloody socket the metal
	eyeservo glistening  the flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters
	revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath  the whole front of his 
	jacket is blown open revealing his metal armor chest

	the remaining swats start to fall back  one turns to run and 
	kpow  a gas canister nail him in the back sending him sprawling

173f    terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby  it fills
	rapidly with the white gas cutting the visibility to a few feet  it
	is total pandemonium  swat leader crouches in the fog white
	knuckling the rifle  terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right
	in front of him  poom  terminator drills him in the leg with the
	45  as the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg terminator
	rips his gas mask off  the swat leader drops writhing to the floor
	choking and gagging clutching his bleeding thigh

	terminator walks up to two swats at the front doors  powpow  leg
	and leg  he snatches their masks as they fall  the gunfire has
	stopped  nobody an see anything  screams and whimpers echo in the
	smoke

174     ext building

	smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges  firing the
	teargas launcher with one hand terminator launches all remaining
	rounds among the cop vehicles  unprotected officers run choking
	and halfblind slamming into cars and tripping over each other  it
	is a total rout

175     at the swat van on of the swats is rapidly handing out the remaining
	masks to unprotected cops  a figure appears out of the smoke beside
	him  he looks up  his mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty
	launcher  instinctively he catches it  terminator grabs his flak
	vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist

175a    int swat van

	terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the drivers
	seat  no keys in the ignition  he flips down the sun visor  the
	keys fall into his hand  he starts the van and slams it into gear

176     intext lobby

	the tear gas has cleared to a thin haze  the uninjured swats are
	tending their wounded  they look up at the sound of shouts and a
	roaring engine

176a    the swat van crashes into the lobby in an explosion of glass and
	debris  cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a 
	smoking oneeighty sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads
	to the bank of elevators  terminator backs up until  crunch  he
	seals the corridor with the back of the van

176b    sarah and john stumble along the corridor coughing
	they leap into the back of the van and terminator hits the throttle
	the van roars across the lobby and exits through blownout windows

						cut to

177     intext second floor

	t1000 astride the kawasaki looks down from a secondfloor office
	and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining
	cops firing at it  it knows  it looks around  analyzing options
	it sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of
	this corner office block
	it twists full throttle on the powerful bike
	roars through the office accelerating fast straight at the
	windows 

178     t1000 blasts out through the glass airborne on the motorcycle  it
	rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and 
178a    slams into the canopy  the impact of bike and rider pitches the
	chopper radically  the startled pilot fights to regain control as the
	bike tumbles to the pavement below
178b    the t1000 doesnt  it clings to the shattered canopy
	nightmarishly the pilot watches as the t1000 smashes its head
	through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly pours itself through the
	jagged hole  it reforms instantly into its previous self on the
	passenger seat

178c    it hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the drivers
	seat
	the chopper is autorotating spinning out of control  it drops
	toward the parking lot  t1000 recovers control ten feet above the
	ground

178d    cops hits the deck as the tailboom swings around going over them by
	inches
	the chopper lifts out in a power climb roaring away across the
	parking lot toward the fleeing swat van

	okay buckle your seatbelts here it comes

179     intext swat vanhighway  night

	terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van
	onto a divided highway  sarah and john are catching their breath
	still coughing from the cs gas  terminator look to the rearview
	mirror  he sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them
	gaining

	sarah looks around the inside of the swat van  it is a rolling
	armory  there are rifles ballistic vests all manner of equipment

				sarah
		john get under these  hurry

	he sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet
	proof vests on top of him completely covering him  then she grabs
	two m16s from the wallrack and loads them  she starts on a shotgun
	as 

180     the swat van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed
	terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to
	be crawling  the van hits it top speed of eighty  they swerve to
	miss the back end of a white 18wheel tanker
180a    the chopper swings in behind them closing fast
180b    t1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the mpk machine
	pistol and fires  the back of the can clangs with hits  the door
	windows are blown in

	terminator weaves the van trying to throw off the t1000s aim
	the unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control
	one of the doors is kicked open  sarah wearing a ballistic vest
	crouches in the doorway whipping up the m16  she opens fire

180c    bullets riddle whats left of the choppers canopy as the t1000
	returns fire
	the van is stitched with hits

180d    inside the van holes are punched through the thin sheetmetal walls
	ripping up the interior  the vests covering john are hit repeatedly
	we see that sarah has hung two kevlar vests on the inside of the back
	door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her  she pops
	back out and fires in controlled bursts  the m16 empties and she
	grabs another

180e    terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes hitting it
	and knocking it skidding

181     omitted

181a    sarah reloads and keeps firing  the van swerves around a toyota  a
	moment later the helicopter passes it the rotor just clearing the top
	of the car

181b    t1000 fires the machine pistol
181c    sarah has popped out to fire  she takes a hit in the thigh and
	several rounds hammer into her kevlar vest  she is thrown back onto
	the floor of the van  she lies there an exposed target

181d    terminator sees the t1000 preparing to fire again
	he locks up the vans brakes  tires scream as the vehicle shimmies
	sarah is thrown forward sliding up to the bulkhead next to john
182     and the helicopter slams right into the back of the van
	the rotor disintegrates  the back doors of the van are crushed in as
	the canopy the whole front of the fuselage is hammered into junk
	trapping the t1000 inside the twisted metal  the chopper hits the
	pavement flips sideways and cartwheels smashing itself into a
	shapeless mass of twisted metal
	it falls away behind the van tumbling end over end

182a    terminator fights to control the van which is fishtailing violently
	from the impact  it smashes up against the center divider screeching
	along the concrete and then pulls away  terminator puts the hammer
	down and the van accelerates  he swerves to avoid an ugly pickup
	crawling like a snail ahead

	the right front fender of the van crumpled by slamming the wall is
	sawing into the tire  the tire blows and peels off the clean rim
	the steel wheel grinds across the pavement striking trails of sparks
	and the van slides sideways and topples 
	steel screams on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side

182b    inside the van john crawls to sarah who is groaning and holding her
	bleeding leg  she is white and shocky  terminator starts to
	extricate himself from the crumpled drivers seat

183     back down the road the helicopter wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk
	metal unrecognizable  behind it the tanker truck brakes hard 
	shuddering and groaning trying to stop  the big tires lock up in
	clouds of tiresmoke  the rig comes to a shuddering stop just short
	of the wrecked chopper

183a    the shaken driver jumps down
	the behind the wreckage a cop emerges walking toward him

				driver
		goddamn are you alri 

183b    ssshhck  t1000 drives a blade through the mans abdomen and walks
	on past without slowing or even looking at him

183c    it climbs into the open cab of the tanker  releases the brake
	as the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters
	on the side which say cryoco inc  liquid nitrogen supply

184     at the swat van john and terminator are carrying sarah out of the
	wreck  terminator has the m79 slung over his shoulder the
	bandolier of grenades and his 45 stuck in his waistband  john has
	borrowed a 12gauge riot gun from the swats

184a    the pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them  the driver
	a hispanic guy in his 50s is getting out to help them  terminator
	and john hear a crash and look back as the
185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck

186			     john
		holy shit  come on mom we gotta keep
		moving come on 

				terminator
			to the pickup owner
		we need your truck

	the guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as terminator
	slides sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel  john
	runs to the passenger side

187     the tanker roars spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts
	up through the gears

188     terminator slams the pickup in gear checking the rearview  the
	tanker is a hundred feet behind them now and really moving
	terminator puts the throttle down but the pickup is and old slug
	loaded down by a heavy homemade wooden campershell  it accelerates
	slowly

189     the tanker slams into one end of the swat van spinning it out of the
	way with a roar and screech of twisting metal  the 18wheeler shifts
	to a higher gear still accelerating

190     intext pickup truck

	with the tanker right behind them terminator cuts the wheel swerving
	the pickup back and forth across the lanes
	the big rig stays right on them it tanker whiplashing violently

				john
		faster  hes right on us

	terminator doesnt reply  he rapidly unslings the blooper still
	around his neck and reaches for a grenade

191     low angle on the tractortrailer as it roars right up to the lens
	filling frame with chrome and lights

191a    kwham  it rams the backs of the pickup sending it skidding

191b    then the t1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and
	crabs over sandwiching it against the center divider  the spinning
	chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail
	screeches along the other side

	the pickup bucks and shakes insanely  it ricochets violently between
	the bigrig and the divider
	horrible screech of tortured steel
	sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides
	the windshield shatters as the doorposts buckle in
	metal and glass shower in through the side windows
	the frame twists and buckles  john feels like the fillings are being
	shaken right out of his teeth
	the wooden camper disintegrates falling away as kindling behind
	them

191c    int tanker cab

	t1000 holds the wheel hard over mercilessly grinding the pickup
	the whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained
	hammering

191d    intext pickup

	terminator slides toward the passenger side  keeping his foot on the
	gas he lifts john over him and puts him in the drivers seat

				terminator
		drive for a minute

				john
		where you going

	terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand
	held together by the plastic laminate the windshield flops out of its
	frame  it flies over the top of the truck

191e    terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up
	he turns and aims the m79 onehanded
191f    poom  the grenade misses the t1000 by less than a foot  it explodes
	against the front bulkhead of the tanker almost at the top  liquid
	nitrogen pours from the opening swept back by the 60mph windstream

191g    the bigrig swerves as t1000 regains control  the tanker swings like
	a pendulum behind the cab

191h    the pickup accelerates getting back out in front by a few yards
	behind it the bigrig is trailing a swirling comettail of nitrogen
	vapor  it is gaining again

	terminator still standing opens the breech and starts to reload
191i    john cuts across the highway and takes an off ramp

191j    t1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the
	ramp after him still accelerating  it is twenty feet behind them
	and closing when terminator closes the breech and fires

191k    the grenade hits the front grill and explodes
	the radiator is destroyed along with half the hood  steam blasts
	out obscuring the whole front of the truck

191l    the semi rams the back of the pickup again  spewing smoke and vapor
	like some demon locomotive the tractortrailer pounds into the back
	of the pickup  driving it right through the intersection at the
	bottom of the ramp and straight toward 

	ext steel mill

	the chase has led them to an area of heavy industry

192     the gates are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup
	right through them  terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos
	and impacts  he has three grenades left on the bandolier

	john isnt even steering  they are just being pushed  theres
	nothing he can do  they are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare
	which leads directly to the main building of the plant

192a    terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup
	he leaps to the bed takes two powerful strides and 
	leaps onto the semi  he climbs rapidly onto the hood
192b    and fires point blank through the windshield
	right into t1000s face
	the explosion blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke
	and fire  terminator grabs onto the airhorn as the truck starts to
	shudder and
192c    scream  it is jackknifing
	almost dreamslow the cab begins to swing sideways until its tires
	are shrieking over the pavement  the tractor is smashed back at
	rightangles to the tankertrailer which begins to slide broadside

192d    the juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways
	across the pavement
	it begins to topple
	terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top
	with an unholy scream like the unoiled hubs of hell the whole rig
	slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill  a sheet of sparks
	sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement

192e    john sees whats behind him then snaps around to see the building
	looming right in front  the huge rolling doors are partly open
	no choice
	he steers right through them into the mill as 

192f    terminator with one second to go leaps from the cab 
	he flies through the open doors as 
	the tanker hits the building and 

193     int steel millmain aisle

	terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls as 
	the tankertrailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side
	of the doors  thunderous carnage of twisting metal	      o
193a    it splits wide open  a river of liquid nitrogen pours out at 230

193b    john hits the brakes sliding out of control  he slows almost to a
	stop but hits a steel support column headon  he and sarah are
	slammed forward hard

193c    terminator still clutching the m79 blooper rolls and slides across
	the floor
	he smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a
	massive machine

193d    the semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage into the building and
	shudders to a stop  liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab flooding out
	around it in a hissing wavefront of ultracold
	freezing vapor swirls everywhere obscuring the wreck

193e    terminator lies still  a beat  then he rolls weakly rising on one
	elbow to survey the scene

193f    in the wrecked pickup john stirs  he is stunned and blood runs from
	his nose  dazed he realizes he is in a steel mill  there are
	sirens and he can see men running shouting  he turns and sees
	what they are running from

193g    the wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker  it is
	a strange vista of fire and ice  the huge smelters pour out orange
	light and fire from the sides of the huge galley while the freezing
	vapor rolls down the center

193h    tight on the wreck  a billowing gray cloud  deep inside the shape
	of the cab in visible  a figure emerges pulling itself out  it
	drops to the floor  the hissing boiling river of liquid nitrogen
	flows around its feet

194     the t1000 staggers moving slowly painfully  it has finally been
	affected by something  its feet are freezing to the ground as it
	walks

194a    clink  one of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle  it stumbles
	forward and 
194b    its other foot snaps off  as it catches its balance on the stump of
	its other ankle
194c    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact  it topples forward to its
	knees
	catches itself on one hand  liquid nitrogen flows around the hand

	now the hand is stuck to the pavement
194d    the t1000 pulls and clink  the hand snaps off at the wrist
	it looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist  for the first time
	we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one
	the expression is pain  agony  its mouth opens in a soundless
	scream as the hoarfrost races up its legs across its body
194e    and thats the position it freezes in
	it has become a statue kneeling in the frozen vapor that surprised
	look of agony frozen on its face

	the liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate
194f    terminator just beyond the boundary of the cold can see the t1000
	clearly
	he draws his 45 and aims

				terminator
		hasta la vista baby

194g    kpow  the single shot blows the t1000 into a million diamonds
	spraying up into the air  they shimmer across the ground for twenty
	feet in all directions
	terminator lowers the gun satisfied
	he looks like he needs a vacation

195     john and sarah have seen it from the pickup  she is in bad shape
	conscious but very weak  he tries the door  its jammed  he kicks
	it open

				john
		okay mom we gotta get out now come on
		thats it

	he helps her slide down from the seat of the truck  her knees give
	way  john has to take a lot of her weight  he reaches in and picks
	up the riot gun off the seat  they hobble toward 

195a    terminator  on his knees he looks into the dissipating cloud of
	vapor  the heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid
	nitrogen

196     insert tight on the floor  the t1000 shards are melting
	liquefying  hundreds of drops of mercury spattered across the floor
	orange light of the enormous blackfurnaces dances on liquid metal

197     terminator struggles to rise  one arm is shattered the hand smashed
	and useless  and some legservos are damaged  he can barely stand
	john and sarah arrive

				terminator
		we dont have much time

				john
		what

	terminator points  john and sarah watch as 

198     insert t1000 droplets are creeping together  fusing into larger
	blobs  these pools shiver and run together soon forming a central
	mass

199     on john and sarah realizing its not over

				john
		come on  lets go

	terminator gets one of sarahs arms over his shoulder and they go
	behind them something is moving
200     a head is forming up out of a pool mercury  it rises as shoulders
	form  hunching up from the liquid mass  halfformed it turns to 
	look straight at them

	john looks back in new terror as 

	the t1000 rises to manheight  it is still in mercury form but its
	features are forming rapidly  it takes its first step after them
	sarah stumbles and they pull her up
201     terminator himself has a pronounces limp dragging one leg with a
	shattered ankle joint  johns the one pulling straining driving
	them forward  they round a corner into 

202     int aisle between furnaces

	it is a maze of monstrous machinery  the heat is tremendous
	the air shivers with a pounding roar
	sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again

				john
		come on mom you can do it  come on

	they drag her up and stagger on  her leg is bathed in blood and she
	is deathly pale  he looks back

203     int main gallery

	the t1000 steps into frame  fully formed  the hellfire light
	glints on its impassive cop face  it walks forward  at first it
	seems unaffected by its crystallization but 

203a    angle on its hand as it touches a railing in passing  the railing is
	covered with osha yellowandblack safety tape
	the hand turns yellow and black the color fading to normal by about
	the elbow  it rips the hand from the railing with difficulty  there
	is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface

203b    the t1000 looks at its yellowandblack striped hand  it wills the
	hand back to normal  we see ripples of static or system noise
	moving subtly over the surface of its body  its starting to
	glitch

203c    tracking with the t1000s feet  with each step the pattern on the
	tile floor invades its lower legs  fades as the foot is lifted
	returns as it is set down  the foot is trying to meld with the floor
	the chameleonic function is out of control
	the t1000 is losing it  it moves forward searching  it rounds the
	corner entering the aisle between the furnaces

204     int aisle

	terminator sees the silhouette closing on them through the smoky
	gleam  the t1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them
	terminator turns to sarah over john

				terminator
		keep going

	john shakes his head no  the t1000 is almost on them

				terminator
		run

	john runs dragging halfcarrying sarah as best he can
	she can barely stay conscious  halfrunning delirious she stumbles
	and drops to her knees  john pulls but she cant rise

				john
			crying shouting
		come on you gotta try please mom  get up

	john looks back to see 

204a    terminator trying to load the m79  with his shattered hand he can
	barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech
	t1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands  it clatters to the floor

	the grenade spins across the floor rolling under some machinery
	terminator lunges slamming the t1000 against a wall with all his
	weight  the battle is joined

204b    john and sarah have reached the back of the aisle  it is a culde
	sac blocked on the end by the base of an immense smelter crucible
	they turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette backlit by the
	molten sparks falling from the furnaces above  the battle which will
	decide their fate

204c    terminator grabs the t1000 and hurls it with awesome force against
	the opposite wall of the narrow alley  in less time than it would
	take to turn the
204d    t1000 morphs trough itself front to back face emerging from the
	back of its head
204e    it comes off the wall straight at terminator who smashes his good
	fist into its face  the piledriver blow buries terminators fist
	almost to the elbow

204f    but the t1000s head morphs in a splitsecond into a hand which grips
	terminators wrist and the head emerges somewhere else the
	geometry shifting faster than we can follow
204g    the t1000 slams terminator into a large machine jamming his arm into
	the moving works  a massive sliding bar scissors his arm smashing it
	into junk at the elbow pinning him in the machine

	terminator strains against the machine pinning him  we hear his
	servos whining with overload  the t1000 turns and lopes toward sarah
	and john

	sarah screams and hurls john into a gap between the machines  he
	falls into a maze of pipes and girders

205     int maze of machines

	john turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap  she could
	follow him but she doesnt  suddenly a dark mass moves toward him
	john gasps as a huge steel counterweight driven by a chain 6 inches
	thick slides toward him  he rolls out of the way  when he looks
	back he cannot see the opening

				john
		mom  mommm

206     int aisle between furnaces

	terminator strains to reach a 6foot steel bar lying near him  steel
	workers use them to move the redhot ingots around  he gets hold of
	the end and uses it as a lever  with titanic effort he spreads the
	massive components which are holding him and withdraws him arm which
	is severed at the elbow  dangling junk hands from the crushed joint

207     sarah has lost sight of john  it is much of a goodbye as they will
	have
	she turns as the t1000 closes on her  she is halfslumped against
	the sooty machines looking barely conscious  she struggles to load
	a shell into the empty weapon  at the last instant she whips up the
	riot gun and fires

a207    t1000s face is blown open but quickly reforms as it closes on her
	she fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but 
a208    thunk  a steel needle slams through her shoulder pinning her
	the polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand  the index finger
	extends as a gleaming needle toward her eye 

				t1000
		call to john  now

207c    wham  something whistles down on the t1000 with such force that is
	cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval  the 6foot steel
	bar is imbedded in its body  terminator hurls the killer off sarah

207d    the t1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with
	fury
	swinging again and again  hammering terminator back  terminator
	falls back against the wall

	behind the t1000 is an enormous ibeam hanging from two chains  it
	is used to lift ingots into the smelters and it runs on a linear
	track
207e    the t1000 grabs the ibeam and rolls it down the track  straight at
	terminator  the twoton girder smashes into his chest crushing the
	armor
	the t1000 pulls the ibeam back and then heaves it forward again
	terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder  we hear
	metal crush and break inside him  he sags turning to grip the
	wall
	the third blow slams into his back smashing his spine and pelvis  we
	hear servos ratcheting and failing  he drops to his knees crucified
	on a wall of machinery
	the fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades  sound of
	crushing metal  his skull is partially caved in
	he slides to the floor

207f    on the t1000 emotionless as it walks forward

207g    terminator is a pathetic shape on the floor  he is trying to crawl
	feebly
	dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine  his arm
	stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward  his
	exposed machine eye burns red with determination

	we see his prize  he has the m79 with the breech still open 
	cradled in the crook of his ruined arm  he good hand the exposed
	steel one is reaching for the last grenade which is visible under
	the skirt of the massive smelter base  his metal fingers reach out
	for it as 

207h    the t1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down
	with unbelievable force  it punches into terminators back through a
	gap in the shattered armor  the t1000 levers it back and forth
	widening the hole  then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it
	down
	it punches right through  emerging from terminators chest
	and into the floor  he is pinioned  the cyborg sags face down and
	stop moving  the light goes out of his eye

						cut to

208     int maze of machinery

	john scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter  above him
	vast machines churn untended  he hears a voice sarahs
	calling low and urgent to him

				sarah
		john  john  can you hear me  where are you

208a    he crawls out of the shadows
	onto a landing next to one of the smelter crucibles  molten steel
	glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace  heat shimmers
	the air giving everything a hallucinatory quality

	john sees sarah nearby limping toward him  she can barely move her
	leg bathed in blood  he runs toward her

				sarah
			gasping
		help me honey

	tight on sarah her stoic face as she hobbles forward reaching out
	to him  something rises behind her out of focus

209     another identical sarah but this one has a shotgun
	aimed right at us

209a    john freezes  which is which  he looks down  the first sarahs
	feet are melded with the floor sucking and fusing with the tiles as
	she walks  they have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the
	knee

				sarah
		john get out of the way

				john
			screaming
		shoot

209b    john dives aside  the sarahform spins changing into youknowwho
	sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it  boom  it staggers back
	kchak  she chambers another round  boom  it staggers again
	kchak  boom  and again  and again

209c    the t1000 is blown back a step and sarah advances with each shot
	the craters in the t1000s body heal slowly  its power is waning
	she fires again  and again  her eyes blazing with feral intensity
	she walks it back right to the edge of the pit of molten steel

	kchak click  shes empty  the t1000 is right at the edge  in a
	second it will recover its composure as its crater hits close slowly
	she has failed  now it will kill them both
	except

210     closeup terminator as the chain drive brings it into view
	half human flesh half chrome steel
	his red eye gazes right at us as he 
	fires

210a    the t1000 takes the round in the belly  the grenade explodes inside
	its body  a huge hole is blown clean through it and it is ripped
	open and peeled back half insideout  it topples into the molten
	steel and 

211     the t1000s head and upper body reappear above the molten steel
	it is screaming  a terrifying inhuman siren of a scream
	it is changing morphing transforming into anything and everything
	its ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it 
	we catch a glimpse of janelle voight checkered with the linoleum tile
	colors lewis the guard with knives exploding from his face other
	faces switching at a stroboscopic rate now a face every two frames
	until they merge into one face 

	the t1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel
	we see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the
	superheated surface until it vanishes swirling into nothing

212     john runs to sarah  she stands staring into the pit  the empty
	shotgun slips from her fingers  clatters to the floor  he sees that
	shes okay and he runs to the fallen terminator

212a    the crippled cyborg is trying to rise  its servos whine and stutter
	it pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position collapses
	tries again
	john lifts for all hes worth  sarah joins them helping
	the help the crippled machine get on its feet  it can barely stand

				terminator
		i need a vacation

	they walk to the edge of the pit  terminator looks down and sees
	that it is over

				john
			to terminator
		is it dead

				terminator
		terminated

	john unzips sarahs backpack and takes out the hand of the first
	terminator

				john
		will it melt in there

				terminator
		yes  throw it in
	
	he does  it sinks into the lava  vanishes

				terminator
		and the chip

	john takes it out of his pocket  looks at it  tosses it into the
	smelter

				sarah
		its finally over

				terminator
		no  there is another chip

	he touches a metal finger to the side of his head

				terminator
		and it must be destroyed also

	john suddenly understands what he means
	terminator looks at sarah  they both know what must be done
	john shakes his head

				john
		no

				terminator
		im sorry john

				john
		no no no  itll be okay  stay with us

				terminator
		i have to go away john

				john
		dont do it  please dont go 

	tears are streaming down his face

	tight closeup terminator turning toward john
	the human side of his face is in shadow so we see mostly the chrome
	skull and the red eye

				terminator
		it must end here or i am the future

				john
		i order you not to

	terminator puts his hand on johns shoulder  he moves slightly and
	the human side of his face comes into the light
	he reaches toward johns face  his metal finger touches the tear
	trickling down his cheek

				terminator
		i know now why you cry  but it is something i
		can never do
			to both of them
		goodbye

	sarah looks at terminator  reaches out her hand to shake it
	they lock eyes  warriors  comrades

				sarah
		are you afraid

				terminator
		yes

	he turns and steps off the edge
213     they watch him sink into the lava
	he disappears the metal hand sinking last at the last second it
	forms into a fist with the thumb extended a final thumbs up
	then it is gone

214     hold on john and sarah watching through the heat ripples as we 

						dissolve to

215     the sun pure in a cloudless sky
	tilting down reveal that we are in a park very green  people are
	casually dressed having fun  cycling reading children are
	playing in a playground

	beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of washington dc with
	the capital building and the washington monument  the skyline is
	subtly changed with a lot of new buildings advanced highrises
	a card appears

				july 11 2029

	we boom down and track laterally through a playground in the
	foreground  children swinging on swings  sliding down slides
	timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not
	change  as we track we hear

				sarah vo
		august 29th 1997 came and went  nothing much
		happened  michael jackson turned forty  there
		was no judgment day  people went to work as
		they always do laughed complained watched
		tv made love

	we pass a jungle gym neither melted nor burned but full of kids
	swinging and yelling raucously  past it we drop down to see a boy
	pumping the pedals of a tricycle

				sarah vo
		i wanted to run down the street yelling to
		grab them all and say every day form this day
		is a gift  use it well  instead i got drunk

	still tracking we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a bench
	it is sarah now 64 years old  the world has aged her but she seems
	at peace in this moment  she speaks into a microcassette recorder

				sarah vo
		that was thirty years ago  but the dark future
		which never came still exists for me and it
		always will like the traces of a dream lingering
		in the morning light  and the war against the
		machines goes on  or to be more precise the
		war against those who build the wrong machines

	there is a man in is forties playing with two small children
	nearby  he turns  it is john connor  through he has the same stern
	features in adulthood there is no eyepatch no scarring  he is far
	from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might
	have been  but there is still penetrating intelligence even wisdom
	in his eyes

				sarah vo
		john fights the war differently than it was
		foretold  here on the battlefield of the
		senate the weapons are common sense and
		hope

	a fouryearold girl runs to her to have her shoelace tied

				girl
		tie me grandma

	grandma sarah smiles  it is the only time we have seen her smile so
	far  she bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench
	she ties as we hear

				sarah vo
		the luxury of hope was given to me by the
		terminator  because if a machine can learn
		the value of human life maybe we can too

	sarah ruffles the kidss hair as she runs off to play with her dad
