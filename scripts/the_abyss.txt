blue deep and featureless the twilight of five hundred feet down
propeller sound  materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an ohioclass ssbn ballistic missile submarine

in the attack center darkened to wombred the crews faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments  the skipper and his exec crowd around
barnes the sonarman

                                barnes
                checked it twice skipper  its a real unique
                signature  no cavitation no reactor noise
                doesnt even sound like screws

he puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruders acoustic signature a strange thrumming  the captain studies
the electronic position board a graphic representation of the contours of
the steepwalled canyon a symbol for the montana and converging with it an
amorphous trace representing the bogey

                                captain
                what the hell is it

tension builds in the attack room as the montana surges to intercept the
intruder  the exec tensely watches the vectorgraphic readout for the side
scan sonar array  the sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls

rapidly under the subs hull  moments later a shockwave like an underwater
sonic boom impacts the sub slamming it sideways

the cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slowmotion  the sub slams into it with horrific force scraping
along and bouncing off  one tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting kkkwang

the great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for hell

a tiny transmitter is ejected from the subs hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface  a second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge tearing open its pressure hull

various quick cuts just flashes and impressions as
seawater blasts down the corridors 
explodes across the control room hurling men like dolls 
floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds 
bursts through hatches into the reactor room 
blasts men out of frame in a microsecond

in the cobalt twilight we see the montana slide down the sea cliff its hull
screeching like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur  descending in an
avalanche of silt it finally disappears into the blackness below a
blackness which continues almost straight down 20000 feet to the bottom of
the cayman trough  the abyss

the first sea king settles onto the helipad disgorging a contingent of naval

bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor  the working heart of
the rig  thunderous mechanical roar  the drill crew in hardhats and mud
plastered overalls tend the massive spinning turntable in the center of the
chamber  the semiautomated system requires only five men to operate  the
others are lupton mcwhirter dwight perry jammer willis and tommy ray
dietz  bud hears his names called above the din by jammer a massive
roughneckdiver who stands a good head taller than the rest

can be seen welding  he is accompanied by a large submersible flatbed and
by a remotely operated vehicle or rov call little geek  little geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cablelike control tether

                okay here we go  start equalizing yall

hissss of inrushing compressed gas  the pressure in the chamber rises  the
breathing mixture is composed of helium oxygen and nitrogen  catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber watching the
gauges with a practiced eye  lindsey and the seals all grab their noses
and start making funny faces popping their ears with the familiar divers
equalization technique  they continue as

                                lindsey
                get comfortable  the bad news is we got six
                hours in this can blowing down  the worse news
                is its gonna take us three weeks to decompress
                back to the surface later

                                coffey
                look weve all made chamber runs to this depth
                were checked out

                                lindsey
                oh chamber runs  uh huh thats good
                          coffey turn away
                well hey you guys know any songs

they ignore her  start going over some diagrams of the montanas interior
its going to be a long six hours

int gas control station  hours later                                 46

catfish checks his watch then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri
mix manifold watching the gauges  satisfied he leans over to the pressure
window in the door checking out the seals  hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers  jammer is in a chair
reading a louis lamour paperback

                                catfish
                those guys aint so tough  i fought plenty of

                                hippy
                now we get to hear about how he used to be a
                contender

catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of hippys face

                                catfish
                you see this  they used to call this the hammer

int pressure chamber                                                   47

it looks like the end of a long bus trip  everyone silent leafing
through beattohell magazines or just staring  lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the seals two equipment cases  she casually toes open
one of the latches then the other  glances at coffey  hes reading  she
begins to lift the lid with her toe  gets a glimpse inside of packing foam
and what looks like a small black metal box  then wham  coffeys foot
comes down on the lid slamming it shut  startled she looks up into his
cool gaze

                                coffey
                curiosity killed the cat

                yaller done to a turn and ready to serve
                everybody okay

the seals nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear  lindsey exists first
followed by monk wilhite and schoenick  coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case  he is alone for one moment in the chamber  he raises his
hand and stares at it  the fingertips are trembling the slightest bit  he
clenches them into a fist and walks out

int corridor                                                           49

as lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig she bumps into a large
dark mass

                                lindsey
                hey was there a wall here before  i dont
                remember a wall here  oh jammer  hi

the wall grins down to her

                                jammer
                howdy there little lady

coffey emerges behind them and ignoring lindsey faces jammer

jammer scowls turns and leads the seals in the subbay  catfish and lindsey
exchange a look

kissing sounds at beany who has his inquisitive nose right up to hippys
lips

                hippy youre going to give that rat a disease

wider as hippy and bud to see lindsey leaning in the doorway  she and bud
size each other up  he opts for a jovial approach his eyes wary

                                bud
                well well  mrs brigman

                                lindsey
                not for long

lindsey crossed past him her eyes scanning the banks of equipment almost
unconsciously checking checking getting the pulse of her big iron baby

                                bud
                you never did like being called that did you

                                lindsey

                     looking through the front port
                is that one night up in flatbed

                                bud

lindsey leans past bud to the gooseneck mike on the console

one night mimes a puking motion finger down her throat  then she replies
with sickening sweetness

                                one night
                oh hi lindsey

she crosses past bud and exits into the corridor  bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and hippy scrambles in to take over

bud catches up with lindsey in the corridor and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection

                                bud
                then whyd you come down

she stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe  he almost slams into her  she
moves on climbing down the ladder to the lower level

                                lindsey
                you need me  nobody knows the systems on this

                to go wrong after the explorer clears off  what

                had to think for ourselves  coulda been a

lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery  her eyes rove constantly over fittings gauges circuit
panels

                                bud
                             yelling

                morons

she scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely

                                bud
                i think you were worried about me

                                lindsey
                that must be it

lindseys on the move again and bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up

                years invested in this project

                occupied  you can grab a couple hours before
                we get there

lindsey slips past him into his tiny stateroom the only private bunk on the
rig  rank had its privileges  his hand on the door is just level with her
eyes  she notices his wedding ring a massive band of pure titanium
something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
mit

                                lindsey
                what are you still wearing that for

                take it off

bud stays in the doorway  lindsey takes a heaps of buds cloths off the
narrow bunk  start unconsciously straightening the room

                it makes you sound like such a hick  his name
                is michael

lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks

bud eyes her sounding too causal

                                bud

                day and realized the guy never made you laugh

                                lindsey
                youre right bud  it was just that simple
                arent you clever  you should get your own
                show ask dr bud advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms

she closes the watertight door forcing him out  locks it  she turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall

                aaaarrrggh

she flops down on the bed sitting staring at the wall  her armor is
gone  she looks small and vulnerable  a long beat  she reaches over to the
tiny sink  amid the clutter is a bottle of buds aftershave  she unscrews
it and takes a sniff  catches herself  tosses it

bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger  he pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet  he reaches forward to
flush  cant do it  now really pissed off at himself he reaches into the
toilet bowl wrist deep in the chemicalblue water and salvages the ring
he puts it on and washes his hands  the right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs

                here

                                coffey
                im not interested in your way of doing things
                just get your team ready to dive

end of discussion  coffey is walking away  burning bud crosses to his gear
locker  picks up his helmet  finler is suiting out next to him

nearby monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable  hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says fbs deep suitmark iv

                                hippy
                ive been meaning to ask you what this thing is

mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit what looks like
a space helmet and a large backpack

                                monk
                fluid breathing system  we just got them  we
                use it if we need to go really deep

                                hippy
                how deep

                                monk
                deep
                     shrugs
                its classified you know  anyway you
                breathe liquid so you cant be compressed
                pressure doesnt get to you

catfish is grappling with the concept

                                catfish
                youre saying you get liquid in your lungs

                                monk
                oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion

monk take a clear plastic box full of orings off the shelf and dumps them
out  he opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box  then he take beany by the tail off hippys
shoulder

                                hippy
                hey

                                monk
                check this out

he drops beany in the box and before hippy can protest closes the lid
beany is forced under the surface  he struggled for a second and bubbles
come out of his mouth  then he casually swims around in there completely
submerged breathing liquid  catfish and the others stare into the box
amazed

                                monk
                see  hes diggin it

monk takes beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs  then hands him back to hippy  the rat is annoyed but otherwise
alright

bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment  he goes down a stairwell to the lower level  a hundred
feet away jammer loses sight of buds divelights  he starts to get
nervous  suddenly his own lights begin to dim flickering lower and lower
they become little orange candles the filament barely glowing  the darkness
closes in

                bud  bud  you readin me  bud

bud at the same moment is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights which are dimming and flickering  he hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver

jammer smacks the side of his helmet  shakes the transceiver on his belt
nothing just static  then even the static dies  panic time

he grabs the safety line and pulls twice  hard  it is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him  he pulls twice more harder hauling the
thing  the line severs  jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him  his eyes bug  he looks all around in the darkness  cant see bud
cant decide what to do  we can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel

then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls  it is a
cold and ethereal light unlike the warmwhite of their dive lights

it grows brighter  he turns slowly toward it

the glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically coming toward him

                                jammer
                bud  is that you

cu jammer shielding his eyes staring into the radiant source

guess what jammer  its not bud  in the brightest center of the glow
something is moving a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls
jammer blinks against the glare his face registering total outright
astonishment melting into terror

the glare pulses subtly hypnotically  the shifting shadow falls across
jammer  he finally snaps out of his fixity

screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage

his harness catches on a twisted pipe

he struggles totally out of control the big man reduced to a blind panic

jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength

he tears free of the entangling debris  launches like a torpedo slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway  his trimix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact

on bud swimming furiously back toward jammers position  the strange
radiance is gone  his dive light flare back to full brightness

lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane  then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power

suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and something
appears right in front of her a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her  it is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse  what we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside like some
hallucinatory jet engine  and its hauling ass

lindsey jinks left  the object jogs right  she fights the control as her
sub slews around slamming broadside into the sail  kbam  her power comes
back up  righting can one she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc  it pulls a highg turn
and dives straight down

we see the object zip behind flatbed  one night cant see it  the thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hitandrun drunk diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view

                official protest from havana and moscow and has
                led to a redirection of soviet warships into the

tight brotherhood of a seal unit  buds anger is not dispelled  but he
cant address it now  he moves on

                catfish i got a problem here  you there
                catfish

behind her something rises from the depths

it is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the montana wreck

it comes right up behind her  she doesnt know its there  it hovers
sideways like a hummingbird as if curious trying to get a better look  she
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her  she turns
slowly  we see her react as the glowing pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate

a more powerful glow washes up onto her from below

her eyes go down  she gasps absolutely stunned

above the edge of the wall an enormous shape rises silently out of the
depths  over sixty feet across  it looks like a blown glass manta ray its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity pulsing with a blueviolet glow

lindsey stand before it unable to move  absolutely rapt

captivated by its ethereal beauty  it begins to turn majestically one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her  she reaches up  touches it
as it passes over her

lindsey is without fear completely mesmerized

the thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall  she
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water

about that time lindsey remembers she has a still camera a little nikonos

she fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths  gets all set for a shot and

woosh  the little scoutschip whizzes past her from behind startling her
she completely misses the shot of the manta ship  she pivots trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zigzags down along the wall fast as a
meteor  click  she get a shot a second before it disappears

from around the flank of the rig module catfish appears  their comsets
come backs to life along with their lights

                                lindsey

exile  theyre all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves  their

removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an electronic detonator  the

from one of the bunkrooms as lindsey passes  in the mess hall catfish and

her breath as she makes coffee  she carries a cup over to monk who is a

he yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door  switches off
the lights  goes out

quiet lapping of water in the moonpool  a beat  then

a cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber  the surface begins to
pulsate

suddenly the water itself rises forming itself into a shifting shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a mans body  the transparent form pulses an
amoebic mass shivering in the air

it stretches becoming a more refined form  like a blindly probing glass
python it elongates and weaves across the room  it extends and extends
stretching out from the moonpool a shimmering tentacle  the head or tip
a featureless liquid bulb seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward
as if it can see where its going

hippy trudges along the dark corridor  he reaches the mens head and goes in
as the door closes the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
bg  it looks left and right  then extends the length of the corridor
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake

looking down three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders  the pseudopod enters and undulates upward

from inside the makeshift bunkroom we see its tip extend inside

sonny and one night are snoring oblivious  jammer is still unconscious  the
pseudopod taking its time checks them out and then moves on

in the mess hall its dark and quiet  lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair her head buried in her arms on the table  the shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence  it sways gracefully in to air searching
it undulates across the room hanging about five feet in the air surveying
everything  it moves past lindsey  sensing something she lifts her head
turning sees the apparition next to her

her eyes go wide  amazement but not fear  the tentacle is moving on still
searching  lindsey shakes bud awake clapping her hand over his mouth

bud blinks twice then freezes  when she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon

bud chucks his pillow are catfish on the next table

catfish cracks one eye open  turns away  turns right back both eyes open
now  sensing movement the thing turn back toward them  it seems to
recognize lindsey  it doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her  she holds her ground fascinated

the bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face her face  it is water
still clear and undulating but definitely lindsey  she gasps in surprise
the liquidlindsey gasps soundlessly a perfect mimic of her expression
lindsey laughs involuntarily  it laughs without sound  lindsey makes a
face sticking out her tongue testing it

the liquidlindsey does the same  bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isnt but hes taking it pretty
will considering

                                lindsey
                its trying to communicate

her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of buds

she reaches out her hand slowly  gingerly her fingers touch the surface
ripples extend outward from the contact across buds features

her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface just like shes
dipping her hand into a bowl of water except sideways  she draws her wet
fingers out and studies them amazed  touches one fingertip to her tongue

                                lindsey
                seawater

the pseudopod pulls back from her  it loops in the air dramatically full
circle and ties itself into a knot  as the knot tightens down it melts
back into the body  the disappearing knot trick

lindsey laughs grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show  she is transported

                                lindsey

the water tentacle enters and moves toward the hotwired warhead  it studies
the device for a few seconds  bud and lindsey enter through a side door in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead  they begin to lift it off its cart

coffey finally jumpstarts his brain  in a flash of insight he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor  he
and schoenick heave on the door  like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it

body of the pseudopod collapses splashing on the floor  it reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater  as the tendrils dissolve
the warhead slams back down onto the cart unharmed  on coffeys side on the

                                lindsey
                okay raise your hand if you think that was a
                russian watertentacle  lieutenant  no  well
                a breakthrough

coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like nicholson in the shining
bud give her a warning look  dont poke at the rattler

                                bud
                you done impressing yourself ace

                                one night
                no way that could just be seawater

                                lindsey
                they mustve learned how to control water i
                mean at a molecular level  they can plasticize
                it polymerize it whatever  put it under
                intelligent control

                                bud
                maybe their whole technology is based on that
                controlling water

coffey is hunched over elbows on his knees  his hands are out of sight  his
arm is moving in a slow rhythm  we cant see what hes doing

                                hippy
                that thing was probably their version of big
                geek like an rov

                                catfish
                just checking is out huh  how come

angle under the table showing what coffey is doing  he has his kbar knife
gripped whiteknuckle in one hand  he is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm  neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow

cu coffey  he doesnt flinch  his eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills  no one notices  hes keeping the edge

                                lindsey
                theyre curious maybe  we could be the first
                people theyve seen up close

                                sonny
                hope they dont judge the whole race offa us

                                catfish
                maybe i oughta shave

coffey stands abruptly snags schoenick with his eyes and leaves walking
through the group as if they were smoke  this cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch

int corridormaintenance room b                                        151

outside the mess hall coffey pauses listening to the conversation resume
bright speculation a few jokes  coffey is visible shaking  breathing hard
pupils dilated  schoenick looks at him with concern

                                coffey
                it went straight for the warhead  and they
                think its cute

                                schoenick
                you need to get some sleep

coffey walks away without hearing him  schoenick catches up

int maintenance                                                        152

the door opens in the dark room  coffey enters moving with purpose  he
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table  unzips it  pulls out a
shortbarreled car15 assault rifle

                                coffey
                we have no way of warning the surface  do you
                know what that means

schoenick doesnt know  he hopes coffey knows  because hes a fearless man
whos discovering what it is to be afraid  coffey inserts the magazine with
a clack  snaps the bolt  tosses the rifle to schoenick

                                coffey
                it means whatever happens is up to us

missing  he looks around  heads toward the subbay

int mess hall                                                          154

the discussion still in progress

                                one night
                you think theyre from down there originally
                or from you know

she jerks her thumb toward the ceiling

                                lindsey
                i think theyre from you know  some place
                that has similar conditions cold intense
                pressure  no light

int corridorsub bay                                                   155

hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the subbay  he edges forward slowly trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor  slides up along the wall next to the door  inches his eye
around the doorframe  across the room schoenick is working with a chainfall
lowering big geek onto the mirv warhead which is still on its cart  he
begins to attach them together with a sling of tiedown straps

hippy lets his breath out slowly  his expression is holy shit

he slides back along the corridor wall silently  away from the door  then
turn turns quickly to go wham  coffey slams him up against the wall
45 pressed to hippys temple  hippy gulping air as coffey ears back the
hammer

                                coffey
                sniff something did you rat boy

the meeting is breaking up as the door clangs open and hippy is thrusted
inside  his hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face
coffey steps through smoothly straightarming the 45  schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group

                                coffey
                freeze  dont move  thats it
                              to monk
                here hold this a second  were going to phase
                three

he hands his gun to monk with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member  monks eyes move between coffey and the pistol  we cant tell what
hes thinking  coffey grabs hippy and shoves him onto a chair

                                hippy
                theyre using big geek to take the bomb to the
                ntis  we set it up to go right to them

lindsey looks stricken  her plan is betraying them all

                                lindsey
                oh my god  oh no
                        steps toward coffey
                please you cant  coffey think about what
                youre doing for gods sake

coffey lets her approach him his eyes glittering

without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the coke
machine pinning her there with one hand  bud leaps forward

                                schoenick
                get back

bud freezes  the rifles muzzle is aimed for a heartshot

coffey moves up close to lindsey

                                coffey
                this is something ive wanted to do since i
                first met you

his hand reaches down out of frame  we hear something rip  his hand comes
back up holding a piece of gaffers tape

he slaps it over her mouth  then pushes her down into a chair

hippy looks at monk and schoenick

                                hippy
                you boss is having a fullon meltdown  guys
                fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
                were all ringside

                                schoenick
                three hours

                                coffey
                shut up  dont talk

                                monk

                hours  the shockwave will kill us  itll crush
                this rig like a semi driving over a beer can

                                coffey
                shut up  shut up  whats the matter with you

everybody is twitching a hyper  schoenick is whiteknuckling his assault
rifle looking from monk to coffey to the group

                                coffey
                just stay calm  the situation is under control

coffey backs out quickly with schoenick

int corridor                                                           157

coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it cant be opened

                                coffey
                stay here

schoenick take a position in front of the door  coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him

int mess hall                                                          158

their only hope is to sway schoenick  but the seals fear is making him the
perfect machine totally dependent on external orders  and his orders are
clear  they can see him through the tiny window in the door  lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth

                                lindsey
                schoenick your lieutenant is about to make
                a real bad career move

window

using the chainfall coffey maneuvers the completed geekmirv package over
the back of flatbed obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it

lindsey is up next to the door with bud

                                lindsey
               hes about to declare war on an alien species
                schoenick just when theyre trying to make
                contact with us
                                to bud
                i think im reaching him

                                lindsey
                see

the door opens  jammer is standing there  schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall moaning  jammer hands the rifle to hippy as he walks in  hippy
turns to cover the other seal  monk puts his hands up passively

                                monk
                im the least of your problems

bud appraises jammer who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay

door into the main corridor  the wheel wont turn  the others get on it
wont budge

                                bud
                hes jammed the mechanism

                now what

theyre locked in trimodulec  no other doors give access to the subbay
corridor  buds mind is racing  he drops down the ladder to level one into
about two feet of water  he reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch  takes off his boots

                okay im gonna freeswim to hatch six get

the water

bed shoots down through the hatch  the cold hits him list a fist becoming
instantly paralyzing  he starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel
catfish is behind him swimming like hell  they reach hatch six  together
they spin the wheel and heave upward opening it

bud surges up into the lock  catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him
they try the upper hatch  jammed  theyre both panting with the exertion
and intense cold

                                bud
                hafta go on to the moonpool  only way

                                catfish

bud looks at catfish shivering and heaving wideeyed

                                bud
                okay cat  you head back

bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch

bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit  he sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead

int sub bay                                                            165

in the moonpool bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
flatbed  his wracked breathing is masked by the whine of hydraulics as coffey
uses the external controls to extend flatbeds big hydraulic arm locking
the geekmirv in its gripper

bud strokes to a point where coffey cant see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool  he lies gasping behind cab ones cradle
his limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold  his fingers are
completely numb  he hugs himself putting his hands under his armpits
scans the situation  he cant get to the door which is across the room
without coffey seeing him

the sub bay bud moving up on coffey

                                hippy
                he cant get to the door i think hes going
                to try and take him himself

                                lindsey
                he couldnt be that dumb  the guys a trained
                killer  buds idea of a fight is armwrestling
                one night over laundry duty

on the screen bud picks up a piece of pipe  hefts it  moves forward
crouched stalking  lindsey yells at the screen in frustration

bud chucks a tool across the chamber creating a clattering distraction then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of coffeys knees
taking him down  coffey spins even as he falls catching bud in a scissor
kick that topples him

grappling they fall together into the freezing water

coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold giving bud time to haul himself
out hoping to make it to the door

coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs

he pulls himself up as bud kick out  claws his way viciously over buds
body until he has him pinned to the deck  then he pulls out the 45

put it unceremoniously to buds forehead

coffey pulls the trigger click  bud flinches then opens his eyes
staring crosseyed at the muzzle of the 45  coffey cocks it and tries
again  click  nothing  really pissed off beyond description bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment  they face off panting

int control module                                                     170

the rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of monks voice

                                monk
                i tool the liberty of removing this before i
                gave it back to him

monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the 45

even so bud is getting his ass kicked  coffeys really trying to put him out
of business  its mostly duck and dodges on buds part  throw a few things
when coffey connects bud goes down hard  give him credit though  he
manages to scramble back up

the fight wrecks the room scattering tools and gear

compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor

coffey slips on one and buds get in a couple of good licks

slams the seals head in an equipment locker door

but the navy man is just too massive  bud is hammered back into a wall
coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace  spins around at the
sound of a voice

                                catfish
                hey

catfish is right behind him  dripping wet  a trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away

crack  catfishs hammer punch comes in so hard and so fast coffey is
knocked right on his ass  he doesnt get up  just sort of flops around

catfish helps bud to his feet  they advance on coffey who crabscuttles
sideways his eyes rabid

he picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them  as they duck he sprints to
flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down

                                bud
                           to catfish
                get the door

bud leaps across the water to land on flatbed  the hatch is already sealed
he grapples with geekmirv trying to free it from the steel claw

is being dragged down still trying to free the rov  he gives up when he
sees hippy run in waving the assault rifle around like a 130pound rambo

hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at coffey visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water  coffey looks up stares at the

shimmering shape of the rov on its back  underwater we see the rounds
arcing wild a few hitting the rov but causing little damage

bud rockets down into frame in a column of bubbles  he looks around  through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern  bud see a shortcut under the platform

he kicks along a lattice a pipes heaving himself along in frantic handover
hand stokes  he reaches for flatbeds stern as it passes

misses the last handhold but just manages to seize a tiedown trailing
behind it  he is jerked along behind the sub

bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters  flatbed gathers speed moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall  the current slams him spinning him like a fishing lure  he pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of flatbeds platform

hovering

on the back of flatbed  bud has the break he needs  he scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker  nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines  the big arm begins to unfold lifting geekrov

coffey releases the rov with the gripper and makes a grab at bud with the
steel claw  bud dives  the gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow  bud
kicks away rapidly letting nylon rope pay out  we see he has managed to tie
one end to geeks skids  coffey hits the button to activate the rov sending
an acoustic pulse to geeks transponder  the little robot pregnant with its
load of death turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void

coffey pivots his bid machine toward bud  bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage  he loops the rope around a twisted pipe  big geek is
hauling ass away from him  the line snap taut an instant later  the rov
strains like a rottweiler on a leash trying to go  the rope is slipping
as bud fights to make a knot

flatbed slews around thrusters whining  as it banks it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face

through the front panel we see coffey jerking on the controls

enormous predatory instinct its lights blaring

coffeys blind area  flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris
it pivots toward bud  moves after him

line starts to play through the knot slowly

bud has gotten himself into a bad position  along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck  coffey puts the hammer down thrust levers all the way forward
flatbed surges forward multilimbed and demonic  theres no cover side to

slews sideways slamming its heavy skidplate into flatbeds cab  coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock  he fights to control his vehicle  lindsey
looks up to see coffeys sub gun it up over the wall out of sight  she
cruises up over bud

more powerful vehicle  with difficulty lindsey maintains trim

fights for control

modules at full throttle slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls

coffey sideswipes the smaller sub jamming it sideways  it screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules

they head out over empty terrain in a flatout speed run

lindsey is jinking and dodging as flatbed roars along behind her tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash  lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon
coffey is ramming hammering from behind then from side to side

lindsey snarls  hes pissing her off  he shouldnt do that

lindsey rises cuts right

smashes down into coffeys craft  timing it just right  he skids catch in
the rocks

flatbed slews violently nosing down  crushing into the rocky bottom
pressing the advantage lindsey hammers into flatbed from behind

it smashes full force into a second spire spinning out of control

he has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge  as the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load

a tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble  grows
coffey gives up fighting  just stares wide eyed at his death  a damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit

the fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port

suddenly a scythelike curtain of seawater under tons of pressure slashes
into him  a moment later the bubble implodes and coffey disappears in a

                tell me later

he grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his  they lock
together in a fierce kiss fueled by passion and terror the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death

she breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head  seats is down over the neck ring  lock the bailout handle
sealing it  even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling lindseys mouth is barely above water  she give a scared little
laugh

                                lindsey
                this is maybe not such a great plan is it

she is halfparalyzed with the cold shaking pathetically  puts her face to
the glass of his helmet  seconds to go

                                lindsey
                hold me  hold me bud im so scared

he cant hear her but he read her lips  they clutch each other desperately
the embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose  she starts
to choke  her hands grip his shoulders like claws  she bucks and thrashes
bud holds her and a scream tears loose from him a pure agony of the soul

                                bud
                nooooo

the freezing seawater races into her lungs  her finger go slack and her
hands float lifelessly

bud stares transfixed as the last tiny bubble trickles out of lindseys open
mouth  he kicks himself into gear fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch

the door crashes open and jammer thunders in  he picks up the cpr cart meant
to roll on wheels and carries it out past hippy catfish and one night who

else

making mistakes  one night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline

                here he comes

jammer and sonny leap into the freezing water waist deep on the submerged
diving platform  bud bursts to the surface  together they haul lindsey
across the platform out of the water and onto the deck  her skin is blue
white her chest still

bud rips his helmet off in a nearfrenzy like a man possessed a man with a
mission  the others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
lindsey as dead a corpse cold and inert  water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue her limbs completely limp  hippy peels back one
eyelid to find the pupil fixed and dilated

but when bud shouts for them to move they move

                                bud
                turn her over

they flip his wifes body over  he straddles her pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back  seawater gushes from her slack lips  he
does it again until the flow stops then flips her onto her back

                                bud
                come on hurry  gimme the defib

one night and catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment  theyve
all been trained in cpr and use of the gear but that was years ago and is a
friend theyre working on  theyre all thumbs  catfish drops the electrodes
picks them up quickly hands them to bud

tshirt revealing her bare chest bony and still

                jesus  gimme those come on  catfish move it
                man  come on come on

he slaps the things into lindseys bare skin one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage

                is that it  is this right

                all right  do it

one night hits the switch and lindseys body convulses  it is a pure muscle
reflex and when it is over there is not a hint of life  hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth  he opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag  they start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

                                bud
                do it again one night  zap her again

the current hits lindsey again and her back arches  bud doesnt wait for a
result hes in his own reality now driven  hes doing it all at once
somehow in a senseless frenzy pumping on her chest with his hands
squeezing the oxygen bag placing the electrodes

                                bud
                aw  christ come on baby  again  do it

                                bud
                come on one night what are you waiting for

a hush seems to have fallen over the group  they know instinctively that its
over  but bud cant accept it  he looks at them beseechingly like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him  one night starts to cry
quietly

                                catfish
                                gently
                bud its over man  its over

there is a beat of silence  bud stares down into lindseys halfopen
motionless eyes

tight on lindseys eyes moving in until the pupil fills frame a black void

reverse her pov  silence  a distant distorted image we see bud one
night jammer hippy catfish staring down  it is like the circular top of
a dark well their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water  it is
as if we are in a well descending looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away smaller and smaller receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turnedoff tv

tight on bud rigid staring  catfish puts his hand gently on buds shoulder
suddenly bud tears catfishs hand away and sets upon lindsey like a madman
renewing his efforts in spades totally manic

                                bud
                no  no  shes not her heart is strong

mouthtomouth  it is frantic passionate the kiss of life

                                bud
                come on breath  goddamn it you bitch you
                never backed down from anything in life now

light rockets toward us in the blackness as we soar upward from the pit  we
see bud yelling but his voice is distant windlike

                                bud
                fight

tight on lindsey still  then something incredible happens  something they
will never forget as long as they live  lindsey coughs once weakly and her
hands clench in a spasm

bud see it and his expression becomes beatific

                come on lins  you can do it fight your
                way back baby

the others look on in wonder as bud wills this woman back

she starts to cough weakly at first then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs  bud crouches over her rubbing her limbs trying to re
establish circulation  it is like a difficult birth  lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world wet and naked and fighting for breath

bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath  he pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands
and watches her breathe  color is returning to her skin as she lies there
gasping weakly

one the group catfish hippy one night jammer the others theyre
all grinning crying beaming gazing at the miracle of her rebirth

unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery  he looks

looking down past his to a ghostly landscape  his last flare sputters out
but there is light  bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him  and hes right it is beautiful

figure to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels  barren as
the moon but exquisite serene  changeless  a place unseen by human eyes

slopes out suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but cant see it

a tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert rov an indian dying with his
horse in the desert

buds eyelids close  his chest barely moving

a strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open  he blinks  weakly
he raises his head facing the source of the radiance

buds pov a glowing figure hovers before him like a vision  it seems to
be an angel  seen closer as it drifts toward him we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being bioluminescent like some deepsea fish  its body
and limbs are transparent and it resembles a figure made of blown glass  a
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona which pulsates
gently propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a spanish dancer  the
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic with large eyes that convey a
cold dispassionate wisdom

it is stunningly beautiful

the creature settles toward him  unafraid bud extends his hand

its slender blownglass digits grasp his bulky glove  it pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope deeper into the
abyss

at the limits of visibility we see faint glowing forms moving below  they
resolve into nti ships  tiny ovoids like the little scoutship that lindsey
nearly collided with at the montana wreck  the larger mantaships  and
others strangely configured moving in the darkness below like luminous fish

suddenly the darkness explodes with light  a vast reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines like some enormous circuit diagram appears below
them covering the floor of the abyssal trench  it sweeps outward from the
center as if the light were surging through channels  the ntis are revealing
their home to bud  the ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city

bud and the creature descend until between the lines of light we see a dark
surface of inhuman design  the shape extends beyond the limits of visibility
towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface  it
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth

they are picking up speed swept along by a powerful current into the mouth
like opening

bud stares around in awe as smooth pearlescent walls blur past him  it is a
curving threedimensional maze of tunnels like a vast circulatory system
where controlled currents of water become freeways in threedimensional
space  tunnels divide narrow and reenter mainroutes hundreds of feet
across as the pair race through in a dizzying blur

entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor and the nti moves back a
few feet

a shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber  the seawater divides like the red sea into two rippling walls
they move apart  leaving bud standing in a short shimmering hallway

weakly he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free  drops to his knees
doubles over as spasms wrack him  breathing fluid explodes from his lungs
he lies gasping and coughing on the floor dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air  it is

bud slowly recovers sitting up  his head is clearing  this really is
happening  beyond the shimmering vertical surface of the water he sees the
nti being joined by others move or less identical until a group of seven
is gathered watching him

                                bud
                howdy uuuh how you guys doin

his voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber  soft laps of water
from the walls

in the air a pattern of glowing lines appears a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams  bud staggers back from this strange screen hanging in
midair  the image is about twenty feet across

the scene repeats on the eastern coast of the kamchatka penninsula in russia
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave

sirens wail as russian sailors run from the docks of petropavlovsk naval base
some stand rooted as the black glacier of water a thousand feet high and
growing thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion

a roar fills the air a thunder which drowns out the peoples screams even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard  they
leave the announcer standing transfixed his face blank eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake

downtown miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith

in a penthouse office suite an executive watches the wave towering above him
blocking out the sun a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over
about to break upon the teeming city

and then

the wave slows as it crests

and stops

it simply stops

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun  there is quiet a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls  various reactions as the thunder fades and people recover
only to stand awed before the vast inexplicable manifestation  a news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly

the wave soundlessly subsides slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again

video shot handheld of a crowd of people watching the sea  moving from
face to face  various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle  the faces awed stunned tearstreaked
laughing  the cameraman is just walking  some people turn to him and smile
or laugh or whoop

a woman is collapsed on a bench crying

a man is on his knees shaking

total strangers hug each other

a black guy tears pouring down his face turns to the camera with a beautific

someone was clumsily typing them

we knew this was a one way ticket when i put this thing on  but you know i

a pause then

the last message expands to fill the entire screen

bud stares at the screen at his message of selfsacrifice then at the
aliens  they bow their heads just for a moment  a sign of respect

close on bud as he begins to realize what has happened

voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder to a
childlike joy

intercut between deepcore and explorer bridge during the following

a depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off not
swirling down like a whirlpool just dimpling down

it gets wider  deeper  rapidly becomes a yawning pit

the ocean is opening

now the surface is churned by turbulence  slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths

mcbride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better

the open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across

the ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom

something rises in the center of the opening  a massive spire  smoothly
curving and iridescent  off the starboard beam a quarter mile away another
spire rises  tons of seawater fall from its sides with a thunderous roar the
energy of niagara

off the port bow another spire

and another beyond the destroyer albany dwarfing it

six towers plus one larger in the center  rising

one the explorers deck a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun  the air the sea the deck all vibrate with the thunder of
creation

and now for the payoff shot  were high looking down  the spires form a
perfect ring a mile across  a vast dark form like a great shadow rises from
the depths beneath the ships  the spires are connected  it is all one

the nti ark

it surfaces with slow majesty gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back  we recognize it as the structure into which bud was led by the angelic
being which we assumed was a city  the explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull clunking massively to one side as it settles

the bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast slightly curved hull  the missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby high and dry its prop whining futility

contingent theyre all standing there openmouthed in a dreamlike daze
touched by the hand of god

glistening plain of the nti arks hull

                oh yes  i think you could say that

she blinks  seeing something not far away  she gives a little laugh or
something between laughing and crying

reverse as bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouthlike
enterances to the nti structure  his suit is casually unzipped and the fbs
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily

she starts toward him  breaks into a run  then stops a few feet from him
watching him come to her

his smile his eyes illuminating her

he stops and she touches him lightly  is this real

the look at each other wonderingly a moment

then laugh  she sniffs loudly
