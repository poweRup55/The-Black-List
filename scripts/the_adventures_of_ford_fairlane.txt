        ext enigmatic body of water  sunset

        the viewers viewpoint breathlessly glides over a body
        of water

        int helicopter dressing room

        bobby vomit charges through what seems to be a typically
        deliciouslytrashed dressing room barking into a phone
        headgear apparatus  his wire rim glasses amusingly con
        trast with his traditional rock star look of shoulder
        length blond hair and redtanktopoverblackspandex
        his pacing reveals a helicopter pilot in the bg
        flying the dressing room

                                vomit
                  whaat no no i cant do it
                  tomorrow  im taping a rock against
                  drugs spot  its important to me

        vomit savagely snorts into a vial of crystal methe
        behind him a big blanket on a couch rises up becoming
        a giggling lump

                                pilot os
                  five minutes mister vomit

                                vomit

                  it in a little protection program
                  he cant stop us man no way

        vomit rips off his headgear and looks to a purse on the
        couch just as the purses owner a cancercuring beauty
        wearing nothing but an oversize i picture of a heart
        black vomit tshirt bursts out from under the blanket
        sipping from a pink bottle of wine cooler  her name is
        zuzu petals

                                zuzu
                  peekaboo

                                vomit
                  now zuzu didnt i tell you to
                  lay off the coolers

        zuzu giggles away as vomit slithers down to kiss her
        while maneuvering his lips he reaches out to zuzus
        purse

        ext water  sunset

        the viewers viewpoint finally glides past the water
        out over a dam where at the base are thousands of
        screaming fans  a stage has been built atop the dam amid
        spooky industrial art design

        ext dam

        the helicopter equipped with a warped logo and the words
        black vomit swooshes to a halt above the stage where a band
        is rabidly pounding away  the chopper begins to descend
        upon a makeshift backstage area to the side of the stage

                                crowd of thousands
                  vomit  vomit  vomit

        int dressing room

        holding zuzus purse behind his back bobby vomit bobs back
        up  zuzu takes a dainty sip from her wine cooler babbling
        softly in a losing battle with consciousness  vomit opens
        the purse and pulls a compact disc from his spandex  the
        cover reads black vomits greatest hits and has a red
        number one on it

                                zuzu
                  so i had this dream right  you
                  guys were doing that song i love
                  you more than my own death right
                  when all of a sudden these penguins
                  come on stage and tell the audience
                  that i used to wet my bed  and
                  that i enjoyed it  it was so real
                   how bout a kiss bobby

                                vomit
                         closing zuzus
                          purse
                  sure  babe

        zuzu drowsily raises her head eyes closed and adorably
        puckers up  vomit tosses her purse smack dab into her
        face and lips with a bonk  zuzu reacts with a dreamy
        smile and curls into a sleeping fetal position

        vomit turns to stare out at his screaming fans and then
        down to the backstage area zeroing in on an
        eccentrically but stylishly dressed man in sunglasses

        ext backstage area  night sun has set

        the man is julian grendel  the soundtrack suddenly ig
        nores the band to go into grendels mind where elegant
        classical music is playing  he wryly murmurs to himself
        as the reflection on his sunglasses go from the screaming
        crowd to the landing chopper

                                grendel
                  vomit  vomit  vomit

        the inner classical music cuts off as bobby vomit bounds
        out from the copter a skipping zuzu in tow

        vomit and grendel exchange cold smiles  julian grendel
        is deaf the sound of his speech is perverse in an inter
        esting way

                                grendel
                  nice of you to drop by mister vomit

                                vomit
                  please dont spank me mister
                  grendel

        vomit pleasantly walks behind grendel and then wields
        around screeching into the back of his bosss head

                                vomit
                  drown in hell you deaf
                  motherfucker

        grendel turns around with a smile

                                grendel
                  sticks and stones

                                vomit
                  but i thought you couldnt hear

                                grendel
                  oh robert rowbare youre so
                  predictable i dont have to

        vomit seethes off to a nearby roadie holding a big drum
        of goo flinging off his wire rim glasses

                                vomit
                  lets do it man

        the roadie begins pouring the goo over bobbys head

        stage

        the audience explodes in a flurry of cheers as

                                announcer vo
                  welcome sluts and perverts i
                  give you black vomit

        bobby vomit strolls onto the stage  and hes on fire
        covered from head to toe by licking flames  a heavy
        metal human torch

        two roadies with fire extinguishers fooosh out the
        inferno that is the rock stars body  another roadie
        tosses him a mike  vomit smolders a bit  transparent
        goo oozing over his body

                                vomit
                         calmly
                  hello la

        the crowd riots as the band breaks in with their question
        able but aggressively stated definition of music  bobby
        vomit wails his way through a toxic first verse

        he stops singing to spasm to his guitarists solo  he
        relifts his microphone and uh he chokes making gurgl
        ing sounds as if something were trying to crawl out of
        his body

        the crowd sounds like all ten thousand of them are in
        labor  they love this

        julian grendel takes off his sunglasses with a scared
        expression

        vomits face turns red as he thrashes about the stage
        bashing down amps and barbed wire set design  vomit
        vomit  vomit

        the band starts missing notes looking around  this
        doesnt seem to be part of the act  dribbling a crimson
        tide bobby vomit falls to his knees with a final scream
        of earthly existence  a final stream of blood rolls
        from his mouth down the white dam to the crowd who has
        reached a new level of frenzy beyond the limits of human
        comprehension

        ext hottest club in los angeles  later in night

        women standing outside the rollsroyce of nightclubs

        killedandkill again

        at the front of the line the overly rich and gorgeous
        thrust and screech over the velvet ropes as a stoic
        doorman standing before glass doors uses all the zen
        he can to tune them out

        ford scans to jaime larry and the man in the hat at the
        bar

        ford stands and begins weaving between tables  he looks
        to the attractive singer onstage  seeing ford she loses
        her place in the song  she gives off a scowl to ford and
        then continues singing

        bar

        jaime and larry see ford approach  larry turns to the
        bartender

        the bartender nervously pours a blenderful of vanilla
        milkshake into an ornate fountain glass and then adds a
        huge dose of absolut along with a maraschino  he then
        lights the vodka shake afire as ford reaches the bar
        blows it out and slurps

                         suddenly very

                  its stuh  sta  sta  stac 

        as the man with hat stutters like the fanatic he is
        ford casually knocks off his hat revealing weird streaks
        of red hair  ford smiles turns to the bar and takes a
        last sip from his shake before smashing the fountain
        glass into the face of the stuttering sam sending him
        off his barstool

        the sleazebag leaps up like a wild animal and swings his
        fist at ford  ford grabs onto the flying fist stopping
        it dead  sam sharply swings his other fist around but
        ford grabs this one too locking them into an arthur
        murray lesson position

                                ford
                  shall we daance

        ford heaves the fanatic into a nearby table  the fanatic
        drops on all fours and crawls under the table  a
        chuckling ford strolls between the tables

        sam crawls out from under one table and makes under the
        long tablecloth of another  the crowd has taken an active
        interest but the band continues to play

                                ford
                  so finally got a tip that paid
                  off  why cant you sleazebags who
                  harass women take no for an
                  answer  i mean hey its never
                  happened to me personally

        ford lifts up the tablecloth  the sleazebag fanatic is
        not there  ford bobs back up with a puzzled expression
        and puts a cigarette in his mouth

        ford brings out a lighter as the fanatic suddenly
        materializes behind him  sam grabs a huge glass candle
        holder from one of the tables and smashes off the end of
        it causing a jagged edge  the band stops playing as the
        candle sizzles in sams hand

                                sam the sleazebag man with hat
                  last dance mr rocknroll

                          from mouth
                  great

        sam the sleazebag flails the jagged candleholder at ford
        who swerves away and connects with a savage kick to the
        groin which sam enjoys

                                sam the sleazebag
                  thank you

        sam swings out again but this time connects with a
        slash to fords chin  ford is more annoyed than hurt
        his solemn anger stops sam the sleazebag in his tracks

                                ford
                  youre ten seconds away from the most
                  embarrassing moment in your life

        ford launches a powerful uppercut that knocks the
        fanatics candleholderholding hand up into the psychos
        own arm  screaming in pain the fanatic flees toward
        the dance floor trying to pull out the shards  don pipes
        up from a nearby table

                                don
                  come on ford this shits getting old

        ford smiles superswiftly raising his arm  a gun slides
        out of his sleeve through a slidingtaxidriverstyle
        apparatus into his hand

        ford fires up at a discotheque ball rotating above the
        dance floor  the gunshot breaks the ball out of its
        ceiling home and sends it swooshing down right upon the
        sleazebag fanatics head knocking him out cold

        ford turns to the approaching awed twin sisters

                                ford

        jarring tour of fords lovable ratty beach house

        the viewers viewpoint moves up to a wall where a set of
        curtains mysteriously cover a compartment  across the
        wall the viewer sees hundreds of autographed photos of
        various rock stars pinned to the wall in a
        surrealistically haphazard fashion

        pulling out a bit it can be seen that the hellhole is
        packed solid with unwrapped vcrs discarded gold records
        answering machines remote controls walkmans watchmans
        cellular phones and all sorts of other basically useless
        goodies  each one has a smarmy thanks fordtype note
        tagged to it

        a tremendous music system adorns another wall with a pair
        of fivefoot tall speakers standing like silent sentinels
        embedded in one of the amplifiers is a wall socket timer
        clock  two needles about to touch  the timer reading
        359 pm whirs a bit and then there is a click

        wide on music system

        the loudest music in the history of dolby stereo balsts
        out of the speakers  dust is literally kicked up as a
        rollicking rock song careens through the room

        fords bedroom

        the twin sisters pop up in the bed in various states of
        undress their squeals of pain inaudible in the face of
        the music  the lump in the bed between the twins jerks
        spasmodically for a second then calmly rises revealing
        itself to be ford fairlane still wearing the sliding gun
        system on his arm

        a ruffled ford plods in and grabs a pack of cigarettes off
        a vibrating speaker  he ritualistically lights up and
        inhales

        ford pulls back the curtains on the wall revealing a
        carvedout compartment in the wall  inside the space is
        an obviously old but still in mint condition electric
        guitar with a picture of jimi hendrix propped next to it
        ford closes his eyes and touches the guitar with a
        religious solemnity

        ford pulls the curtains and then bends down to a red
        hotlinelooking phone with a quizzical expression on
        his face  ford picks up a remote control and zaps off the
        stereo revealing that the phone is ringing  ford picks up

                                ford

        ford and the kid in an obliviously synchronized moment
        flick out a pair of sunglasses from their breast pockets
        and put them on  they then each pull out a cigarette and

        position behind his ranting friend johnny crunch re
        vealed to be a sweating scraggly monster

                                johnny

        a picture of zuzu from the opening scene blowing ford
        and the viewer a kiss  ford fondles it as johnny gets
        up to pour two cups of styrofoam

                  maam is are you wearing
                  panties  aaah

        the grisly sound effect of a woman being sawed in half
        by a chainsaw comes over the radio  an exasperated ford
        turns it off with a remote control  he grumbles toward
        the passenger seat

                                ford
                  why did i take it  because hes

        snugly behind a seat belt patiently taking in fords
        complaints

        ext various sizzling la sights

        to the chords of a corrosive rockrap tune the viewer
        and fords fairlane glides by various hot spots such as

        offstage showing a roadie zuzus picture

        ford breaks up a game of lacrosse between some debauched
        british rockers and some nubile girls  all are wearing
        lacrosse helmets and holding lacrosse equipment

        the nubile girls take off their helmets  the girls all
        seem to resemble zuzu but the real thing is not to be
        found

        int fords fairlane

        ford crosses a name from a list of bars clubs and
        concert halls rubberbanded to his visor mumbling to his
        koala bear

        ford turns back on his radio in disgruntlement

                                johnny vo
                         on radio

        ford pulls up to the radio station chuckling at johnnys
        histrionics  he turns off the radio and gets out of
        the car

        int radio station lobby

        ford walks into the radio station still smiling at
        johnnys screaming  the lights in the radio station
        lobby are frantically blinking on and off  putting two
        and two together ford stops smiling  he rushes to the
        reception desk

        bullet in his head is the engineer  ford crashes through
        another set of doors and there sparks exploding out of his
        face and arms is a sizzling screaming johnny crunch

        int radio booth  later

        cops detectives and coroner flunkies zip back and forth
        with a dazed ford acting as the eye of the hurricane
        gravely contemplating the charred statue that was once
        his brooklyn buddy

        an assistant pulls a burnt envelope from johnnys body
        filled with charred cash  ford watches in pain

        commotion outside the booth becomes audible as the flashy
        obnoxious lt amos makes an entrance  he has made a
        horrible attempt at dressing stylish  his tie is notably
        nasty

                                detective and ford
                  hoh shit

        rpm sleeve  it is blank except for some handwriting the
        name art mooney followed by a drawn star  ford quickly
        nabs it

        a laughing ford squeezes lt amoss shoulder and walks
        away

        ext beach behind fords house  night

        a smoking ford stands starkly wailing with his guitar in
        cathartic quasihendrixian blasts ruining a perfectly
        nice musical segue on the soundtrack

        he looks down to picture nailed to the fence before him
        of a young ford and johnny doing silly rock star poses
        young ford holds a cheap guitar while johnny clutches a
        pair of drumsticks

        ford presses the cigarette against the photo setting it a
        fire and then resumes his playing  the kid rolls up on
        his skateboard holding his ears breaking into fords solo

                                the kid
                  ouch

        the kid holds out his hand  a ring of snoopy in his
        fighter pilot outfit is attached to his hand  a couple
        of notes of snoopy and the red baron play on the
        soundtrack

        ford snores away on his couch holding his guitar  the
        koala bear sleeps beside him  the doorbell rings  and
        again  fords eyes pop open to a pile of wadded up
        money on his coffee table

                  i dont believe it  i took the
                  money

        he meanders to the door like acocoon iicast member and
        opens the door  colleen sutton stands in a striking pose
        at the door  behind her in the street is a blue limousine
        and a driver

        the very attractive colleen belongs to the genre of rich
        people that has seen it all every piece of decadence
        perpetuated  nothing fazes her even the chilling sight
        of a justwokeup ford

                                colleen

        glass also from the coffee table  he hands it to the
        deadpan colleen

        splashes orange juice all over herself undulating in a
        wacky martin shortesque double take  ford remotes off
        his alarm  colleen regains her composure with a big
        orange juice stain

        they sit upon the couch the dozing koala between them

                  five thousand should be enough

        don cleveland the suave black producer from the club sits
        behind a large mixing board along with engineers and mixers
        a passable tune with ghoulish vocals is filtered into the
        booth  as don speaks ford stands behind him staring
        through the glass at the source of the wretched music

        don cracks up as ford makes his exit

        int hallways outside studio

        a pleasedwithhimself ford bounds from his studio  he
        comes across an eerie sight in the hallway  two men in
        gunslinger coats over armani suits  one is a black mohawked
        punk and the other is a highhairheaded heavy metaler

                                ford
                  you guys part of a band

                                punk gunslinger
                         contemptuously amused
                   sure  our name is pain

        ford fakes a smile  the duo snort and sneer as he walks
        off

        ext gloomy marina  night

        fords fairlane pulls up before a pretty ominous marina
        boars are eerily moored with no sign of human beings

        ext pier  night

        ford creeps across the pier  he puts the finishing
        touches on his armtohand sliding gun apparatus before
        looking to a nicesized but inherently tacky boat from
        which an eerie rock song spookily emits  the bow reads
        the mighty penis

                                ford
                  i wonder which boats johnnys

        ext deck ofmighty penis night

        ford comes onto the deck ofmighty penis  he glances
        around before descending below to follow the siren call
        of the eerie music

        int cabin

        ford comes down and turns on some bizarrely hued lights
        revealing a literally rocking bachelor pad from hell com
        plete with a scary rack of dildos and an inflatable doll
        that floats above a neon me sign  ford goes past a wall
        that has cut out quasinude shots of breasts and buttocks

                                ford
                  the love boat is making another
                  run

        he then makes a glance to another picture on the wall
        it is the same youngandwannaberockstars picture
        of johnny and ford that ford viewed earlier

        ford sadly blinks before looking to a gun rack on the
        wall that holds three shotguns  ford wobbles over to
        an entertainment system set up next to the rack  he
        turns off the eerie rocker on the stereo  a video
        cassette marked collie and me lies on an adjoining
        vcr  ford puts the tape in

        tape

        the tape whirs on to show johnny kneeling on his heart
        shaped bed in a comical schoolboy outfit and a dunce cap

                                johnny vo

        colleen sutton comes on the screen in killer black lin
        gerie and wearing a paper burger king crown  she steps
        threateningly toward the bed carrying a scepter

                         on video

                  this is why i have cable

        ford steps over to a closet and opens the door  and
        theres a smiling guy in a psychedelic tiedye shirt
        standing inside  ford quickly closes the door  and
        bam  a hand crashes through the door and latches on to
        fords neck  ford beats off the arm

        kablam  the smiling guy kicks the door off its hinges
        meet smiley  hes muscular and seems mean despite the
        fact he has a ponytail wears sandals nice black gloves
        and has a damn smile that never ever leaves his face

                                smiley
                  hows it going

        smileys fist swooshes at fords head  fords hand whips
        out of nowhere and grabs the fist in midair

                  most embarrass crunch  smiley punches ford across the jaw with his left jaw

        fords body careens into a dresser  he bolts up and as
        he did so wowly in his opening scene superswiftly raises
        his arm  only this time the gun doesnt slide out

        ford feebly tries to reach in his sleeve to retrieve the
        gun butcrack  smiley strikes again  ford runs to the
        gun rack and tries to pull out a shotgun but it is locked
        panicked ford yanks the entire gun rack off the wall as
        smiley latches on with a nasty bear hug  ford fires off a
        wild blast from one of the stillintherack guns

        the shotgun blast demolishes aplayboycenterfold and
        causes a blast of water to whoosh out from her remains

        smiley moves into a strangling mode while fords hands
        move down to the next gun on the rack  another blast
        bursts a hole in the other wall

        ford fires off yet another one into the floor below him
        causing a devastating geyser that allows him to break
        away from smiley

        water is amusingly blasting out from every angle  ford
        and smiley battle semiobliviously to this new added
        element of nature  the water rises above their knees

        ford spins around and grabs the tv off the stillstanding
        home entertainment center  he smashes it upon smileys
        head submerging him into the water which is now at
        fords waist  ford frantically scans the water like a
        shark attack victim but smiley does not emerge

        ext deck

        ford collapses onto the damp deck with a gasp  the
        entire lower level of the boat is underwater  ford works
        himself into a standing position as smiley ferociously
        resurrects from out of decktop windowcase

                                smiley

                  can give you twenty maybe thirty
                  bucks more

        smiley does a savage medley of punches across fords
        gut before slapping him into the deck rail  water
        splashes onto the deck as the boat goes into death
        throes  ford ungracefully makes a clinging jump onto

        fly bridge

        ford beaches himself on the tippy top of the boat
        smiley effortlessly pops up and moves around behind
        fords head

                                ford

        at fords jawline  this hurts the fly bridge is the
        only part of the boat above water

        smiley removes his thumb pats ford on the head and then
        proceeds to exuberantly backstroke away  a job well done

        fords torso is the only thing above water  his sliding
        gun apparatus pings to life  the gun finally slides into
        his hand  ford snorts and shakes his head as he dis
        appears below the water

        int dorothy chandler pavilion lobby  night

        the elite of los angeles with impeccable tuxedoes and
        gowns to prove it grandly stream into a large
        auditorium

        ford holding a plastic bag of party ice over his face
        stumbles through the pavilion doors in a wrinkled tuxedo
        the ice bag breaks sending ice and water down fords
        shirt  various snooty patrons turn to harrumph includ
        ing colleen who does a double take when she realizes who
        she is harrumphing at

                                colleen

        a couple of gasps rise up out of the patrons around them
        ford and colleen feel the breeze of heads turning all
        around them  they turn to see what everybody is looking
        at

        what they are looking at is jazz  gone are her glasses
        and businesslike dress  she stands at the inside
        entrance of the pavilion in a tight lowatthetop

        jazz squints at the crowd trying to find ford who is
        quickly coming right towards her

        the dignified woman laughs and ford smiles at her laugh

        int foyer

        colleen strides out of the auditorium and purposefully
        veers down the hall into the ladies room

        from a seated position at the other end of the hall jazz
        frenetically pops up and pushes on her glasses  she clacks
        after colleen into the ladies room as well

        int dorothy chandler pavilion lobby

        balletgoers stream into the lobby for the postballet re
        ception  ford meanders out with the buzzing crowd a
        couple patrons taking notice of his wrinkled attire  ford
        blazes a marlboro gold as a snooty nonsmoker who got a
        snide closeup earlier in the segment points to a yes i
        mind if you smoke button on his lapel

                                snooty nonsmoker
                  can you read smoker

                                ford
                  can you whistle man in the mirror
                  out your ass snapperhead

                                snooty nonsmoker
                  hey dont be a pottymouth  i
                  just dont want cancer

        as ford speaks he takes a rubberband and attaches it to
        a lighter in a way that keeps the flame lit  he then
        places it in the nonsmokers tuxedo pocket

                                ford
                  you know youre right sir and
                  im sorry  i thought i lived in a

                  vcr but hey you reminded me i
                  live in a hell where any sperm like
                  you can stab me in the heart with
                  these things called opinions just
                  because you have them

        the nonsmoker weakly smiles his jacket starting to smoke

                                snooty nonsmoker
                  its okay  its okay guy  smoke all
                  you want  here have one of mine

        the nonsmoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes from his
        literally smoking jacket and then bolts away

        an hors doeuvres tray cruises by  ford grabs something
        on a toothpick and casually shoves possibly the worst
        thing hes ever tasted in his life into his mouth  ford
        doesnt chew  he just looks around for someplace to
        spit it out just as julian grendel approaches

                                grendel
                  well hello ford

                  i must say youre an island of
                  reality in an ocean of diarrhea

        jazz excitedly approaches ford and grendel  ford grabs
        her and deeply kisses her  ford pulls back and addresses
        jack in his normal voice  meanwhile jazzs face turns
        color her mouth trying to deal with the most disgusting
        transferal of an hors doeuvre in film history

                                ford
                  and its good to see you julian

                  note for note in my brain

        jazz swallows her eyes bulging with delicate agony

                                ford
                  what were you one of those brilliant
                  child prahdigies who was writing
                  baroque operas while the other kids
                  were fingerpainting mr greenjeans

        julian winces in pain and then smiles

                  go on another time another place

        grendel watches the couple walk off and the viewer hears
        the classical music in his head

        ext outside dorothy chandler  night

        jazz pulls ford into the cool of the night

                  why didnt i pick fishermen

        ford stops the blender flips off the lid and begins
        drinking his homemade vodka milkshake straight out of
        the blender but only after setting it on fire and
        blowing it out

        ford then lazily remotes on the television  mtv news

        runs to the door of the cage  he flings it open  the
        babe no longer has the face of a monster  she has the

        scans the crowd  more young pretty girls in sexy black

        tough trendoids and actual psychopaths dressed in very
        black black are packed together like burnt sweating
        sardines  a postpunk acid chiller is throbbing from the
        speakers

        an unamused ford treads through the unsavory pack  the
        crowd almost mystically parts to reveal colleen at a
        table by a window in a violent leather ensemble her
        hair slicked back

        ford sits himself down and a waiter pours him a cappucino

        ford and colleen are oblivious to the flying petals and
        the spurting water

                                colleen

        suddenly serious ford and colleen bound away from the
        table into the seething masses

        ext nearby rooftop  night

        the punk gunslinger and the heavy metal gunslinger throw
        down their rifles connected to huge silencers in self
        disgust

        smiley suddenly abracadabras behind colleen  her face
        contorts in agony and she falls  smiley bashes his way
        outward as a futile ford twists and pushes to colleen
        a knife has been farmed in her spleen  she croaks up
        her last words

        rain  the music has stopped and the place has been
        emptied of its ultracool swarm replaced by the familiar
        cacophony of policemen and coroner officers  a black
        bodybag is carried through the tables past a melancholy
        ford who sits contemplating shot black rose petals
        until

        of his jimi hendrix guitar shrine  with a mute howl of
        pain he lets go of his grip on zuzu letting her head
        clunk to the floor

                  in the microwave

        ford stops gasping  he races into his

        kitchenette

        where zuzu stands before a microwave oven calmly combing
        ash out of her hair  the timer reads 0009 0008

                                fordout

        ford grabs zuzu by the hand and yanks her toward the door

                                zuzu
                  wait my purse

        zuzu breaks off from ford to retrieve her purse on the
        ground

                                ford
                  wait my purse

        zuzu zooms back and grabs fords hand pulling him out the
        door

        ext outside fords house  night

        ford and zuzu burst from the house and dive onto the grass
        heads down  a pause then a familiar beeping sound sig
        nalling the end of a microwave cycle  zuzu lifts her head

                                zuzu
                  maybe it was just a pot pie

        bahoom  a corner of the house neatly explodes

        ford lighting up a cigarette and zuzu achingly move
        into standing positions to watch the gently bellowing
        rubble  neighbors come out of their places to take
        part in the fun

        the kid slowly approaches from behind the transfixed ford
        and zuzu  his eye is black his lip bleeding and his
        shirt is torn

                                the kid

        ford spins around and the kid collapses in his hands

        the kid runs off  ford gruffly exhales and turns to an

        seen

        ford and zuzu straggle over to fords fairlane with nice
        new tires  ford pulls out his alarm beeper and raises it

        melodi swings open the door leading the viewer into

        sorority house

        with a burst of loud music the most ludicrous manifes
        tation of the classic collegegirlsbehindcloseddoors
        fantasy unfolds in eyepopping fashion  girls in short
        shorts are aerobicizing to the music girls in calvin

        zuzu turns to the stunned ford and laughingly spanks him
        as the sorority sisters scamper over

        the punk gunslinger pushes jazz back against the heavy
        metal gunslinger  the metal gunslinger grabs her arms
        while the punk grabs her legs  they swing jazz back and
        forth three times before heaving her smash through the
        plate glass window of the office

        int sorority house  night

        the sisters stand in semidarkness around ford each
        holding a lit candle and each wearing only a special
        robe  ford is also wearing a robe over boxer shorts

        ford looks over to zuzu who stands by the window doing
        a jerking off motion  ford smiles until he looks

        pov  through window

        the two gunslingers ride up in a jeep without their
        lights on

        sorority house

        ford spins to the sisters

        the sisters blow out their candles

        ext sorority lawns

        still in his robe ford bounds across the lawns of various
        sorority lawns until he is far from the malevolent jeep

        ford stands at the top of an inclined street  he looks
        to the jeep at the foot of the hill before turning next
        to him  next to him is the sports car with the unpoor
        license plate

        ford reaches down to the emergency brake

        int jeep

        the two gunslingers intensely load their guns  the punk
        gunslinger looks up then back down and suddenly back up
        again with a squeal  the sports car is coming right at them

        too late to run  the sports car sails right into the
        jeep wounding it with a loud crunch

        frat boys pile out of the acrossthestreetparties with
        howls

                                unpoor frat boy driver
                  duudes they executed my midget

        the frat boys thunder towards the jeep  the punk
        gunslinger exhales a this aint my night breath before
        pulling out an uzi  he sprays a line of cars parked
        before the fraternity shattering windows setting off
        car alarms and sending scared frat boys running away
        squealing

        police sirens can be heard in the distance

                                punk gunslinger
                  its cutourlosses time dude

        the jeep starts to screech off but then stops and backs
        up so the heavy metal gunslinger can lob a grenade into
        the sports car

        the unpoor frat boy driver watches in agony as his car
        explodes  ford comes up from behind him takes the boys
        hand and extends the thumb  ford grins

        sorority

        a victorious ford struts into the sorority to much
        applause  ford looks down to a box of water balloons and
        pulls out one with each hand  highenergy music is
        playing on the stereo

        the sorority sisters all start to yank off their robes when
        suddenly a crumpled and bloodied jazz enters the house

                                jazz
                  why do we have to have an office
                  on the second floor

        jazz begins to collapse  ford drops his water balloons
        and catches her

                                jazz
                  i came to warn you

        zuzu pulls out the red number one black vomit cd from
        her purse  she goes to the compact disc player and
        slides it in

        the painful computer screeches  screeee  buzz
        shshshshshsh come croaking out the speakers  the
        sorority sisters hold their ears whimpering in pain
        while zuzu obliviously tries to dance to it  ford and
        jazz smile at each other

        jazz takes the black vomit compact disc case with a red
        number on it from jazz and holds it up

                  i believe the last time we came

                                ford
                         smiling

                  one but hey i never throw away
                  a clue

        ford triumphantly pulls the small toy duck from his
        pocket  he frowns and throws it away then pulls out

                  out an incomprehensible stream of
                  high bits  this one is putting out
                  low bits  the data is in some fucked
                  binary system  the two discs need
                  to interface simultaneously with a
                  third decryptor disc  comprendo

                                ford

                  find zuzu in order to get hold of
                  one of those discs and colleen threw
                  a tizz when we took hers  obviously
                  all this binary disc shit is pretty
                  mighty
                         standing up
                  but its not necessary  people
                  are dead  one was a friend  the
                  same people were involved in a
                  scam to rip off grendel records

                  an hour hell i dont know

        int julian grendels office  night

        bizarrelyoverthetophightech  strange furniture 
        gold records  the spooky portrait of julian and his
        father  a nighttime cityscape sparkles through the
        windows  awnings meant for sunlight jut out and block
        moonlight

        bathed by hightech lighting wearing a tuxedo julian
        grendel is pounding a feverishlymodulated classical
        tune on a piano

        when the viewer takes in the sight of a confused ford
        and zuzu standing off to the side the latter blowing
        gum bubbles it is revealed that julians piano is
        literally soundless  the piano has had all its chords
        ripped out  the classical piece existed only in julians
        brain and on the soundtrack  julians actual playing
        produces only a dull clicking sound

                                ford
                  uh nice piano  probably get a
                  lot of complaints from the
                  neighbors  heh  its another
                  time julian another place  if i
                  told you bobby vomit johnny crunch
                  and colleen sutton were the ones
                  you were complaining about the ones
                  who tried to rip you off what
                  would your reaction be

                                grendel
                         wry
                  shock

                                ford
                  and if i told you that you already
                  knew all that shit and that you
                  had them killed what would you do
                  then

                  golly id probably faint

        suddenly smiley smiling in another tiedye shirt non
        chalantly walks into the room carrying a couple shirts
        in cleaners bags in his blackgloved hands

                  spot out

        grendel downs ford with a punch to the gut and tears the
        cds from fords pocket  smiley laughs and whimsically
        shakes his head

                                zuzu
                  ford you were right

                                ford

        julian picks up a remote control and zaps a stereo  a
        dramatic classical piece floats on  he then coolly pops
        open the drawers of three cd modems beneath a large
        computer screen  he plunks a disc in each

                                grendel

        the two gunslingers enter and along with everyone else in
        the room look to zuzu who obliviously pops a bubblegum
        bubble

                                grendel
                  not her ford  im afraid
                  sometimes a pussy is just a pussy
                  but a 1962 fender stratocaster
                  with an original humbucking
                  pickups maple neck strung
                  upside down for a lefthanded
                  genius  jimi hendrix is
                  something else entirely

        the punk gunslinger lifts up fords beloved guitar out
        from under a couch in the office as smiley bolts behind
        ford and holds his arms behind his back

                                fordno  ugh

                                punk gunslinger
                  hey thats the sound your koala
                  bear made when we hung it

        grendel throws down the 23 and takes the guitar from the
        punk  he gently places the guitar on the table and takes
        a comfy seated position on the couch  he flicks a
        switchblade and lowers it toward the guitar

                                grendel
                  it doesnt have to be like this

                                ford
                  oh god pleasedont

        grendel fiendishly plucks a guitar string with the knife
        ford acts as if it was cutting off his tongue instead

                                grendel
                  dont you think this guitar would
                  look a lot neater with fords name
                  on it

                                gunslingers
                  ooooooh yeah

        the punk begins carving the letter f on the front of the
        guitar  ford gets dizzy  smiley has to slap him awake

                                fordrape

        the punk gunslinger removes a power drill from his coat
        pocket and hands the cord to the heavy metal gunslinger
        who scampers to an outlet to plug it in  julian takes the
        drill and turns it on gunning the power with wicked bliss

                                fordokay  okay  you got me  boy

        grendel laughs and lights up a cigarette  he motions for
        smiley to let go of ford  ford proceeds to light up a
        cigarette also

                                grendel

                  shut up

        the metal gunslinger brings julian and ford each a glass
        of vodka

                                ford
                         raising his glass

                           into julians head
                  sucking my dick

        grendel spins off howling in pain  the punk and heavy
        metal gunslingers rush toward ford but he dispatches both
        of them with swift punches  smiley though grabs him from
        behind and holds his arms

                                smiley
                  take a free hit bro  come on

                                grendel
                  sure

        grendel wipes off his face and steps toward ford  he
        then stops and with all his might backhands zuzu across
        the face sending her tumbling to the floor  he smiles
        and then gives her a kick in the ribs for good measure
        ford breaks from smiley and rushes down to zuzu

                                grendel
                  kill them  not quickly

                                ford
                  are you okay

                                zuzu
                  if you ask me that question one more

        as zuzu speaks ford reaches in her mouth and pulls out
        her gum with one hand  with the other hand he removes
        one of her earrings

                                ford
                  when i say no run for the door

                                grendel
                          pausing at doorway
                  oh wait  one sec  open the window

        the heavy metal gunslinger pries open the window  julian
        picks up fords guitar with two hands and heaves it over
        ford and zuzus head and out the window

                                ford
                  shit

                                grendel
                  ciao

        grendel and the punk gunslinger make a brisk exit  the
        heavy metal gunslinger draws his gun while smiley smiles
        and cracks his knuckles

        for stands up and speaks whimsically

                                ford
                  dont hurt me

        smiley punches ford across the jaw  snapping his head
        back  he then grabs him by the collar and thrusts him
        across the wall  smack  over the desk  into the
        wall  right next to a wall socket

        zuzu felinely kneels before the heavy metal gunslinger
        sneakily picking up the 23 cd from the floor

                                heavy metal gunslinger
                  now were talking

        ford jams the earrings from his right hand into the
        chewed gum from his left hand and then shoves them into
        a wall socket

                                ford
                  now

        zuzu punches the gunslinger in the groin  the earrings
        spark  and the lights go out  the classical music
        grinds to a halt and gives way to the sound of grunts
        and punches

        int hallway

        ford rounds a corner holding a hand

                                ford
                  move it

        ford pulls the hand around the corner  it belongs to the
        dazed heavy metal gunslinger  ford with a brutal yank
        pulls him into his knee doubling him up  ford watches
        him drop to the floor as zuzu rounds the corner holding
        her eye

                                zuzu
                  nice left you got there jerk

                                ford
                  sorry it was dark now come on

        another corridor

        ford and zuzu race around another corridor  zuzu sees a
        door  roof access  she opens it

                                zuzu
                  this way

                                ford
                  no wait

        smiley and the heavy metal gunslinger chug around the

        immediately wields back around and grabs for the roof
        access door but it has closed  he tries to open it
        but it has locked  a bullet explodes the lock

        ford and zuzu are climbing down and around the side of the
        building

        the ledge is about a foot wide  the sheet metal awning
        juts down and out at a fortyfive degree angle just under
        and out from the ledge

                                ford
                  and you say i never take you
                  anywhere

        reach a space in the awning  ford starts to lower himself
        through the space to the next level nine feet below

        ext capital roof

        smiley looks over the edge  straight down  between the
        cracks we can see ford and zuzu on their precarious journey

                                smiley

        window  bonk  the glass bounces unaffected  whoa
         ford teeters from the hit  falling  zuzu grabs him
        and pulls him back up

                  side of the building and somebody
                  sticks their head outside the window
                  and says i forget what they said
                  but its pretty funny

                                ford
                  why have you come to my planet

        a bullet zings by  zuzu shrieks  they look up

        between the spaces the metal gunslinger points the
        business end of a gun between the awnings from the 14th
        floor ledge

                                ford
                  around

        they move along the side of the building  making for the
        next space in the awning

        different ledge  with smiley

        smiley hits the ledge and teeters  he steadies and moves on

        11th floor  ford and zuzu

        wide and high on all this

        are zigging and zagging and dropping down  the metal
        gunslinger follows them from a few floors above  going
        left and right  smiley is concentrating on going straight
        down

        heavy metal gunslinger

        prepares to go down  sticking his gun in his mouth he
        slaps down on the rim of the next ledge

        ninth floor  right between ford and zuzu

                                fordzuzu
                  wow

        his gun still in his mouth the gunslinger swings and flaps
        his arms trying to get his equilibrium  falling backward
        he yelps out of the corner of his gunclenching mouth

                                heavy metal gunslinger
                  help

        zuzu instinctively reaches out for him  and grabs the
        gun  and the trigger

        she innocently blows the back of his head off  the
        corpse bounces off the awning

                                zuzu
                  oops

        ext vine  atop wonder bread tour bus  night

        on the roof of the wonder bread tour bus a tour guide is
        blabbing through a bullhorn to a bunch of seated tourists

                                tour guide
                  the building is a symbol for the
                  music industry a business where
                  anything can happen and usually

        the corpse of the heavy metal gunslinger slams down before
        him with a crash that turns into a gaping hole on the bus

                                tour guide
                   does

        back to ninth floor

        zuzu flings the gun away from herself

                                zuzu
                  ick

                                ford

                  help someone trying to kill you
                  but hey good job  shall we

        ford helps zuzu drop her feet into the hap and smileys
        hand juts up and grabs zuzus legs  smiley is in midair
        pulling down on zuzu  he must have jumped up to snatch them

                                smiley
                  hows it going

        eighth floor

        smiley and zuzu fall down as one  slap  smiley hits
        the ledge  lets go of zuzu  and she falls outward

        clang  zuzu slams into the slanted metal awning  her
        feet slide out from underneath her like a bad ice skater
         she reaches for the ledge  misses  but slap  she
        grabs onto the top edge of the awning

        she lays there at a fortyfive degree angle her feet
        sticking out into the atmosphere

        and smiley stands right above her grinning  smiley rests
        a steadying hand on the wall  sticks his foot out
        towards the top of the awning  towards zuzus fingers

                                zuzu
                  ohfoord

        thunk  ford drops from above and lands on the ledge
        behind smiley  smileys gloved hands lunge out at ford
        and grab his throat  ford shoots his hands out and
        locks them on smileys neck

        zuzu hangs on for dear life as ford and smiley squeeze
        pushtwist  both almost dependant on the other to keep
        balance  bored smiley decides to finish off ford  he
        swings fords head out a bit then in smashing fords
        skull against the building

        the force of the smash knocks them both off balance
        they twist  tip  let go of each other  and both
        fall  clang  clang  onto the metal awning right
        next to zuzu  smiley in the middle  each holding on
        with one hand to the creaking awning they both start
        to wail punches on each other  then kicking

                                zuzu
                  fluck this

        zuzu gets into the act  with her nails  and smileys
        eyes  she rips away blindly at his face

        smiley yells  he loses his grip and starts to slide down
         until he grabs fords belt

        ford gleefully unloosens his belt and lets a desperate
        and descending smiley yank it all the way out  ford
        reaches out to the belt at the last second  he savors
        the sight of smiley hanging on for dear life

                                ford
                  i want you to say that youre the

                                ford
                  okay  bye

        before ford can let go of the belt he catches sight of
        smileys glove ripping open revealing a snoopyina
        fighterpilotsuit ring just like his sons the kid
        the snoopy and the red baron song plays a couple of
        beats  ford looks to god

                                ford
                  hey  god  youre an asshole

                                zuzu
                  let go of the belt  what are you
                  doing  you got mad at me for
                  trying to save the other guy

        smiley starts to pull himself back up as ford contemplates

                                ford
                  i cant kill this kids father

                                zuzu

                  the tooth fairy  kill  kill  kill

                                ford
                  this is fucking unbelievable  zuzu
                  its a long story you see

        smiley suddenly lurches up to fords neck and starts
        strangling away  and thats when the awning bends  it
        wasnt built for this  the angle changes from fortyfive
        to twentyfive as all three people slam down and bounce

        the snoopy comes off in fords hand

        they all lose their grip  and free fall

        in midair zuzu latches onto fords legs and smiley
        latches onto zuzus legs  fords elbow crunches through
        the edge of the next metal awning  his encrusted elbow
        is the only thing that is keeping the dangling threeway
        chain of himself zuzu and smiley from death  all three
        howl and scream in amusing syncopation

        ford looks to his left and stops screaming  hanging from
        two good guitar strings off a building thermometer isthe guitar  ford loudly cheers and breaks into a
        rendition of purple haze

                                ford
                  excuse me while i kiss the sky
                          loudly hums a

                  whoooo  oh god buddy im sorry
                  for calling you an asshole
                  youre number one man  hey
                  zuzu look i found my guitar

        ford looks down to zuzu who is rightfully wailing her
        head off  ford is slapped back into reality  ford looks
        over to his guitar back down to zuzu then up to god
        he whines

                                fordyoure tearing me apart here

        ford reaches over to his guitar and unhooks it from the
        thermometer with his free hand

                                ford
                  sorry jimi

        ford fiercely flings down his guitar  it blazes down into
        smileys face  smiley lets go of zuzu with a final howl

        ford and the viewer watch the guitar swirl and spin in
        the air before crunching to the ground

        zuzu climbs up fords back and into the frame

                                zuzu
                  thanks  i know how much that
                  thang meant to you

        they semiromantically kiss  zuzu squeals in mock
        indignation

        entrance to capital records building  later

        placidly sits before the viewer  suddenly ford and
        zuzu drop down from the top of the frame and land on
        their feet their backs turned to the camera  they stand
        shellshocked and motionless for a moment until ford
        turns around and tries to catch his breath  zuzus body
        language says that she still thinks shes on a ledge

        an amiable tourist couple approach the devastated duo

                  they tried to get these cds
                  together in order to have proof of
                  grendels involvement so they could
                  keep him in line  nows the fun part

        holding a radio mike grendel is in the throes of
        grandiosity

                                grendel
                  they make jokes about the music
                  industry  they say its cutthroat
                  they say its cynical well we know
                  the truth  theres a lot of love
                  in this room tonight but but

        a flash of reflected light hits grendels face causing
        him to wince  he wiggles his head and continues

                                grendel
                  but ive talked long enough  now
                  the moment youve been waiting for

        out wearing a heavy metalstyle wig to the bullshit
        applause of the crowd  he is accompanied by a security
        guard

        grendel puts down the radio mike to applaud kyle  the
        flashing of reflected light hits grendel a little more
        fiercely  annoyed he looks offstage to its source

        grendels face drops and then switches back to a wide
        counterfeit grin grendel shuffles away from kyle and the
        flashbulbs  he steps over the radio mike he placed down
        on the stage  a nubile hand reaches over the stage and
        grabs it

        ext alley

        jazz and the punk gunslinger crash into the volkswagen
        shoving grappling and kicking  they crunch down onto
        the ground

        the gunslinger dives toward his gun  but a foot steps
        on it  jazz and the punk look up to see a quite dapper
        sam the exsleaze

                                sam
                  i used to be just like you abusing
                  women to hide my emotional
                  insecurities  i realize now that
                  a little insecurity is good for a
                  man

                                jazz
                  sam the sleazebag to the rescue

        a dazed punk gunslinger leaps up and swings his fist at
        sam who catches it with one hand

                                sam
                  youre ten seconds away from the
                  most embarrassing moment of your
                  life

        sam and the punk engage in a violent howling wrestling
        match  the punk nails sam with a kidney punch and then
        bolts toward his gun  jazz stands before him holding it
        nervously  she lifts up her eyepatch to get better aim

                                jazz

        jazz empties the gun into his chest sending him to the
        ground  sam wearily rises up

        int backstage

        grendel hungrily bolts into the backstage area
        mockworried

                                ford

        grendel humbly approaches ford but then levels a karate
        style kick into fords ribs  he snatchesthecd from
        ford and splits it apart in the three pieces

        he savagely begins eating the cd pieces bloodily cutting
        his lips

        ford pulls five more cds from his pocket

                                ford
                  and may i suggest for dessert the

                  cash you gotta give to the actual
                  artists who create the music  those
                  ingrates really take a bite  but
                  seriously when pops died you got
                  vomit crunch and sutton to help

                  what is this are you holding a
                  microphone behind my head

        holding the radio mike zuzu scampers up behind grendel
        with giddy selfconsciousness at the adventure at hand
        as grendel launches into a tirade zuzu holds up the
        mike just behind him she reacts to his words with over
        thetop facial expressions

                                grendel
                  i should kill more music people
                  when i was sixteen i wrote an
                  opera the greatest piece of music
                  ever created in the 20th century
                  outside thedirty dancingsoundtrack  it was called paco
                  the shoeshine boy  when i showed
                  it to my father he said it wasnt
                  happening  that no playlists
                  worth his while would touch it

        club

        the crowd rumbles into silence to listen in shock to
        grendels words coming over the loudspeaker

                                grendel vo
                  lets face it making money is the
                  only art form open to innovation
                  whoever says theyre in the
                  business because they like music
                  is a lying pathetic piece of shit

        a tear streams down kyles face

        offstage

        grendel continues to dig his own grave with zuzu having a
        ball in the bg exploiting his deafness with commentary

                                zuzu
                  is this guy flucked up or what
                  i think hes going to blow

                                grendel
                  the day my father turned down
                  paco i dedicated my life to
                  taking over this fucking industry
                  and making it so disgusting so
                  sleazy and so corrupt that it
                  would have to selfdestruct  i even
                  pissed in the punchbowl tonight

        club

        a line of industry types by the punch bowl simultan
        eously spit outward

        an amused eyepatchless jazz sam in tow passes them on
        their way to the bar  seeing jazz the bartender pulls
        out a fountain glass in order to make a vodka milkshake

        backstage

        ford is actually concerned about the frothing grendel

                                ford
                  man julian that accident took
                  away more than your hearing

                  here look

        grendel pulls off his plastic ears and holds them out to
        ford

                                zuzu
                  hoh graphic  im going to dream of

                                ford
                  just be thankful he wasnt
                  dissatisfied with his sex life

        the zuzudirected comment causes grendel to wield around

                                grendel
                  you little bitch

                                zuzu
                         guilelessly into
                          the mike
                  feelings whoa oh feelings

        grendel loses it  the inner classical music in his head
        comes on the soundtrack playing ten times faster than
        normal

        zuzu with a squeal runs off to the stage  grendel
        pursues

        stage

        zuzu and grendel run out in view of everyone  grendel
        looks out at the dead silent tableau of people who were
        cheering him only moments before

        the crowd starts to boo

        ford walks out onstage having a hard time keeping down
        a grin  grendel suddenly yanks a gun from the security
        guard and points it at ford who stops smiling  kyle
        troy faints

        bar

        the bartender puts a last blast of vodka atop the shake
        and is right about to light it on fire but sam grabs
        and throws

                  jazz

        jazz catches it and she throws the shake up to the stage

                  ford

        ford grabs the shake and flings the contents into grendel
        who gets off a shot with his gun  ford dives behind an
        amp as julian lets another shot fly  ford pulls from his
        pockets matchbooks from a multitude of la clubs  he
        lights a handful of them on fire as grendel moves in for
        the kill

                                grendel
                  im still the king

                  julian youre fired

        ford flings his homemade fireball into grendels vodka
        doused tux  he explodes in flames staggering around
        the stage

        crowd

        jaime and larry watch in bemused detachment

                                jaime

        stage

        the flaming grendel stumbles to an electronic keyboard
        set and begins playing a warped piano solo  the key
        boards spark and churn amid the flames before grandly
        exploding along with julian grendel  the sprinkler system
        blasts on

        crowd

        a deadpan larry turns to a jawdropped jaime

                                larry
                  now that i have no idea

        ford bounds off the stage  he is oblivious to the
        sprinkler systeminduced rain  don greets him

                                don
                  thanks for the promotion man

                                ford
                  no prob

        jazz romantically moves through the makeshift rain  ford
        strides to her when zuzu sprouts up holding hands with a
        beefy rock

                                zuzu
                  look who i found  its damion

        ford glumly droops his head and shuffles away

        ext corner of fords street  later in night

        an rtd bus rumbles to the corner of fords street  the
        sad detective shuffles off the bus to the tune of the
        saddest song in film history

        as ford walks toward his house he passes his debris
        still splayed out on the street from the night before
        mangled gold records smoldered speakers his red hotline
        now burntline phone and then theres that funky sliding
        armandgun apparatus with a gun attached  ford picks it
        up sliding the gun back and forth with a rueful smile

        fords house is looking gloomy dark and missing a lot
        of pieces  ford walks through the intact but dis
        embodied front door

        int fords house

        head still drooping ford closes the door behind him
        a click causes him to look up  sitting atop a battered
        piece of couch blood stains neatly blended into his tie
        dye shirt is smiley holding a gun  cheerful as always

                                smiley
                  hows it going

        ford superswiftly raises his arm and tadaah  the gun
        slides smoothly down his arm into his hand  smiley for
        the first time in our story stops smiling  ford fires a
        cute hole in his forehead sending him crashing into a wall
        that was barely standing to begin with  it crumbles down

                         to his arm

        the viewers viewpoint is lulled to a friendly hut by a
        beautiful tropical cove  a humble handdrawn sign reads
        ford fairlane private investigator  fishermen only

        swinging around the hut the viewer discerns ford jazz
        and the kid kicking back on chaise lounges in silly
        tropical shirts with identical sunglasses

                  giveaway part

        the viewers viewpoint pans over a bit to reveal sitting
        next to the kid on a very small chaise lounge and in a
        very small leather jacket is the koala bear with a sweet
        little neck brace

        close on ford
