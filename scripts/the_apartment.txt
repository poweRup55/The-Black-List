            serious traffic jam  as for
            myself i very often stay on at the
            office and work for an extra hour
            or two  especially when the
            weather is bad  its not that im
            overly ambitious  its just a way
            of killing time until its all
            right for me to go home
            you see i have this little problem
            with my apartment

drawn  from inside drifts the sound of cha cha music

                         bud vo
            its a real nice apartment 
            nothing fancy  but kind of
            cozy  just right for a bachelor
            the only problem is  i cant
            always get in when i want to

int the apartment  evening

carpets are threadbare and the upholstered furniture could
stand shampooing  there are lots of books a record player
stacks of records a television set 21 inches and 24
payments unframed prints from the museum of modern art

only one lamp is lit for mood and a cha cha record is
spinning around on the phonograph  on the coffee table in
front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses a
pitcher with some martini dregs an almost empty bottle of
vodka a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the
bottom some potato chips an ashtray filled with cigar

an empty vermouth bottle some icecube trays a jar with
one olive in it and a crumpled potatochip bag

oldfashioned refrigerator  he takes out a frozen chicken

protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in

rinses the cocktail glasses is about to empty the martini
pitcher into the sink thinks better of it  he pours the
contents into a glass plops the lone olive out of the jar
scoops up the last handful of potato chips toasts an
imaginary companion and drinks up  then he pulls a
wastebasket from under the sink

it is brimful of liquor bottles and bud adds the empty
vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar  picking up
the heavy receptacle he carries it through the living room
toward the hall door

hot aluminum tray out of the oven  he carries everything
out into the living room

in the living room bud sets his dinner down on the coffee
table settles himself on the couch  he rears up as
something stabs him reaches under his buttocks pulls out a
hairpin  he drops it into an ashtray tackles his dinner
without even looking he reaches over to the end table and
presses the remote tv stationselector  he takes a sip from
the coke bottle his eyes on the tv screen across the room

the picture on the tv set jells quickly  against a
background of crisscrossing searchlights a pompous announcer
is making his spiel

                         announcer
             from the worlds greatest
            library of film classics we
            proudly present 
                   fanfare
            greta garbo  john barrymore 
            joan crawford  wallace beery 
            and lionel barrymore in 
                   fanfare
            grand hotel

there is an extended fanfare  bud leans forward chewing
excitedly on a chicken leg

                         announcer
            but first a word from our sponsor
            if you smoke the modern way dont
            be fooled by phony filter claims 

bud still eating automatically reaches for the station
selector pushes the button

a new channel pops on  it features a western  cockamamie
indians are attacking a stagecoach

thats not for bud  he switches to another station  in a
frontier saloon gower street cowboys are dismantling the
furniture and each other

bud wearily changes channels  but he cant get away from
westerns  on this station the us cavalry is riding to
the rescue  will they get there in time

bud doesnt wait to find out  he switches channels again
and is back where he started

on the screen once more is the announcer standing in front
of the crisscrossing searchlights

                         announcer
            and now grand hotel  starring
            greta garbo john barrymore joan
            crawford 
                   bud is all eyes and
                   ears again
             wallace beery and lionel
            barrymore  but first  a word
            from our alternate sponsor
                   unctuously
            friends do you have wobbly
            dentures  

that does it  bud turns the set off in disgust

the tv screen blacks out except for a small pinpoint of
light in the center which gradually fades away

in the bathroom bud in pajamas by now is brushing his
teeth  from the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on
stretchers  bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf
shakes out a sleeping pill washes it down with a glass of
water  he turns the light off walks into the bedroom

in the bedroom the single bed is made and the lamp on the
night table is on  bud plugs in the electric blanket turns
the dial on  then he climbs into bed props up the pillow
behind him  from the night table he picks up the magazine
that arrived in the mail slides it out of the wrapper
opens it  its the new issue of playboy  bud leafs through
it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine
he unfolds the overleaf glances at it casually refolds it
then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read

what he is so avidly interested in is the mens fashion
section  there is a layout titled what the young executive
will wear with a subhead reading the bowler is back
illustrating the article are several photographs of male
models wearing various styles of bowlers

bud is definitely in the market for a bowler but somehow
his mind starts wandering  he turns back to the overleaf
again unfolds it studies it then holds the magazine up
vertically to get a different perspective on the subject
by now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect and he
yawns  he drops the magazine on the floor kills the light
settles down to sleep  the room is dark except for the glow
from the dial of the electric blanket

three seconds  then the phone jangles shrilly in the living
room  bud stumbles groggily out of bed and putting on his
slippers makes his way into the living room  he switches
on the light picks up the phone

                         bud
            hello  hello  yes this is
            baxter

putting on his raincoat and hat bud opens the hall door
takes the key from the table shoves it under the doormat
his eyes fall on the dreyfuss apartment and there is some
concern on his face  he picks up a pad and pencil from the
table prints something in block letters  tearing off the
top sheet he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph
then walks out closing the door behind him  the note reads

                        not too loud
                the neighbors are complaining

ext brownstone house  night

over his pajamas  as he sleepwalks down the steps a cab
pulls up in front of the house  bud ducks discreetly into

            hiya ouspenskaya

dobisch nudges her inside with his knee kicks the door shut
behind him

the landing is empty for a second  then the door of the
rear apartment opens and dr dreyfuss in a beaten bathrobe
sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them
suddenly from buds apartment comes a shrill female giggle
dr dreyfuss reacts  then the cha cha music starts full
blast

                         dr dreyfuss
                   calling to his wife
                   offscreen

shaking his head he closes the door

ext central park  night

bud in raincoat and slippered feet turns in off the
street plods along a path in the deserted park  he stops
at a damp bench under a lamp post sits  in the background
lights shine from the towering buildings on central park
south

bud huddles inside his raincoat shivering  he is very
sleepy by now  his eyes close and his head droops  a gust
of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench  bud
doesnt stir  he is all in

                                            fade out

wool gloves and carrying a box of kleenex  he coughs
pulls out a tissue wipes his dripping nose  he has a bad
cold

company which last year wrote 93 billion dollars worth of
insurance  there are sixteen elevators eight of them
marked local  floors 118 and opposite them eight marked

wielding a clicker is directing the flow of traffic into

something very appealing about her  she is also an
individualist  she wears a carnation in her lapel which
is strictly against regulations  as the elevator loads she
greets the passengers cheerfully

            well about six months ago  i was
            going to night school taking this
            course in advanced accounting 
            and one of the guys in our
            department  he lives in jersey 
            he was going to a banquet at the
            biltmore  his wife was meeting
            him in town and he needed someplace
            to change into a tuxedo  so i
            gave him the key    and word must
            have gotten around  because the
            next thing i knew all sorts of
            guys were suddenly going to
            banquets  and when you give the
            key to one guy you cant say no to
            another and the whole thing got out
            of hand  pardon me

squirts up each nostril

            showing then rushes off to catch
            the sevenfourteen to white plains
            so you fix yourself a cup of
            instant coffee  and you sit there

time the door opens and sheldrake comes striding in briskly

conversation of her own

                   into mouthpiece
            yeah  yeah  where  you

            somebody watch my line  theres a
            swinging party up on the nineteenth
            floor 

she scoots out the door the other girls immediately abandon
their posts and dash after her

int nineteenth floor  day

its a swinging party all right nobody is working several
desks have been cleared and pushed together and on top of
this improvised stage four female employees and mr dobisch
with his pantslegs rolled up are doing a rockette kick
routine to the tune of jingle bells employees are ringed
around the performers some drinking out of paper cups
others singing and clapping in rhythm

one of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar and it
is jammed with people mr kirkeby and mr vanderhof are
pouring  each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his
hands and is emptying them into the open top of a water
cooler

but the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in 
everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill

bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle
holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze since his
promotion he has bought himself a new suit dark flannel
and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round
collar and a foulard tie he also has quite a glow on
detouring past necking couples he heads in the direction of
the elevators

the doors of frans elevator are just opening and the
switchboard operators led by sylvia come streaming out

                         sylvia
                   to a colleague
             so i said to him never again 
            either get yourself a bigger car or
            a smaller girl 

as they head for the party they pass bud who is approaching
the elevator with the two drinks fran is just closing the
elevator doors

                         bud
            miss kubelik

the doors slide open again and fran looks out instead of
the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform she
wears a sprig of holly

                         bud
                   holding out one of
                   the drinks

                         fran

            been in my elevator once  and
            then you didnt take your hat off

                         bud

            you couldnt help yourself i mean
            when youre having a drink with one
            man you cant just suddenly walk
            out on him because you have another
            date with another man you did the
            only decent thing

                         fran
            dont be too sure just because i
            wear a uniform  that doesnt make
            me a girl scout

                         bud
            miss kubelik one doesnt get to be
            a second administrative assistant
            around here unless hes a pretty
            good judge of character  and as
            far as im concerned youre tops

                         fran
            why not
                   as they pass a
                   kissing couple
            they seem friendly enough

                         bud
            dont you believe it later on
            there will be human sacrifices 
            white collar workers tossed into
            the computing machines and punched
            full of those little square holes

                         fran

            have

                         bud

            after all this is a conservative
            firm  i dont want people to
            think im an entertainer 

his voice trails off there is something familiar about the
cracked mirror of the compact  and the fleurdelis
pattern on the case confirms his suspicion fran notices the
peculiar expression on his face

                         fran
            what is it

                         bud

his head the noise from the party washing over him he
slowly crosses to the clothestree picks up his coat  a
new black chesterfield with the coat over his arm he
starts out of the office

int nineteenth floor  day

the party has picked up tempo on top of the desks sylvia
is doing a mock strip tease  without taking any clothes
off there is hollering drinking and clapping all around her

bud moves past the floor show paying no attention kirkeby
spots him detaches himself from the cheering section around
sylvia

                         kirkeby
            where you going buddyboy the
            partys just starting

            drivein again  the car doesnt
            even have a heater four oclock 
            okay

bud ignores him continues walking through the ranks of
empty desks

                                            dissolve to

int cheap bar  columbus avenue in the sixties  evening

it is six oclock and the joint is crowded with customers
having one for the road before joining their families for
christmas eve there are men with gaily wrapped packages
small trussedup christmas trees a plucked turkey in a
plastic bag written across the mirror behind the bar in
glittering white letters is happy holidays everybody is in
high spirits laughing it up and toasting each other

everybody except bud baxter he is standing at the bar in
his chesterfield and bowler slightly isolated brooding
over an almost empty martini glass the bartender comes up
sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick
takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in
front of bud bud fishes out the olive adds it to half a
dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on
the counter he is obviously trying to complete the circle

a short rotund man dressed as santa claus hurries in from
the street and comes up to the bar beside bud

                         santa claus
                   to bartender
            hey charlie  give me a shot of
            bourbon  and step on it  my
            sleigh is double parked

he laughs uproariously at his own joke nudges bud with his
elbow bud stares at him coldly turns back to his martini
the laughter dies in santa claus throat he gets his short
of bourbon moves down the bar to find more convivial company

standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her
middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat her name is margie
macdougall she is drinking a rum collins through a straw
and she too is alone from a distance she is studying bud
with interest on the bar in front of her is a container of
straws in paper wrappers she takes one of them out tears
off the end of the paper blows through the straw  sending
the wrapper floating toward bud the paper wrapper passes
right in front of buds nose he doesnt notice it

margie undaunted lets go with another missile

this time the wrapper lands on the brim of buds bowler no
reaction another wrapper comes floating in hits buds
cheek he never takes his eye off his martini

margie leaves her place and carrying her handbag and her
empty glass comes up alongside bud without a word she
reaches up and removes the wrapper from buds bowler

                         margie
            you buy me a drink ill buy you
            some music
                   sets the glass down
            rum collins

not waiting for an answer she heads for the juke box bud
looks after her noncommittally then turns to the bartender

                         bud
            rum collins
                   indicating martini glass
            and another one of these little
            mothers

at the juke box margie has dropped a coin in and made her
selection the music starts  adeste fidelis she rejoins
bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their
drinks in front of them bud removes the new olive adds it
to the pattern on the counter in front of him they both
drink staring straight ahead for quite a while there is
complete silence between them

                         margie
                   out of nowhere
            you like castro
                   a blank look from bud
            i mean  how do you feel about
            castro
                         bud

                         margie

            cuba with the crazy beard

            him doping a horse

                         bud
            well you cant win em all

they sit there silently for a moment contemplating the
injustices of the world

                         margie
                   to herself
            twas the night before christmas
            and all through the house

int buds apartment  evening

the kitchen and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small
christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace

coat and gloves crying softly pacing up and down is
sheldrake his coat and hat are on a chair as are several
christmas packages on the coffee table are an unopened

it aside and substitutes the cha cha record as the music
starts he dances over to the coatrack beside the door

coffee table he picks up the gloves looks around for some
convenient place to get rid of them moving over to the

delayed reaction to something he saw inside he quickly

bud slams the door shut starts toward the bedroom halfway
there he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on
he detours to the phonograph switches it off continues
into the bedroom

in the bedroom the overhead light is on and dr dreyfuss
is working on the unconscious fran he has removed her coat
and is shining a flashlight into her eyes examining her
pupils bud approaches the bed worriedly

                         bud

stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end then he starts
to lift fran off the bed

                         dr dreyfuss
            help me will you

            if it isnt too late you better
            put some coffee on  and pray

bud starts away as dr dreyfuss takes fran into the bathroom

bud loses no time getting into the kitchen he fills an
aluminum kettle with water strikes a match lights the gas
burner puts the kettle on then he takes a jar of instant
coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard shakes
an excessive portion of coffee into the mug sticks a spoon
in it he watches the kettle for a moment mops his brow
with a handkerchief then starts back toward the bedroom

bud crosses the bedroom to the halfopen door of the
bathroom looks in anxiously from inside come the sounds of
a coughing spasm and running water bud turns away undoes
his tie and collar paces the bedroom floor something on
the night table attracts his attention  resting against
the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope bud picks it
up  on it in frans handwriting is one word jeff he
turns the letter over in his hand trying to decide what to
do with it

dr dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom carrying a pale
still unconscious fran bud quickly conceals the suicide
note behind his back

                         dr dreyfuss
            bring my bag

he lugs fran into the living room bud stashes the letter in
his back pocket picks up the medical bag follows them

in the living room dr dreyfuss lowers fran into a chair
her chin falls to her chest dreyfuss takes the bag from
bud fishes out a hypodermic syringe draws 2 ccs from a
bottle of picrotoxin

                         dr dreyfuss
            roll up her right sleeve

            yourself up another dame

                         bud

bud just stands there taking it fran stirs slightly and
from her parched lips comes a low moan dr dreyfuss grabs
her by the hair lifts her head up

                         dr dreyfuss
            if youd come home half an hour
            later you would have had quite a

with his free hand dr dreyfuss slaps fran viciously across
the face bud winces dreyfuss still holding fran by the
hair takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag he
crushes one of the ampules in his hand passes it under her
nose fran tries to turn her head away dreyfuss slaps her
again hard crushes another ampule repeats the process

of the boiling kettle but bud pays no attention

he forces her to swallow some coffee

                         fran
                   pushing the mug away

            of hours

they lift her from the chair and each draping one of her
arms over his shoulder they start to walk her up and down
the room

                         dr dreyfuss
                   urging fran on

but gradually as dr dreyfuss voice continues droning
hypnotically she falls into the rhythm of it repeating the
words after him and putting her weight on her feet

                                            dissolve to

int the apartment  dawn

through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of
dawn fran has been put to bed by an exhausted dr dreyfuss
she is in her slip and dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket
over her her eyes are closed and she is moaning fitfully
watching from the doorway is bud in shirtsleeves now weary
and disheveled

                         dr dreyfuss
            shell sleep on and off for the
            next twentyfour hours of course
            shell have a dandy hangover when
            she wakes up 

                         bud
            just as long as shes okay

                         dr dreyfuss
                   massaging his calves
            these cases are harder on the
            doctor than on the patient i ought
            to charge you by the mile

they have now moved out into the living room where the
overhead light and the christmas tree bulbs are still on

                         dr dreyfuss
            any of that coffee left

                         bud

he goes into the kitchen dr dreyfuss takes a small notebook
with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag sinks down
on the couch

                         dr dreyfuss
            how do you spell her last name

            where does she live

a cup of hot water

                         bud

            she didnt mean it doc  it was
            an accident  she had a little too
            much to drink and  she didnt

                         dr dreyfuss

coffee

                         dr dreyfuss
                   taking a big gulp of
                   the spiked coffee

he walks out closing the door after him bud dejectedly
turns off the overhead light kicks out the plug of the
christmas tree lights trudges into the bedroom

drapes the dress over it hangs it from the door an early
morning chill has invaded the room and bud switches an the
electric blanket to keep fran warm then he slumps into a
chair beside the bed looks at fran compassionately the
light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the
grayish room bud just sits there watching fran

                                            fade out

fade in

int staircase  brownstone house  day

mrs lieberman followed by her dog is climbing the stairs
to buds apartment puffing asthmatically she seems quite
angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell there

like a man who has slept in his clothes  rumpled bleary
eyed unshaven

into the apartment

int the apartment  day

inside fran is asleep under the electric blanket breathing
evenly he tries to shut the bedroom door but it wont
close completely because frans dress on a hanger is
hooked over the top he goes to the phone picks it up
dials the operator

manufacturers tag still dangling from it and the boys are
in pajamas and astronauts helmets as for the cape canaveral
set it is a miniature layout of blockhouses launching
pads and assorted spacemissiles tommy has his finger on

where she is she sits up in bed winces holds her head in
her hands  she has a fierce hangover

in the bedroom fran becoming aware of buds voice crawls
out of bed and holding on to the furniture moves unsteadily
toward the living room door

                   into phone

int the apartment  evening

buddyboy is bending over a hot stove preparing an italian
dinner he takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire and
picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand pours the
spaghetti on top of the racquet strings then he turns on
the faucet runs water over the spaghetti with the combined
technique of brillatsavarin and pancho gonzales he gently
agitates the racquet letting the water drain off the
spaghetti as he works he hums a theme from tschaikowskys
capriccio italien

fran walks in still in her robe

                         fran

as fran starts into the living room bud begins to ladle
meat sauce onto the spaghetti humming operatically

in the living room the small table has been set for two
and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that mr kirkeby
left behind still in its cardboard bucket but freshly iced
as fran lights the candles she notices the napkins on the
table peels a pricetag off the corner of one of them

                         bud

he carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in from
the kitchen sets it on the table sprinkles some cheese on
it then he crosses to the coffee table where a full
martini pitcher stands in readiness fills a couple of
glasses fran seats herself at the table

the door bell rings carrying his martini glass bud crosses
to the door starts to open it

                         bud
            because i dont want to take
            advantage of you  the way i did
            yesterday in bed

by now the door is open and bud is speaking to fran over
his shoulder he turns finds himself face to face with karl
matuschka who is standing grimly in the doorway

                         matuschka
            baxter

                         bud

she exits into the bedroom removing her dress from the
door and closing it matuschka leans against the wall
beside the hall door eyeing bud truculently bud raises a
finger to remonstrate with him  then breaks into a nervous
ingratiating smile

                         bud
            care for a martini champagne
                   matuschka continues

            how about a little spaghetti with
            meat sauce made it myself
                   matuschka just scowls

dreyfuss sticks his head in

            know her better i think shes the
            kind of girl that definitely ought
            to be married to somebody 

                         sheldrake

he removes his dark glasses reflectively

                         sheldrake
            thats just one of the privileges
            that goes with this job you also
            get a nice little expense account
            the use of the executive washroom 
                   breaks off peers at
                   buds face
            say what happened to you baxter

            oh

with a shrug he exits into his own office closing the door
behind him bud sits there unconsciously bending the
glasses in his hand until they suddenly snap in two bud
glances down at the two broken halves as though surprised
by his own violence tosses them on the desk

            i dont know i guess thats the
            way it crumbles  cookiewise

                         sheldrake
            what are you talking about

                         fran
            id spell it out for you  only i
            cant spell

the piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised
left arm he drops the arm in a signal and the lights go
out at the same time he strikes up auld lang syne

all over the dimly lit room couples get to their feet
embracing and joining in the song

in the last booth sheldrake leans across the table kisses
fran

                         sheldrake
            happy new year fran

frans expression is preoccupied sheldrake faces in the
direction of the pianist and holding his glass aloft sings
along with the others

as auld lang syne comes to an end the place explodes
noisily  there is a din of horns ratchets and shouted
greetings the lights come up again

in the last booth sheldrake turns back toward fran  but
she is no longer there her paper hat lies abandoned on her
vacated chair

                         sheldrake
            fran 
                   looking around
             where are you fran

he rises cranes his neck trying to spot her in the crowd

                                            dissolve to

ext brownstone house  night

fran a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the
rickshaw comes down the street almost at a run there is a
happy expectant look on her face she hurries up the steps
of the house and through the front door

int staircase and second floor landing  night

fran mounts the stairs eagerly as she reaches the landing
and heads for buds apartment there is a loud sharp report
from inside

fran freezes momentarily then rushes to the door

                         fran
            mr baxter
                   pounding on door
            mr baxter mr baxter

the door opens and there stands bud the bottle of champagne
he has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand he
stares at fran unbelievingly

                         fran
                   sagging with relief
            are you all right

                         bud

                         bud
                   still stunned
            of course not

int the apartment  night

fran comes in and bud shuts the door the room is the same
as we left it except for an empty champagne glass standing
on the coffee table

                         bud
            let me get another glass

he goes to one of the cartons takes out a champagne glass
wrapped in newspaper starts to unwrap it

                         fran
                   looking around
            where are you going

                         bud
                   indicating carton
            in there

fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out
of the carton settles herself on the couch starts to
shuffle the cards expertly

                         bud
            what about mr sheldrake

                         fran

bud sinks down happily on the couch and fran holds out the
deck to him

                         fran
            cut

bud cuts a card but doesnt look at it

                         bud

                         fran
                   cutting a card
            seven 
                   looking at buds card

                         fran
                   smiling
            shut up and deal

bud begins to deal never taking his eyes off her fran
removes her coat starts picking up her cards and arranging
them bud a look of pure joy on his face deals  and
deals  and keeps dealing

and thats about it storywise
