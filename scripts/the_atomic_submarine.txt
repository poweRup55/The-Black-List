                  the huge heavy vessel glides smoothly along between

                            here great passenger and cargo
                            carrying atomic submarines glided
                            by the dozens back and forth
                            across the pole until a series
                            of mysterious undersea disasters
                            threatened to close the arctic
                            route forever


            5     special effect shot  close shot  sturgeon

                  as it glides very close past camera so we can read
                  the name  usas sturgeon united states atom sub
                  sturgeon on the bow  we may spot the closedcircuit

                                        narrator
                            the decisive moment came may 3 at
                            1315 hours when the undersea
                            atomic liner sturgeon largest of
                            them all reached 87 degrees 10
                            minutes north latitude  only a
                            few miles from the north pole it
                            self


            6     special effect shot  underwater ice cave  day

                  in the depths of it appears a distant faint ball of
                  glowing light  the ball begins moving toward camera
                  slowly becoming larger and larger  there may be a
                  faint weird electrical hum just audible from it


            7     special effect shot  cargo sub sturgeon

                  it moves ahead unconscious of impending doom the peep
                  peep of its sonar impulses now gradually increasing in
                  pitch doppler effect as they echo back from the
                  approaching blob of light


            8     special effect shot  the saucer  day

                  dimly seen a vague indistinct shape thruthis sequence
                   it approaches  a huge ovalshaped disc with what
                  seems to be a revolving turret or lighthouse on top
                  the peeppeep of the sturgeon sonar has now risen to a
                  frantic scream and the magnetic lowfrequency hum from
                  the saucer becomes louder and louder

    

                                                                      3


            9     special effect shot  pan shot with sturgeon

                  the great atom sub glides past camera but now as we
                  are shooting from her stern over the bow we see the
                  screws halt then go into reverse and she begins to
                  back away back toward camera  then in the bg we
                  see the saucer the great eerie eye or whatever it
                  is looming like a searchlight on her top and the
                  oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy
                  the saucer is easily overtaking the reversed sturgeon
                  when


            10    special effect shot  the saucer

                  it moves to a position nearly filling screen when

                  a great bolt of sheer highfrequency energy  like an
                  undersea lightning bolt  stabs out from somewhere in
                  the saucer and lances out toward camera


            11    special effect shot  the saucer and sturgeon

                  the great stabbing bolt of energy impinges on the hull
                  of the sturgeon and for an instant the entire sub
                  seems to glow with radiant light  then in closer de
                  tails we see the effects


            12    special effect shot  bow of sturgeon

                  it seems to melt away or collapse like a shell of
                  paraffin over a fire  the water boils and hisses
                  about it


            13    special effect shot  conning tower

                  the radio antenna the periscope the mast the tower
                  itself  all seem to melt and collapse


            14    special effect shot  the sturgeon

                  what is left of the sturgeon glowing and hissing
                  still red hot begins rising to the surface towards
                  the icelayer


            15    special effect shot  the saucer

                  it reverses draws back into the icecave from which
