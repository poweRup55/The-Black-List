     a world war ii era personnel carrier transports twenty silent
     lapd officers into the heart of downtown los angeles the
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival

     we focus in on bucky bleichert 26 the counterpuncher from

     pound truncheon

     buckys pov

     hundreds of inuniform gis use baseball bats and twoby
     fours to beat the shit out of zoot suitwearing mexicans

     most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of mps and shore patrol whove chosen
     to restore order by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters

     sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows darkness falls
     quickly on what bucky rightly realizes ischaos

     suddenly buckys running

     away from the action

     down a side street and onto a

     quiet residential block

     he slows to a jog trying to gather his thoughts and then a
     voice

               bleichertbleichertext a bungalow courtyard  same

     a police officer has three marines in dress blues and one
     zoot suiter cornered in a center walkway

     the marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their twoby
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet
     dodging the blows like the exfighter he is

                          voice over

               formerly a regular attraction at the
               hollywood legion stadium

     the terrified mexican stands frozen on one side of blanchard
     trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
     marines blows with his own truncheon

               code three bleichert

     bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in
     fending off the marines blows to jab at them with his stick

                          voice over
               and he knew me bucky bleichert light

     on instinct bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
     marines with his fists connecting hard punches with soft
     midsections

     and now blanchard moves in lashing vicious truncheon blows
     to the shoulders of the marines sending them one by one into
     a heap

     bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket
     behind him lee is busy turning the dead mens pockets inside

     bucky walks back to the bathroom drawn there by the sound of
     the drumming water the bathroom door is open an invitation

     he stops at the threshold of the bathroom his pov

     kay stands in the shower curtain open for buckys benefit
     she faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness

     her attitude is not one of seduction however her expression
     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet she pirouettes
     for him showing

     a series of old knife scars crisscrossing her back from
     thigh to spine

               heres what she wasnt she wasnt raped
               she wasnt pregnant dried semen
               indicates voluntary intercourse within
               the last weekshe took what id call a
               gentle whipping in the last ten daysin
               terms of the nittygrittyshe was
               probably tortured with a knife for thirty
               six to fortyeight hours before death
               the cause of which is either the mouth
               wound or more likely she was beaten to
               death with something like a baseball bat

                          lee
               what about her insides

                          coroner
               they came out after death then id say
               he drained the blood from the body and
               washed it clean probably in a bathtub

                          lee
               did the guy know anything about medicine
               or anatomy

                          coroner
               maybe probably not a surgeon typebut
               that doesnt rule out veterinary
               training biological training or my

               said the father of her child would be a
               combat veteran

               ive told it how many ways how many more
               ways do you went to hear it

     millard straightens up and turns to the oneway mirror he
     tugs at the knot of his tie soon after he slips out of the
     room and harry sears slips in

     bucky turns to lee

                          bucky

                   re the interrogation
               now youll see why russ keeps harry
               around

     int the interrogation room  same

     harry circles red manley lightly tapping a metalstudded sap
     in his hand

                          lee
                   re the sap
               russs only rule no actual hitting

     back inside the interrogation room  same

     harry leans close to red tapping the sap on the table his
     stutter completely gone

                          harry sears
               you wanted some fresh gash and you
               thought betty was easy you came on
               strong and that didnt work you offered
               her money she told you she was on the
               rag and that was the final straw you
               wanted to make her bleed for real

                          red manley
               no no no not betty

     harry smashes the sap onto a glass ashtray shattering it
     red bites down on his lip cutting it

                          harry sears
               you plied betty with drinks got her to
               talk about her old boyfriends and came on
               like a pal like the nice little corporal
               willing to leave betty to the real men
               the men who saw combat

                          red manley
               no

     harry smashes the table again

                          harry sears
               you took her to a toolshed maybe one of
               those abandoned warehouses out by the old
               ford plant in picorivera there was some
               twine and lots of cutting tools lying
               around and you got a hardon

                          red manley
               no no no

     again harry smashes the table red almost topples his chair
     backwards out of fear only harrys hand an the back slats
     keeping it from going over

                          harry sears

               played your trombone in the army band

                          red manley

                          harry sears
               tell god

     harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls
     the whole thing over onto its side

     red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees he clasps his
     hands together

                          red manley
               the lord is my shepherd i shall not
               want

     he begins to weep completely broken

     harry turns to the one way mirror looking straight out at
     his audience selfloathing etched into his flabby
     juicehound face

     he gives the thumbsdown sign and walks out of the room

     outside in the hallway

     russ millard meets him at the door and leads him away from
     the general crowd of officers

     back in the interrogation room

     bucky watches as lee and another officer handcuff red and
     take him outside lee has his hand on reds shoulder like a
     kindly uncle

     outside the station

     bucky stands on the steps taking fresh air russ steps out

                          russ millard

               project he was putting uphollywoodland
               underneath that godawful sign

               i always loved the keystone kops

                          emmett sprague
               old mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
               dry he did he had extras moonlighting
               as laborers and vice versa i used to
               drive em over to hollywoodland after
               twelve hours on a keystone cops flicker
               and put in another six hours by
               torchlight even gave me as assistant
               director credit a couple times so
               grateful he was for the way i squeezed
               his slaves

     the table to see ramona trying to corral a potato with her
     fork the source of the sound

               use his influence with the city zoning
               board to have a street named after me
               but all he could manage was a deadend
               block in a red light district in lincoln
               heights are you familiar with the
               neighborhood mr bleichert

               what kept me up that night wasnt the
               idea of fritz vogel extorting criminals
               or fritz vogel bracing charlie the pimp
               to see if betty had told him something

     ext the backroads of ensenada  night

     dolphine drives his car while bucky trains his gun on him

     they come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
     overlooking the ocean a huge wooden burning cross marks the
     spot

                          dolphine
               the locals keep the damn thing lit up
               they got a lotta missing relatives

                          bucky
               good enough

     ext the bluff  later

     bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence wraps it in a
     rag and lights a torch off of the cross dolphine kicks at a
     filthy american flag in the sand

                          dolphine
               here supposed to be nearel bannerocut to

     a small shovel pushing into the ground

     bucky breathes out hard unbearable dolphine digs on
     pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
     sand

     bucky cant stand the suspense he tucks his gun into his
     waistband and grabs the shovel after a few more strokes the
     thump of something solid

     and suddenly its theresunburned pink skin blond hair and
     stitch scars on the eyebrows

     lee blanchard lee blanchard lee blanchard

     and buckys in dolphines truck while dolphines screaming
     for him to wait and bucky slams the truck in reverse
     knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
     of the sand onto the road heading north and leaving dolphine
     and lee alone at the graveheading north like a refugee

     ext kays house  dawn

     buckys car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine trying
     not to make any noise

     the sun comes up illuminating buckys filthy face as he
     watches the pictureperfect house wishing time would stand
     still or better yet wishing it would go back

     finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
     the house

                                                       dissolve to

     a lapd chaplain reading solemnly from a bible

     but as the camera pulls back we see bucky in his dress blues
     standing next to kay in a wedding dress

     ext the backyard of kays house

     russ millard and harry sears stand by as the only two guests

                          voice over
               lee and kay had lived in sin not because
               their shack job was against department
               regs but because the ghosts of their
               past had forced them to choose between
               love and passion the veneer of a fairy
               tale only a bandaid for a fractured
               life

                                                       dissolve to

     lee and kay dancing together

     as harry and russ drink from a punch bowl

                          voice over
               our true vows were made in private bury

                          detective
               bleichert you got those prints for me

     bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him the
     nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine

                          detective contd
               thanks we gotta hot one i think

     bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk the radio

     bucky steps over the police rope and into the study a large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to a tape
     outline of a body three feet away lies a shotgun

     behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings

                                                            cut to

     a series of shots

     as bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls scrapes
     tissue from the muzzle of the gun dusts it for latent
     prints etc at the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag

     int the hallway  continuous

     as bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards

     boy done up in court jesters garb his body is gnarled and 
     hunched he wears a stuporous eartoear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar

     it is eerily reminiscent of elizabeth shorts death wound

               for the first time since the beginning of
               the whole fiasco i stopped trying to
               figure out who killed elizabeth short
               instead i focused onwhere

     ext a wooded area  night

     bucky and russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper like
     two men consulting a treasure map in the woods

     in the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
     out and the door hanging off its hinges

                          voice over
               and if my hunch was right we wouldnt
               have to look any further than one of
               emmett spragues condemned bungalows one
               that was isolatedabandoned

     they walk on leaving this particular bungalow behind

     ext a stream  woods  later

     bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
     deeper into the night

                          voice over
               and most importantly close to a water
               sourcewhere one could drain a body of
               its blood

     bucky and russ round a bend in the stream and see

     the skeleton of a bungalow

     teetering on the edge of the stream empty window and doors
     hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
     leer

     bucky and russ feel it tensing up as they approach they
     pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
     step into the abandoned house

     int the bungalow  same

     a scattering of trash in the front room animal shit a
     bicycle tire rags

     they move through the house each roam each closet and
     corner creeps with potential violence still nothing

     step inside

     int the gardening shed  continuous

     they know something bad happened here

               case would always be open
               and so while it killed me to wait til

     cocks his head at her as if to say the next one will be
     closer

                          emmett sprague

                          voice over
               maybe hed have gone for a gun or

               filling him with blackness like the
               sawdust in spragues goddamn dog beat

     bucky kicks the tin door shut sealing the fire inside
     elizabeth shorts private hell

     int jane chambers house  another day

     bucky and jane chambers drink some iced tea

                          jane chambers

               my dog and those sure as hell arent my
               shoes

     he gets up from the table

     int jane chambers house  continuous

     bucky wanders over and stares at the slashmouthed clown
     painting always transfixed by it

                          jane chambers
                   re the painting
               id been thinking about giving it to
               charity but its too valuable i found
               eldridges receipt

     she wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from
     her late husbands desk while bucky continues to stare at the
     clown she returns reading from the sale slip

                          jane chambers contd
               its a frederick yannantuono original

     back to scene

     as the slashmouthed clown towers over bucky his head
     buzzing

                          jane chambers contd

               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester

     find it unlocked he goes inside

     a red wave of sweat washes over him he walks carefully into

     ramonas sitting room

     where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa her arms lost in a
     silk dressing gown her face puffy and her eyes dark her
     gray hair frizzy

     bucky trains a gun on her

     the folds of her dressing gown she holds a tiny ladylike
     revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet when she
     speaks its with complete control

                          ramona

               know madeleine was eleven and she looked

               for george

                          ramona
               for being richer than he was

     buckys not sure what to say next she fills the space quite
     well

                          ramona contd
               honestly though sometimes i thought
               martha was going to bring the whole
               family down around her by chance her
               little stunt about tipping the police to
               lavernes

                          bucky

               worse than mine maybe the cruel joke is
               on you

     she speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him
     and on buckys hungry eyes we
