               with a carriage coming toward the cameraext edinburgh street  late afternoonfull spot  down the lonely almost deserted street comes a
               cab drawn by a bony white horse  this black and sepulchral
               vehicle passes through the long shadows and sharp gleams of
               the late afternoon sun  on the box bunched over almost
               lost in the folds of his triplecaped overcoat and with a
               battered beaver on his hand is the cabman  the horse plods
               along his hoof beats echoing with a hollow sound in the
               narrow street  at the corner the vehicle turns leftext greyfriars churchyard  late afternoonthe black cab drawn by the white horse goes slowly past a
               little cemetery  the driver turns his head and looks down as
               he goes past

               from his angle but not a moving shot a pleasant little
               graveyard with mossy gravestones old turf making a spot of
               green between the gray walls of the kirk and the blank stone
               wall of a large building

               seated on a table stone is young donald fettes a poor
               medical student dressed in worn neat clothing with only a
               woolen scarf about his neck for warmth  he sits in such
               scanty sunlight as he can find munching on a cold bannock
               and washing it down with thin ale from a round stone bottle

               med close shot  fettes  in the closer view it can be seen
               that he is looking at a small cairn terrier who lies morosely
               guarding a newlymade grave  the dog with his head down
               between his forepaws occasionally glances over
               apprehensively at the young student  fettes takes a bit of
               his bannock between his thumb and forefinger and leans
               forward toward the dog

                                   fettes
                         here  heres a bit of something
                         for you

               the dog does not stir  fettes leans further forward almost
               putting the morsel of food to the dogs nose  the dog growls
               savagely  fettes draws back

                                   fettes contd
                         now now laddie  i only wanted
                         to be friendly

               it is at this moment that a shadow falls athwart him and
               looms up in the afternoon sunlight against the wall behind
               him  he looks up

               another angle  fettes looking over as mrs macbride a
               plump motherly woman of middleage with a tartan shawl over
               her head and carrying a pannikin of water and a bone with
               some meat on it comes through the gate  she crosses over to
               the little dog puts the water before him and starts
               shredding little pieces of meat from the bone to feed him 
               the dog laps avidly at the water then gratefully takes the
               morsels of meat she gives him

               walks at his heels  he stops at a wooden charlie the

               posters  the boys crowd around to watch  one of them backs
               up to a little trundle cart and surreptitiously filches a
               piece of the shortbread being sold from this portable store 
               at the other side of the charlie stands a street singer a
               beautiful girl of about nineteen dressed in ragged highland
               plaid  she is singing an old border ballad about two crows
               who sit waiting to pick the dead eyes out of a fallen knight 
               a shepherd crook in hand and faithfully attended by two
               handsome collies stops a moment to hear her song drops some
               coppers into the begging bowl she holds in her hands then
               passes on

               through the consonance of the street singers song comes the
               dissonant beat of a horses hoofs the racking clatter of
               ironshod wheels and then between the singer and the camera
               there passes very close the white horse and the black cab 
               as it blocks her out of the scene

               middle years with keen darting eyes set in a face lined and
               furrowed by an evil life  the quick play of his features as
               he talks or smiles can form a moving and deceptive mask  so
               that now as he opens the door smiling to help his
               passengers alight his face is cringing with good humor and
               servility

                         born paralyzed

               the little girl shrinks from him at the bluntness of this

                         to be months apart  but theyve
                         been growing more frequent

               fettes closes the door behind him and stands rather shyly

                         way 
                             looking up at fettes

               talking together while in the other room fettes puts the

                         three years

                             tapping the letter in his
                              hand
                         it seems that dr maximillian is
                         right  the violence of the
                         accident must have disturbed the
                         tissues and caused a traumatic
                         tumor  a sort of growth that
                         presses against the nerve centers

                                   mrs marsh
                         but can anything be done for her

                                   macfarlane
                         perhaps  a delicate operation 
                         an operation which has never been
                         performed  but it could be
                         performed  im sure it could be 
                         i could incise the columna dorsi 

               he is quite excited as he speaks almost as if challenging
               himself  mrs  marshs interruption is illtimed  it stops
               him in full tide of selfpersuasion

                                   mrs marsh
                             eagerly
                         and you will try  you will

                         believe me madame if i were only
                         a doctor i would undertake this

                         responsibility of training thirty

                         every sympathy for you and for the

               empty look  everything is meticulously clean

               doctor and student  it is evident he is listening to every
               word they say

                         you are trying to spy on me

               he takes fettes arm again and leads him off toward the other
               end of the anatomy room  the two medicals go out of earshot

               leading to the alcove  macfarlane with his hand on the
               elbow of the younger man guides him to the curtain

                         theyre the bodies of paupers 

               the camera begins to dolly slowly toward them

                                   macfarlane
                         thats what the law stipulates but
                         there are not enough of them
                         fettes  there are not enough of
                         them 

               macfarlane pulls aside the curtain  he and fettes pass
               through and the curtain falls into place behind them  the
               camera continues to truck slowly toward the curtain

               grave  he lies with his muzzle on his forepaws but his eyes
               are open and alert  out of the scene comes the plodding beat
               of a horses hoofs and the rumbling of ironshod wheels  the
               dog lifts his head

               the horse comes to a stop  there is the creak of springs as
               someone alights  the dogs hackles rise  he growls

               another angle  the great black shadow of a man in a caped
               overcoat and top hat with a spade over his shoulder is thrown
               onto the wall of greyfriars kirk by the street lamp  the
               huge shadow looms high over the tiny dog  robbie rises
               valiantly to his feet snarling  as he does so the actual
               figure of the man as black and indistinct as his own shadow
               comes past the camera blacking out the little dog  there is
               a deeper growl from robbie  the man swings his spade down 
               as the spade drives home there is a little weak sound from
               the dog

               another angle  with his foot gray pushes the dead body of
               the little dog to one side strikes the spade into the ground

               the hoofbeats the wheels and then silence when the horse
               comes to a stop  he sits up  from downstairs comes a
               stealthy knocking at the door  he gets up sleepily and

               nightlight  this casts its dim rays over a small portion of
               the room near the entrance door  fettes comes through the
               door on the landing  he peers over the bannisters and then
               somewhat slowly as if not too easy at the prospect before
               him he begins to descend the stairs

               another angle  fettes crosses the anatomy room looking
               apprehensively into the darkness at either end  at the door

               the entry and is lost to viewint entryway  nightit is so dark that fettes can barely be seen  the clank of
               the chain as he throws it off and the snap of the bolt are
               loud and frightening in this small enclosed space  he pulls
               the door open  before him silhouetted against the dim
               radiance of the cab lamps is gray  in his arms is a long

               fettes helps him  gingerly he takes hold of the corpse and
               together they lay it down on a long marbletopped table in
               the center of the room almost directly under the nightlight 
               gray heaves a sigh of relief to be relieved of the weight

                         and ive always gotten along with

                         understood my humble position

               he puts one hand on fettes arm  fettes moves away from him

                         dr macfarlane said i should pay

                             interrupting
                         of course  its the soul of the
                         business  the pay 

               fettes shifts uneasily confused and seemingly uncertain of
               his next step

                             prompting him
                         i have no doubt you have the key in
                         your pocket 

               fettes reaches into his pocket and brings out a big iron key

                             pointing
                         and there is the box

               they start over toward it  fettes opens the box

                         my fee is as usual  ten pounds

               fettes counts out the money to him  gray flips the last coin
               into the air and catches it with a gamin gesture which is
               surprising in a man of such sinister appearance  as fettes
               still stands rather stupidly gray prompts him again

                                   gray contd
                         and now although its none of my

                         in the drawer

               fettes brings it out  gray watches him while he writes  the
               pen scratches and squeaks over the paper  then both turn and
               start toward the entry

                                   fettes
                         good night mr gray

               as the door gray tips his hat elegantly to fettes

                         profitable meetings

               he leaves disappearing in the darkness of the entryway  a
               second later the door can be heard closing behind him 
               fettes stands for a long moment looking at the dark entry
               then from behind him comes a chuckle of laughter  he whirls
               abruptly

               another angle  fettes in the bg and above him on the
               landing holding a candle is dr macfarlane in an elegant
               dressing gown

                         your medical career

               comes a clamor of mens voices cutting across which
               suddenly comes fettes voice

               he turns toward the skeleton then reacts sharply as he
               notices its ludicrous stance

               he starts rearranging the skeletons limbs  richardson

               he starts for the stairs  there is a snicker of laughter

               arms of the skeleton back into fighting positionint macfarlane hallway  daymrs marsh sits there  broad beams of sunlight flood in from

               fettes bows formally  it is obvious he is pleased yet very
               puzzled to see her  he comes down and takes her hand

                         more than one hundred seventyfive
                         pounds of pressure  double that
                         and you get the full strength of

                         food and bite our enemies

               the students laugh that peculiar laugh common to students
               and soldiers when a superior makes a joke  it is at this
               moment that fettes starts down the stairs  macfarlane looks
               up

               macfarlane studies him for a moment  he then gets up from
               the stool and puts his hand on the boys shoulder

                                   macfarlane
                         fettes i was an assistant once  i

                         ignorant men have dammed up the

                         but her son might be alive today

               hint of fog in the air  it is the dinner hour and the street
               is fairly well peopled  on one corner by the light of a
               flaring torch a pamphleteer is selling his wares  on the
               other corner the street singer stands chanting her ballad

               boy who sings as he turns  song to be supplied  on the
               spit is a young porker with forelegs and hind legs stretched
               to elongate him before the fire  the porker has just
               recently been put on the spit so that he gleams pale white in

               and cape to the attendant and strides forward toward the
               fireplace  he extends his hands and looks at the slowly
               turning porker

               from behind them comes an insinuating voice

                                   grays voice
                         a fine specimen isnt he toddy

               they both twist around quickly

               reverse shot  on the opposite side of the room where he has
               hidden from them by the high walls of the divan a sort of
               inglenook built away from the fireplace is gray  this is

                         too  but come toddy sit down here
                         with your young friend

               fettes looks in surprise from the doctor to the cabman
               utterly confused at the familiarity of this mans address

                                   macfarlane
                             coldly

                         matters to discuss

                         medicine  thatll keep  sit down

               as macfarlane hesitates angry and most anxious to refuse
               gray lowers his tone to a sly confidential murmur

                                   gray contd
                         you wouldnt want it said of you
                         that you refused a glass to an old
                         friend

               macfarlane shrugs

                                   macfarlane
                         well buy you a glass gray

               he motions to fettes to sit down  fettes takes a seat and
               macfarlane sits down beside him  as fettes sits down beside
               him gray turns to him in a confidential manner

                                   gray
                         im a pretty bad fellow myself but

                         macfarlane 

               he chuckles shaking his head as if in appreciation of the
               most sinister sort of villainy  macfarlane is angry  fettes
               is confused and unable to orient himself in this strange
               relationship between the great anatomist and the lowly
               cabman  gray turns to macfarlane

                                   gray contd
                         come toddy order for your friend

               macfarlane lifts his hand to beckon to the waiter

                         no on second thought let me
                         order
                             as the waiter comes up
                         well have a bowl of hot punch and
                         a cut off the loin from that fine
                         porker

               the waiter looks at gray dubiously unused to such a
               sumptuous order from so humble a customer

                                   gray contd
                             catching the look

                         with the commonality

               the waiter nods looks from macfarlanes tense and angry face
               to grays grinning countenance turns and makes off to the
               kitchen  for a moment the three men sit silently macfarlane
               encircled in the iron ring of his anger
               fettes tonguetied and abashed and gray gloating over the
               doctors discomfiture  finally gray breaks the silence

                                   gray contd
                             to macfarlane

                         medical matters  dont let my
                         humble presence stop you  speak
                         up toddy

               macfarlane goaded beyond the point of endurance pounds his
               fist on the table

                                   macfarlane
                         i will not have you use that name
                         to me

                                   gray
                         you will not have it

               the two men glare at each other then very slowly macfarlane
               averts his gaze  fettes looks from one to the other and then
               trying to cover the defeat of his teacher begins to speak

                                   fettes
                         dr macfarlane  you remember the
                         lady who came to see you yesterday 
                         the lady with the little girl

                                   macfarlane
                         i remember her

                                   fettes
                         she came again today  she wanted
                         me to ask you if you would not
                         break your rule and operate  she
                         feels you are her only hope

                                   macfarlane
                         so she told me  im a teacher 
                         not a practitioner

               macfarlane shrugs as if this aspect of the conversation were
               closed  gray looks over at him quizzically

                                   gray
                         youre a teacher eh  maybe youre
                         afraid to be a doctor toddy

                                   macfarlane
                         afraid of what

                                   gray
                         afraid you are not as good a doctor
                         perhaps as you make out to be

                         i am the best man for the job

               he picks up the table knife and puts it across his knuckles

               lawn of the ramparts  when they run past the little
               wheelchair in which georgina is seated the camera holds on
               georgina  she turns her head to watch the children run off 
               then she turns and looks the other way to where her mother
               and fettes are standing by the ramparts deep in
               conversation  the camera pans with her gaze  they are out
               of earshot of the child talking in low confidential tones

               back against the hobb  again he pushes it forward  again it
               rolls back  suddenly and with almost maniacal rage he
               lifts up the poker and brings it crashing down on the coal 
               the soft coal splinters into a hundred pieces  suddenly

                         spinal column and its intricacies
                         to insure success in such an
                         operation  i would have to study

               fettes dejected and disappointed nods and slowly leaves the

               open before him and with index finger moving from letter to
               letter he is laboriously but silently spelling out the
               words  suddenly he hears footsteps behind him on the stairs
               and quickly slams the book and begins dusting the desk

               full shot  the anatomy room from josephs angle  fettes is
               coming down the stairs and crosses toward him

                             in a last desperate

                         id gladly go

               but fettes has already passed into the entry way

                                                       dissolve outext dark alleyway  nightit is a crooked narrow alley  the only light comes from the
               ends  fettes can begin to hear the ballad of the street
               singer from the street toward which he is going  he pauses a
               moment listens then walks forward into the darkness the
               song almost seeming to guide him through the dark alley

               he comes to the darkest portion of the alley  a sound from
               the left attracts his attention  he comes to an abrupt halt
               as something white and mysterious moves on a window sill at
               his eye level  he takes a half step backward as a white cat
               leaps down and scurries noiselessly across his path  fettes
               grins at his own fright and goes on  he passes through the
               darkness and comes out into the dim light of the other
               street  he comes to the street corner and on the corner
               stands the street singer  she is singing her little song and
               jingling a few coins in her begging bowl to attract the
               attention of the few people passing by in this dismal street 
               fettes goes up to her  she stops singing

                                   fettes
                         do you know where mr gray lives 
                         gray the cabman

               the girl shakes her head

                                   fettes contd
                         well thanks anyhow

               he takes a coin from his pocket and drops it into her bowl 
               he goes off and the camera moves in to a big closeup of the
               girl as she resumes her song

               long shot  fettes as he walks  this alley like the other
               grows darker toward the center  there is an arch leading to
               a court  fettes turns left under this archext grays dwelling and stable  nightit is a tiny narrow squalid building  he looks at it sees
               the name john gray  cabman written on a board across the
               door goes up to it and knocks  as there is no answer he
               pushes the door open and steps into almost stygian darknessint grays stable  nightfettes gropes his way along the wall toward the stairs 
               suddenly from the darkness looms a tremendous white figure 
               it is the cabmans horse  his first momentary fright over
               fettes pats the horses nose passes on to the stairs climbs
               the brief flight of steps leading to a door from under which
               comes a ray of light  again he knocks  a voice shouts out
               to him

                                   grays voice
                         come in  come in

               fettes thrusts open the door and looks around to see the room
               in which he finds himself  it is a large loftlike room
               furnished with odds and ends of poor furniture  the best
               pieces in the room are two dilapidated easy chairs that have
               obviously seen better days  on one wall some spare harness
               is hung  a great battered wardrobe contains grays clothes 
               the floor is covered with two worn turkey carpets  there is
               a bed on which the bedclothes are untidily tumbled  there is
               a washstand and pitcher  quite evidently gray uses this
               chamber as a combined living dining and bedroom as well as a
               kitchen  this last is the purpose to which it is being put
               as fettes enters  gray in shirt sleeves is crouched over
               the embers of the fire in the hearth stirring some sausages
               in a frying pan  the kettle steams busily on the hob  on a
               small table near the fire is a loaf of bread a jug of ale a
               wooden trencher a clasp knife and a fork  as fettes enters
               gray rises and goes to meet him with the frying pan still in
               his left hand

                                   gray
                         so its the young doctor come to
                         see me  im honored  honored 

               there is a curious almost triumphant undertone in his voice

                                   gray contd
                         here take this  it is the most
                         comfortable chair

               he guides fettes to a chair and fettes without removing his
               coat sits down

               with quick servile civility he crosses to the taboret gets a
               glass and bottle and brings it back with him  he pours a
               glass for fettes

               fettes takes a swallow

                                   gray contd
                         and to what do i owe this honor of
                         this visit  some business was it
                         of dr macfarlanes

                                   fettes
                         dr macfarlane didnt send me  i
                         came of my own accord

               he breaks off taking another swig from his glass

                                   fettes contd
                         what are the chances of your being
                         able to get us a subject

                                   gray
                             shaking his head
                         it would be difficult  very
                         difficult  there was a dog that
                         bothered me during the last job 
                         people seem so concerned about dogs
                          all in all it raised the very
                         mother and father of a row  im
                         told the kirkyards are to be
                         guarded
                             pausing
                         but i would not like to say that it
                         would be impossible to get a
                         subject

               a look of relief comes over fettes face  he picks up his
               glass and drinks again

                                   fettes
                             leaning forward
                         but how soon man  dr macfarlane
                         is engaged in some very urgent
                         research at present  he cant wait
                         very long

               again gray smiles

                                   gray
                         i fear he may have to

                                   fettes
                         but cant you give me any idea

                                   gray
                         how could i  i will do my best 
                         after all you see i am
                         financially interested

               the camera pulls back to a wider angle as fettes gets to his
               feet abruptly  where comes very faintly over the shot from
               somewhere outside the voice of the street singer singing
               the same melody

                                   gray contd
                         you may tell toddy that i will do
                         what i can when i can  as he
                         knows i will
                             sighing
                         but he must wait and see as the
                         children do

                                   fettes
                         if thats your answer  itll have
                         to do

               fettes turns abruptly away and goes quickly out of scene
               toward the door  gray sits for a moment reflecting then
               gets to his feet  the camera pans with him as he goes to the
               door and outext street  nightmed full shot  at the far side of the street fettes can
               be seen striding  at the nearer side approaching slowly is
               the street singerint grays stable  nightclose shot  gray  his head is turned in the direction of
               the voice  his hand comes up to his chin as he rubs at it
               reflectively obviously seized by an idea  he makes up his
               mind and turns into the stable

               med shot  it is dark  in the fg is the white horse  it
               turns as gray comes into scene and nuzzles him affectionately
               as he pats it

                                   gray
                         ah friend  theres bad news for
                         you boy  bad news  

               he pulls out a lump of sugar and gives it to the horse

                                   gray contd
                         we have to go out again friend

               he turns away into the darkness but is back in a moment
               bearing the horses collar  as he slips the collar over the
               animals head 

                                                       dissolveext street  nightit is a long deserted street  at the near end a lantern on a
               house wall casts a sphere of dim radiance  the camera is
               focused down the street which ends in stygian darkness  from
               behind the camera comes the street singer walking slowly
               singing and rattling her begging bowl  she walks on  just
               before her figure is lost in the darkness from behind the
               camera can be heard the clopclop of hoofs the creak of
               carriage springs and the rolling wheels of grays cab  as
               the singer disappears completely into the darkness the cab
               goes past the camera  it too disappears into the darkness 
               the camera holds  the sound of the carriage ceases  a
               moment later the song of the street singer comes to an
               abrupt choked end

               with his pencil still poised over the anatomical chart he
               pauses listening  from some distance away comes the sound
               of a horses hoofs and the banging of wheels  fettes rises
               and crosses to the window  he draws the curtains aside and

               he is still almost half asleep as he starts over toward the
               desk pulling the key from his pocket as he goes  as he does
               so his eyes light on the face of the corpse revealed on his
               side by the drooping canvas  he is startled takes two steps
               nearer and looks again

                          for auld lang syne

               gray turns very humbly and goes to the door then he turns

               macfarlane who has turned back to his desk whirls about
               but gray has already disappeared into the darkness of the
               entry way and from thence comes his loud crowing laughter 
               the doctors face clouds in anger  he turns back to his
               desk  the street door can be heard closingext macfarlanes close  daygray still laughing comes out on the sidewalk to find

                         he has his own idea of a joke 
                         perhaps his horse tickled him in
                         the ribs

                         blocks and those little blocks are
                         all held together so that it works

               macfarlane whirls around

                         like a gentleman in london

               macfarlane rises drunkenly to his feet there is a threat of
               physical violence in his manner

                                   gray
                             somewhat placatingly for
                              the first time not
                              completely master of the
                              situation
                         aye toddy there is something

                                   macfarlane
                         there is much in what i say gray
                         and if you have any regard for your
                         neck youll leave now and stay away

                         so ill bid you good night doctor
                         macfarlane

               gray picks up his hat and starts off out of scene macfarlane
               slumps back into his seat his hand reaches out for the
               whiskey bottle he starts to pour another drink

                                                       dissolveint grays stable  nightby the light of a single lantern gray is unharnessing his
               horse he leads it out from between the shafts and into its
               stall there is a furtive sound before him as the door to the
               street slowly moves open he wheels quickly as a slight
               hunched figure sidles through the door gray waits until the
               figure walks into the range of the lamp and is revealed as
               joseph then he speaks

                                   gray
                         ah  dr macfarlanes man  a
                         surprise visit but come in  come
                         in

               he steps aside and joseph slowly moves over toward the
               stairway looking around him

               med shot as gray leads joseph into the living quarters and
               looks curiously at joseph who returns the look with a sort
               of determined belligerence

                                   gray contd
                         youre welcome to my little

                         to  me  something very private

                                   joseph
                         yes

                                   gray
                         now that is very interesting 
                             with a gesture
                         take a chair joseph

               joseph seats himself and gray sits down opposite him  no
               sooner has he seated himself than the big white cat his pet
               comes and jumps upon his knee gray strokes it fondly

                                   joseph
                             looking around
                         can anyone hear what we say

                                   gray
                             indicating the cat
                         only brother

                                   joseph
                             bending toward him
                         i know that you kill people to sell
                         bodies 

               gray sits motionless except that the hand which rests upon
               the arm of his chair slowly tenses and that other hand which
               strokes the cat stops at the cats head  for a long moment
               he is silent then he speaks very softly

                                   gray
                         you say youve come here on your
                         own account  no one knows you are
                         here

                                   joseph
                         give me money or ill tell the
                         police you murder the subjects 

               again there is a silence as gray studies him  by now grays
               right hand relaxes  his left hand begins to stroke the cat 
               finally he smiles

                                   gray
                         well you shall have money joseph 
                         why should you not

               still smiling he very carefully takes the cat from his lap
               sits it on the floor and rises  joseph follows him with his
               eyes

                                   gray contd
                             crossing to the taboret
                              for a bottle and two
                              glasses
                         i dont suppose the great dr
                         macfarlane is too free with his
                         pay is he

               he has come back with the bottle and filled a glass with
               brandy for each he passes a glass into josephs hands

                                   gray contd
                         here  have some of this

               they both drink immediately gray refills josephs glass

                                   gray contd
                             as he pours
                         you want money and you shall have
                         it

               he pulls a purse from his pocket and begins to count out
               notes and coins

                                   gray contd
                         let me see  five and five  then
                         in gold  six all together shall
                         we say sixteen pounds joseph

               joseph with the glass still at his lips nods his head gray
               looks about as if seeking a point of vantage then carefully
               sets himself in a straightbacked chair facing and a little
               to the side of josephs chair joseph is in a lowcushioned
               chair gray being above him almost seems to hover over him
               gray leans forward to give him the money

                                   joseph
                         i have made you give me money but

                         doctors

               this time gray fills josephs glass and drabbles a few drops
               into his own but doesnt bother to pick it up

                                   gray contd
                         drink up man

               the liquor has begun to affect joseph he takes the third
               glass eagerly and drains it while gray watches him in
               silence as he puts the glass down gray begins to speak

                                   gray contd
                         i have an idea  a splendid idea 
                         such an excellent idea that we must
                         drink on it

               he fills the fourth glass joseph takes it but does not
               drink as he is interested to hear grays proposition

                                   gray contd

               joseph drinks again gray keeps silent while he swallows the
               liquor as joseph puts down the glass gray hitches his chair
               forward an inch or two again he refills the glass puts it
               into josephs unsteady hand

               joseph lets his hand swing to his lap gray clasps josephs
               nose between thumb and forefinger cupping josephs chin hard
               against the heel of his palm

                         this is how they did it joseph

               suddenly his hand tenses josephs eyes dilate with terror
               and his head jerks to one side violently as he attempts to
               tear his face from the grasp of grays hand 

               med close shot  gray steadily clutching josephs face he
               throws himself upon the other man and the chair slowly goes

               is lying across the body of his victim his hand still
               clutching josephs nose and mouth joseph struggles
               convulsively throwing his arms and legs about trying to get
               at grays body which lies athwart him with his free hand
               gray pins down josephs right hand the man is helpless the
               violence of his movements grows less and less for a moment
               he is still then he struggles again

               close shot  joseph  he is making a final desperate effort
               to pull away from grays hand then his face muscles relax
               his eyes close 

               close full shot  gray and joseph gray looks down at his
               victim joseph is at last unconscious gray gets to a
               kneeling posture but still keeps his hand on josephs nose
               and mouth

               grays left arm he lets go of josephs hand and pats the

               close shot  gray as he examines joseph evidently joseph is
               dead enough to suit him and he lets go his grip 

               full shot as gray gets to his feet he crosses the room to a
               cupboard opens it and takes out a square of folded canvas
               he starts back toward joseph and stops on the way to pick up
               josephs glass from the taboret he drinks the remainder of
               the liquor in it gray kneels down beside joseph and begins
               to wrap the canvas about the body suddenly a thought
               strikes him and he puts his hand in josephs coat pocket he
               fishes out the money he had given him he begins wrapping the
               canvas around the body again

               pattern with the shadows there is no sound until abruptly
               a key turns in the lock of the outside door it opens and
               through it comes the figure of gray in his stovepipe hat and
               caped coat over his shoulder he carries a long limp and
               apparently heavy bundle wrapped in sacking cautiously
               without a sound he carries his grim burden toward the

               from view sounds come from behind the curtain bumping
               shuffling sounds then grays hand appears momentarily as it
               throws out a bundle of sacking   after a grunt of effort
               comes a heavy splash as something is dropped into the big vat

                         but why gray why

                                   gray

                         did not want to do but so long as

                         and a graverobber

               macfarlane looks at him  as he looks he realizes he has
               heard the truth and that gray will never leave him in peace 
               now he in turn attempts cunning  he moves forward in his
               chair as if wishing to put forth a convincing argument 
               macfarlane starts to rise his mind made up gray sees there
               is no longer any hope of forestalling violence he throws
               himself forward and seizes him as he seized joseph

               gray clings to him and gets his other arm about macfarlanes
               neck macfarlane tries to shake him off tries to twist away
               from him the effort makes him lose his footing  they fall

               hearth  gray still clings to him every muscle tense
               macfarlane with his hands under grays shoulders heaves up
               trying to push the man off he heaves once twice a third
               time and then lets his arms relax from the futile enormous
               effort

               macfarlanes eyes grow huge and fierce with anger now he
               tries to pummel gray in order to free himself raining blows
               on his back his head and into his side gray grunts with
               each punishing blow but never for a moment relaxes his grip
               finally the pistonlike blows grow weaker the flailing arms
               fail and macfarlane drops his hands to the floor at his side
               limp and relaxed

               he lets go his grip on macfarlanes face  no sooner has he
               done so than macfarlane throws him off with a violent
               movement both men scramble to their feet and face each
               other

               the camera swings away from the two men and focuses on the

               cats great round eyes seem to be surveying the struggle
               while above its head the shadows of the two men can be seen
               meeting struggling breaking off rushing together again
               and all the while there can be heard the sound of blows
               hoarse breathing gasps and hard ejaculations of breath then
               one indistinguishable figure picks up a chair the chair
               breaks with a crash over the head of the other figure and
               that figure falls out of scene only one upright shadow
               remains above the head of the cat that shadow picks up a
               cloak and top hat puts them on and bends to pick up a body
               the shadow of one man carrying the body of the other comes
               toward the cat the shadow growing huge and outfigure on the

                         i think it was the pain of the
                         operation more than anything else 
                         shes afraid that if she stands the
                         pain will come again nothing dr
                         macfarlane could ever do would take

               erect position she had been before and now in her desperate
               effort to see over the battlement she suddenly straightens
               her knees her hands lift off the arms of the chair without
               knowing it she is standing she tries again to look over the
               wall and again the height and distance is too much for her
               completely unconscious of what she is doing she takes a
               forward step and from this vantage point she can look over
               the wall she turns back with disappointment on her face she
               calls to her mother

               thing lunges heavily against macfarlanes shoulder

                                   macfarlane

               three shot the carriage sways violently and the thing
               between the men its outlines barely distinguishable seems
               to twist out of fettes grip it sags against macfarlane

                                   macfarlane contd
                         keep it off me

               forced to keep both hands on the reins macfarlane tries to
               thrust the thing away with his shoulder but it still keeps
               falling against him

                                   macfarlane contd
                             shouting
                         keep it off me i say

               fettes makes an effort to hold on to the corpse

               med full shot  the carriage going along the road the
               horse proceeding at a hard trot the hoof beats ring out
               rhythmically 

               three shot  process  fettes macfarlane and the corpse
               the rhythmic hoof beats sound very loud as the two men drive
               on in silence fettes makes a desperate effort to hold the
               corpse away from macfarlane but it keeps bumping into the
               doctor  through the hoof beats and in the same rhythm comes
               the voice of gray on the sound track

                                   grays voice
                         youll not get rid of me that way 
                         that way  that way  that way 

               macfarlane shakes his head as if to clear it of this
               remembered voice  these wellremembered words 

               close shot  macfarlane  his eyes are wide with
               apprehension and fear  he glances down at the wrapped corpse
               as it bumps against him he draws away shivering over the
               sound track grays voice still sounds beating on the ear with
               the same rhythm as the hoofs on the road  macfarlane pulls
               up on the reins 

               three shot  as macfarlane turns to fettes the carriage comes
               to a halt

                                   macfarlane
                             making an effort to
                              arrive at speech
                         fettes  for mercys sake lets
                         have a light

               fettes looks over at his companion he has never seen
               macfarlane in this state before and the younger man is
               puzzled

                                   fettes
                         all right

               he climbs over the sill into the roadway 

               med full shot  the carriage as fettes tries to strike a
               light in the pouring rain and howling wind he finally gets a
               taper going and touches it to the lamp wick the lamp flares
               for a moment 

               two shot  macfarlane and the corpse

                                   macfarlane
                         its changed  i swear it
                         its changed fettes

               reverse shot  fettes as he looks up puzzled

                                   fettes
                         changed changed to what

               high angle shot  macfarlane and the corpse with fettes at a
               lower level

                                   macfarlane
                         lets have that lamp

               fettes undoes it from the dashboard and lifts it up over his
               head to cast a light on the corpse

                                   macfarlane contd
                             looking down at the
                              bundle
                         this is not a woman

                                   fettes
                             matteroffactly
                         it was a woman when we put her in

                                   macfarlane
                             somewhat wildly
                         hold that lamp up  i must see her
                         face 

               he tears open the sacking

               another angle  close shot of fettes  he is looking up
               holding the lantern high over his head but is unable to see
               anything over the high dashboard except macfarlanes face 
               suddenly macfarlane pulls back and on his face there is such
               a look of anguish and terror that fettes cries out in alarm

                                   fettes
                         dr macfarlane

               reverse shot  now the face of the dead woman can be seen
               with macfarlane looking down at it in horror as slowly it
               turns to the dark wellmoulded features and smoothshaven
               cheeks of the familiar countenance of gray a wild yell
               breaks from macfarlanes lips

                                   macfarlane
                         gray  gray 

               med full shot  the horse and carriage the nervous horse
               bolts fettes tries to dodge out of the way the lamp falls
               and breaks and in the darkness the carriage goes bounding
               past his and away he stands looking after it then breaks
               into a run following the runaway

               close shot  macfarlane  he is fighting to control the
               horse  but as the carriage rocks the thing against his
               shoulder moves either by reason of the violent motion or of
               some frightful volition of its own 

               the canvas wrapping slips slides away and reveals again the
               head and naked torso of gray 

               the pace increases even more macfarlane sees the dreadful
               metamorphosis and a strangled cry breaks from his throat 

               the carriage sways again and the arms come free from the
               canvas another swerve another lurch and they have fallen
               limply around macfarlanes neckext hillside road  nightfull shot  a hairpin turn with cliffwall to one side a
               sheer drop to the other the carriage the horse beyond
               control cannot take it at the speed it strikes the cliff a
               wheel breaks loose the braces tear apart the horse
               staggers runs on free the carriage tilts sickeningly
               stands on end rolls over the edge and plunges down to
               destructionext hillside road  nightfettes has managed to get the lamp going again and is running
               along the road following the wheel tracks in the rainsoaked
               earth he comes upon a bit of wreckage and stops he listens
               then walks over to the edge of the cliff he holds his
               lantern well over the edge and peers down then he starts
               down the cliff sideext the cliff side  nightmed full shot  fettes as he scrambles down holding the
               lantern at arms length to protect it from the rough rocks
               and the heather  he comes to a slightly more level space and
               stops he looks down 

               med shot  shooting downward from fettes viewpoint
               macfarlanes body obviously without life is lying flat on
               its back arms and legs outspread and lying against his
               chest is something wrapped in canvas
               the camera moves slowly down until it is close showing
               beyond all doubt that not only has the canvas never been
               disturbed but also that it is the womans body which it
               covers
