               int elementary school  classroom  moments later

               the classroom is filled with screaming running children 
               mrs boswell enters the classroom with andrea and immediately 
               calls out to tommy a tough sevenyear old kid who swings a 
               whiffle bat at lenny now seven a sniffling chubby kid

                                     mrs boswell
                         tommy leave lenny alone dont make 
                         me send you to mr voyteks office

               evan is surprised to see his mother enter with mrs boswell 
               but continues playing with kayleigh now seven a quiet 
               sweetlooking girl

               mrs boswell leads andrea over to the teachers desk

                                     mrs boswell
                         i was going to show this to the 
                         principal but i wanted to talk to 
                         you first

                                     andrea
                         what is it

                                     mrs boswell
                         yesterday i had all the children 
                         draw pictures of what they wanted to 
                         be when they grew up most of them 
                         made drawings of what their parents 
                         did but this

               mrs boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls 
               out a drawing andrea turns to stone when she sees it

                                     andrea
                         i dont understand evan did this

               the drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while 
               standing on a heap of dead bodies its extremely 
               sophisticated for a sevenyear old some of the corpses have 
               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically 
               correct

               andrea sees evan playing with lenny harmless as a bunny 
               and struggles to control her concern

                                     andrea

                         of course there is one more thing 
                         mrs treborn and i feel bad for 
                         mentioning it

                         well he didnt remember doing it

               andrea is visibly shaken now

               family he looks at tommys picture and is confused

                         move away from me

               tommy gets upset he swipes his hand down lennys picture 
               and his macaroni mother crumbles to the floor lenny begins 
               to cry

                         you can still see your mom a little

               lenny unable to stop crying begins hyperventilating out of 
               control his desperate gasps for breath are frightening

               evan scared looks around for mrs boswell but cannot find 
               her he reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his 
               own macaroni mother apart and places it over lennys 
               picture its a nuclear family again lenny slowly is able 
               to catch his breath

                                     lenny

               smiles gratefully at evan

               back into the kitchen she drops her purse in shock when she 
               sees evan in doorway expressionless and holding a large

               some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts he breaks a 
               small capsule under evans mouth pinches his bleeding nose 
               closed and lets evan inhale the vapor through his mouth

               evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off holding his 
               bloody nose

               kayleigh says nothing as tommy sees the theatre playing seven 
               and whispers

               the report as she watches intensely

               she pulls her sleeve up revealing a large bruise

                                     kayleigh
                         its not your fault mrs kagan called

                         damn your dad did this

               kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger 
               darker bruise

                                     kayleigh
                              looking down

                         deserve is a better brother and 
                         father all they do is make you feel 
                         like shit

               she looks into his eyes

                                     evan
                         you really have no clue how beautiful 
                         you are do you

               she searches his eyes for sincerity and finds it they lean 
               into each other for a tender kiss after a moment a roar 
               from nearby

                                     tommy os
                         what the fuck are you doing

               they jerk back to see tommy shocked and betrayed staring 
               at them from across a small crowd by now some teens chuckle 
               at tommy

                                     teen punk os
                         buying popcorn what the fuck are 
                         you doing

               tommy rushes through the small crowd at evan his hands in 
               fists suddenly a foot reaches out and trips tommy tommy 
               falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him

               tommy slowly gets up locks eyes with evan hatred oozing

               evan looks guilty weakly shaking his head its not what 
               youre thinking

               tommy suddenly lunges at the teen punk who must be at least 
               a foot taller than he is tommy lands a flurry of punches 
               before the teen punk can even defend himself frequently 
               taking opportunities to eyeball evan

               evan kayleigh and even the punks friends look on helplessly 
               when two security guards seize tommy tommy valiantly 
               struggles against them at first but the moment he realizes 
               its hopeless he allows his body to go slack

               as tommy is being dragged away he turns to evan a sick 
               smile on his face  evan and kayleigh look back speechless

                         and a maze you take a flatworm and 
                         run it through the maze until hes 
                         memorized it then you put a new 
                         flatworm in the maze hes clueless 
                         banging into walls getting lost 
                         whatever

                         ten bucks says he eats it off the 
                         floor

               thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as evan knocks the 
               threeball in the side

                                     evan
                         you chop up the smart flatworm and 
                         feed it to the dumb one and presto 
                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze 
                         inside and out

               evan walks past heidi putting his hand on her shoulder to 
               squeeze by the hand lingers longer than necessary and heidi 
               doesnt mind he sinks another ball

                                     evan
                         just by absorbing the first worm 
                         into its cellular structure it gets 
                         all of the worms memories

                                     thumper
                              thoughtfully
                         thats probably why hannibal lecters 
                         so smart

               a handful of popcorn hits thumpers face they all try to 
               ignore hunter and spencers jeers

                                     heidi
                         so whats the point

                         itll help me understand the 
                         complexities of the human brain

               another barrage of popcorn hits thumpers jacket although 
               his hand clenches on the cue he meekly shuffles away to the 
               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling greeks

                                     heidi
                              intrigued

                         doctor or something

               thumper casually takes the pool cue from evan

                                     evan
                         no i just dont want to lose my 
                         mind

               as heidi digests this thumper carefully lines up his shot 
               the eight ball

               crash the cue ball intentionally jumps the table rocketing 
               into the pitcher of beer on the greeks table theyre all 
               soaked with beer and debris

               just as they begin to rise thumper smashes the cue stick on 
               the table whistling innocently while now brandishing a 
               spear they sit the fuck down

               kristin impressed casually wraps her arm around thumpers 
               waist he smiles coolly its nothing

                              re her beer

               evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading as he 
               reads he seems more and more on the verge of passing out

                                     evan
                         its like my mind refused to believe 
                         what it was seeing hearing crockett 
                         make those awful screams just 
                         writing about it gives me the shivers

               color drains from evans face as he realizes what hes 
               reading he looks over at heidi who kisses him

                                     heidi

                         it was like tommy was possessed or 
                         something there was a hate in his 
                         eyes that i couldnt really call 
                         human

               as evan reads the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate 
               around him like a tuning fork his voice becomes distant and 
               sounds echo around him like distant memories resurrecting 
               themselves

               evan is thirteen again the scene begins exactly where evans 
               blackout occurred as a child tommy has just knocked kayleigh 
               unconscious with a wooden plank lenny is frozen at the sight 
               of crockett in the fluidsoaked gunny sack and evan seething 
               with rage stands up with clenched fists and charges tommy 
               at full speed

               evan looks around utterly confused by his surroundings

                                     evan
                         what the hell is going on

               before an answer comes tommy smiles at his good fortune and 
               swings the plank hitting evans head evan is sent sprawling 
               backwards his forehead bleeding freely

               tommy knocks evan hard in the ribs with his boots evan 
               writhes in agony his face against the ground lenny moves 
               toward the gunny sack lifts it and tugs desperately on the 
               rope that traps crockett inside

                                     lenny
                         i cant undo the rope

               tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile

                                     tommy
                         drop it or ill slit your mothers 
                         throat in her sleep

               as if on cue lenny does exactly as hes told his eyes begin 
               to glaze over

               evan beaten and bloody reaches out with his last bit of 
               strength grabs tommys foot and holds on

                                     evan
                         i got him lenny help crockett

               lenny remains frozen in place tommy yanks his leg back 
               breaking evans grip

               evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap

               tommys voice hitches his eyes water from pent up 
               frustration

                                     tommy
                         listen to me good evan theres a 
                         million other sisters in the world 
                         you didnt have to fuck with mine

               tommy smiles viciously at lenny traumatized to watch tommy 
               pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the 
               campfire to the soaked gunny sack

               whoosh of flames

               and evan passes out

                         so don juan you pass out on all

               the window of opportunity for conversation has closed

                         what if i can get back all my lost 
                         memories with my journals

               with lightning speed lenny jumps from his desk and 
               unexpectedly shoves evan in to the wall squadrons of hanging 
               planes crash to the floor lenny digs his fingers into evans 
               shoulder

                                     lenny

                         your last motherfucker

               evan is terrified then lenny suddenly moves back and begins 
               working on the model again his eyes a million miles away 
               evan is speechless

               the door bursts open mrs kagan looks at the smashed model 
               airplanes by evans feet evan ignores her accusing stare

                                     evan
                         well thanks for seeing me man i 
                         shouldnt have waited so long

               when lenny doesnt respond mrs kagan hustles evan back 
               into the hallway

               int evans dorm  night

               evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins 
               pouring over them

               nearby thumper empties a can of hairspray into his mohawk

                                     thumper
                         you really think he wanted to kill 
                         you

                                     evan
                         all i know is that i might be able 
                         to unblock some of my repressed 
                         memories

               he finds something hes looking for marks the page with a 
               yellow postit note marked blackout and sets the book in a 
               separate pile

               as he sets the next journal on the bed it automatically 
               opens up to a place where the spine was bent staring up at 
               him is the message

               evans diary

               i will come back for you

               evan looks overcome by guilt

               later that evening

               int evans dorm  night

               evan has now organized a pile of five journals he selects 
               an entry begins reading and suddenly closes the journal 
               fear covers his face he holds one of his hands up and isnt 
               surprised to see it trembling

               he opens his journal again and reads out loud

                                     evan
                              reading aloud
                         the last thing i remember before the 
                         blackout was holding my hands over 
                         kayleighs ears
                              his voice slowly 
                              fades
                         i think i was more focused on her 
                         hands on mine than the mailbox across 
                         the street

               his own words grow reverberant distant furthermore the 
               walls behind him vibrate slightly worse than before

               flash

                                                              smash cut to

               evan kayleigh lenny and tommy all thirteen watch the 
               mailbox across the street with intense anticipation

               when evan comes to in this memory the lit cigarette absently 
               drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt 
               smoldering

               the mailbox ticktock ticktock like a staring contest

                                     lenny
                         maybe it went out should someone 
                         check it

                                     tommy
                         yeah you do that lenny

               suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls 
               into the driveway

               mrs halpern 24 an attractive young mother gets out of 
               the car and walks to the mailbox

               across the street tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of 
               lennys shoulder

                                     tommy

                         your last motherfucker

               tommys words make evan flinch from inside the car a baby 
               begins to cry mrs halpern walks back to the car

               evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in 
               pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt sending the 
               lit cigarette to the ground he pulls up his shirt revealing 
               a fresh burn mark on his stomach

                                     mrs halpern

               mrs halpern picks her up and carries her to the house as 
               the mother unlocks the front door to the house the kids 
               break into wide smiles of relief but wait

               the mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to 
               the mailbox now tommy is the only one left still smiling

                                     mrs halpern
                         you want to open the door honey

               the baby fumbles with the mailboxs door handle for a moment 

               angle on kids faces

               boom

               the blast is deafening evan kayleigh and lenny watch the

               evan and kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run 
               a few steps when they realize that lenny isnt with them

                                     tommy

               lenny doesnt seem to hear his eyes fixated on the crimson 
               road evan and tommy double back and grab him they try to 
               make him break out into a run but lennys feet drag limply

               to run with lenny through the woods

               sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room looking sick 
               and pale he lifts his shirt to see a new scar from the 
               cigarette burn

                                     evan

                         such a brain and all i just wondered

                         exactly your age he said he figured 
                         out a trick to remember the past

               evan tries not to react

                         i couldnt tell if they were real 
                         memories or just phantoms you know 
                         he might only have thought he actually 
                         remembered them

                                     evan
                         sure

                                     andrea
                         and then just before it got so bad 
                         that he had to be committed he said 
                         that he could

                                     evan
                         what what could he do

               andrea shakes her head

                                     andrea
                         forget it its nothing he was far 
                         too sick by then

               evan nods but something gnaws beneath the surface

               int evans dorm  night

               evan hastily hunts through his journals tearing up the room 
               looking for a certain book thumper lying on his bed quietly 
               watches evan with growing concern

                                     evan
                              reading aloud
                         i never wanted to be in the movie 
                         anyway and it was cold so i wanted 
                         to wear my clothes but mr miller 
                         took his shirt off 

                                     thumper
                         what the fuck are you doing

                         shhh i need quiet for this

               thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away

                                     thumper
                         are you stupid or what

                         reason why youve repressed the one 
                         day when some old lecher had you in 
                         your tighty whities dammit

               thumper begins scanning the journal entry a bitter laugh

                                     thumper
                         yeah man id think twice about 
                         this you could wake up a lot more 
                         fucked up than you are now

               he hands the journal back to evan evan opens it and begins 
               reading it silently

               his hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in 
               defeat

               int evans car  countryside  day

               evan looking haggard and frail wipes the greasy hair from 
               his eyes and punches the accelerator his teeth are clenched 
               and he hammers his fist on the dashboard

                                                               dissolve to

               piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out

               int ridgewood diner  continuous

               truckers the place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears 
               decorated in grime motif

               evan is about to enter when he spots kayleigh coming out of 
               the kitchen with a tray full of food

               kayleigh now twenty looks pale and sickly thin she bangs 
               her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to 
               the floor her boss stares back in aggravation

                                     boss

                         without you breaking something

               kayleighs face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up 
               the order she is humiliated and evan leans back against a

                         no but i think something really bad 
                         mightve happened to us

               kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette

                                     kayleigh
                         is there a point to any of this

               evans features shift from inquisitory to tenderness he 
               steps closer to kayleigh and softly strokes her face she 
               flinches at first but remains in the same spot

                                     evan
                         whatever happened it wasnt our 
                         fault you know we couldnt have

                         spoken to you in seven years

               she moves her face away from his hand

                                     evan
                         but you were seven years old and 
                         theres nothing you couldve done to 
                         deserve

               her face collapses and she turns away

               evans hands tense up into fists he becomes weak in the

               evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper 
               he unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite

               evan opens his journal marked age 7 he plops on his bed 
               and starts writing sideways in the margins

                         its been said that a persons life

               he turns the page and begins reading the journal as he mouths 
               the entry to himself the resonance of an older mans voice 
               seems to reverberate throughout the room and the world behind

               and watches with horror

               evans face is flushed with rage he walks behind kayleigh 
               and cups his hands tightly around her ears she cant hear 
               anything now

                         own flesh and blood

               the mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a 
               sevenyear old mr miller looks around the room as if hes 
               the butt of some sick joke

                                     mr miller

                         whose only concept of trust was 
                         betrayed by her own sick pedophile

               the wooden door to the rooftop swings open revealing kayleigh 
               and evan kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees

               the entire roof is decorated with fairylights chinese 
               lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles and elegant 
               romantic table for two awaits them flanked by twelve formally 
               dressed servants previously seen pledges who respectfully 
               stare ahead with the utmost class

               two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by 
               kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight

               on ladders delicately tossing pedals

               kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down

                                     kayleigh

                         that i wanted to spend the rest of 
                         my life with you

               her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely her eyes 
               tell him she feels the same way a magical moment

               and they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it 
               might as well be their first ever

               the seats and tires have been slashed the hood has been 
               mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the 
               roof

               the most unnerving thing however is a spiked leather dog 
               collar hangs off the rearview mirror

               evan stands there stunned unable to react when 

               another neonazi rick swats evans journals out of his 
               hands and onto the floor life springs back into evan as he 
               rushes for the journals he and rick grab the journals at 
               the same time a minor tug of war

               almost imperceptibly vibrate

               in mrs boswells first grade class all of the children 
               draw colorful pictures evan sees some paper spindles sitting 
               on mrs boswells desk as he heads over to them mrs boswell 
               firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own 
               desk

                                     mrs boswell
                         no monkey business evan sit still 
                         and finish your drawing

               evan defeated looks over at his blank piece of paper he 
               smiles mischievously and grabs some colored pencils

                                     mrs boswell
                         thats great everyone just imagine 
                         anything you want to be there are 
                         no limits

               soon enough an image emerges evan holding a knife stands 
               over a heap of several dead inmates karl and rick

               when done he sneaks over to mrs boswells desk where the 
               two paper spindles sit the metal needles reach up and skewer 
               a number of paper notes and messages

               evan looks over to see mrs boswell holding up his drawing 
               horrified

                                     evan
                              musically
                         oh mrs boswelllllllll

               she looks over in time to see evan using all of his seven
               year old strength to whip his hands down toward the spindles

               the moment before his palms reach them theres a brief instant 
               where soundscapes collide and the world behind him vibrates

                                                         and were back to

               int evans prison cell  day  2002

               evan comes to as echoes of screaming children fade alertness 
               slowly creeps back up on him as he hears

                                     carlos
                         oh sweet jesus its true its a 
                         miracle a miracle

               evan looks up to see carlos staring at him with reverence

                                     carlos
                         your hands the stigmata

               evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm

                                     evan
                         what did you see what did it look 
                         like

                                     carlos

                         out of nowhere i thought you were

                         so you believe me

               carlos simply stares at him awestruck and hands over a box 
               of cigarettes

               int karls cell  continuous

               evan nervously approaches a crew of aryans block his path

                         i want to make a deal

               the aryans laugh make discrete eye contact with karl who 
               grins and signals to let evan pass

               int karls cell  continuous

               karl and rick wait expectantly as evan nervously enters 
               they say nothing relishing the fearful silence

                                     evan

               they continue to stare

                         is your blood pure

                         the fucking teeth or youll be leaving 
                         without em

               evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees 
               karl and rick lower their pants to their ankles evan looks 
               miserable about to do the deed when  carlos bulldozes 
               past the aryans into the room slamming karl into the wall 
               and jamming a shank into karls crotch

               rick instantly charges carlos but trips on the pants around 
               his ankles evan anticipating ricks fall stomps ricks 
               face before snatching his journals from karls shelf

               evan frantically flips through them hunting for something 
               as the other white supremacists charge the cell

                         carlos

               carlos drops karls writhing body to the floor and presses 
               his girth against the cell door

               evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as 
               the other supremacists force the door open  evan focuses 
               on the words chanting quickly

                                     evan
                         we took the woods behind the junkyard

                         into tommy we hadnt seen the smoke 
                         yet

               words from the entry begin to shimmer reverberant sounds of 
               barking break the sound barrier and the image of aryans 
               storming the cell behind him become a frenetic blur

               at first then rights himself he seems strangely exhilarated 
               a sinister victory smile

                         rot in hell you fucking animals

               kayleigh and lenny walking by his side do a double take 
               evan shrugs just kidding and looks around getting his 
               bearings he whips his hand out and stops them

               he suddenly notices kayleigh who now no longer looks an 
               awkward and unkempt tomboy but rather a vibrant and feminine 
               young girl whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering 
               before she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles  
               evan remembers his mission and darts over to a junk pile

               razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long evan offers 
               it to lenny

               evans words hit home and tommys anger slowly dissipates a 
               look of understanding passes between them gratitude even

               tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it lenny comes 
               screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell with all of 
               the force he can muster he jams the metal shard all the way 
               through tommys throat

               tommy clutches his throat gagging in blood evan surveys

               his hands and freezes up completely kayleigh wakes up and 
               screams when she sees blood spurt from tommys throat

               evan continues and kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense 
               interest and matched skepticism

                                                         dissolve to later

                         for reasons unknown to you it reminds 
                         you of your stepsister

               evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar 
               sounds of thumper having sex with another naked gothic co
               ed on evans bed

                                     evan

                         okay with you bein sick and all

               evans temper flares and he picks up a chair and smashes it 
               against a wall above thumpers head

                                     evan
                         im not saying it again

               thumper and the coed quickly cover themselves in the blankets 
               and leave alone in the room evan looks under his bed and 
               breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are 
               intact he sifts through them again he finally finds the 
               passage he needs something catches the corner of evans 
               eyes and he turns to examine it

               to the left of thumpers buddha statuette sits a large votive 
               candle that bears a portrait of jesus christ

                                     evan

                         i need to set things right

               as he begins reading a passage to himself sounds echo 
               backward at us from another time and place and the entire 
               room shimmers around him

               watch mrs halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across 
               the street with intense anticipation evan suddenly comes to 
               life and makes himself visible running across the street 
               shouting

                                     evan
                         lady stay back dont go near the 
                         mailbox

               mrs halpern startled stares at the young kid skeptically 
               as she absently continues toward the mailbox

                                     evan
                         i mean it woman get the hell back

               lenny comes running across the street to evans aid and 
               tommy shrugs and follows after him

                         theres a bomb in the mailbox get 
                         away

               tommy still running cringes to hear lennys stupid 
               confession and rolls his eyes at the situation evan positions 
               himself between mrs halpern and the mailbox frantically 
               waving his hand at her to stay back because shes still 
               coming

                         ill save you lady

               tommy takes a running dive at mrs halpern perhaps a bit 
               too hard and sends her and the baby to the pavement hurt 
               but no major injuries

               seeing things are safe evan backs away from the mail 

               boom

               a flood of memories assault him

               we see countless and brief image flashes of evan growing up 
               from the age of thirteen with no arms and requiring a 
               wheelchair

               int multiplex theater lobby  day  1995

               evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of 
               the wheelchair lenny must halt in order not to crush evan 
               as evan writhes about on the floor his legs paralyzed a 
               crowd gathers

               evan focuses on lenny but its hard to ignore the crowd 
               that titters and snickers in the background

               evan spins around in fear he sees tommy cleancut and 
               handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads campus 
               crusade for christ tommy seems goodnatured now working 
               hard and soliciting names for his list he looks up as evan 
               rolls along and his eyes brighten to see evan

                                     tommy
                         i did what you said man were 
                         pooling our student funds with hillel 
                         house and were going to have an 
                         awareness dance

                                     evan
                         oh goody nothing like spinning my 
                         chair around to a techno mix of hava 
                         nagila til i puke

               tommy frowns and exchanges glances with lenny who shrugs 
               and nods back to him

                                     lenny
                         uh we should be getting to class

                         now tomorrow i could wake up as 
                         some dirt farmer in bangladesh

               another exchanged glance kayleigh looks at evan

                                     kayleigh
                         lets go for a stroll

               evan allows kayleigh to roll him away from the others to 
               the very spot where evan once killed tommy

               evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can magically 
               will to open close open close

                                     evan
                         so tommys really into this jesus 
                         kick huh

               kayleigh looks at him curiously

                                     kayleigh
                         you know how spiritual hes gotten 
                         ever since he saved mrs halpern and 
                         katie

                                     evan
                         he saved mrs halpern please the 
                         twisted fuck

               kayleigh now by a bench stops and sits as she casually 
               uses her foot to turn his chair to face her she pulls out a 
               granola bar and hands it to him

               his prosthetic hand crushes it it crumbles to dust she 
               seems more confused

                                     kayleigh
                         is something the matter

                                     evan
                              re prosthetic arms
                         yeah i think i gotta get these fixed 
                         or something

               she leans into him gently feeding him her remaining bar

                                     evan
                         kayleigh do you ever think about 
                         us i mean wonder if it could 
                         ever have been different between the 
                         two of us

                                     kayleigh

                         first person i really ever cared

                              feeding another bite
                         when my folks split they gave me 
                         and tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with i couldnt stand my dad

                         sometimes think of us together

                                     kayleigh
                         its crossed my mind from time to 
                         time

                                     evan
                              hopeful
                         and

                                     kayleigh
                         well a lot of things cross my mind 
                         ive always been a fast thinker ev 
                         i can play out the movie of our entire 
                         lives in under a second boom  we 
                         fall in love  get married  two 
                         kids your keen analytical insight 
                         matched to my generous nature  
                         kids grow old as do we relatively 
                         stable relationships matching burial 
                         plots the whole bit it took a lot 
                         longer to spit out than to imagine

                                     evan
                         then you think it might have worked 
                         out

                                     kayleigh
                         why not but thats not how things 
                         wound up im with lenny lennys 
                         your friend and there it ends

               she looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically 
               tears streak down evans face as he speaks in a pleading 
               tone

                                     evan
                         would it make any difference if i 
                         told you that no one could possibly 
                         love anyone as much as i love you

               kayleigh shakes her head sadly then suddenly looks up evan 
               turns to see lenny waving her over she puts her hand on 
               evans shoulder stands and goes to lenny

               evan cant take his eyes off her

               angle on

               lenny kissing kayleigh in painful slomo evan turns away 
               utterly heartbroken

               int handicapped bathroom  day

               close up

               evans stump turns on a bathtub faucet

               reveal

               evan fully clothed lies in a bathtub thats filling with 
               water beside the tub the wheelchair has been tipped over

               the water rises past his mouth to his nostrils  evan makes 
               his peace and takes a final breath

               and the water spills over the side of the tub all evan can 
               do is watch it still breathing easily through his nose

               a beat then the door opens

               tommy enters immediately sizing up the situation

                                     tommy
                         you forgot to put the toaster on the 
                         edge

               tommy casually turns off the water then pops open the drain 
               the water level lowers to evans mouth

                                     evan
                         but you kayleigh and lenny like 
                         toast and thats really all that 
                         matters now

               tommy feels evans anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor 
               by the tub he lays his head onto evans shoulder

               evan bristles at first but finally gives in to his hatred 
               ultimately resting his own head against tommys taking the 
               comfort offered

                                     tommy
                         ill get you changed visiting hours 
                         are almost up

               int st vincents hospital  evening

               tommy rolls evan through a quiet hospital corridor

                                     evan
                              looking around
                         what did mom get transferred again

               tommy frowns confused then rolls evan into 

               int andreas room  continuous

               evan is startled to see andrea hooked up to several ivs an 
               oxygen tank and a respirator several oxygen hoses connect 
               to a tracheotomy tube

               tommy smiles and kisses andrea on the cheek she tousles his 
               hair in return

               evan can hardly speak as tommy begins to wheel evans chair 
               closer to andreas bedside andrea utters a faint whisper

                                     andrea
                         looking good kiddo

               evan eyes her medical clipboard as hes wheeled by

                                     evan
                              reading
                         lung cancer

                         sorry mrs t hes been out of sorts 
                         lately

               andrea flinches to hear this evan stares at her eyes wide

                                     evan
                         right you started chain smoking 
                         after i blew myself up

               evan suddenly seems sick with guilt

                                     evan
                         there must be a way to fix this

                         never even got the chance to write 
                         it

               a flicker of recognition registers in her eyes

                                     andrea
                         is evan different

                         times

               andrea is shocked

                                     andrea
                         how did you know that

               she uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen 
               tube and forces herself to speak in a sick gravely manner

                                     andrea
                         just like jason

                         of here

               he pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself 
               out of the room

               andrea forces her loudest raspy scream

                                     andrea
                         stop him stop him stop him

               int evans dorm  night

               lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in evans closet 
               evan watches nearby

                                     lenny

               evan watches lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of evans junk 
               on the floor old report cards books toys and photo albums 
               fall on the floor

                                     lenny
                         is this it

               evan beams when he sees lenny holding his old journal age 
               7

                                     lenny

                         first place now shhhh

               lenny utterly baffled sits back in silence and watches 
               evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat

               on evan

                                     kayleighs mother
                         what did you say to her what 
                         happened

               evan ignores them he cant take his eyes off kayleigh

                                     evan
                         goodbye

               his eyes well up

               flash

                                                              smash cut to

               int evans dorm  day  2002

               evan wakes up with a bloody nose he grabs a pillow and covers 
               his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him

               lenny looking fit grabs a towel from atop an awardwinning 
               flatworms project and hands it to evan

                                     lenny os
                         you alright should i call the doctor

               evan groans and shakes his head no he rides out the pain 
               like a seasoned pro

               when it finally subsides he lowers the pillow and smiles 
               feebly

                                     evan
                         ill think ill be alright this time
                              a new hope
                         i really do

               lenny nods still concerned

               int college  incinerator room  later

               evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace 
               he and lenny carry cardboard boxes

                                     lenny
                         you sure about this

               evan nods they silently dump tons of journals into the fire 
               evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies 
               photo albums old report cards etc in they go

               close on

               burning journals

                                                               dissolve to

               ext city street  day  2010

               evan a suit now walks down a city street cradling a cell 
               phone to his ear

               title card years later

                                     evan
                              into phone
                         yeah ma im running a little late 
                         for lunch one of my patients had a 
                         breakdown anyway order some soup 
                         in the meantime see ya soon

               as he clicks off an attractive woman wearing a power suit 
               approaches from the other direction evan has to look closely 
               but its kayleigh a mature woman now

               he stumbles slightly caught off guard as she passes her 
               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary but theres 
               no recognition evan watches her continue past him and down 
               the sidewalk

               after a hesitant beat he takes a breath turns around and 
               follows her

               fade to black

               roll credits

                                         the end
