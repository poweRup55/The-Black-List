	a speck of dust

	grains of sand dance in the wind  as we glide over a vast
	desert the speck of dust becomes a horse and rider 
	catherine young straddles the beautiful black animal her
	mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon  a curious breeze
	blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in as if
	the wind itself were telling something to her

	catherine sees a flickering light in the sand  she pulls the
	reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into
	nothingness  she dismounts affectionately scratches the
	horses neck and follows the light  when she looks over her
	shoulder the arabian is now a childs wooden hobby horse 
	not surprised catherine smiles and walks down a dune sand
	sliding beneath her feet

	she finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed
	gnarled limbs appear to form hands  the light dances across
	her face  she shades her eyes and pinpoints the source

	a small mirror reflecting rays of bright sun housed within a
	locket and chain  its held by edward a hauntedlooking boy
	of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes  he sits
	on a fallen tree trunk patiently waiting for her arrival

				catherine
		thanks for the horse

	hes a shy child yet comfortable with catherine

				edward
		you liked him

				catherine
		hes beautiful

	edward smiles delighted he made her happy

				catherine contd
		but i thought we were going sailing

	the boy frowns

				catherine contd
		you promised

	a devilish glint in his eye edward redirects the mirror 
	catherine follows the flicker to a toy boat in the sand

				catherine contd
		we cant fit into that

	edward shines light in her eyes momentarily blinding her
	then snaps the locket shut  when her vision clears
	catherine sees a giant ship perched among the dunes  a craft
	weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert

				catherine contd
		thatll do

	she walks toward it but edward doesnt follow

				catherine contd
			coaxing him
		come on mister e

	she extends her hand but he adamantly shakes his head no

				catherine contd
		what now

				edward
			nods at the ship
		s broken

	undaunted she finds herself standing on the deck

				catherine
			calling to him
		who says

				edward
		mockylock

				catherine
		oh no no you dont

				edward
		mockylock is the bogeyman  mockylock
		wants me where i am

				catherine
		i bet we can fix it

	she opens a rusted iron door  it makes an horrific
	screeching sound  similar to metalonmetal but more
	piercing more pained  as if made by a living thing

				catherine contd
			familiar with the noise a
			warning to him
		edward

	the boys face contorts turning into something halfhuman
	halfanimal  a monster  mockylock  he screeches trying
	to frighten catherine but she cocks her head

				catherine contd
		we agreed  no more mockylock

	the creature sticks its tongue out and dives

				catherine contd
		edward

	but its too late  edwardmocky lock slithers into the sand
	and disappears  resigning herself to a failure she opens
	the palm of her left hand revealing a small bump in the
	flesh between thumb and forefinger  she presses hard and

	picture and sound distort and change

	int laboratory  day

	we are looking at a large screen showing an electronically
	generated threedimensional view of a human brain featuring
	colorcoded neurological activity  in a specific section of
	the image cells flash from yellow to red

	pull back to reveal henry west surrounded by computers
	monitors electronics and keyboards  dr miriam kent stands
	before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and
	images  both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip
	assemblers  the impressive weird computer system hums as it
	shifts programs the unusual brain image changing colors  

	through a large window we see into an adjoining room within
	which a human figure hangs suspended in midair by a series
	of cables designed to simulate flotation

	at the console miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of
	the touchsensitive screen changing the complex chemical
	symbols displayed there

	in the procedure room a series of pharmaceuticals are
	injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleevearm of
	the figure  a featherweight cloth mask electronically rises
	revealing the sleeping face of catherine

	at the console miriam hits a button and speaks into an
	intercom microphone

				miriam
		sing a song of sixpence

	in the procedure room there is no reaction from catherine

				miriam os contd
		sing a song of sixpence

				catherine

	catherines eyes open

				catherine
		baked in a pie

	in the control room henry hits a switch and catherine is
	lowered to the pedestal  miriam checks monitors displaying
	catherines vital signs and continuing what must be a
	routine presses numbers on a keypad to open the pressurized
	airtight door separating the two areas

	in the procedure room lights come on and miriam eases
	catherine out of the apparatus  she checks her pupil
	dilation pulse throat and reflexes  she pokes and prods
	with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside
	observer but is nothing to them  getting to her feet we
	see that catherines bodysuit is made of an unusual dark
	fabric almost liquid in consistency

	at the console henry moves to another section and for the
	first time we see there are two elaborate neural monitors 
	and the brain pictured here is smaller  younger

				henry
		mister e is doing fine

	reveal a second figure suspended from the ceiling in the
	procedure room  a small boy is lowered to the pedestal and
	as miriam records data catherine removes the childs mask
	displaying the haunted face of edward  clearly the boy is
	in some kind of catatonic state

				miriam
		did we go sailing

				catherine
		almost  mockylock showed up

				miriam
		mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock
		wants me where i am

				catherine
		mockylock is a pain in the ass

	henry communicates with them via the intercom

				henry
		where did that come from again

	catherine looks annoyed  how could he forget

				catherine
		a nursery rhyme

	catherine detaches the cables and eases edwards frail body
	into a waiting wheelchair  miriam takes a penlight and
	examines the boys eyes an emotionless void oddly
	beautiful

				miriam
			thinking aloud
		nursery rhymes fairy tales the
		bogeyman all preparation for the
		horrors of the real world

	making certain the child is comfortable catherine covers him
	with a blanket rests a teddy bear on his lap and pushes him
	into the control room accompanied by miriam  henry types in
	a command and moves to join them

				henry
		anybody hungry  im hungry

	a buzzer sounds and another door hisses open a constantly
	fretting administrator barry cooperman is waiting for them
	in the corridor

	although this is a hospital room filled with medical

	posters photographs and drawings to make it more homey 
	some hint at aspects of edwards fantasy world  every

	clothes under a lab coat stand opposite cooperman  sitting
	on the bed with edward is ella baines an elegantly dressed
	woman in her mid40s  there is a soulfulness to her but
	the husband lucien baines 60s possesses the icy demeanor
	of a corporate tycoon  one might write him off as cold but
	we sense a genuine love for his wife and child  ella smiles
	and caresses edwards hair

				ella
		he needs a haircut

				catherine
		ill tell the nurse

		god he loves when you visit

				ella
		my husband wonders if thats true

		theres been progress

				lucien
		yes but there is no proof the procedure

	catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the
	intensity of her experience with edward but feels she must
	defend herself

				catherine

	int white room  day

	at first were not sure where we are or whats happening 
	its too bright the space confining  as our eyes adjust we

	crying and the camera finds anne vicksey  dark circles
	beneath eyes red and puffy from crying  hair wet and ratted 
	sweater and pants damp and stained  barefoot she shivers
	from cold and fear

	juice boxes  in the center of the floor is a drain and above
	her on the ceiling a fluorescent lamp also encased in
	clear plastic

	there is no door

	a mechanism clicks then a rumbling anne seems to know
	whats coming  she presses against the wall removes her
	arms from the sleeves of the sweater hunches down and
	raises the garment over her head forming a tent

	water erupts from the shower head  there is no steam so
	this water must be cold  shaking anne whispers a count to
	herself  oneone thousand twoone thousand three and
	so on  the spray hits everything in the room  mirror
	toilet floor  and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain

	she peeks up from the tent but the water has not stopped
	and that isnt what she expected  we hear a soft sucking
	noise and a click  the wrapper rises on a puddle of water 
	anne pounds her fist on the wall

				anne contd
			angry scared

	a puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has
	somehow been sealed shut  her panic intensifies as we hear

				miriam
		someday you can  we all believe that

	catherine halfheartedly nods but her mind is elsewhere
	focused on the two apparatuses

				catherine
		i want to try it  please

	miriam knows what this is about

				miriam
		weve been over this a dozen times  no

				catherine
		why not  just once  a trial run  what

			frustrated
		it could take years for me to get past

				miriam
		if we reverse the feed and bring edward
		into your mind it could be devastating
		for him  imagine the shock of suddenly
		existing in a whole other world

				catherine
		i do it all the time

				miriam
		yes but youre a willing participant 
		picture edward in a strange place lost
		frightened

				catherine
		id be there for him

				miriam
		and he might blame you for terrifying

		okay okay

	miriam takes a penlight and examines catherines eyes

				miriam

	ext rural highway  day

	a green ford pickup truck cruises down this deserted stretch
	of twolane blacktop the driver carefully maintaining the
	speed limit  he signals and exits

	ext country road  day

	the truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy unpaved road 
	the area is desolate depressing and deserted  it feels
	like no ones been anywhere near here for years  the pickup
	stops at a rusted gate and the driver a tall lean sinewy
	fellow undoes a combination lockandchain  we do not yet
	see his face

	ext abandoned farm house  day

	the truck parks inside a charred barn now hidden from view
	and the driver steps out followed by his dog

	a magnificent white german shepherd  we notice a glint in
	its blue eyes  the animals an albino  the driver points
	and whistles  welltrained the shepard sprints to the gate
	and waits keeping a watchful eye on the road

	int the cell  observation room  day

	from the outside a passerby would never know this sanctuary
	existed  within the foundation of a farm building never
	completed we find a small room in the center of a much
	larger space  the cell  we hear the whir of electronic
	equipment and notice video cameras mounted on tripods pointed
	at the twoway glass  we follow cables to a massive video
	recorder  the type used in surveillance able to record for
	days without maintenance and an elaborate timing device
	connected to a series of valves and switches

	as if in a beatific trance the driver moves to the window
	and gently rests his palm on the glass  anne moves  arms
	flailing mouth gasping eyes filled with dread  the last
	spark of life the driver jumps startled and frightened

	almost shamefully he turns and hides unable to look at her 
	suddenly his body tenses and writhes as if seized by
	torturous pain  he opens his mouth in a silent scream

	and then quickly as it came the pain subsides  hidden in
	shadow he breathes deeply regaining selfcontrol  he
	waits then moves back to the glass  annes dead face floats
	past him  almost angelic  he watches her and leans his head
	against the window closer  and the driver catches his own
	reflection in the mirror

	meet carl stargher

	ext catherines house  night

	small and isolated the nearest neighbor a block away

	int catherines house  night

	the place is a mess  computer printouts dirty dishes
	unopened mail videotapes and notepads cover tables chairs
	and floor  on the crammed bookshelves psychology texts sit
	next to volumes on mythology religion and the occult 
	totems figurines and artifacts central and south american
	in origin adorn the walls and tables

	as portishead plays on the stereo we find catherine
	suffering from insomnia wearing goofyyethip eyeglasses
	sweatpants and a ucsd tshirt sharing a latenight snack
	with her pet cat  she shuts the refrigerator door and we
	linger on an odd postcard taped to the surface  a kitschy
	postcard of a warriorgoddess

	int basement  night

	we move out of shadow toward a bright focused light
	following the albino german shepherd  valentine  as it
	enters a vast subterranean room  most of the walls have been
	knocked down leaving only thick support posts  valentine
	finds stargher in a dugout pit  about five feet deeper than
	the rest of the room  polishing a stainless steel table  a
	bright tungsten work light hangs above and near it is the
	chain cables and hooks of a customized mechanical hoist

	the dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far
	corner where there are empty jugs of bleach sitting next to a
	long deep cast iron tub  stargher whistles and valentine
	obediently retreats to a kennel cage  stargher gives him a
	chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub

	soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of anne vicksey 
	the interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and
	the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is
	floating in nothingness but what hypnotizes and appalls are
	her eyes  wide open transformed by the chlorine into
	something ghostly they are unforgettable

	as the bleach gurgles down the drain stargher lifts anne
	from the tub and carries her to the table  he places her
	face up and dries her with a clean white towel  he moves her
	limbs lips hips and hands into desired positions then
	retreats into shadow  in the harsh light against the shiny
	table the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and
	we almost expect her to move

	we hear stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the
	pool of light  nude we see that his lean muscular frame is
	laced with some rough tatoos  when he turns his back to us
	we find eight metal rings thick and strong pierced through
	his flesh  two columns of four on either side of the spine
	running from shoulder blade to just below the waist  what in
	gods name are they for

	stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where
	he keeps television monitors and vcrs  he inserts a
	videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches
	the screen

	in black and white we see anne awaken in the cell  her
	first moments inside  disoriented terrified trapped she
	examines her surroundings

	stargher is mesmerized by her fear  fastforwarding to her
	death he presses a remote and we get sound  anne screaming
	begging for her life  aroused stimulated stargher drinks
	it in like a symphony  valentine cowers in the back of his
	cage hating this

	int catherines house  bedroom  night

	lying on her bed a waterbed catherine sleepily stares at
	the ceiling rolls onto her side and feels herself drawn
	into the comforter  the folds of the fabric become ripples 
	ripples become dunes

	ext edwards world  day

	and we find ourselves in the desert of edwards world

	we fly over dunes and come up behind catherine as she
	struggles through waves of sand  the tree trunk is up ahead
	and we glimpse someone hiding inside

	catherine reaches  mockeylock erupts from within the tree
	trunk  snarling  catherine retreats silently screaming

	int catherines house  bedroom  dawn

	in her own bed catherines eyes are open  in sharp contrast
	to a typical reaction to a nightmare she remains calm  no
	sweaty face no gasp no reaction at all really  she might
	as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs  wide awake her
	eyes return their gaze to the ceiling

				catherine
		go  to  sleep

	int stargher house  basement  night

	chains attached to bizarre hooks dangle from the ceiling 
	admiring annes body stargher links the hooks to the rings
	in his back  he presses a remote unit and up in the rafters
	a series of gears click into motion  the sound is torturous
	as the mechanical hoist lifts stargher off the ground
	pulling at the rings strips of flesh rising  stargher
	grimaces but clearly he wants the pain needs it  as the
	hoist clicks into another gear it carries stargher over the
	table until his body is perfectly positioned above annes

	in the flickering weird light of the television screen
	stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of
	william blake  a levitating demon ready to debauch an
	innocent angel  with his free hand he touches himself
	chains clinking and swaying

				reid
		minimal activity in the dorsolateral

		you ever hear of whalens infraction

	clearly not

				reid contd
			re the eeg
		in any schizophrenic these areas would

	novaks worry intensifies

				reid contd
		starghers neurological system was

		dormant  in his case for about
			guesses at starghers age
		thirty years  most likely hes
		exhibited symptoms for awhile now but
		the infraction  the breach  didnt
		occur til today  you never know when
		itll happen at what age or why  the
		triggers vary but the results dont
			fascinated by stargher
		he has no ties to reality  no awareness
		of this world or the people in it

				teddy lee
		what about thorazine or desoxyn

				reid
		the normal psychotropics dont work 
		hes not just catatonic hes
		disappeared  like having a dream and
		never waking up

				novak
		this girl  julia hickson  only he
		knows where she is

		then im sorry  for her and for you

	novak is past angry  hes bordering on devastation  ramsey

				ramsey
		well go back to his house pete 
		theres still a lot to do  analyze the

		through his records  maybe he owns

				novak
		theyre in that fucking thing for forty

	ramsey backs off knowing his partner is on the verge of

	cooperman appears in the window and explains

				cooperman

			with gravity
		we have a situation

	int campbell center  conference room  day

	a small tv screen shows footage of anne drowning in the cell

	theres someone else in the room  john tracy  he cannot
	watch the video not again  catherine glances at him
	uncomfortable with his presence

				miriam
		when did he lapse into the coma

				novak
		sometime yesterday morning

	john tries to keep his composure but novaks making this
	tough for him  novak wants the scientists to see to
	understand the boys pain

				novak contd
		each tape is the same  he provides
		food drinking water a toilet 
		periodically a shower starts  its on
		some kind of timer  hes clever with
		machines building things  i think he
		wants them to believe this is a simple
		kidnapping  that theres a possibility
		of rescue  of survival  but its just
		a form of torture  at the end of the
		fortieth hour the drain shuts  the
		water starts and doesnt stop
			gravely
		weve already lost more than a day  if
		she isnt found tonight  she dies like
		the rest

				cooperman
			to miriam henry and
			catherine
		john and ella baines  as well as the
		sunerset board of directors  have given
		their approval but the decision is
		yours

				miriam
		what about the legalities of this

				novak
		stargher is in custody  the functional
		equivalent of being under arrest 
		normally wed mirandize him and if he
		didnt lawyer up wed interrogate him 
		but because of his condition he doesnt
		have the capacity to waive those rights

				henry
		so what youre asking us to do is
		illegal

				novak
		no not at all
			explains
		were dealing with exigent
		circumstances  somewhere theres a
		kidnapped woman still alive  if we
		weigh the suspects constitutional
		rights against the public safety 
		the law favors the victim and gives us a
		lot of leeway  its called the public
		safety exception

				cooperman
		so what can you do

				novak
		pretty much anything we want  theres a
		chance to save a human life  because of
		that stargher has no reasonable
		expectation of privacy

	miriam henry and cooperman appear to be onboard  novaks
	made a persuasive heartfelt argument  only one person still
	remains uncertain

				catherine
		what if

	all eyes turn to her

				catherine contd
		what if he wasnt like this  what if he
		was normal  conscious  how far would
		you go

				novak
		as far as i needed

	catherine nods analyzes novaks eyes gestures body
	language and interrogates him

				catherine
		do you think hed tell you what you need
		to know

	johns discomfort is increasing and novak is sensitive to it

				novak
		theres always a chance theyll confess

				catherine
		really  i dont work with violent
		cases i work with children  but even a
		kid lies  they love it when they get
		you to believe something that isnt
		true  dont you think stargher would do
		the same

				novak
		sometimes once theyve been caught
		they feel a need for disclosure  they
		have so much they want to tell 
		but theyve never had a sympathetic ear 
		they need someone to understand why
			focusing on catherine
		stargher used to hide the bodies very
		carefully  it was part of the ritual 
		some werent found for weeks and any
		physical evidence had been meticulously
		wiped clean  but these last three
		they were still in water  always in
		water  but
			clarifies
		listen he wasnt just careless  it
		went beyond that

				catherine
		okay  lets assume he wanted you to
		find him that some part of him hated
		what he was doing most likely that
		part is dead  schizophrenics with
		whalens infraction sever all ties with
		the real world  im sorry i really am

				ramsey
		is it possible

				catherine
		if he came to trust me yes but it
		takes months to build that kind of
		trust  someone like stargher cant
		distinguish between fantasy and reality 
		its all the same  he might tell me
		shes in timbuktu and absolutely one
		hundred percent believe it to be true
		but shes

				john os
		julia

	they turn to john tracy  his vulnerable barely audible
	voice forcing everyone to listen

				john contd
		not she  julia  not thing or it or
		her  do you know anything about her 
		do you know what weve been through 
		julia is everything to me  can you say
		that about anyone

		the connections between nerve cells are

	miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars  henry
	continues eager to focus attention back to him but even he

				henry contd
		its like the early days of television 
		the subject sends out a live feed and
		you receive it during time of broadcast 
		whatever happens happens  all you have
		to do is tune in

	miriam gives stargher an alcohol bath the clinical procedure
	taking on the quality of ritual  her wash cloth moves under

				catherine
		then he should like this

	catherine connects stargher to the suspension apparatus and
	it hoists him off the table

				catherine contd
		theyre comforted by the feeling of
		weightlessness  like floating in water

	henry catches ramsey poking his nose near a third suit and
	apparatus in the dressing area

				henry
		dont touch that please

				ramsey
		sorry

	miriam prepares a series of chemical cartridges and loads
	them into a container connected to the ivlike tubes linked
	to the suspension device

				miriam
			intimate quiet
		this isnt your responsibility 
		remember that  dont let them use guilt
		as a tool  if you want to stop say so

				catherine
		ill be fine

				miriam
		she said convincingly

	catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary
	connections  reluctantly miriam retreats to the monitoring
	station  she locks down the procedure room and joins
	henry novak and ramsey at the console

				novak
			eyes on the chemicaldrug
			monitors
		thats the stuff

				henry
		about twelve years of research right
		miriam

				miriam
		dont remind me

				ramsey
		what is it  are they  exactly

	thats like asking her to explain the rules of cricket

				miriam
		psychostimulants serotonin
		stabilizers meprobamate neurontin
		lithium carbonate  and my baby  it
		duplicates and expands upon the effects
		of a chemical called oxytocin forcing a
		break in the neuron connections that
		hold experience  so new experience can
		form

	ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods but novak is
	fascinated  catherine presses the bump on her hand  a red
	indicator light flashes on

				henry
		theres a touchsensitive microchip
		implanted in her hand  if she becomes
		frightened disoriented or simply wants
		to end the session she signals us to
		abort

	catherine presses again and the red light shuts off

				miriam
		although none of what she experiences is
		real she can be tricked into thinking
		it is  the mind is awfully gullible so
		she needs to monitor herself

	catherine and stargher are suspended from the ceiling  henry
	types and the lights dim to a more somber tranquil level 
	various screens flicker to life displaying the vital signs
	of both feed and receive  miriam initiates the injection
	program

				miriam contd
		catherine  im about to start  if you
		want me to wait or

				catherine
		no  no

	in the procedure room we see chemicals mix with her blood
	then feed the iv  at the console as henry types furiously
	at the computer keyboard novak asks miriam

				novak
		you said she has a gift

	overhearing henry interrupts pointing at a section of
	catherines mind map

				henry
		not a gift  a highly evolved area in
		her cerebral cortex thats all  a
		genetic fluke

				miriam
		catherine has a tremendous capacity for
		empathy
			clarifies
		when we started there were a number of
		test subjects  other therapists  who
		acted as receivers  all they did was
		observe and report  nothing more  but
		catherine she had the ability to feel
		what was happening  she understood 
		and the patient responded  edward
		engaged her in dialogue took her
		places showed her things  he knew she
		cared

	a hopeful solemn novak gazes through the window watching
	catherines body as it becomes parallel to starghers

	in the procedure room catherine takes a deep breath and as
	the drugs take effect feels herself losing consciousness 
	she glances at stargher a man who tortures and kills women
	then looks up as the cloth mask descends from the ceiling

				miriam os contd
		intravenous administration complete

				henry os
		initiating connection

	we follow fibrous wires running from catherines mask to
	starghers  their blood mixing with chemicals in the ivlike
	containers  the computer system humming

				henry os contd
		transfer begins 1100 hours 34 minutes
		12 seconds

	catherines eye focuses on the mask  as it comes closer we
	see the lining is laced with threadlike wires and microchips
	forming hyperminiature circuit boards  catherines eye
	blinks  the mask covers her face  catherines eye shuts

	vision fades  darkness  a faint light  microscopic veins
	in the eyelid become wires connected to chips  and were
	moving into the circuitry

	entrance one

	int starghers world

	the pattern of the electronics grows into something more
	organic textured concrete  evolving into a world  black
	and shadowfilled it resembles a labyrinthine complex of
	vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its
	core

	our journey into this bleak grim place continues and we
	occasionally glimpse brief images of a boys baptism

	intercut with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness
	and fragmented visions of catherine connected to the
	apparatus face masked descending into this world

	there is an abrupt shift from still images to regular motion
	and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with
	tiny fish and tadpoles  at waters edge lying on rough
	pebblestrewn ground is a hand

	catherines hand  we sense movement but she remains still 
	from the darkness comes a dog  black in color and
	featureless it sniffs catherine dismisses her and meanders
	into a cubicle opposite her disappearing from view  after a
	moment of odd quiet a drop of blood hits the mask and we
	follow catherines hand as it moves to the cloth and removes
	it from her own face

	in macroscopic super slowmotions another blood droplet
	sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down hitting a red
	ant catapulting it onto what looks like a tree but is just
	a twig  as the insect scurries away more drops pound the
	earth splatter against twig trees and explode into pools
	of stagnant water

	as we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the
	world into which catherine descended

	she sits up shivering and breathes deeply acclimating to
	her surroundings  the floor is covered with filth ash
	pebbles and insects  water is present in many forms
	puddles moisture dripping ceilings

	eyes focusing queasy not fully awake catherine notices
	the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets
	showering the air  she turns and finds the source

	the black dog stands in the opposite room next to a tub full
	of blood shaking himself dry after his bath  satisfied
	the animal stops and trots away  still adjusting to this
	nightmarish realm catherine at first doesnt hear it but
	then realizes that somewhere a child is crying  she looks
	around then through a crack in the floor briefly catches
	sight of a boy beneath her on a level lower than hers  as
	he disappears into corridor ending in nothing we pull back
	to show a massive landscape of blocks cubicles crawlspace
	walls stairs and ladders  leading everywhere and nowhere

	catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific room 
	shortly after a light comes on within the cubicle and she
	moves to it  we feel as though were looking at a series of
	interlocked tenement rooms some walls of which have been
	torn away to expose rooms within rooms with no windows or
	doors  following a path of fragile steps catherine makes
	her way to the lighted room and enters

	int starghers world  lighted room

	a mottled horse stands with its head down nose kissing the
	floor allowing the boy to caress its neck  this sweet
	animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and
	catherine approaches with respect

				catherine
		hello

	the frightened child retreats into a corner of the
	claustrophobic room but the horse does not startle 
	surprisingly  to the boy  the horse takes an affectionate
	step toward catherine inviting her to take over  catherine
	allows the mare to smell her then vigorously scratches along
	the mane and shoulder much to the horses delight

				catherine contd
		yeah you like that dont you

	she can see the boy hiding in the corner stealing glances at
	her from the shadows

				catherine contd
		is your name carl

	the boy  young stargher  is startled and intrigued by the
	question  how did she know that  but says nothing

				catherine contd
		another little boy i know he has a
		horse too

	the boy reacts to an unusual sound coming from the ceiling

				catherine contd
		his names edward  the boy not the
		horse

	the boy takes a few steps toward her out of the shadows but
	he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than
	connecting with catherine  very anxiously he looks at the
	wall behind catherine and watches an old windup kitchen
	timer click down

				catherine contd
		whats the matter carl

	again a sharp sound from the ceiling

				catherine contd
		whats wro

	young stargher runs at her and shoves her hard  catherine
	falls back just as eight sheets of glass drop from the
	ceiling  like oversize razor blades they slice the horse
	into four clean sections  they separate and compact the
	quadrants until four glasscontained sections of dissected
	horse stand within the room  catherine screams but the mare
	barely acknowledged what happened  betraying no emotion the
	boy runs  the shaken catherine takes a moment to collect
	herself then gives chase

	int starghers world  the labyrinth

	young stargher knows his way around the landscape but
	catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight  she
	runs climbs and crawls  until shes utterly lost and
	disoriented  tired and having difficulty breathing she
	drops to her knees and cools down  she hears a noise
	nearby gets to her feet and finds a geared mechanism
	connected to some kind of shuttered door composed of an
	almost metalliclooking glass  curious yet cautious she
	examines the nearby walls floor and ceiling for any signs
	of traps akin to the glass blades  finding none she pulls
	the mechanism and quickly steps back

	the shutter opens and catherine knows theres something alive
	in the tiny cubicle beyond  she retreats into shadow
	hiding  released from the chamber is a woman  as she moves
	out of a darkness we see victim one

	ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb she appears to
	sense the presence of a stranger targets catherine in the
	shadows and attacks

	catherines had enough and moves to press the implant but
	the victim is already there 
	she brutally grabs catherine throws her against the wall and
	smacks her head against it  catherine drops to the floor
	like a rag doll

	victim one hefts catherine onto her shoulder and with great
	purpose carries her deep into the labyrinth toward the
	core  passing in and out of consciousness between darkness
	and light a dazed catherine is taken on a tour of
	starghers world  passing mausoleumlike chambers filled
	with images of unspeakable horror andor disturbing
	intensity  at one of the rooms we think we see young
	stargher silently observing

	sitting of standing in individual cubicles are starghers
	other victims two thru six each woman resembling the
	grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in
	starghers basement  dressed by a fetishistic sadist nine
	inch nails meets the brides of dracula they resemble bored
	housewives barely acknowledging the new member of the
	harem
	
	
	int starghers world  the core

	victim one drops catherine in the center of the room and job
	done crawls away

	groggy feeling sick catherine sits up  unbeknownst to her
	she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the
	kind of throne  and someone is there  in the dim pool of
	light above the pedestal we see a man rise from the throne 
	the wall behind him is covered in blood red cloth and as he
	descends we realize it is a cape connected to eight metal
	rings pierced through the flesh of his back  in a fluid
	motion waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as
	the man reaches the floor  catherine knows he is there 
	unable to stop herself she turns  and sees the terrifying
	face of stargher  but no the same stargher

	this is stargher king

				stargher king
			primitive guttural
		where you come from priddy thing

	in a split second catherine presses the implant on her hand

	int campbell center  conference room  day

	apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated
	novak sits crosslegged on the floor shoes off analyzing
	recent photos and documents sent to him via courier 
	ignoring a snoring ramsey napping on a nearby cot novak
	looks at blowups from the videos blueprints of starghers
	house detailed shots of the basement and a draftsmans
	conceptual drawing of the cell itself

				henry vo
		gentlemen

	novak looks at an intercom speaker

				henry vo contd
		shes back

	novak doesnt wait for his juststirring partner and moves

	int campbell center  laboratory

	as he enters novak sees a concerned henry checking a print
	out of the procedure

				novak
		what happened

				henry
		mustve been rather unusual

	noting novaks confusion henry points to a central monitor
	resembling a futuristic vu meter gradiated in sections of
	white yellow orange and red

				henry contd
			re whiteyellow area
		if her neural activity stays within this
		range i know shes selfcognitive
			clarifies
		as if she were having a dream but she
		knows shes dreaming  she can wake up
		any time she wants to

	as ramsey joins them novak nods understanding but his eyes
	are on catherine whos just coming back to consciousness

				henry contd
			re orange section
		however if her level of involvement is
		rather intense as it was just now she
		can perceive things as true  its
		difficult to keep perspective

	as novak lingers on that question ramsey gestures at the red
	section

				ramsey
		what happens here

				henry
		we dont talk about that

				novak
		what happens

				henry
		well theoretically while shes inside 
		if she came to believe that starghers
		world is her world her mind has the
		power to convince the body that anything
		done to it is um actually done

	novak doesnt like the sound of that

				henry contd
		thats why we monitor the use of the
		drugs so closely  we dont want her
		getting to that degree of perceptual
		disorientation

				miriam
		pump in two liters of pure oxygen
		please henry

	henry types a command and novak speaks into the intercom

				novak
		dr kent

	in the procedure room miriam eases catherine back to
	consciousness

				miriam
		deep breaths

	when she sees stargher catherines flesh crawls

				catherine
		is it cold in here

				miriam
		what happened

	no response

				miriam contd
		whats wrong

	incapable of being in the same room as him catherine tears
	out of the apparatus and anxiously exits

				miriam contd
		catherine

	in the procedure room

				novak
		ill get her

	int campbell center  day

	a worried novak searches the halls of the campbell center 
	hes about to ask the staff for help but stops when he sees
	through the window to edwards room

	int campbell center  edwards room

	catherine sits next to the boys bed holding edwards hand
	softly singing a lullaby to him to herself  feeling that
	he must speak to her novak intervenes

				novak
		edward baines i presume
			to the catatonic child
		hi ed  im pete

				catherine
		do you think thats funny

				novak
		no  not at all  from what i
		understand he knows im here isnt
		that right

	catherine nods  novak picks up edwards fallen teddy bear
	and rests it in the crook of the childs arm

				novak contd
		i read about a woman in texas who was in
		a coma for seven years  every time her
		husband came to visit her heart would
		beat faster  isnt that something  i
		dont know what name scientists have for
		something like that

				catherine
		it doesnt have much to do with science

				novak
		what then

				catherine
		the soul  the spirit  whatever you
		want to call it

				novak
		ah the part of us that cant be
		explained

	she appreciates his understanding  and finds herself
	comforted by his presence  catherine scrutinizes novak his
	intensity his honesty his complexity  and asks

				catherine
		agent novak

				novak
		peter okay

				catherine
		do you feel theres a side of yourself
		you dont show people

	the question catches novak offguard but hes willing to
	answer  anything to get her talking

				novak
		absolutely
			realizing its too personal
		i suppose everyone does

				catherine
		just like we all have fantasies right 
		things only we know that we dont
		share

				novak
		thats what therapists are for right

	catherine laughs  it helps her relax  if only slightly

				catherine
		during the sessions  when im inside 
		i see those things  what a person
		hides what they despite what they want
		to control  with stargher

	this is difficult for her

				catherine contd
		with stargher i saw things

				novak
		what did you see

				catherine
			professionally
		a kingdom  his utopia 
		life without consequence or restriction 
		hes not even carl stargher anymore 
		hes this idealized version of
		himself who can do anything he
		pleases without fear  a horrible
		primitive ugly thing
			uncomfortable re edward
		i dont want to talk in here

	she kisses edwards forehead and exits

	int campbell center  conference roomcourtyard  day

	catherine and novak sit on a bench in the center of the
	courtyard  john tracy is visible in the reception area
	unable to sleep desperately trying to fight frustration

				catherine
		whyd you bring him here

				novak
		youre the shrink you tell me

				catherine
			already knows
		as soon as i met him you knew id say
		yes  he makes julia real for me

	novak nods  guilty

				novak
		its an old lawyer trick  target the
		emotions  do it right you get a
		reluctant witness to testify a scared
		kid to confess

	catherine looks at him with disbelief  you

				novak contd
		before i was with the bureau i was an
		attorney a prosecutor  mr law and
		order  and then i had a murder case
		in north carolina  charles gish 
		butchered seventeen people in three
		days  and because of one tiny piece of
		tainted evidence he walked
			no regrets
		thats when i quit the das office and
		joined the fbi

	catherine can see the pain and frustration in novaks eyes 
	she gives him a moment and asks

				catherine
		you thought stargher wanted to be
		caught

				novak
		i did yeah

				catherine
		you were right  theres a part of him
		that knows the truth  about what he
		did about himself

	novaks curiosity is piqued

				novak
		what about julia

				catherine
		this is going to sound terrible but
		i dont think she matters anymore  not
		to him  he never finished her  the
		othershe was able to make them his

				novak
		you think you can do this dont you

				catherine
		he might tell me about julia  the part
		of him that wants to help that feels
		shame and remorse  who wants to be
		redeemed

				novak
			skeptically
		this is stargher were talking about

				catherine
		not stargher not really  hes split
		himself right down the middle 
		goodevil rightwrong mercifulcruel 
		a monster  and an innocent child  if i
		could reach the boy

				novak
		whoa  hold on  arent they the same
		guy

				catherine
		dont you feel there are different sides
		to every personality  maybe even the
		worst of us is capable of one decent
		act  were all human

				novak
		its hard for me to see stargher as
		human capable of something like
		remorse

				catherine
		then what is he

				novak
		evil

				catherine
		if you believe that

				novak
		maybe this is a big fucking waste of
		time

				catherine
			sensing something
		what happened to charles gish

	novak doesnt respond  she prods him

				catherine contd
		what happened

				novak
		what difference does it make

				catherine
		tell me

	god he does not want to do this

				novak
		right after the trial the night after
		he was released  mr and mrs frank
		simmons found charlie sitting in their
		living room watching tv with their
		twelveyear old daughter margaret  hed
		cut her right down the middle with a
		carving knife

				novak contd
		found the girls heart in the freezer 
		he thought they might want to keep it
			grim humor
		luckily the next thing he did was slit
		his own throat
			bleakly
		i am convinced of one thing 
		charles gish couldve been raised by
		ozzie and harriet and the same thing
		wouldve happened

	he can see catherine doesnt accept that

				novak contd
		a child can experience abuse worse than
		charlies  and grow up to be someone
		who would never ever hurt another
		living thing

				catherine
		youre sure of that

				novak
		yes  i am

	catherine realizes that was a confession

				ramsey os
		where the hell you been

	they turn to see ramsey

				novak
		right here

				ramsey
		next time tell me okay

				novak
		but you looked so cute  all sleepy

	ramsey shoots him a murderous look then asks catherine

				ramsey
		your colleagues want to know what to do
		with stargher

	novak looks to catherine for the answer  through the window
	blinds she watches john tracy lower his head

				catherine
		tell them to prep him  and that ill be
		right there

	ramsey nods and heads back to the lab

				novak
		thank you

	briefly he touches her hand  catherine looks away from john
	to novaks hand to the photographs on the wall  starghers
	house valentine the pickup truck  valentine

				catherine
		i need something

	int campbell center  corridor  day

	a k9 unit fbi agent escorts valentine to the lab

	int campbell center  laboratory  day

	as the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring
	area catherine and valentine share a moment of connection 
	slowly confidently she approaches the shepherd kneels and
	removes his leash and muzzle  she strokes him and the dog
	instantly warms up to her

				fbi k9 agent
		sure wasnt like that with me

	novak signs a document and the k9 agent exits

				catherine
		youre a good boy arent you
		valentine

	the dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves
	it catherine and novak following

	in the procedure room stargher lies face down on a gurney 
	now taped to the wall near stargher are pictures from the
	basement  his dolls the hoist etc  miriam in surgical
	mask and gloves carefully reinserts the metal rings taken
	from an fbi evidence bag into the eight straps of flesh on
	his back  when he sees this valentine whimpers and hides 
	catherine comforts him  miriam finishes her task and removes
	her mask

				miriam
		i hate to admit it but theres
		something perversely satisfying about
		this

				henry
		i think thats the whole point

	valentine runs to his sleeping master and barks at
	catherine as if asking for help  she encourages the animal
	to lick and sniff starghers face and hands

				henry os contd
		thats interesting

	in the control room he scrutinizes the monitor showing the
	detailed map of starghers brain

				henry contd
		increased neural activity in the frontal
		lobes  rising dopamine levels in the
		basal ganglia  ever since the dog
		walked in

	in the procedure room catherine readies herself in the
	receive apparatus  as stargher is lifted off the pedestal
	the doors hiss shut and valentine curls up on the floor
	beneath his master  as catherine is lifted she smiles at
	the animal then looks to stargher

				novak
			comforting and coaching her
		remember julia hickson is priority
		number one  nothing else matters  find
		out where she is

				catherine
		okay okay

	lights flicker  catherines eyes shut  fade to black

				henry os
		uhoh

	lights flicker  we hear an electrical hum rise and fall 
	catherine opens her eyes and the lights blink on and off in a
	weird pattern making it difficult to see clearly

				catherine
		dont kid around henry

	her suspension apparatus descends on the floor

				henry os
		im not  its a power problem  i need
		you to go to the circuit breaker and
		check switches six through twelve

	catherine moves toward the electrical panel

				henry os contd
		try to stay awake okay

				catherine
		yeah yeah yeah  im not sleepy

	as she moves toward the panel everything becomes larger  by
	the time catherine reaches the circuit breaker it is the
	size of a garage door  curiouser and curiouser

	she turns around to see the laboratory is empty and dead
	quiet  and she sees herself  catherine as small as a mouse
	trapped in a giant walled space

	at the console novak miriam and henry observe the procedure
	room  and catherine  suspended in the apparatus 
	motionless

	entrance two

	int starghers world

	catherine turns to see catherine lying in the fetal
	position locked in a box made of thick clean glass  the
	electronic hum becomes rhythmic ambient noise inside the
	box staying calm she searches for and finds a trap door on
	the floor  she pushes out  the camera executes a complete
	180degree perspective change

	catherine plummets  she tries to reach out to stop her
	descent but cannot

	catherine falls through a dark cavernous room resembling a
	mammoth hollowedout rib cage  below her is a domelike
	structure growing out of the floor a hole in the center of
	its crest  dozens of other such domes are visible in the
	murky hellhole but catherine has no choice  shes dropping
	into this one

	once she passes through the hole inside the dome
	catherines body looks as though its moving through water
	but there is no water  like an aerial artist she reverses
	her position so shes heads up  standing stable on the
	floor  sensing something with her  and knows it is

				catherine
		valentine

	out from the darkness moving in normal motion comes the
	white german shepherd but in the thick haze his face is
	indistinct and ghostly

				catherine contd
		hi sweetie

	and as she steps toward him his face dissolves into a stark
	landscape  an ear becomes a hill the nose a stone mouth a
	path and the eye a house 
	young stargher retreats towards the bleak structure as
	catherine enters frame  seeing the invitation she presses
	on

	int starghers world  boyhood home  kitchen

	young stargher is at the sink washing dishes an anxious eye
	on the clock

				catherine
		need some help

	as catherine enters the claustrophobic house the boy
	hesitantly pushes a towel toward her but doesnt look  she
	reaches the counter and starts to dry much to young
	starghers relief  as he washes catherine hands him a
	mirror locket just like edwards

				catherine contd
		carl i want to give you a present

	hes hypnotized by the thing his eyes lighting up

				catherine contd
		if you need me or if you feel that im
		around but cant find me just shine it
		like this

	she shines reflected light onto the walls  carl hands
	catherine the wet plate and takes the locket  the dish slips
	from her fingers and shatters on the floor  the boys eyes
	fill with dread  the kitchen clock reads 530  he pushes
	catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside

				catherine contd
		whats wrong honey

	with a finger to his lips he pockets the locket and shuts
	the door  from within the closet she watches the terrified
	child through a crack in the door  in the kitchen young
	stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate 
	startlingly his father martin stargher is already in the
	room  cruel imposing manipulative man

				martin
		what did you do know  you make a mess 
		i hate a mess

	young stargher backs into a corner fearing what will come

				martin contd
		dont lie now carl

	in the closet catherine pushes but the door wont budge 
	she pounds  in the kitchen we hear no sound

				martin contd
		remember what i said about liars  liars
		will be punished

	int closet  continuous

	catherine hears the child scream  but the scream comes from
	behind and she spins around

	int starghers world  living room

	young stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly middle
	aged woman barely wearing a mans robe  on a nearby table
	are whisky tumblers and an ashtray filled with butts

				woman
		i got you a present cutiepie

	she gives him a toy doll  drunk she hugs and kisses him 
	embarrassed the boy tries to squirm away

				woman contd
		oh no  youre not going anywhere

	martin enters and sneers at the boy

				martin
		go back to bed worm

				woman
		its okay we was just

				martin
		shut up cunt

	the woman cowers familiar with his violent moods  the boy
	hurries to his room but martin grabs him by the collar

				martin contd
		what is that

	he pulls the doll from the childs hands turns to the woman

	the poor boy trembles with fear  and martin notices a puddle
	of urine on the floor  he drops the boy and laughs

				martin contd
		little worm pissed his pants

	humiliated carl covers himself and hides in a corner 
	martin and the woman laugh and laugh delighting in the boys
	humiliation

	int closet

	feeling the boys shame catherine turns and finds a faded
	postcard taped to the wall

	int starghers world  bedroom

	martin has discovered his sons secret hiding place  a
	camouflaged corner of the attic  arranged in deliberate
	artistic fashion are scavenged dolls  heads limbs and
	torsos held together with twine tape and wire  some wrapped
	in filthy plastic  faded photographs including one of his
	mother mementos and most disturbingly the feathers and
	bones of dead birds insect carcasses and dissected
	desiccated mice  theres something peculiarly beautiful
	here but martin doesnt see it  not at all

				martin
		only girls play with dolls

	he turns and we see carl is bound to a wooden support beam a
	piece of tape covering his mouth  the boy is stripped to the
	waste barely conscious face streaked with tears and sweat

				martin contd
		what kind of thing are you

	int closet

	a weird noise snaps catherine back to reality  she turns
	just as a door opens behind her  responding to the
	invitation she moves through it

	int starghers world  bathroom

	the adult carl stargher sits at the edge of the tub his back
	to us smoking a cigarette  a white german shepherd puppy
	clicks across the tile floor and yips at catherine  she
	again hears the weird noise  a stainless steel bowl wobbles
	as starghers bloody rubbergloved hands fill it with
	something  stargher knows shes there and isnt surprised by
	her presence but hes not sure what to make of her  what to
	do with her  he rises and walks past her to the sink  he
	pulls off the gloves and washes his hands glancing at her in
	the mirror

	catherine cannot resist looking in the tub  she sees a dead
	girl her torso sliced open  disgusted and mortified she
	pulls back

				stargher os

				stargher os contd
		didnt know what i was doing

	and reaches for the knob  but the doors not there  scritch
	scritchscritch  she can still hear the dog but theres no
	damn door  she turns

	no door  no window  the girls body and bloody remains have
	vanished  an overhead light flickers on giving the room the

				stargher os contd

	catherine turns back to the wall calm and intimidating
	stargher stands in the center regarding her with great
	curiosity  catherines ready to press the sensor

				stargher contd

	int starghers world  bathroom

	a wave of fear of impending doom overtakes catherine

				stargher king

				stargher king contd
		me god want you stay

	stargher king straddles catherine and pins her arms behind
	her back  shes unable to touch the sensor  with the tip of
	the tool he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of
	her suit

				stargher king contd
		me god mek you beaudiful

	he shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger  
	a collar clamps shut around catherines neck and

	she blacks out

	int campbell center  laboratory

	a sensor alarm sounds on the computer  henry and miriam
	express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red
	and move to the map of catherines mind  as it becomes
	cool starghers becomes hot

				miriam
		son of a bitch

	in the procedure room valentine barks  startling everyone 
	the dog growls and backs away  as if he senses something
	horribly wrong within his master

	in the control room novak questions the scientists

				novak
		when we got here you just topped and
		pulled her out

				miriam
		that was with edward  shes accustomed
		to his world  starghers mind is

				novak
		into stargher  inside

				miriam
		yes

	novak knows who that person will be

	int cell  day

	fueling herself with candy and juice julia examines the cell
	for a way out but finds tight seals everywhere  the shower
	erupts with water   she counts until thirty it stops 
	shivering julia stars at the drain as the water spirals
	down

				julia
			trying to remember the words
		our father who art in heaven hallowed
		be thy name  thy kingdom come thy will
		be done

	on the other side of the glass we watch her through oneway
	glass from the video cameras pointofview  she looks right
	at us in the mirror saddened by the dark circles under
	her bloodshot eyes

				julia contd
		on earth as it is in heaven

	we drift to the right and see the led counters clicking
	away  014454 014453 014452 less than two hours to
	live and she has no idea

	int campbell center  laboratory

	in the procedure room novak lies in a hastilyrigged third
	apparatussuspension device  miriam connects him to the iv
	cylinder and tubes

				miriam
		i have done this you know  been
		inside

				novak
		no

	miriam nods knowing he wont accept an opposing argument

				miriam
			instructs him
		deep breaths

	in the observation room henry adjusts monitors showing
	novaks vital signs

				henry
		pulse is rapid pressures a little
		high

	in the procedure room miriam asks

				miriam
		nervous

				novak
		absolutely

	she loads a microchip sensor into a highpressure injection
	gun and implants it in novaks hand  he winces from the
	brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges

				miriam
		i have to ask you some things are you
		taking any prescription drugs

				novak
		prevacid  for my stomach

				miriam
		any psychiatric medication

		i doubt that

	henry checks the maps  catherines vitals and reports

				henry
		we should hurry

	miriam walks novak through whats about to happen

				miriam
		the first five minutes will be
		disorienting  give yourself time  let
		the drugs do the work  if you can see
		smell feel hear taste things  youre
		on the right track  once youve
		acclimated try to get a feeling for
		catherine  instinct plays a huge role
		in this  trust it

	she gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder exits and
	shuts the door  in the observation room miriam continues
	via intercom

				miriam contd
		you can control how you see yourself 
		clothes shoes that kind of thing  but
		the rest of it is up to him  use only
		what he provides  dont try to change
		anything  or introduce something of
		your own  itll only upset him

	in the procedure room novak flexes his fingers and sees the
	little bump beneath his flesh

				henry os
		agent novak  press the sensor

	novak does and the red light comes on  as novak is lifted
	he looks at catherine then stargher  valentine yips and
	settles beneath novak  the suspension device clicks into
	place and the mask descends

				miriam os
		no matter what happens peter remember
		one thing its not real

	novaks eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the ivlike
	cylinder  a liquid cloud of his blood grows within 
	preparing the mixture for injection

	the viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the camera
	moves into the mixture  as blood and chemical swirls take
	shape we move fast  deeper into the fluid at a molecular
	level  we feel like were soaring over some kind of liquid
	landscape

	novak hyperventilates  hes having difficulty making the 98
	transition

	flying faster faster faster  through an entire universe

	novak is in the procedure room  alone  his face contorted
	as if feeling the effects of tremendous gforce

	entrance three

	int starghers world

	clouds hover above a dark gloomy landscape dotted with
	hills  three identical women sit on black earth their
	bodies positioned in a uniform pattern  pull back to reveal
	novak at their feet in a kneeling fetal position face down
	in the gritty soil a piece of cloth draped over his head 
	with difficulty practically inhaling black grit novak
	breathes deeply and rises to his knees  his hand moves to
	his face and hes briefly astounded by the texture of the
	gravel the sharpness of it against his face  removing the
	shroudlike cloth he looks at the soil smells it tastes
	it

				mother one os
		have you seen him

	novak finds the first of the three  visions of starghers
	mother  addressing him  she like the other two speaks in
	a ghostly monotone nearly devoid of emotion

				mother one contd
		my boy my little one  his father took
		him from me  have you seen him

	as she continues almost mantralike woman two begins

				mother two
			similar monotone
		my child is an abomination  he is
		damned  he has no soul

	the womens repetitive monologues overlap  aurual layers
	now added by three

				mother three
		me god me boy  me god good son

	novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings  the sights
	sounds and feel of the place  like being within a dream  as
	he backs away from the odd quartet shimmering light dances
	across his face  shading his eyes  novak searches for the
	source

	opposite him across the valley is a sheer rock wall  a
	massive cliff face pockmarked with rough windows  like a
	star the light sparkles inside one of them a fragment of
	mirror reflecting a beam away from novaks face to a path
	cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall

	the light guiding him novak follows the path and starts to
	climb finding stairs or ladders passing deep seemingly
	infinite passages  like tombs or the drawers of a
	mausoleum  deep within one of them the light flickers 
	fades  and novak crawls into darkness

	int starghers world  the den

	novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence 
	the place reeks of sex pain lust and cruelty  as he moves
	deeper into the chamber novak sees young stargher perched
	atop some kind of pedestal crouching fingering his mirror
	locket bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of
	the room

	the flickering light pinpoints a figure emerging from the
	darkness  it is catherine  altered to an image of
	starghers victims  her skin face clothing eyes are just
	like the victims  its a shocking strange image made even
	more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face  novak
	is staggered by the sight  his vision and hearing become
	affected by blurred vision sharp sounds  then focus to
	clarity as he reminds himself

				novak
		not real

	like an ethereal queen of the damned she strides toward him
	narrowing her eyes

				novak contd
		catherine

	she exhibits no recognition of her name  catherine
	seductively moves closer to novak their bodies almost
	touching her hands caressing his hair lips neck

				novak contd
		jesus  catherine  listen to me

	she presses her finger to his lips and forces him down onto
	the floor his back to the pedestal  catherine straddles
	novak and when he tries to stand she holds him down
	forcing him to stay

				novak contd
		listen to me

	she steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a male
	figure coming toward them coming into the light  novak is
	utterly unaware of whats happening  catherine is keeping
	him occupied  waiting for the arrival of

	stargher king

	catherine laughs  novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of
	the monster before stargher king grabs him by the throat and
	smashes his head against a pedestal

	blackout

	int starghers world  the den

	eyelids rise and flutter  novak becomes conscious  and
	instantly realizes whats happened

	he lies on the pedestal face up spreadeagle his wrists
	and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery
	cords  standing over him in a pool of light is stargher
	king  wearing what could be seen as ceremonial garb a
	silent solemn stargher king prepares himself for execution
	of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of
	shiny sharp macabre tools

	novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself not real 
	he opens them breathes deeply and focuses on catherine

				novak
		youre catherine young  you majored in
		psych at uc san diego  you work for
		sunerset industries

	stargher kings fingers pass over an array of horrific
	instruments  the throat piercercollar mechanism a cleaver
	knife a misshapen hammer a long slender needle

				novak contd
		your grandmother raised you after your
		parents died in a car crash

	stargher king lifts the bladelike needle  so far catherine
	looks at novak like hes speaking gibberish

				novak contd
		when you were twentyone you were
		arrested for possession and got off with
		community service

	stargher king slices through novaks clothes exposing the
	flesh of his abdomen

				novak contd
			reminding himself
		not real petethis is not real
			urgency
		you had to work at a center for abused
		kids for three months  you stayed on
		two years for no pay  you give half
		your fucking salary to the nursing home
		your grandmother stays at

	stargher king grabs his throat and traces the blade down the
	center of novaks torso  novak struggles and pleads with
	catherine

				novak contd
		i know this because i work for the fbi 
		peter novak remember
			a desperate request
		remember  you are cath

	stargher king cuts his flesh and inserts the needle into his
	stomach  novak screams  this fucking hurts

				novak contd
		help me

	stargher king wiggles the needle pulls it out and digs his
	finger into the wound  novak cries in pain

				novak contd
			tears forming horrified
		fucking feels real

	the intensity of novaks cries hit catherine like a
	thunderbolt  theres a glimmer of life of recognition in
	her eyes

				stargher king
			finally speaking
		me god gut you like a dear

	although we dont see it we hear something awful  like
	stargher king fishing around inside the wound  a pale
	sweating novak tries to stay conscious  he will not go into
	shock

				novak
		not real  not real  not real

	a female hand grabs the tool from the tray

				stargher king
			mimicking novak laughing
		nod reel nod reel nod reel

	stargher king is slammed from behind  catherine rams the
	thing through his throat   as stargher king stumbles away
	gagging blood pouring form his neck we see that she has
	returned to normal  the bride persona is gone  as
	stargher king emits animalistic growls catherine turns and
	sees an intact novak standing next to her  as if nothing had
	happened

	catherine and novak run out of the den into the tunnel from
	which novak gained access  he stops ready to press the
	sensor when a flicker of light dances across catherines
	face

				catherine
		wait

				novak
		like hell wait

	but she wont listen and hes forced to play catch up as she
	moves further from the den toward the cliff face  the
	flicker of light shines on the entrance to a specific tunnel

				catherine
		he wants us to follow  the little
		boy

				novak
		little boy  thats him

				catherine
		he brought you to me didnt he  if you
		want julia to live trust me  trust
		him

	int tunnelcubbyhole

	on her hands and knees she enters the tunnel not waiting
	for him to respond  she knows what hell do catherine and
	novak crawl through the dark grimy claustrophobic space
	playing with his mirror locket

				catherine
		carl

	he so desperately wants her affection but fear prevents him
	from reaching out to her

				catherine contd
		this is peter

	scared he shakes his head no

				catherine contd
		dont be scared  youre my friend and i
		would never hurt you

	she extends her hand  ohsohesitantly he takes it

				catherine contd
		will you take us to her  to julia

	shyly hesitantly he nods  she smiles gratefully and
	affectionately touches the boys face  clasping her hand
	young stargher leads catherine and novak into utter darkness

	int starghers world  the idealized cell

	more stylized than the actual cell its bigger and ornately
	decorated with the atmosphere of a church  individual
	images hang like shrines each showing julia hickson from
	different angles

	central to the room is a window into the cell itself  where
	we find a beautiful mermaidlike julia hickson floating in
	water  peaceful joyous

	in the center of the room we find novak and catherine she
	holding the hand of young stargher he stunned at the sight
	of julia  the child looks at catherine with beatific sad
	eyes regarding her as one would a saviour

				novak
		where the hell are we

				catherine
		carl do you know  like on a map

	he shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder

				catherine contd
		its okay its okay  you helped so
		much already  im proud of you

	as a frustrated novak searches for anything identifying
	catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad
	haunted eyes

				catherine contd
		carl i think i can help you  would you
		like that  even if peter cant find
		julia i want to help you

	the boy leans against her and she caresses his face

				catherine contd
		i promise

	novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell 
	mounted beneath the glass is a shiny perfect metal plaque
	reading carver industrial equipment with a logo  novak
	recognizes it from the hoist in starghers basement

				novak
		lets go

	he pulls her to her feet  feeling betrayed and rejected the
	child breaks away from her  the roar of stargher king shakes
	the cell  terrified the boy searches for a place to hide

				catherine
		carl

	novak feels whats coming

				novak
		come on

				catherine
		i cant leave him

	stargher king appears  his throat wounded bloody mess he
	descends out of dark nothingness howling with rage  he
	reaches for catherine but young stargher runs in front of
	her  

	stargher king clamps his massive arms around the child 
	little carl opens his mouth in a silent scream catherines
	arms reach out to him but novak clasps her hand and presses 
	and she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the
	arms of a monster

	int campbell center  laboratory

	henry notices significant activity on the monitors

				henry
		theyre back

	everything happens fast  he and miriam frantically cease the
	procedure 
	novak and catherine are lowered and novak startles them by
	quickly regaining consciousness  miriam attempts to inject
	him with stabilizing drugs but hes already trying to tear
	himself out of the apparatus

				novak
		get me out

	miriam moves into the procedure room

				novak contd
		get me out

	miriam tries to follow protocol but novak is moving like a
	fish caught in a net ripping and tearing his way out of the
	apparatus and suit  he gets to his feet but soon falls to
	his knees dizzy and disoriented

				miriam
		dont move

	novak is not listening  fighting off any aftereffects both
	physical and mental  he moves for the door

				miriam contd
		agent novak

	catherine is coming back and miriam moves to her  novak
	pauses just for a moment

				novak
		is she alright

				miriam
		yes  but youre going to sit down right
		now  i have to

	novak is already gone

	int campbell center  conference room

	novak speeddials a number on speakerphone hurriedly
	dresses and locates a photograph of starghers basement 
	when he hears someone pick up the line he barks

				novak
		this is novak whove i got

	a confused ramsey enters and listens

	int stargher house  basement

	a team of fbi agents is meticulously going through every inch
	of starghers house 
	crisscrossed wooden beams have been laid across the pit
	allowing forensics experts to search without disturbing
	anything  on the other end of the direct line is cole

				cole
		agent cole

	intercut with novak and ramsey

				novak
		i need you to find something in the
		basement

		find out the history of that machine 
		who bought it used it sold it  and
		check starghers pay stubs  i want to
		know every contractor he worked for 
		im calling you from the chopper in ten
		minutes

	dizziness and disorientation again hit novak  pale and
	sweating he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps

				ramsey
		jesus christ man you look like hell

				novak
		considering where ive been

	fighting the pain he gathers together maps slips on his
	shoes and grabs gun and holster  ramsey is apoplectic

				ramsey
		whoawhoawhoa  mind telling me what
		the fuck is happening

	 novak points to the photo of starghers basement
	specifically the hoist

				ramsey contd
		youre bettin the farm on something you

	novak is not stopping

	int campbell center  laboratory

	in the procedure room miriam shines the penlight into
	catherines eyes

				catherine
		a pocketful of rye

				miriam
		four and twenty blackbirds

				catherine
		baked in a pie

	at the console on a security monitor henry can see novak
	and ramsey exiting down the corridor

				henry
		the fbi has left the building

	in the procedure room miriam appears concerned

				miriam
		damn him

				catherine
		whats wrong

				miriam
		agent novak  i didnt get a chance to
		clear him

	catherine encourages her

				catherine
		go  im fine  go

	as miriam hurries to catch novak she tells henry

				miriam
		keep an eye on her

	he nods but isnt really paying attention  catherine turns
	to starghers motionless form still suspended still
	connected to the machinery

	int the cell  day

				julia
		do something julia

	she looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls
	the tile looking for a weak spot  she focuses on the
	ceiling panel and although its painful because of swollen
	fingers removes her engagement ring

	ext campbell center

	a readyandwaiting helicopter is on the pad  novak races
	out of the center ramsey right behind him shouting at each
	other in order to hear above the chopper noise

				ramsey
		pete listen to me  what did you really
		learn in there  anything new  you
		really think stargher gave you a save
		theday clue  what if this is all some
		kind of trick your head is playing on
		you

	he wont consider that  novak climbs into the helicopter and
	buckles himself in  he looks to ramsey  you coming 
	ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot
	to take off

	int campbell center  laboratory

	henry analyzes voluminous printouts from the last procedure 
	although his eyes are on the data he converses with
	catherine in the procedure room via intercom

				henry
		there was a moment when we thought
		wed lost agent novak as well

	we see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the
	procedure but henry is oblivious

				henry contd
		his postprocedure consciousness
		recovery was remarkably quick  never
		saw that before  hey remember that one
		time

	he jumps when the door to the procedure room seals shut and
	mechanisms hum

				henry contd
		catherine

	when he looks through the window catherine is again
	suspended the procedure under way

				henry contd
		what are you doing

	he types in a command but nothing happens  he tires again
	on another keyboard but gets no response  when he looks at
	the map screens he sees something odd  its a small
	change but it makes all the difference in the world
	
			int the cell  day

	like a rock climber in a crevasse julia shimmies up the
	walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using
	her hands and feet to push up  the tile is slippery and each
	movement precarious

	she uses strength and balance to reach a position just below
	the plexiglass the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie
	intense glow  she sees a gap between the glass and the wall
	and uses her engagement ring to dig into it scape scrape
	scraping with the diamond

	the shower sprays water  julia nearly loses her balance but
	manages to stay pressed into the corner  she kicks the
	shower head sending the spray as far from her as possible
	and continues to dig at the caulking around the light
	fixture

	in the observation room we see something unexpected  the
	clock reads 000000  that water isnt going to stop

	int campbell center  edwards room

	miriam and ramsey return to the lab to find henry anxiously
	observing from the console

				henry
			flustered
		she changed the codes

				miriam
		whats wrong

				henry
		it would take hours to reroute the
		system and even if i did i shouldnt

				ramsey
		what are you talking about

	miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully angrily
	worriedly realizes whats happened

				miriam
		shes done it  stupid stupid girl

				ramsey

				henry
		instead of going into his mind

				miriam
		shes bringing stargher into hers

	entrance four

	int catherines world

	a bright deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of
	things we saw in catherines home  unusual trees rock
	formations totems statues and a brilliant pool of water

	the pond ripples  visible through the crystalclear water is
	young stargher rising to the surface like a drowning victim
	suddenly breaking through to air  panicked he scrambles to
	shore and pulls himself to land  although the place is
	comforting and beautiful hes in strange territory and it
	frightens him  shivering he hunches down eyes darting this
	way and that

				catherine os
		youre all right carl

	the boy turns toward the voice and finds catherine her hair
	waving in the wind skin glowing eyes bright cutting a
	magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
	goddess 
	she opens her arms and the boy runs to her basking in the
	comfort of her embrace  he shivers and she holds him
	tightly

				catherine contd
		its okay honey youre with me now 
		youre safe here

	she looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains

				catherine contd
		i promised i would help you and i
		always keep my promises

				young stargher
		can

	catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak  a
	sad trembling little voice

				young stargher contd
		can i stay here

	she is touched that he would ask and strokes his face

				catherine
			regretfully
		ohno honey im sorry  its doesnt
		work that way

	the boy breaks away from her turning his back  she gently
	takes his hand but he yanks it free

				catherine contd
		but what if i told you you could come
		visit

	he slowly turns to her

				catherine contd
		ill make sure it happens carl  ill
		get them to let me do it  and maybe
		maybe we can

	young starghers eyes open wide with silent terror  over his
	shoulder she sees a snake slither through the pool 
	centipedes crawl over her legs and hair  she stands and
	brushes them off  the atmosphere grows darker and ominous

				young stargher
		he found me

	catherine bristles as stargher king rises from the pool like
	a human serpent  the brilliant colors of catherines world
	fade to grim tones

				young stargher contd
		he always finds me

	stargher king screeches with anger and confusion

				stargher king
		where thiisss att  me god no like id
		here

	he snarls when he sees catherine

				stargher king contd
		you  priddy bishhorkund  you big
		trubblemekker
			sneers at the boy
		and you  you cumm home now liddle
		cogsugger worm  or me god haffa punish
		you

	young stargher tightens his embrace of catherine  she steps
	back away from the pond hugging the boy tightly

				catherine
		no

				stargher king
		no

	stargher king laughs

				stargher king contd
		hoo you thing you are himm muther

	he comes close and reaches for the boy

				stargher king contd
		you gimme liddle worm

	for a moment catherine appears frightened and intimidated 
	perhaps near an emotional breakdown  but that is not the
	case  she quietly lowers little carl to the ground and
	whispers something in his ear  as the boy nods runs and
	hides a ferocity grows within her

				catherine
		i said no

	like a vengeful valkyrie she emits what can only be called a
	battle cry  stargher attacks  arms reaching for her 
	catherine blocks punches and kicks  stargher king doubles
	over  catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her
	bent knee breaking his nose

				catherine contd
		welcome to my world

	as blood flows from his nostrils stargher king grins

				stargher king
		you funny  you thing you stop me god

	he charges  at the right moment catherine sidesteps and
	smashes him in the ribs as he passes  stargher king crumples
	to the ground and she kicks an uppercut to this chin  rising
	from the mud and muck stargher king lands a powerful blow to
	her head sending her flying  he lifts the stunned catherine
	with one hand and pulls her face to his

				stargher king contd
		you cum back wif me god  you be good
		bishhorkund

	catherine looks into his soulless eyes  then spits in them
	and bites his face  she breaks free as he yowls with pain 
	he steps toward her but his feet dont move  the earth
	itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard like
	concrete  stargher king howls with frustration

				catherine
		my world

	a shimmering knife seems to enrage from within her forearm
	out the flesh and into her hand

				catherine contd
		my rules

	she slashes across his chest drawing blood

				young stargher os
		no

	catherine stops  and turns to see the distraught young
	stargher

				young stargher contd
		dont hurt him

	she spins around and sees not stargher king but martin

				young stargher contd
		he didnt mean it  i was bad

	disturbed by the transformation catherine backs away  her
	vision blurs the sound distorts  and the earth cracks
	around stargher kings ankles

				young stargher contd
		he teached me a lesson  i deserved it

	fighting feelings of disorientation she kneels before the
	child and rests the knife on the ground

				catherine
		no one deserves it carl  no one

	she reaches out to him but the child is jerked into the air
	by stargher king  in one hand the monster holds little
	carl  in the other  a knife  his face and chest red with
	crimson stargher king fixes his eyes on catherine with a
	predators stare

				stargher king
		yer world  my knife

	stargher king raises the blade toward the boys throat and 
	snap  the strong arms of an adult stargher breaks his arm at
	the elbow  both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground
	as stargher king yowls like a stuck pig the good arm
	cradling the other

				stargher king contd
		me god hurt  why you do that  why

				stargher
		enough

	stargher king regards him with disgust

				stargher king
		enuff

	martin starghers voice comes from the belly of the beast

				stargher
		ill tell you whats enough

	stargher and stargher king square off  the boy stands
	between them with the knife at his feet

				catherine
		carl

				stargher king
			still speaking as martin
		shut up cunt
			to the boy
		give it here worm

	the child picks up the blade and stands between them looking
	to catherine for guidance

				stargher king contd
			as martin
		you want a mommy  is that what you
		want

	in an almost dreamlike motion the child hands the blade to
	adult stargher

				stargher
		enough

	and he drives the thing into stargher kings heart  for a
	brief moment martins face is superimposed over stargher
	kings  stunned he slumps and regards adult stargher with
	sad troubled eyes

				martin
			as stargher king
		why  whatd i do

	stargher twists the handle of the blade and martinstargher
	king drops dead   dead  young stargher smiles and hugs
	catherine

				young stargher
		time to go way

				catherine
		carl

	the boy runs to adult stargher who lifts the child into his
	arms and holds him close

				young stargher
		bye

	she looks to adult stargher and begins to understand  he
	descends into the pool the boy resting his head on his
	shoulder

				stargher king
		thank you catherine  you did help me 
		more than youll ever know

	man and boy disappear beneath the waters surface  catherine
	stands and sees that stargher kings body has vanished 
	she walks to the shore and sees deep underwater stargher
	and little carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell 
	and fade from view

				catherine
		goodbye carl

	she presses the sensor in her hand

	int campbell center  laboratory

	in the control room miriam is shocked by what she sees on
	the monitors and looks at stargher

				miriam
		hes in full arrest

	catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is
	automatically lowered  she pulls the mask from her face
	rises and opens the door  miriam races inside and
	desperately attempts to revive stargher  but its no use 
	angry and stunned she demands of catherine

				miriam contd
		help me

	but catherine chooses not to  she knows carl stargher will
	never return to the world of the living

	int helicopter  day

	the chopper roars across the sky  as they head northeast
	away from the urban and toward the rural novak gazes out the
	window trying to stay focused fighting any aftereffects of
	the drugs  the pilot communicates via headset

				pilot
		agent novak  go ahead

	ext starghers house  continuous

	cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting

		the hoist was manufactured by carver
		industrial equipment in 1982  serial
		number 117337j  purchased by a boat
		shop in lake havasu but sold to
		lattimers industrial supply in 1992

	int the cell  day

	the water is near the ceiling  kicking her legs to keep
	afloat julia digs with the ring and we see she has created a
	gap between the light fixture housing and an unused pipe
	leading to the surface  she pushes but cant get anything
	to move  the opening will get no bigger  julia sucks the
	last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell 
	searching for something she finds a juice box and pulls out
	the drinking straw

	int campbell center  laboratory

	shaken but oddly transcendent catherine watches as
	starghers body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney  she
	comforts a whimpering valentine and tells him

				catherine
		everythings alright now valentine  i
		promise

	int helicopter

	novak scans the topography of farms below listening to a new
	report

	int suburban  day

	cole is the passenger on the radio to novak a driver next
	to him doing about a hundred down the interstate siren
	blaring

				cole

	novak locates delano on the map

				novak
		the exact location cole  give it to
		me

	the pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed

	int the cell  day

	julia is entirely underwater but alive  she uses the straw
	to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling but its
	difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching

	int helicopter

	novak uses binoculars to scan farmland  he searches  and
	there it is the abandoned farmhouse

				novak
		take it down

	int the cell  day

	julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs
	against the walls but as she does the straw slips from her
	mouth  she reaches for it but only succeeds in pushing it
	away from her  it heads for the drain  and disappears

	ext abandoned farm house

	the helicopter lands and novak jumps out  he knows this is
	the place  he runs into the barn but theres nothing no
	sign of her  the pilot looks at him with a true sense of
	loss

	int the cell  continuous

	as julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny
	holes of the drain we see for the first time an expression
	which tells us shes given up  thumpthumpthump  the cell
	starts to vibrate  a repetitive noise whupwhupwhup  comes
	from above  she swims to the top of the cell and pounds at
	the ceiling

	ext abandoned farm house

	fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs novak
	pushes on  think peter think his eyes find the water
	tanks and he shouts at the helicopter

				novak
		cut the engine

	as the motor dies novak listens and listens  there it is 
	water pipes beneath his feet  and very faintly a pounding 
	he follows the sound searching the earth  its clearer now
	louder  novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to
	assist him  together they expose the entrance to the
	underground sanctuary

	int the cell  observation room

	novak drops to the floor below  instantly affected by the
	similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of
	starghers mind he feels another wave of dizziness but
	pushes on

	and is hit hard by the sight of drowned julia her motionless
	body floating past him  her eyes open and bubbles drift from
	her nose and mouth  novak bangs on the plexiglas and calls
	to her

				novak
		julia

	the thick plexiglass still remains but she now can see him 
	novak pulls his id badge and smacks it against the glass 

				novak contd
		move aside

	he pulls his gun and takes aim  julia swims to the top of
	the cell and presses herself against the ceiling  bangbang
	bangbangbangbang  novak fires a circle of shots into the
	thick plastic  water slowly leaks but the damn thing is
	still solid  he lifts the industrial vcr and rams it at the
	bulletdamaged section  crack crash  water pours from the
	cell  julias body descends on the torrent of water  novak
	reaches inside and pulls her to safety  hes just about to
	give her cpr when she coughs sputters and thirstily drinks
	in oxygen  holding her tightly novak sinks to the floor
	the water from the cell spilling everywhere

	ext abandoned farm house

	coles suburban leads a contingent of fbi vehicles and local
	police cars onto the property sirens blaring

	knock at the screen door and catherine sees novak waiting

				novak
		ready

	catherine cradles her cat

	gentle squeeze  the cat dashes into the kitchen and
	valentine follows

				catherine contd
		theyre hungry

	he moves into the kitchen  in a moment of quiet

	of water causing her to melt  and she looks away unable to
	watch disturbed by the image  she turns to the kitchen and
	sees novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat  he rises and
