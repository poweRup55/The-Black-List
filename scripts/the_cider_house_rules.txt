               larch wrinkles his nose at the odor

                                     larch

                         its obviously an aborticide

                                     larch
                         obviously

               larch wets his finger with the stuff then touches it to his 
               tongue

                                     larch

                                     larch
                         if you take enough of it your 
                         intestines lose their ability to 
                         absorb vitamin c

                                     homer
                         in other words scurvy

                                     larch

               as homer turns to leave larch stops him he points to the 
               basin

                                     larch
                         take care of that will you

               homer stops annoyed he picks up the basin and empties the 
               contents into a white enamel pail

               with the white enamel pail attracts the attention of buster 
               a sixteenyearold who is picking over a plate of pastries 
               on a table buster immediately goes with homer

               embryois listening to a recording he cant hear what larch 
               and homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified 
               tent over a small hospital bed on wheels the humidifier is 
               operated by a car battery

                                     larch
                         fuzzy is not uncommon i tell you 
                         theres something about the premature 
                         babies of alcoholic mothers they 
                         seem susceptible to every damn thing 
                         that comes along

                                     homer

                         the morons who write the books should

                                     homer
                         but isnt fuzzy just well

                         wouldnt call his bronchial infections 
                         underdeveloped would you

               larch plucks fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips 
               him into the breathing tent fuzzy smiles as larch leaves 
               mary agnes a pretty but toughlooking teenager comes into 
               the dispensary

                                     homer
                         what is it mary agnes

               mary agnes smiles at homer then she sticks her tongue out 
               at him homer looks at her impassively but as the moment 
               continues his expression suggests his annoyance fuzzy starts 
               to cough he wheezes as he breathes homer leans down he 
               peers at fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent

                                     mary agnes
                              garbled because of 
                              her tongue
                         look

               homer examines mary agnes tongue

                              dismissively

                         all right

                         bit me

                                     homer
                              looks at her tongue 
                              again
                         no you did it yourself maybe in

                         i must have been dreaming of kissing 
                         someone

               homer is not responding to her comeon he wheels fuzzy into 
               the hall

                                     homer

                         a dog which had lain concealed 
                         till now ran backwards and forwards 
                         on the parapet with a dismal howl 
                         and collecting himself for a spring 
                         jumped for the dead mans shoulders

               homer enters he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner 
               of the room where he starts to undress

                                     larch
                         missing his aim he fell into a 
                         ditch turning completely over as he 
                         went and striking his head against 
                         a stone dashed his brains out

               larch turns out the lights from the open doorway to the 
               hall larch delivers his nightly benediction

               the girl wont speak when edna touches the girls forehead 
               she pulls back her hand in alarm

               int operating room  morning

               edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl the 
               girl is feverishly hot and whimpering she keeps looking at 
               her feet in the stirrups as if shes an animal caught in a 
               trap larch and homer stand on either side of her

                                     edna
                         her temperature is a hundred and 
                         four

                              very gently
                         how old are you dear thirteen

               the girl shakes her head the pain stabs her again

                                     larch
                         twelve are you twelve dear
                              the girl nods

                         been pregnant
                              the girl freezes
                         three months

               another stab of pain contorts the girl

                                     larch
                         are you four months pregnant

               the girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen 
               homer very delicately examines the girls abdomen too

                                     homer
                              whispers to larch
                         shes at least five

               the girl goes rigid as larch bends into position

                                     larch
                         dear child it wont hurt when i 
                         look im just going to look

               homer assists larch with the speculum

                                     larch

                         never have stuck that inside me

                                     homer
                         stuck what inside you

               homer holds the girl stillshe is babbling on and on while 
               larch is examining her

                                     twelveyearold girl

                         such thing i wouldnt stick that 
                         inside me it wasnt me

               larch his wild eye peering into the speculum makes an 
               audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl 
               larch tells homer to have a look larch then whispers 
               something to edna she brings the ether bottle and cone 
               quickly larch starts putting the cone in place over the 
               nose and mouth of the frightened girl homer bends to the 
               speculum

                                     larch
                              to the twelveyear

                         feel it anymore youve been brave 
                         enough

               homer stares into the speculum he closes his eyes the girl 
               is resisting the ether but her eyelids flutter closed

                                     edna
                         thats a heavy sedation

                                     larch

                         and theres a foreign object i think 
                         its a crochet hook

               homer has pulled off his surgical mask he leans over the 
               scrub sink splashing cold water on his face

                                     larch
                              to homer
                         if shed come to you four months ago 
                         and asked you for a simple d and c

                         jobsome moron who doesnt know 
                         how

               homer furious leaves the operating room edna lifts the 
               girls eyelids for larch so that he can see how well under 
               the ether she is

                                     larch
                         i wish youd come to me dear child 
                         you should have come to me instead

               int corridor  morning

               homer storms down the hall then stops pulling off his white 
               coat angry pacing he kicks at nothing

               ext st clouds  graveyard  early morning

               buster and homer are digging the pit larch paces by the 
               coffin of the 12yearold girl

                                     buster
                         whatd she die of

                                     larch
                              inhales deeply
                         she died of secrecy she died of 
                         ignorance

               buster nods but hes totally bewildered

                                     larch
                              to homer
                         if you expect people to be responsible 
                         for their children you have to give 
                         them the right to decide whether or 
                         not to have children wouldnt you 
                         agree

               buster doesnt get it homer has heard this too many times 
               he rolls his eyes

                                     homer
                         how about expecting people to be 
                         responsible enough to control 
                         themselves to begin with

                                     larch
                         how about this child you expect 
                         her to be responsible

               homer looks away

                                     homer
                         i didnt mean her im talking

                                     larch
                              smiling
                         its just a marvel to me that you 
                         still have such high expectations of 
                         people

                         two

               homer writes on a piece of paper candy and wally exchange a 
               worried look

                                     wally

                         procedure

               edna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood 
               her

                                     edna

               the young homer

               int corridor  day

               homer walks down the corridor dressed in his operating gown 
               as the door to the or opens and wally stumbles out 
               hurriedly opening a window wally breathes deeply to regain 
               his composure

                                     wally
                         i think it was the etherthe smell

               edna comes down the hall with a dirtstained crying curly

                                     edna
                         hes down the hall throwing up

               homer nods to edna who is marching off with curly wally 
               smiles at homer

                                     homer

                                     homer
                         liberator

                                     wally

                                     homer

                         calm all the time

               wally hears homers facetiousnesshow tired he is of his 
               heart condition

                                     wally
                         oh well i dont imagine theres 
                         any strain or stress around here

               homer appreciates the joke

               the door to the operating room that wally exited opens into 
               the corridor candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by larch 
               and angela wally rushes to candys side homer follows 
               slowly candy is groggy coming out of the ether

                                     wally
                         how is she doing

                                     larch

                                     candy
                              slurred speech
                         boy or girl

                                     angela
                         it was nothingits all over

                                     wally
                         its all over honey

               they walk candy on her gurney homer looks after them

                                     candy
                              slurred speech

                         children as you want im sure youll 
                         have very beautiful children

               larch wheels candy behind a curtain

                                     larch
                         youll have princes of maine youll 
                         have kings of new england

               larch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to wally

                                     larch
                         i suggest you find yourself some 
                         fresh air lieutenant

               wally is left alone in the corridor

               int boys division  day

               cranked at threequarters fuzzy sits in bed wheezing and 
               coughing hes drawing with great intensity using crayons 
               on a piece of paper held by a clipboard homer sits on the 
               end of fuzzys bed cleaning up steerforth homer pauses to 
               look out of the window he sees wally dashing and spotless 
               in his uniform beside his flashy car a life homer might 
               have had crosses his face

                                     fuzzy os

               homer turns to fuzzy who holds up his picturea big pumpkin 
               with a jackolantern face

                                     homer
                              distracted
                         uh its the end of october

               homer looks at fuzzy his little body is working hard just 
               to breathe

                                     steerforth

                                     fuzzy
                              disappointed
                         oh its the best time how come we 
                         only get pumpkins once a year

               fuzzy coughs and coughs

                                     homer
                         dont get too excited fuzzy

                                     fuzzy

                         christmas too we dont get any 
                         good presents at christmas anyway

               homer looks out the window at wally again his decision forms

               ext orphanage driveway  day

               homer approaches the flashy car where wally is still pacing

                                     homer
                         has anyone offered you anything to 
                         eat

                                     wally
                         actually someone did i just didnt 
                         think i could eat anything

               an awkward silence which homer covers by examining the car

                                     homer
                              trying to sound casual
                         i wonder if you might give me a ride

                                     wally

                         where are you going

                                     wally
                         were heading back to cape kenneth

               homer nods but he has no idea where cape kenneth is

                                     homer
                         cape kenneth

               wally nods

                                     homer
                         that sounds fine

               int stairwaycorridor  day

               homer runs up the stairs two steps at a time he races into 
               a corridor at full speed exhilarated suddenly dr larch 
               appears in front of him homer stops abruptly out of breath 
               unable to speak

               int larchs office  day

               as homer stands guiltily larch rifles through an xray file 
               holding various x rays up to the lit screen he quickly finds 
               the one hes looking for attaching it briefly to the screen 
               for a confirming looka heart x ray which larch waves at 
               homer as he talks

                                     larch
                              sarcastic
                         doubtless youll let me know what 
                         immensely worthwhile or at least 
                         useful thing it is that you find 
                         to do

                                     homer
                              restrained
                         i wasnt intending to leave here in 
                         order to be entirely uselessi expect

                         in other parts of the world i suppose 
                         there are other ways

                                     homer
                              still restrained
                         of course

                                     larch
                              blows up
                         are you really so stupid that you 
                         imagine youre going to find a more 
                         gratifying life what youre going 
                         to find is people like the poor people 
                         who get left hereonly nobody takes 
                         care of them as well and you wont 
                         be able to take care of them either 
                         theres no taking care of anybody
                         not out there

                                     homer
                              feeling trapped
                         you know im grateful for everything 
                         youve done for me

                                     larch
                              calmly
                         i dont need your gratitude

               larch hands homer the heart x ray

                                     homer
                              exasperated

               camera closes on homer with the x ray

               int kitchen  late afternoon

               buster and mary agnes are serving the evening meal while 
               larch rails at angela and edna who are helping buster and 
               mary agnes the sound of children in the dining hall is 
               intermittent and chaotic

                         i think these will fit you

               homer is grateful and ashamed before he can speak edna is 
               therea wad of bills in her hand she tries to put the money 
               in his pocket when he refuses it she simply puts the money

               as homer puts his stuff in the truck of wallys car angela 
               cant resist touching his face she is too upset to speak

               from a window larch is watching the departure he sees homer 
               saying goodbye to the children embracing them

               from another window fuzzy just stares of course hes 
               coughing

               we see wally carrying candy to the car

               she speaks to homer touching his sleeve like a sleepy 
               person as wally puts her gently in the backseat

                                     candy

                         idea to have a doctor along for the

               who looks betrayed edna picks up curly and carries him to

               there is quiet as the journey gets underway wally keeps 
               glancing at candy in the rearview mirror she seems distant

                         picking apples is truly boring

               candys eyes snap open and she sits up a little

                         as exciting as walking

               candy seems irritated with wally homer tries to engage her

                                     homer

                         stay away from me

               wally signals to homer to get out of the car

               later wally and homer stand outside the car overhearing 
               candys weeping homer is smoking nervously

                                     homer

                         its all very normal

               wally looks at homer who takes a nervous drag on his 
               cigarette

                                     wally
                         you ought to cut that shit outits 
                         terrible for you

               homer looks at wally he sees the authority in his eyes 
               homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot

               they notice that candy has stopped crying wally finds candy 
               asleep in the backseat

               ext wallys car  on the road  late at night

               the lone car on the road snatches of war news from the radio 
               are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark 
               highway

               ext coast of maine  morning

               the car is parked with homer sleeping in it alone the sounds 
               of the ocean increase as homer opens his eyes homer gets 
               out of the car and walks toward the beach enchanted there 
               it is his first view ever of an ocean the horizon the sun 
               glimmering on the water candy is lying on a blanket in the 
               sand wally is throwing rocks in the water homer takes it 
               all in when candy calls for him homer walks up to her

                                     candy
                         im a little worried about the
                              she gestures below 
                              her waist
                         about how much bleeding is okay

                                     homer
                         it should taper off tomorrow but it 
                         can come back again you have cramps
                              candy nods
                         theyll ease up almost entirely as 
                         long as the bleeding isnt heavy 
                         its normal

                         catch

               a football comes flying through the air toward homer it 
               bounces off his chest wally laughs

                                     wally
                              meaning the football
                         give it here

               homer throws the football its clear hes never thrown one 
               before

               after line of treesthe apple orchards

               homer sees an outdoor shower where three black men are 
               showering it is a wooden stall that leaves the showers 
               occupants visible above and below their midsections a fourth

                         to let him be the boss

               homer wonders what that means as wally reaches for the door 
               of the cider house before wally can knock a pretty young 
               black girl rose rose bumps open the screen door with her 
               hip and throws a bucket of water in the grassalmost hitting

                         there

               homer looks at mr rose with an uncomprehending expression

                                     mr rose
                         if youre as smart as wally says

               pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion hes so 
               fast the knife seems to come out of nowhere he begins to 
               peel the apple homer eyes mr rose but mr roses focus is 
               riveted to his apple and the long perfect strand of peel 
               dangling from it

                                     mr rose

               rose rose picks up the book that homer has put on the bed 
               she studies the cover its great expectations by charles 
               dickens she puts it down restlessly

                         they told muddy his feet was too 
                         flat

                         recall

               finished unpacking homer sits on his bed he picks up great 
               expectations and begins to read rose rose sits down next 
               to him watching him read homer notices her interest

                         i cant read nobody taught me

               homer smiles politely and goes back to his book rose rose 
               keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages

                                     rose rose
                              pointing to the page
                         what does it say there

               homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds 
               smoking listening like bedtime stories at the orphanage 
               he thinks however the pickers attitude is suspicious 
               reserved

                                     homer
                              reading
                         i looked at the stars and considered 
                         how awful it would be for a man to 
                         turn his face to them as he froze to 
                         death and see no help or pity in 
                         all the glittering multitude

               homer looks up theres no response

                                     homer
                              to rose rose
                         more

               some muttering some giggling mostly silence rose rose 
               wants more but suddenly jack jumps out of bed and stomps to 
               the kitchen end of the cider house where a piece of paper 
               is tacked to the wall jack is talking to homer all the way

                                     jack

                         enough to read whats this

               jack points at the piece of paper homer gets up and looks 
               at it

                                     homer

               all the smokers laugh and cough in their beds

                                     mr rose
                              uncharacteristically

                         lucky one

               homer shakes his head wally stops walking they both stop

                                     wally
                              more serious
                         you want to fight about it

               homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around at 
               first he is startled but then he laughs wally laughs too 
               they shake hands

               mr rose calls out to homer from the tractor the pickers 
               are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed theyre going 
               back to the orchard homer has to run to catch up to them 
               he jumps on the flatbed he sees wally waving goodbye

               ext orchards  day

               high up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders mr rose and 
               homer are picking side by side mr rose is picking with 
               highspeed perfection but homer is slower and fumblinghe 
               drops an occasional apple to the ground

                                     mr rose
                         you pickin more cider apples then 
                         anythin else them drops is good 
                         only for cider and you pickin the 
                         stems with the apples only half the 
                         time they good only for cider too
                         if you dont pick them stems
                              homer watches him
                         the rule is you wanna pick the apple 
                         with the stem homer and see 
                         here see that bud thats just 
                         above the stem thats the bud for 
                         next years applethats called 
                         the spur you pick the spur you 
                         pickin two years in oneyou pickin

                         chance to grow you leave that on 
                         the branch you hear

               homer nods he picks more carefully with more concentration

                                     mr rose
                              approvingly

                                     homer
                         i guess so

               homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top 
               of the tree he can see the driveway of the worthington house 
               where candy and olive are saying a tearful goodbye to wally 
               distracted homer drops another couple of apples which mr 
               rose observes with a wry smile

               trailer mr rose and the pickers are just watching them

               homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when 
               he hears the tractor start candy follows his gaze

                                     homer

               pulls away

                                     candy

               he jumps on the back of the departing flatbed between mr 
               rose and rose rose as candy watches him

               like hes still a kid

               int dining hall  early morning

               at one table the children are happily eating apples a few 
               of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their 
               pockets at another table larch edna and angela sit around 
               an open packing crate of apples larch takes a bite from an 
               apple and spits it out angela takes the apple out of his 
               hand

                                     angela
                         thats a pie apple wilbur homer 
                         said youre not supposed to eat it

                         so hes an apple expert is he

               angela gives him a critical look as larch takes a bite out 
               of the new apple

                                     larch
                              sarcastically

                         life werent meant for pies

                              incredulous

                         homer wells is picking apples

               both edna and angela glower at him

                                     larch

                         us a proper letter a dissertation 
                         on apples we dont need

                              annoyed

                         picking appleshe must have had to 
                         pay to send them too

                         i wouldnt worry edna that he 
                         doesnt have money if he gets hungry 
                         he can pick his dinner

               larch angrily tosses the halfeaten apple into the garbage

                                     edna
                         wilbur its a gift how can you 
                         be angry with homer for sending us a 
                         gift

               larch stares into space depressed then he examines the 
               crate and finds the mailing label that says ocean view 
               orchardscape kenneth maine he rips it off holds it up 
               triumphantly

               camera closes on homers face he keeps picking

                                     larch os
                         his name is homer wells

               int st clouds  dining hall  evening

               edna and angela face the board of trustees around a table 
               larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a 
               folder larch has provided a copy for each member the three 
               elderly gentlemen on the board dont speak they just nod 
               their heads to everything dr holtz or mrs goodhall says

                                     larch
                         and his pathetic resume is the 
                         best ive seen though i find it 
                         hard to believe the board would be 
                         interested in this character

                                     dr holtz
                         but he looks like an excellent young 
                         man a firstrate candidate

                                     larch
                         he looks like a bleedingheart 
                         missionary moron to me but thats 
                         going to be the problem with any 
                         doctor interested in coming here

                                     mrs goodhall
                         do you know him

                                     larch
                         no i dont want to know him hes 
                         doing missionary workin india 
                         i wrote him weeks ago but hes 
                         either too holy or too busy to answer 
                         maybe he got killed in the war

               suddenly steerforth bursts through the door having been 
               pushed from behind by mary agnes the two stop when they see 
               whats going onnot to mention larchs stern expression 
               they back out mary agnes winking at dr holtz before the 
               door closes mrs goodhall is ready to continue

                                     mrs goodhall
                         i fail to see how someone courageous 
                         enough to make a commitment to a 
                         foreign mission is automatically to 
                         be dismissedthat part of the world 
                         requires precisely the kind of 
                         dedication that is needed here

                                     larch
                         does it snow in bombay one winter 
                         here and well be shipping him south 
                         in a coffin

                                     mrs goodhall
                         you cant think that a man who has 
                         served under such conditions as 
                         exist over there will be in the 
                         slightest daunted by a little snow
                         have you no idea how harsh and 
                         primitive and full of disease that 
                         part of the world is

                                     larch
                         then i suppose we can look forward 
                         to catching various diseases from 
                         him

                                     dr holtz
                         but dr larch he seems exceptionally 
                         qualified

                                     larch
                         im not talking about his medical 
                         qualifications its the christian 
                         thing that bothers mei just dont 
                         see it being of much use around 
                         here

                                     mrs goodhall
                              bitterly
                         i fail to see how a little 
                         christianity could hurt anyone 
                         here

                                     larch
                         anyway i was just showing you this 
                         guy as an example of whats available

                                     dr holtz

                                     mrs goodhall

                         you wouldnt be opposed to meeting 
                         with him

                                     larch
                         i suppose it wouldnt hurt to meet 
                         him whats his name again

                                     larch
                              mumbling
                         i just hope he wont expect us to 
                         say grace all the time

               the three elderly gentlemen repeat the name

                                     mrs goodhall
                         its a nice name very new england

                         very

               int dispensary  night

               a song plays on the old phonograph as a happy larch and angela 
               dance edna interrupts them

                                     edna

                         in india does he even want to 
                         come back

               this causes larch to take the needle off the record

                                     larch
                              angrily

                         hold him there

               ext cider house  rainy day

               as he leans in to talk to candy whos behind the wheel mr 
               rose calls to homer from the doorway of the mill room

               int mill room  rainy day

               mr rose is instructing homer as they stand bottling cider 
               in their yellow slickers and rubber boots rose rose is hosing 
               down the pressboards muddy and hero and peaches are operating 
               the grinder and the press jack is stirring the vat in a 
               defiant contemptuous way jack keeps flicking the ash of 
               his cigarette into the vat this make everyone uncomfortable 
               only mr rose doesnt appear to notice

                                     mr rose

               homers expression changes from exhilarated to guilty he 
               leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen 
               candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder homer looks 
               afraid to breathe

               from behind with her head on his shoulder they look like a 
               normal couple we track in toward the huge screen until we 
               see only the screen there are shadows on the black screen

                         over your adolescence that period 
                         which i would define as the first 
                         time in our lives when we imagine we 
                         have something terrible to hide from

               him he sheepishly thanks her when homer closes the door

               rose rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open there 
               is something familiar about the way homer approaches her 
               bedside he does so with the authority of a doctor he sits 
               on the edge of her bed with such complete selfassurance 
               that she doesnt protest

                                     homer
                         how many months are you

               she just stares but she doesnt stop him when he touches 
               her abdomen its as if she knows that he knows what hes 
               doing

                                     homer

               rose rose stops she cant even continue setting the table 
               her voice turns bitter despairing

               nods almost invisibly after her father rose rose looks 
               pointedly at candy nodding candy slowly gets it mr rose 
               is the father rose rose lets that sink in she keeps looking 
               at candy with an ashamed expression

               ext orchard  day

               the pickers are at work on their ladders when candy runs 
               down the aisle between two rows of trees she stops at the 
               bottom of homers ladder out of breath muddy and peaches 
               and hero in the treetops are watching and listening

               smiling his enigmatic smile mr rose keeps slowly picking 
               while homer stands at the foot of his ladder

                                     mr rose

                         in that boy wallys at war

               that takes some of the steam out of homers superiority

                                     homer
                         but shes your daughter

                         homeryou must know that

               homer turns he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away

                         shes pregnant do you know that

               by his expressionhe looks as if hes been punchedits 
               clear that mr rose didnt know that

               that muddy peaches and hero already know that mr rose is

               arrive for lunch almost simultaneously with homer he looks 
               at then looks away from rose rose mr rose is the last to 
               sit down at the table as a very tense wordless lunch begins

               ext orchard  day

               homer is on a ladder picking apples muddy climbs a ladder 
               on the other side of the same tree

                         dont mess in this homer if you 
                         know whats good for you

                                     homer
                         how longs this been going on muddy

                         it

               muddy looks all around for mr rose then he gives homer his 
               knife

                                     muddy
                         theres my knife homer it aint

                         knife to rose rose you hear

               homer nods pocketing the knife as muddy climbs down and 
               moves his ladder to an adjacent tree he keeps talking to 
               homer until he disappears in the leaves

                                     muddy
                         you best just watch you ass homer 
                         you dont wanna end up like jack

               homer thoughtfully continues his work

               int bunkhouse  late at night

               in the late sun the leaves have a reddish fiery glow

               its much colder the pickers are on their ladders in the 
               trees again but theyre dressed for the cold homer is high 
               on a ladder he turns toward the view of the worthington 
               house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the 
               driveway homer sees candy get out of wallys car she leaves 
               the door open and runs toward the house parked in front of 
               wallys car is an army jeep with an enlisted man leaning 
               against it the indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he

               another first for him he turns and looks at her with an 
               almost clinical curiosity then he goes back to staring at 
               the blank screen

               ext orchard  in front of the apple mart  dawn

               the rain has stopped but the grass is wet the trees

               gets out the car exits the frame in one direction homer 
               walking exits the frame in another

               the mood is solemn they work with tired focus candy drives 
               up the men are evasive with her they find a reason to work 
               across the mart candy walks to homer stands next to him 
               they say nothing for a moment until candy breaks the silence

               her hands into her pockets finds a letter there which she 
               hands to homer

               toward him mary agnes also sees homer she immediately turns 
               away and runs inside music fades out over

               int lavatory  early morning

               mary agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the 
               mirror she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands

               int orphanage front hall  early morning

               everyone has heard the news they come on the run the 
               children flock around homer hugging him homer takes angela 
               and edna in his arms mary agnes joins the group homer takes 
               in how changed how attractive she is they smile awkwardly 
               at each other

               int boys division  evening

               homers suitcase is open on the bed we see homers hands as 
               he begins to unpack smaller hands reach in and root through 
               the clothes

                                     curly os
                         did you bring something for me

               curly continues his search homer thinks for a second then 
               reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of palegreen 
               glass

                                     homer
                         you know what i did

               homer hands the piece of glass to curly

                                     homer
                         its from the ocean its for you

               curly is duly impressed he walks away to examine his new 
               treasure homer continues unpacking he pulls his x ray out 
               and puts it aside

                                     buster
                         what are you doing here

               homer turns to see buster mary agnes angela and edna in 
               the doorway

                                     mary agnes
                         we made up a room for you

                                     angela
                         wouldnt you be more comfortable by 
                         yourself

               homer smiles he nods

               angela and mary agnes start to put homers things back in 
               his bag edna picks up the x ray and looks at it with a somber 
               expression

                                     edna
                         homer do you know what this is

                                     homer
                         sure its my heart

                                     angela
                              shakes her head
                         actually its fuzzys theres 
                         nothing wrong with your heart

                                     homer
                         fuzzys

                                     edna
                         dr larch wanted to keep you out of 
                         the war homerthats why he did 
                         it thats why he told you it was 
                         yours

               homer is stunned he puts his hand to his heart

                                     angela
                         i think he worried about his own 
                         heart he said it would never stand 
                         up to homer wells going off to war

               homer takes that in he nods mary agnes touches him 
               sympathetically

               int larchs office  night

               homer looks at his fake diplomas they are now framed and 
               hanging on the office wall homer surveys the office as if 
               for the first time he sits down in the desk chair as if 
               slowly getting used to his new position

               int boys division  night

               homer reads to the boys from david copperfield while his 
               voice is strongpositive optimistic certainly reassuring 
               to the boysthere is in the conclusion of the chapter 
               something that distracts him he seems to hesitate he misses 
               a line or two and perhaps he purposely skips one or two 
               others possibly homers eyes wander ahead to the title of 
               the next chapter i make another beginning

                                     homer
                         thus i began my new life in a new 
                         name and with everything new about 
                         me i felt like one in a dream 
                         the remembrance of that life is 
                         fraught with so much want of 
                         hope whether it lasted for a year 
                         or more or less i do not know i 
                         only know that it was and ceased to 
                         be and there i leave it

               homer stops and looks at the boys faces

                                     curly
                         what happens next

               homer smiles

                                     homer
                         thats tomorrow curly lets mot 
                         give the story away

               homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar 
               semidarkness seconds later the closed door to the hall 
               is flung open flooding the room with light from the hall 
               and homer dressed in his long white laboratory coat and 
               looking every inch the doctor delivers his best imitation 
               of larchs popular blessing

                                     homer
                         good night you princes of maine 
                         you kings of new england

               on copperfield and steerforth and curly as the door to the 
               hall is closed and semidarkness prevails in the room again 
               copperfield smiling shuts his eyes after a second the 
               wideeyed steerforth shuts his eyes too then curly

               the last to close his eyes is buster

                                                             fade to black

                                         the end
