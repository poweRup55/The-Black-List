trendazoids  well see more of this circus later  right now
the bg sound is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
establishment since we are 

tight closeup a framed 8x10

thinly filmed in dust mounted among dozens of other band shots
visible among the posed members of a group called diabolique is
eric wielding guitar on the club stage  nd blur as people 
cross frame

grange 4550 powerful a seasoned assassin cruel but loyal
his facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
down the corridor  ngo nwa 50ish clad chinese gangster style
 white topcoat white scarf tinted shades  and two body guards
supplying a power perimeter around himlean darkhaired asian
killers who would gladly die for ngo nwa which they will in 
just a minute

they have just passed the diabolique 8x10  ngo nwas gloved
fingers in passing leave little skid tracks in the dust that
clear the eyes of eric in the photo

as the foursome reaches the door grange turns doubtfully  
suspiciously  to nwa

	he will see me unannounced

mirrored on the club side all sorts of activity is visible
through automatic miniblinds  a flyvision bank of 12 tv
monitors is hot with surveillance

lao a painfully cleancut armaniclad asian impeccable
almost dashing but the dynamic here is crystal clear nwa is
the king lao the dark prince in this hierarchy

at the desk lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny
perfect rat skeleton by ngo nwas unheralded entry  the desktop
is bare except for and arcane vietnamese fighting knife half a
meter long with an ideogrammed blade dramatically positioned
beneath an artemide lamp  lao rises and feigns servility

nb  the following exchange will play fast and entirely in
vietnamese

		lao
	formal greeting

		nwa
	dismissiveness contempt then
	chastizing anger as

nwa indicates the blade with some ridicule

		lao
	phony assuagement

		nwa
	knows its bullshit

lao turns staring out the blinds fighting for control  deep
breath  he turns back to his master  nwa gestures broadly at
the oppulent office indicating that lao should be grateful but 
is somehow errant
 
		nwa
	respect is required

		lao
	begrudging agreement

lao sees the blade  an idea  he lifts it reverently bears it
the nwa hiltfirst in both hands as if bestowing a thing of
immeasurable worth

		ngo nwa
	why give me this

nonetheless nwa accepts the blade  it gleams  hypnotic even
nwa has to admire it  turns it so the blade is pointed at his
sternum  his attitude indicates lao is too far away to do
anything untoward

		lao
	sinister punchline

lao spins through the air and heelkicks the blade through nwas
chest pinning him to the door  its over so fast the gasp of
astonishment never escapes nwa  lao is much more than merely 
treacherous he is extremely capable

		lao
	     in perfect english
	when i spoke of an offering i
	didnt mean an offering to you

the jacket of his exlord  lao now bows to no one

bellrope testing it  a final look to albrecht

ext church roof  resuming lao  night

lao snaps ellys free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
rod and advances one foot on either side of the peak of the
roof his blade brandished

close moving shot  eric  hands up to grapple but
weaponless  he spiders to meet lao suddenly picking up speed
and running along the precarious peak

lao sees him coming braces to strike but eric executes a broad
flying leap right over laos head

eric lands slips sprawls sideways clinging to the peak of the
roof  lao hurries in to slash with the blade as eric averts
the steel rings  eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
that dumps lao

eric spreadeagles to keep from falling  distantly lao
similarly saves himself

new angle  the fight  here comes lao crabbing back toward
the peak  eric rolls to ellys position grabs the lightning
rod and tries to wrest it loose

bluehot

handcuff freed sliding down the roof slope

he embraces eric and rams the killing blade deep into erics
back

on eric as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
sternum  tight grimace  a lot of pain

		eric
	can you fly

he pulls lao into a backward roll down the roof holding him
tight

moving angle  intercuts  eric and lao fall

eric lands on his back forcing the blade through himself and
into lao  eric completes the roll and kicks lao off into space

it up to her

		eric
	i dont know if i can  but you
	have this and you know where to come

		elly

he grasps ellys face in his hands and bends painfullyto kiss
her on the forehead

		eric
	for you ill try  promise

move with eric

spent empty he holds the rose determinedly but hes never
going to make it the few yards back to his own grave  so close

groping hand tries to drag him further

		eric
	leave me now

tears on her face  she cant watch this  she turns and drops
the flowers on shellys grave

erics pov  his own grave

still too far away to matter
