        back around to check out jennifers ass

        jennifer and frida turn a corner and keep walking both a bit 
        embarrassed for different reasons at what just happened 
        they head into a barrestaurant pan up to the name of the 
        restaurant its called coyote ugly saloon

        jennifer sits between george and carlton who both lean in 
        hanging on her every word theyre all having steak

        int victorias secret  day

        chaos hardly the relaxed atmosphere jennifer described 
        though there is indeed classical music playing

        cut to an overhead shot of a huge circular bin of womens 
        underpants and another bin of bras all different colors 

        various womens hands pick frantically through the bins 
        looking for the right size and color sometimes hands grab at 
        the same one simultaneously the atmosphere seems hectic

                                  woman 1

        jennifers finger points to a red panty and frida snatches it 
        and gives it to her

                       large small no fucking mediums

        more and more hands pick through the bras and panties with 
        increasing fervor fridas hand grabs a pair of blue panties

                       jennifer i got a medium

        as frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile she 
        realizes an oliveskinned woman is grabbing the other end of 
        the panties they have a bit of a tug of war over it

                                  olive woman
                       thats mine

                       no i had it first

        the tug of war continues frida and the olive woman both 
        refuse to let go it looks like theyre about to rip when the 
        olive womans head comes into frame  the back of her head 
        fills the frame with brunette curls frida screams

                                  frida

        frida looks at her wrist which is beginning to swell

                                  frida
                       i think she broke the skin

        frida looks at jennifer uncomfortably jennifer smiles to 
        herself reminiscing


        int doctors office  day

        frida sits wearing a white hospital gown on an examining 
        table shes bored as there isnt much to look at and its 
        cold in there  especially in the skimpy gown 

        she goes to a mirror and puts on chapstick she smacks her 
        lips as jennifer had in after putting on lipstick 

        suddenly the door opens and nearly hits her frida backs up 
        embarrassed as a male doctor in a white coat walks in he 
        barely looks at frida and stares at his clipboard

                                  doctor
                       a bite whered you get bitten

                                  frida
                       at victorias secret

        the doctor looks up from his clipboard confused

                                  frida
                       there was a sale

        she holds it up for him to see he takes a look at it

                                  doctor
                       a dog at victorias secret

                                  frida
                       no it was another woman

        the doctor seems skeptical he examines her wrist closer

                                  doctor
                       this doesnt look human did she 
                       wear dentures or damn this is 
                       the oddest bite ive ever seen

        the doctor makes a note on his clipboard

                       hows the rest of your health

        the doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes

                                  doctor
                       pms what symptoms are you 
                       experiencing

                       emotional and depressed and

                                  doctor

                       diet and exercise should help

                       to make sure its related to your 
                       period and not just in your head

                       its not just in my head

        the doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door

                                  doctor
                       ill send a nurse in to clean that

        scratches herself she notices her nails are surprisingly 
        long she stares at them confused then opens the cat food

        a crazy thought she stands up and sniffs around her kitchen 

        she searches the cupboards then the refrigerator its full 
        of fruit and vegetables the other cupboard has healthy stuff 
        as well frida slams the cupboard shut obviously not

        her fingernails and toenails which are quite long and thick 

        she goes to the refrigerator opens the door looks in and 
        closes the door she does this several times as if its 
        contents will change the next time she opens it 

        she paces faster and faster in a tighter circle she feels 
        claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off

        which is filled with junk food frozen yogurt chocolate
        covered pretzels doritos a box of tampons and some midol

        have the nice brown eyes frida mentioned earlier he carries 
        a mcdonalds bag and is eating a french fry

        fridas skeptical

                                  mark
                       hey whats all this stuff

        he shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his 
        mcdonalds bag on the table 

                                  frida
                       jennifers giving me a makeover

        mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it frida 
        sniffs at the burger

                                  mark
                       what you got a date or somethin

                                  frida
                       since when do you care

        frida lustily eyes the burger mark sees her check it out

                                  mark
                       sorry i know you hate the sight of 
                       meat 

        mark looks at frida for a moment  for the first time really 
        since he barged in

                                  mark
                       you look different i mean you 
                       look good 

                                  frida
                       you never say that

                                  mark
                       you do though you look really 
                       is that a wonderbra

                                  frida
                       no 

        he walks closer to her frida backs up

        mark moves in closer puts his arms around her and tries to 
        kiss her frida turns her head away from his kiss she looks 
        down and sees the burger which sits on the table behind mark

        ecu of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial 

        frida sniffs and makes a little moan  shes completely 
        focused on the burger mark thinks shes moaning for him and 
        he continues kissing her neck as he does frida reaches 
        down picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it

        close on fridas face as we see her sheer nearorgasmic 
        enjoyment of the burger suddenly mark jerks away

                                  mark
                       ouch shit what the fuck

        he twists his arm to reach around to feel his back 
        completely ignoring marks pain frida takes a few more chomps 
        of the burger as though she hasnt eaten in days

        mark lifts his shirt which is ripped he sees in the mirror 
        that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it

                                  mark
                       look what you did

                                  frida
                       oh my god im sorry

                                  mark
                       shit and youre eating my burger 
                       you dont eat meat

                                  frida
                       i cant help it it smells so good

        frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs 
        into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball

                                  mark
                       fuck you have sharp nails

        frida dabs his scratches with the rubbing alcohol

                                  mark
                       ouch that stings damn what am i 
                       going to do with my back like this

                                  frida
                       worried about what all your 
                       girlfriends might think

                                  mark
                       frida you know youre it for me

                                  frida
                       yeah right you better go 

        frida pulls him towards the door mark grabs his empty burger 
        wrapper and fries

                                  mark
                       hey wait i paid three bucks for 
                       that burger you owe me

                       thousand bucks you owe me

                                  mark
                       im working on it

        frida rolls her eyes she drags him and pushes him out the 
        door marks surprised by how strong frida is

        frida slams the door and locks it

                       fortune on you hes gonna feel 
                       like you owe him something

        frida looks worried she picks up a big hand mirror on the 
        table and looks at herself

                                  frida
                       oh my god i have a mustache

                       bleach that its no big deal

        jennifer brushes fridas hair she pauses and looks at 
        fridas eyes

                             suddenly realizing shes not 
                             wearing glasses
                       oh my glasses maybe my eyes got 
                       stronger from not wearing them


        int restaurant  night

        frida sits across the table from gregory 

                                  gregory
                       you hungry

                                  frida
                       starving

        a waiter hands each of them a menu 

                                  gregory
                       have whatever you want my treat 

        they each look at menus the entrees are listed from lighter 
        fair down to steaks cu of each menu item and its price 
        frida does a doubletake at her menu 

        instead of seeing a dollar amount frida reads it like this 
        chefs salad  french kissing and groping pasta special  
        heavy petting and breast feel chicken marsala  blow job 
        steak frites  regular fucking surf and turf lobster  kinky 
        sex till youre sore

                                  gregory
                       man im starving too i think ill 
                       go for the surf and turf

                       im not really hungry after all

                                  gregory
                       you said youre starving come on 
                       i cant stand a woman who wont 
                       eat

        frida hungrily eyes a steak the waiter passes by with she 
        inhales deeply

                                  frida
                       maybe just one little steak


        int restaurant  night later

        cu of frida eating devouring everything on her plate slow 
        dolly in to cu of frida as gregory goes on about himself

                                  gregory
                       my senior year i was waiting for 
                       that letter from harvard id 
                       heard from yale got in brown 
                       mit got in but harvard heres 
                       the suspense a letter comes 
                       and everyone knows if its a thin 
                       envelope you dont get in right 
                       so i get a thin envelope and i 
                       wasnt even gonna open it i was 
                       just gonna jump off a bridge 
                       cause it was harvard or bust 

        frida looks up momentarily as she rips off a particularly 
        tough piece of meat her food is much more interesting than 
        her date gregory blurs a bit into the background his voice 
        is slightly altered  as now were hearing his subtext

                                  gregory
                       okay lets face it i got into

                       on my sats and was kicked outta 
                       prep school but hey thats life 
                       i have a really small penis which 
                       is why i tell stories about how 
                       great i am im also losing my 
                       hair and i have no interest in a 
                       relationship i just want you to 
                       like my screenplay idea but i do 
                       expect you to fuck me later

        the cameras still on frida as shes eating she looks up at 
        gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus

                                  gregory
                       so there i was hanging from the 
                       edge of a bridge when my mom said 
                       son you got into harvard it 
                       took three of them to pull me back

        gregory looks at her not sure if shes serious then he 
        takes a step back and looks around to make sure no ones 
        watching he then unzips his pants and pees frida has the 
        urge to laugh for a moment but then she holds it back

        an awkward moment as gregory takes a really long time to pee 
        he looks over at frida once or twice and they exchange an 
        awkward glance finally hes done and he zips up his pants

        frida and gregory look at each other fridas eyes seem to 
        glow she takes a step towards him gregorys taken off 
        guard as frida grabs him and kisses him

        hands free so he puts it on her bloody sheet lloyd cant 
        keep his eyes off the bloody sheet

                       was probably just found with a 
                       knife in his back

                       door and next thing i knew i woke 
                       up with my period alone

                                  jennifer

                       have to eat if youre drinking 
                       and not just those little salads

                                  frida
                       i ate a burger in the afternoon and 
                       a steak and a half with gregory

                                  jennifer
                       i guess youre off that vegetarian 
                       kick youve been on for ten years

                                  frida
                       i couldnt stop eating steak i 
                       felt out of control  like i was 
                       making up for all those years being 
                       a vegetarian i couldnt get 
                       enough and then gregory walked me 
                       home and he peed in front of me

                                  jennifer
                       what why the hell did he do that

                                  frida
                       he was trying to get into my 
                       apartment and i know this sounds 
                       gross but i was so turned on i 
                       grabbed him and kissed him 

                                  jennifer
                       and then

                                  frida
                       i think i went in and fell asleep 
                       i guess gregory walked home and got 
                       killed i blacked out

                                  jennifer

                                  frida

        a chill runs down fridas spine

                                  peter
                       we lived in northern minnesota 
                       she went for a walk one night and 
                       they never found her body  just 
                       her torn apart clothes with her 
                       blood and wolf blood on them then 
                       the town rounded up bunch of 
                       hunters and shot all the wolves in 
                       the area

                       the weird thing is ive had an odd 
                       morbid fascination with wolves ever 
                       since

        straightens herself up and spins around as peter opens the 
        door holding a bag full of tampon boxes

        strange glow she opens her mouth and her lower teeth look a 
        bit like wolves teeth she looks back up at her eyes again 
        and blinks doing a double take she looks down at her teeth 
        again and now they seem normal 

        frida inspects her face for facial hair she touches her 
        breasts which feel large and painful

        carltons voice trails off as he rambles on meanwhile frida 
        is feeling strange symptoms shes scratching like a dog

        frida hears snippets of other conversations in various parts 
        of the park a holdup a couple arguing a couple making out
        fridas head is spinning and shes breathing heavily she 
        hears carlton again

                                  carlton
                       as james dean said live fast die

        frida circles him slowly staring into his eyes hes turned 
        on and intrigued she takes off her jacket breathing heavily 
        she zones in closer finally shes within reaching distance 
        and carlton grabs her waist and pulls her toward him

                                  carlton
                       wow your bodys really hot

        she pulls the cigarette out of his hand and stomps it out 
        she grabs his face and kisses him passionately then she 
        pulls away violently which sends him spinning for a second 
        he looks up and shes vanished all carlton sees is darkness

                                  george
                       well the flake got a lot hotter


        ext central park  night

        carlton is still searching in the darkness for frida he 
        hears a low growling from somewhere behind him

                                  carlton
                       frida is this some sort of game 
                             playfully as if calling a 
                             dog
                       here frida here girl

        he turns around but sees nothing he takes a few more steps 

        he hears another growl  a bit louder and seeming a bit 
        closer carlton turns around and seems scared by what he 
        sees he backpedals quickly away and breaks into a jog

        whatever carlton sees starts chasing him we hear growling 
        and carlton looks scared to death he runs through the park 
        and is chased until he falls down and we zoom in closer on 
        his terrified face as he screams the growling gets louder 
        carltons face is blocked by a shadow

        obviously grossed out she opens the trash bag and spreads it 
        out on the floor with the broom she pushes the sheet
        wrapped arm into the trash bag

        frida hangs up she inches over to the sink and turns on the

        frida backs up and puts her hand on top of the washer 
        protecting it

                       having trouble sticking it in

        as the apartment door opens we see in silhouette spencer 
        carrying frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride 
        he then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the 
        door closed behind him spencer is longhaired and sexy 

        frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup  
        but she looks great shes busty and curvy  barely 
        recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes frida 
        holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes

                                  frida

                       ummmm you smell good

        spencer puts frida down she immediately starts pacing and 
        circling the apartment wolflike shes on the prowl shes 
        acting different than weve seen her before spencer is 
        wearing a los lobos tshirt

                                  frida

        frida puts his hands on her breasts and gives him a deep 
        aggressive kiss she unzips his pants

        spencer turns the light on he gets a quick look at frida  
        her eyes glow like wolf eyes frida turns the light off 

        we hear spencer freaking out and wolflike growls and noises 
        a vicious attack from the darkness we see the silhouette of 
        a human figure with wolflike features get up from the bed and 
        walk off spencer is moaning

        the room remains dark for a moment then spencer struggles 
        and turns on the light hes all bloodied and can barely move 
        as he reaches for the phone as soon as he grabs the 
        receiver he dies the bloody phone falls to the floor

        mark looks up at her with his pleading bambi eyes that frida 
        always falls for

        mark goes to hug her and kiss her neck she sniffs him then 
        sniffs him again more closely  like a dog mark giggles 
        frida doesnt like what she smells

                                  mark

        mark puts his wallet watch and beeper on the dresser and 
        leaves the room unbuttoning his shirt frida enters and sits 
        on the bed her head is spinning mark turns on the shower 
        which we hear off screen he passes in front of the camera 
        shirtless frida sees him gets up and walks toward him

                                  frida
                       mark

        the mouth hes taken off guard she then pushes him away

        mark leaves frame frida goes back into the bedroom she 
        hears mark singing muffled from the bathroom fridas about 
        to lie back on the bed when marks beeper goes off

        she reaches up to the dresser for the beeper its the kind 
        that has a message on it she presses the message button and 
        sees mark you studmuffin last night was awesome see you 
        soon sherry frida puts down the beeper

        she leans back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling her 
        eyes are glowing 


        int fridas bathroom  dusk

        mark steps in the shower and pulls the shower curtain closed 
        cu of the water coming out of the spout mark suds his body 
        with soap and continues singing he starts even lightly 
        dancing in the shower  looking vain and ridiculous

        a blurry human figure with wolflike features appears behind 
        the shower curtain  but mark has his back turned and doesnt 
        see it then he hears a growl over the sound of the water 
        running mark turns around and sees the figure

        then we see from the wolffigures pov an attack on mark 
        reminiscent of the shower scene from psycho 

        after the attack the blurry wolfish figure runs off and the 
        camera stays on mark as he slumps to the ground we zoom in 
        on his eye and on the bloody water going down the drain 
        dissolve from the eye to a full moon and then back to the eye


        int fridas apartment  night

        camera dollies creepily through the apartment as we still hear 
        the sound of the water running in the shower

        a knocking at the door awakens frida she is nearly naked 
        except for some shredded clothing her face is scratched

        blinks a few times and her vision seems blurry 

        she sits up puts her glasses on throws on her robe and 
        stumbles to answer the door the shower water is still 
        running but frida doesnt seem to notice

        lloyd looks around he starts coughing  like hes choking 
        on something

                                  peter
                       you okay lloyd

                                  peter
                       he needs some water 

        peter opens the cupboard to get a glass and sees a carton of 
        milk some cottage cheese other products that should be in 
        the refrigerator lloyd is not facing the cupboard and is in 
        his coughing fit anyway so he doesnt see this

        jennifer and frida he makes eyecontact with frida and sees 
        shes afraid he lets her off the hook and just takes a glass 
        out of the cupboard and closes it as though nothings wrong 

        he fills the glass with water from the sink and hands it to 
        lloyd lloyd drinks up and stops his coughing fit

                       frida you have to admit he is a 
                       bit cold at times and last time 
                       you saw him he was quite torn 
                       apart

        jennifer is tempted to laugh frida is more serious

                                  frida
                       but you said the bodies were ripped

                       no why

                                  peter
                       he was ripped to shreds also in 
                       his apartment

                       weve ever seen

        frida lets them out she and peter exchange a glance frida 
        closes the door she and jennifer stare at each other

                                  frida

                       of the killings

                                  lloyd

                       would rip guys to shreds just outta 
                       jealousy this makes no sense

        peter takes a squirt gun and squirts frida frida screams 
        playfully she grabs another squirt gun and fills it

        montage of squirt gun fight played just like a real police 
        gunfight  with them creeping through the apartment and 
        ducking behind furniture trying to get a direct hit on each 
        other and having a great time

        peters beeper goes off he checks it as he does frida 
        squirts him in the face she cracks up

                                  frida
                       whatever you do dont tell me you 
                       have to leave

        she walks him to the door they kiss peter opens the door 
        from the hallway we see his pov of frida as he closes the 
        door and she looks sadly at him

        match cut the closing of the door with the opening of the 
        trunk in the next scene


        ext car lot  day

        from inside the trunk the door opens and we see peter and 
        lloyd looking down into it they hold their noses from a bad

                       madame sconce the original 
                       werewolves were females they 
                       became werewolves on the lunar 
                       cycle because it corresponded to 
                       the womans cycle my suspicion is 
                       that the only cure is true love

        object which is a large front tooth peter has a quick flash 
        of marks dead face in the car trunk missing a tooth

        on her hands she hears peter coming and quickly slips on 
        some rubber gloves to hide her hands

        ecu of peter sticking the tooth in his pants pocket he 
        enters the kitchen somethings weighing heavily on his mind

        he goes to her to kiss her but frida selfconscious about 
        possible facial hair bows her head and he ends up kissing the 
        top of it she recoils and he looks at her concerned she 
        wont let him get a good look at her face

                                  frida

                                  frida
                       i was just wondering a person 
                       has a choice between killing 
                       themselves or killing others which 
                       is worse i mean you fry in hell 
                       either way right

                                  priest
                       if you kill yourself you wont be 
                       around to ask for forgiveness or to 
                       make a last confession whereas if 
                       you kill others you can go to 
                       confession do penance and be 
                       absolved from your sins

                                  frida
                       but if the person is killing 
                       several people then maybe its 
                       better to kill oneself cause then 
                       the killing stops

                                  priest
                       you have a point hmmm ive 
                       never been asked this before 
                       who is being killed catholics 
                       homosexuals protestants
