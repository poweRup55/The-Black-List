            line drawings of elves small forest creatures tree limbs
            and other grotesqueries drawn in the delicate fanciful and
            yet frightening style of arthur rackham the dissolves from
            one card to another are accomplished by a gust of wind
            blowing autumnal leaves past the title as the card begins its
            dissolve  the drawing on the last card shows an oddly shaped
            tree trunk

            miss callahan extends her arm toward the right column they
            take up the words the left column has just finished while
            the left column now goes on with the second part of the

                      are bending down 

            miss callahan smiles in satisfaction at her pupils and
            turning around continues along the pathway waving time with
            her hands as the children go on and on with their musical
            round

            ext bridge crossing a small stream  day

            with miss callahan at their head the children march onto the
            bridge here miss callahan halts and the children stop with
            her she turns to face them and makes a motion for them to
            gather around her with them grouped about her she half
            turns facing the sunny glade on the other side of the stream

                                miss callahan
                      take a good look children it may seen
                      just a little valley with a stream
                      running through it but no its sleepy
                      hollow just because you are lucky enough
                      to be the kindergarten class of

                      hollow 
                          glancing at her watch
                      for exactly fifteen minutes

            almost with the grace of a child she rises and begins to run
            as if this were a signal for them to begin their play the
            children run after her

            med shot of children as they begin to run past the camera
            laughing end shouting  finally one little girl comes
            running past the camera and the camera trucks with her this
            girl is amy reed there is a haunting quality about her
            childishness almost a feeling such as wordsworth expressed
            that her youth still keeps her in touch with the memory of
            another world a memory which fades with each passing day
            and whose fading leaves a sense of emptiness and loss

            med close shot  amy apart from the other children she
            raises her arms and looks up to the sun and the sky a
            butterfly perched on a stalk of mullen attracts her
            attention and she tiptoes softly toward it kneels beside
            it and begins to speak to it her voice can be heard but
            the words cannot be distinguished suddenly the butterfly
            spreads its wings and flies away amy rises with a smile and
            runs after it 

            med close shot  a stand of goldenrod in the meadow the
            butterfly flies into the scene and lights on one of the
            blossoms a moment later amy comes and kneels beside it she
            whispers but only a word or two can be heard

                                amy
                      where are you going — why do you fly 
                      the whole wide world   my friend 
                      youre my friend

            the butterfly flutters its wings and soars into the air amy
            chases after it

            med close shot of several children ruthlessly pulling up the
            goldenrod  the butterfly goes fluttering past them  amy
            her face rapt and concentrated runs past in friendly
            pursuit  one of the boys a stocky heavyset youngster
            named donald looks after her and begins to run

            the camera dollies with amy as she pursues the butterfly
            from behind her comes a shout

                                donalds voice
                      ill get it for you amy

            donald enters scene and runs past her

                      ill get it for you ill get it

            he runs ahead of her and before she can protest snatches
            off his cap and with a quick sweeping movement catches the
            butterfly and presses his cap closely to him  as amy and tho
            camera halt together he opens the cap with a smile puts in
            his hand and brings out the torn crushed body of the
            butterfly  he offers it to amy

            closeup of amy  the shock and hurt have hit so deep in her
            childish mind that her face is almost expressionless 

            two shot  amy and donald  he still stands stupidly smiling
            at her  amy makes a quick movement with her hand and slaps
            him hard across the face

                           one who tries to bring calm
                           to a situation
                      really mr reed there isnt anything to

                           the whole discussion on a
                           social footing
                      thats exactly what i told mr reed but
                      he insisted upon remaining home from
                      business to talk to you miss callahan

                                oliver
                      i know it may seem stupid of mebut it
                      isnt the slap im worried about  its
                      the reason

                                miss callahan
                      something to do with a butterfly they
                      were quarreling about it

                                oliver
                      no amy slapped donald because he had
                      hurt the butterfly  and it was her
                      friend

                                miss callahan
                      well that seems a harmless fancy 

                                oliver
                          interrupting
                      amy has too many fancies  too few
                      friends it worries me it doesnt seem
                      normal

                                alice
                          apologetically to miss
                           callahan
                      you know these fond fathers with their
                      only chicks

            miss callahan disregards this she looks seriously into
            olivers face

                                miss callahan
                      i can see youre worried and she is a
                      very sensitive and delicately adjusted
                      child

            she makes a slight pause as if hesitant to go on then
            abruptly resumes talking

                                miss callahan contd
                      but a good deal of the blame for that may
                      lie with you mr reed perhaps youre
                      over anxious  watch her too closely 
                      worry too much the childs bound to feel
                      it

            oliver is about to answer but amy who has been in the
            corridor suddenly comes into the room

                                amy

            walks quickly and the child trots along beside her  the two

                                alice contd
                      she certainly doesnt seem to have
                      inherited any artistic abilities from
                      either of us look at that

            oliver peers over her shoulder at the drawing

                      amy too much to let her lose herself in a

            takes up a handful of birthday candles already mounted in
            their candy sconces and begins to put them into the cake
            edward suiting the action to the word half singing half
            speaking but avoiding any musical comedy feeling

            sidewalk humming to herself she skips along sometimes
            hopping on one foot as if she were playing a game of
            hopscotch sometimes swinging herself diffidently around the
            trunk of the tree and continuing on in the sunlight up the
            sidewalk toward her comes jack on his tricycle amy sees him
            and stops as he passes her she calls out to him

            frowning she reaches a corner where she stops for a second
            pulling herself backward and forward contemplatively as she
            holds on to the cornerpiece of a fence she still is looking
            after jack puzzled she shakes her head giving the problem
            up and turns down the side street she stops almost
            immediately her face brightening again with the anticipation
            of new joy

            to their game of jacks devoting their entire attention to
            it

            little girls scramble to their feet and with screams of
            laughter start running down the street amy turns around
            puzzled and then starts after the children the three little
            girls can be heard screaming to one another

            piazza stands on the fringe of the forest it is overgrown
            with ivy morning glories and wild honeysuckle  the yard
            too which had once been a formal garden is a tangle of wild
            growth  the house is silent no sign of life about it  a
            very low crumbling and in some places completely broken
            iron rail sets the garden off from the dirt pathway  there
            are ornate statues in the garden and in front of the
            entrance is an old elaborate carriage post  the children
            come running into the scene screaming and laughing

                                children

            closer shot of the children suddenly they notice where they
            are and they immediately grow more quiet their whispers can
            be heard as they go past on tiptoe

                                children
                          ad lib

            longer shot of the children as they near the other end of the
            fence their courage suddenly leaves them and they all make
            a frantic run for it

            shot of amy as she comes up to the old house she is out of
            breath and quite evidently her playmates have gotten out of
            her sight she looks with interest at the strange house and
            the overgrown garden she stands gazing about her a voice
            from an upper window begins to call her the voice is sweet
            professionally trained and full of enticement

                                voice
                      little girl little girl come into the
                      garden its pleasant and cool here 
                      ever so pleasant  ever so cool out of
                      the hot sun 

            amy is fascinated she looks up and still looking up slowly
            and hesitantly begins to go into the garden she passes under
            the pergola and peers at the frightening heraldic lion in the
            bushes with an occasional glance in the direction of the
            voice which still can be heard calling she goes on to the
            path and approaches the sculptured figure of comedy on the
            porch steps from above her the voice calls

                                voice
                      little girl step back away from the
                      house so that i can see you step back
                      little girl

            amy looks puzzled but to get a better view she takes one or
            two natural steps backward looking up 

            close up of an open window a gentle breeze is blowing the
            lace curtains through the opening between the curtains a
            womans gnarled hand appears in a velvet sleeve this hand
            holds a handkerchief weighted at one corner and tosses the
            handkerchief out the windowext farren gardens  dayamy watches as the handkerchief flutters down  she makes a
            futile effort to catch it  it falls near her she picks it
            up and examines it 

            insert      amys hands as she holds up the handkerchief 
            one corner of it has been drawn through a silver ring  she
            removes the ring and tries it first on one finger and then
            another  it fits her thumb 

            med close shot of amy  she puts the ring on her thumb and
            stands a moment holding the handkerchief up between her two
            hands  suddenly and silently from behind a bush beside her a
            thin white arm and hand appears  the hand grasps the
            handkerchief

            two shot of miss barbara farren cadaverously tall and thin
            with only her bright hair to speak of a beauty which is
            quickly fading as she steps out into the sunlight from
            behind the bush  as she does so she tears the handkerchief
            from amys hands  amy stunned and silent relinquishes the
            handkerchief and watches while barbara farren paces stately
            across the garden and around the corner into the house  from
            above her the voice can be heard calling

                                voice
                      go away little girl  go away

            amy looks up and starts to move away  at first she walks
            slowly with many  backward glance but upon reaching the
            protective shadows of the pergola she breaks into a run

                      know what the score is

            amy comes in from the back yard  she is hot and breathless
            as if she had been running  edward takes a look at her and a
            quick look at the kitchen clock  he leaves his former
            companion lying on the table and crosses to the icebox

                                edward contd

            she nods  he opens the icebox door and takes out a glass of
            milk which has been standing waiting covered with a saucer 
            as amy takes the glass with her right hand she holds up her
            left thumb

                                amy

                                edward
                      most surely that was a nice lady to give
                      a ring to a little girl

                                edward

            edward looks at her appraisingly

            edward looks up in concern and amy hastens to bury her face
            in the glass of milk

                                edward
                      your daddy isnt going to like that  he
                      had his heart set on your playing with
                      the other kids

            he shakes his head uttering a clucking sound of disapproval 
            amy takes her face out of tho glass long enough to say

                                amy
                          thoughtfully
                      id better tell him

            she drinks the remainder of her milk thinks a moment and
            evidently feels it better to get the worst over right away

                                oliver
                      your daddys so pleased with you hes
                      building a model ship for your very own 
                      come take a look at it                        

            he takes her by the hand to show her the model on the bench 
            amy looks at it but she is not particularly happy  her
            fathers kindness makes it all the more difficult for her to
            tell him what she has to say

                                oliver contd
                      you see when you are a good girl and
                      play with other children instead of
                      moping and dreaming by yourself your
                      daddy wants to do everything he can to
                      make you happy

            this has not helped amy any  she stands still staring at
            him wondering how to begin

                                oliver contd
                      how you run along and join your
                      playmates

            turning away from her he turns on the electric saw amy
            still stands watching him he is about to feed a piece of
            wood to the saw when she finally summons up courage enough
            to tug at his sleeve

                                amy
                      daddy 

            oliver looks at her and tries to hear what she is saying but
            cannot because of the noise of the machinery  with an
            impatient gesture he turns it off

                                oliver
                      what do you want amy

                                amy

                      tell you about the other children

                      but i didnt play with them daddy  they
                      wouldnt play with me 

            oliver is annoyed at having been interrupted and further
            angered by the fact that he had jumped to his own conclusion
            of the childs goodness  he sits down on a little stool to
            bring himself on the same level with the child

                                oliver
                      what do you mean you didnt play with the
                      other children

                                amy
                      it was on account of the birthday party

                                oliver
                      because you didnt ask them  i dont
                      blame them for being angry why didnt
                      you explain what happened

                                amy

                                oliver

                      voice 

            oliver cocks his head apprehensively

                                oliver

                                amy
                      it was just a voice

                                oliver
                          completely angry
                      now look this is the last time you come
                      to me with any such stories — im sick of

            his voice has been rising  as amy starts to steal out of the
            workshop into the yard alice dressed for gardening pokes
            her head in at the open doorway

                                alice
                          trying to pour oil on the

                      voices from an old dark house

                                alice

                      doubt in my mind that you spoil this
                      child

            amy who has been listening intently shrinking away with
            mingled embarrassment and hurt suddenly begins to cry
            oliver is the first to kneel beside her

                                oliver contd

            workshop door and turns back to look at her parents in the
            background alice is dabbing at her eyes with her
            handkerchief but she is smiling amy starts down the path
            edward trundling a wheelbarrow toward the front yard passes
            her notices the tears and stops

                      let me take another look at that ring

            she lifts it up and he looks at it 

                                edward

                      sit down and think of some good wishes to
                      make 

            edward with a kindly pat on her shoulder picks up his
            wheelbarrow and starts off amy looks after him absorbed
            then she turns 

            another angle amy ambles along the walk in one hand she
            carries the hoop and stick idly she kicks up  pebble with
            the toe of her shoe as she passes a bush she tears off a
            leaf and chews on it she reaches a snail pond and  drops
            down beside it with a sigh amy locks down into the pond 

            insert      the surface of the pond a large goldfish is
            lazily swimming around 

            back to scene amy smiles and leans over tho pond she puts
            one hand in the water and ripples the surface then staring
            at her hand she stops fascinated 

            close up of amys hand under the surface of the water the
            silver ring glistens brightly 

            amy draws her hand out of the water and stares at the ring a
            smile lightens her face she knows now what she will wish
            for she sits down on a large rock closes her eyes and
            firmly turns the ring on her finger as she makes her wish

                                amy
                      i wish for a friend

            for a second she remains with her eyes closed then slowly
            she opens her eyes looks about herext the woods  daylong shot the trees stand still and quiet at first no
            breeze rustles the leaves the yaddo lying on the lawn is
            motionless then a whisper of a breeze moves the branches of
            the trees and the yaddo flutters gently coming to lifeext reed yard  dayamy is standing up and looking with anticipation at the
            moving sunlight and shadow 

            through the picket fence on the fringe of the woods a
            cluster of dandelions grow the breeze blows the dandelions
            and they incline their tufted heads toward the yard the
            little spears of dandelion fluff are loosened in the air and
            enter the yard sailing on the wind the musical motif of
            irenas song sounds faintly growing stronger

            amy looks about her as the dandelion tufts come dancing by
            her
            she laughs happily and in the moving sunlight and shadow
            begins to roll her hoop irenas song which fills the track
            is gay and happyint oliver reeds workshop  dayoliver is at his handsaw he is feeding a long thin strip of
            wood into the saw and edward stands behind him holding up the
            other end of the stick ho has on a carpenters apron
            through the window amy can be seen playing happily racing
            along the path 

            the saw cuts to the end of the stick and oliver turns it off
            both men look out of the window

                      amy looks happy — seems almost as if she
                      were playing with another child like
                      somebody else were running with her and
                      playing

            attention and she turns

            the entrance to the drawing room as amy sees it  a portiere
            like curtain separates the drawing room from the hallway 
            inside the drawing room in the halflight are weird shadows

            roomint farren drawing room  daythe drawing room like the hallway is deep with shadows the
            drawing room is cluttered with useless victorian and
            edwardian antiques  amy moves slowly into the room her
            attention going from one baroque object to another on a
            small mahogany table there is a glassed dome enclosing a
            stuffed dove that flutters over a mossy column of artificial
            forgetmenots  a low cackling laughter sounds os 
            startled amy looks up 

            a corner of the room  in the dim light the furniture throws
            large shadows  an amused cackling laughter is heard 

            amy frightened listens a moment  the laughter ceases amy
            takes a step toward the hallway  suddenly there is a sharp
            quick rattling sound and sunlight floods the scene  amy
            cowers hiding her eyes from the bright light

            julia farren stands at the window one hand still resting on
            the center rod of the oldfashioned shutter through which
            bright sunlight now pours mrs farren is a fabulous

            a diamond top her scarlet lips open in a smile as she looks
            down at amy

            amy slowly lets her hands fall from her face and stares up
            at julia farren blinking her eyes in the unaccustomed light
            julia farren adjusts the rod on the shutter so that the light
            is softer and no longer glaring she smiles at amy

                                mrs farren

            mrs farren moves a few steps to her chair and sits down in

            she indicates the sofa across from her

            amy moves to the sofa and slides up onto it a large white
            cat leaps onto the lap of mrs farren who caresses it
            gently amy is unable to take her eyes from the fabulous
            woman before her mrs farren smiles a glittering smile

               to freeze an icy hateful gleam comes into her eyes amy

               beautiful her eyes lynxlike glint as she stares she
               looks as if she might pounce like a panther into the room

                      wind the flapping and fluttering of his
                      great cloak beating like gaunt wings the
                      thunder of his horses hooves is loud
                      loud and louder beating hard beating
                      strong on the frozen ground as he comes
                      riding riding riding

                      at the hour of midnight down the road
                      that goes through sleepy hollow across
                      the bridge he goes galloping galloping

                       if you stand on that bridge at the
                      wrong hour  the hour when he rides by
                      his great cloak sweeps around you he
                      swings you to his saddle bow and you
                      have to ride forever your eyes seeing for
                      his blind eyes your ears listening for
                      his ears long deafened and dead and
                      always his cold arms around you crushing
                      you into the cavity of his bony chest
                      then forever you must ride and ride and
                      ride with the headless horseman

                      perhaps youd better go through the whole
                      bunch there may be others of irena in
                      there

            oliver nods and sits down on the arm of the chair he starts
            to turn the photos over

            over the scene from outside sounds the gay childish
            laughter of amy oliver raises his head and listens for a
            second he then begins sorting the photosext reed garden  dayas amy walks along the garden path she is bouncing a large
            gailycolored ball she is bouncing it at first in an aimless
            sort of way then she throws it up into the air and catcher
            it over the scene comes the strain of irenas song and
            amy with the ball in hand looks up her eyes brighten with
            a curious interest and her lips part in a friendly smile
            she tosses the ball toward the camera after a second it
            comes back to her this time the camera travels with the ball
            to show amys friend who catches the ball and tosses it back

                      at still midnight walk round about an
                      oak with great raggd horns and there
                      he blasts the trees with a sigh 
                      ah well its a bad generation 
                      forgetting all the beautiful words ill
                      tell you plainly  theres a wild
                      huntsman who scours the forest with his
                      dogs and his men he winds his horn and
                      the woods echo with it everywhere he
                      passes the animals are slaughtered and
                      lie dead beneath his trampling feet if
                      he should catch up with anyone walking in
                      the wood forever and forever they would
                      have to hunt with herne the huntsman and
                      his wild rout hear his horn 

            the question is addressed to both persons amy nods and
            edward shakes his head

                                amy
                      and does he kill people

                                mrs farren
                      no not people  just deer and game but
                      the people he catches can never be free
                      again they too must kill and kill
                      covering themselves with blood

            edward getting alarmed by now decides that the visit has
            lasted long enough he looks toward the shuttered windows

                                edward
                      its dark wed better be getting on the
                      family will be waiting

                                mrs farren
                      such a brief visit but dear child it
                      has made my christmas very merry

            she takes amys little hands and presses them against her
            withered cheek tenderly from the doorway barbara watches
            bitten deep with jealousy and hurt

                                amy
                          as edward takes her hand and
                           starts to lead her from the
                           room
                      merry christmas

            she reaches the doorway and mrs farren blows her a kiss
            barbara moves with them to the door to let then outint farren hallway  nightsilently barbara watches edward and amy pass out into the
            snowfilled darkness then she turns back into the hall 
            mrs farren looking at the sparkling new ring on her finger
            is walking toward the stairs

                                barbara
                          bitterly
                      you didnt even open my present and im
                      your daughter

                                mrs farren
                      my daughter died long ago

            very slowly holding onto the banister mrs farren starts
            ascending the stairs  barbara stands watching herext road  duskearly winter darkness is in the air it is not snowing but a
            wind is blowing rustling the garments of edward and amy who
            walk down the road the colored man is leading amy by one
            hand in his other hand is a pocket flash which he now turns
            on the ray of the flashlight cuts through the darkness the
            beam falling upon the snowy road suddenly edward stops
            short staring down before him 

            the camera pans along the ray to where it discloses lying
            upon the snow in a pool of blood the mangled body of the
            little deer 

            edward quickly tries to hide the pathetic sight of the dead
            deer from amys eyes by switching the flashlight off the
            object and by putting an arm around the child shielding her
            from viewing the carcass

                                edward
                      mustnt look little miss mustnt look

                                amy
                      but i saw what it was its the little
                      deer

            edward has passed by the deer and is walking along more
            rapidly now with amy

                                edward
                      bad luck to see death in the snow

                                amy
                      but what happened to the little deer

                                edward
                      probably hit by a car hard to see things
                      in the twilight

                                amy
                      why is it just lying there why doesnt
                      it get up

                                edward
                      because it cant its dead

                                amy
                      but it was alive — it was fast and
                      strong

                                edward
                      it got hit

                                amy
                      but where has it gone  wheres all the
                      strength and the quickness

            edward cannot answer the childs question so he makes a
            secret of it he raises his finger to his lips he shrugs

                                amy
                          pondering a moment
                      ill ask my friend shell know

            amy immediately dismisses the whole project from her mind and
            walks along with edward

                                                                fade out

                                                                 fade inint reed living room  eveningoliver is just finishing dismantling the christmas tree

            of oliver and irena which oliver had put in the back of the
            album weeks ago

            wondrous delight at the photograph she holds in her hands

            oliver stares at her a second then takes the photograph from
            her and looks at it there is a pause and he looks closely
            at amy

                                oliver

            amy realizes by the seriousness of his tone that once more
            she has offended her father she has no way however of
            knowing the reason for that offense alice has come over and
            is staring down at the picture which she has taken from
            oliver oliver kneels down so that his eyes are on a level
            with amys

            amy is confused and overwrought alice hoping to divert
            oliver touches him on the shoulder

            full glare of the cold moonlight

            the camera pans with her as she walks along about the time
            she has reached the halfway point in her journey across the
            bridge she stops stilled with terror in the distance is a
            sound that seems very much like that of the hoofs of an
            approaching horse galloping closer through the winter night
            amy turns and looks behind her

            the post road as amy sees it stretching out into the
            shadows there is nothing stirring but the sound of the
            approaching horseman grows louder and louder 

            amy turns her head away and starts to run the sound grows
            louder closer filling the screen amy stumbles and falls
            she cowers against the side of the bridge as the rider
            thunders down upon her the sound tears past her and a
            shadow brushes by her and is gone timidly she looks up

            fast as possible across the snowy road the car has no

            automobile it is covered with a chain but the chain has
            become loose and is flapping rhythmically against the road
            making a sound like that of horse hoofs

            they enter the frozen meadow preceded by the troopers with
            the hounds on leashes  their flashlights gleam

            over her until her body is partially covered by it  her head
            is fallen forward and to one side  she seems to be sleeping
            a sleep of death  far in the distance os is heard the
            barking of the hounds 

            the camera moves in for a closeup of amys face  the hounds
            bark again far away  amys eyelids flicker over the scene
            as in amys mind is the voice of mrs farren saying
            repeatedly

            again the hounds bark and the captains shrill whistle
            sounds in the distance  amy is jolted suddenly out of her
            sleep  she rubs her eyes and listens  far away once more
            the hounds are heard barking  amy frightened struggles to
            her feet and looks off 

            long shot of the meadow  through the falling snow far away
            are the tiny flashlights of the state troopers  the hounds
            bay dismally 

            amy with new terror in her heart stumbles off into the wind
            and storm

            humming to herself the song from cymbeline   barbara
            listens for a moment a new light comes into her eyes and

            through the wind and storm the hounds are baying loudly the
            rays of the flashlights are coming up into the house

            through the shadows and holds on amy irena slips back
