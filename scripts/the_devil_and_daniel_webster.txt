the devil and daniel webster
aka all that money can buy


the hill farm of jabez stone in new hampshire some miles from the village 
of cross corners around 1840 it is a poor farm stony and stingy with its 
favors the house is small simple bare

a wide view of the jabez stone farm on a sunday morning fades in and it is 
seen squatting down under the muddy showery skies of a cold new hampshire 
spring the grip of winter is broken  the ground runs with water the air 
is still cold but the sun is warm at noon its a cold spring but liveness 
has begun to come back to the earth it isnt depressing weather  exciting 
rather  for after months of snow and ice there is going to be warmth and 
light though not quite yet but theyre in the air  on the way
 
over this scene comes the sound of distant church bells ringing faintly from 
the village of cross corners and jabez stone a husky young farmer in his 
late twenties gets a rather discouragedlooking horse hitched to a rattle
trap buggy
 
				jabez 
		mary ma all ready first bells aringing
 
ma stone a brisk old woman jabezs mother bustles to the door which 
stands open she wears her best sundaygotomeeting clothes and is 
adjusting her bonnet tying the strings under her chin with nervous fingers
 
				ma stone 
		yes were all ready marys just coming down
 
she comes out on the porch she has a tart tongue and knows how to use it 
but when she talks to her son or her daughterinlaw there is affection 
under the tartness
 
				ma stone 
			helping him into his coat
		now son cheer up were all healthy weve 
		still got meal in the barrel and look at that 
		sky  
			pointing out 
		 big cracks in it like it was ice on the 
		mill pond cracking up to show its spring 
		acoming if that aint enough for a 
		godfearing new hampshire family i want to 
		know
  
and ma stone climbs up to the seat of the buggy jabez on her side to help 
her
 
now mary appears at the door also dressed for church she is four or five 
years younger than jabez small appealing with rather fine features she 
looks more fragile than she is it is obvious that she and jabez are very 
much in love
 
				mary 
			seeing the pool of mud in 
			her way stops and calls
		jabez  help
 
				jabez  
		coming  

he rushes from the buggy to help
 
the dog shep a ragged shepherd appears from below the hill running with a 
stick in his mouth he jumps up against jabezs leg wiping his mudcaked 
paws on him
 
				jabez 
		down shep down
 
				mary 
		he only wants you to throw the stick for him 
		jabez i guess hes feeling the spring 
		acoming too
 
				jabez
		all right  only he neednt dirty my pants
 
he wrests the stick away from shep and throws it far off with a mighty swing 
shep runs after it barking excitedly mary standing on the edge of the 
porch follows the soaring stick with her eyes
 
				mary 
			speaking with pride
		you throw mighty far jabez  almost into the 
		pigsty 

				ma stone
	 		from the buggy
		mary  jabez 
 
				mary 
		coming ma

				jabez 
			as he sweeps mary up in his 
			arms carrying her to the buggy
		what is that smile on your face
			glancing down at his clothes 
		is there anything wrong with me
 
				mary 
		now jabez ive got on my sunday bonnet and 
		im going to church with my husband almost the 
		first time since the beginning of winter  and 
		if that isnt an occasion i dont know what is
 
				jabez 
		youre right mary

				ma stone 
		i hope we wont be too late  
 
she shifts her position so that mary can get in too the barking of shep is 
heard and then suddenly the squealing of a pig
 
				jabez 
		now what the dickens  
 
and we see shep on the slope coming from the barns barking excitedly and 
chasing after a small pig that his barking has scared into a panic 
thereupon at the stone house jabez stands up in the buggy
 
				jabez 
			yelling
		look at that consarn dog shep stop it shep
 
jabez leaps down  from the buggy and heads for the bushes chasing the pig 
shep runs after him barking furiously only making matters worse and on the 
slope cutting down to the gully there unfolds a wild scene of jabez trying to 
catch the slippery pig both man and pig slip through the mud and fall once 
jabez almost catches the pig grabs frantically for its hind leg but the pig 
manages to break away finally the pig slips over some rocks in the gully 
and falls hurting its leg jabez succeeds in cornering it helped by shep 
who rounds it up as he would a sheep and jabez carries the pig back toward 
the house his clothes now a sight with mud and wet
 
at the stone house
 
				ma stone 
		well i guess we wont be going to church today
 
				mary 
		i guess we wont
 
jabez emerges from the gully with the pig still squealing in his arms he  
comes up panting the muddy dog following him looking quite triumphant and 
not at all guilty mary is near jabez comes up to her and they stand for a 
moment looking at each other
 
				jabez 
			as the pig squeals
		quiet mr porker 
			laughing as he struggles 
			to hold it 
		hes worse than a greased pig at the county 
		fair
 
they walk into the house as the rain starts

the kitchen it is the largest room in the house and very much the 
pleasantest there is a big fireplace with fire in it crane pothooks etc 
all of the cooking is done here a clock with a tinny striking effect hangs 
on the wall jabez and mary enter ma follows
 
				jabez 
			looking over the pig
		i think his leg is broken
 
				mary 
			taking his wet trousers hanging 
			them near the fire and covering 
			his knees with a blanket
		oh jabez
 
				jabez 
			shaking his head
		yep
 
he is fitting a crude splint to the pigs wounded leg helped by mary who 
holds the splint while jabez wraps it tightly with some rags torn from an old 
shirt the pig doesnt like this a bit and often protests loudly in the 
shrill guttural of pigs
 
				jabez 
		i remember dad used to say sometimes when they 
		were handing out hard luck the farmers got 
		there first
 
				mary 
		jabez dont you remember your own wedding we 
		said its for better or worse we said its for 
		richer or poorer
 
				jabez 
		thats what we said
 
				ma stone 
			has taken the bible 
			and starts leading
		there was a man in the land of uz whose name 
		was job and that man was perfect and upright 
		and one that feared god and eschewed evil
  
				jabez 
			as the pig heaves and 
			almost breaks away
		consarn the consarn  
 
				ma stone 
		jabez what kind of talk is that for the 
		sabbath and me areading the holy word
 
				jabez 
		sorry ma  but this consar this little 
		pig   he wont let me fix him 
 
				mary  
			smiling
		hes stubborn as a stone
 
				jabez 
		hold the splint tighter  its almost done 
			as mary holds the splint tighter 
		go on reading ma this man job he had 
		troubles didnt he
 
				ma stone 
		you know that son 

				jabez 
			nodding
		hard luck  like me
  
				ma stone 
			severely
		now jabez stone  as for what youre calling 
		hard luck  well we made new england out of 
		it that and codfish
 
				jabez 
		thats right ma  we aint licked yet a 
		stones never licked till hes dead  thats 
		what dad used to say didnt he ma
 
ma stone nods silently
 
				jabez 
			finishing with the pig
		there guess that ought to hold good put him 
		down here by the fire mary 
			moving forward an empty woodbox 
		but we dont want to get him too close  well 
		have roast pork for supper
 
				ma stone 
			with a smile
		not on the sabbath you wont jabez
 
				mary 
		give me the book ma im going to read us 
		something comforting
 
ma hands her the book and mary plumps it down on her knee with spirit turns
the pages then remembers and looks up at ma stone  

				mary
		that is  if you dont mind changing the 
		lesson ma
 
				ma stone 
		land sakes i dont mind i never did hold much 
		with job even if he is scripture he took on 
		too much to suit me i dont want to malign the 
		man but he always sounded to me as if he came 
		from massachusetts yes mary you go ahead 
		and read
 
as mary is about to read there is a dash of rain on the windows and shep is 
heard barking from outside holding the blanket around him jabez rises and 
goes to the window

				jabez 
		well ill be  theres a rig turning in by
		the gate
 
				mary 
			rising and going quickly 
			to the window
		who is it
 
				jabez
		its tom sharp and two other fellers  oh 
		glory  wheres my pants
 
he makes a wild scramble for them grabbing them up from a chair near the 
fire the women in the way of all women are rushing about fixing up the 
kitchen shep is heard barking outside
 
outside a buggy has driven up in the teeming rain and two farmers their 
clothes drenched are climbing down while a third farmer remains in the 
drivers seat reining in the horse the men run for the shelter of the 
porch barked at by the dog who has been curled up by the kitchen door they 
reach the door and knock one pats the dog and quiets him jabez pulling up 
his braces opens the door
 
 				tom sharp
		afternoon mary
 
				mary
		afternoon tom come in
 
tom sharp starts to come in slowly followed by his friends
 
				ma stone 
		theres a mat there to wipe your feet on

 				tom sharp
		thanks maam howdy jabez
 
				jabez 
		howdy tom

he wipes his feet vigorously so does his companion

 				tom sharp
			introducing the second farmer
		this is van brooks  hes massachusetts

thereupon ma stone looks at him with redoubled suspicion and now the third 
farmer the one driving the buggy stands at the door stamping his wet feet

 				tom sharp
		this is eli higgins  vermont

				ma stone 
		theres a mat there to wipe your feet on

				third farmer
		thanks maam 

he enters
 
each farmer ducks awkwardly as introduced and mutters afternoon maam to 
mary and ma stone they come over and hold their hands out to the blaze that 
mary pokes up

				jabez
		come on close to the fire  set down

they sit
  
				van brooks 
			who is nearest to the woodbox
		little pig hurt himself
 
				jabez
		yep

the women busy themselves at the cupboard over in one corner opposite side 
of the fireplace the men make themselves comfortable by the fire as jabez 
adds a few logs of wood and again pokes up the coals but they do not smoke 
eli higgins gets his pipe out and is about to fill it
 
				ma stone 
		we dont smoke on sabbath in new hampshire
 
				eli higgins
		sorry maam i forgot 
			and he puts the pipe away
 
				jabez 
			to eli higgins
		hows the year been in your part of the 
		country
 
				eli higgins 
		had a good stand of corn  coming up right 
		nice then we got a hailstorm  in june 
		hailstones so mighty chickens sat on em 
		thinking they was eggs makes you wonder 
		sometimes what providence is thinking about
 
				van brooks
		we got a snowstorm in august
 
				mary 
		in august
 
				van brooks
		yes and it was so cold  a man got caught in 
		it  froze him solid all except his heart 
		that was frozen already
 
				tom sharp 
		loan shark  hey
 
				jabez 
		too bad it didnt happen to miser stevens
 
				tom sharp 
		are you one of old stevens customers too
 
				jabez 
		sure am
 
				tom sharp 
		yes its the debt and the lien and the 
		mortgage that eats up the farmer

he stretches out his thin legs uses a splinter of wood for a toothpick 
pulled from a log near the fire
 
				eli higgins 
		city folks they can go bankrupt  a farmer 
		he cant crawl easy
 
				van brooks 
		laws ought to be changed somehow
 
				tom sharp 
		yes we farmers ought to put through some of 
		our own laws at regular meetings  have a sort 
		of grange as they call it in vermont
 
				van brooks 
		thats why the three of us met up together 
		neighbor stone were american citizens  
		weve got a right to get ourselves organized 
		like city folks
 
				tom sharp 
		what do you say sound reasonable to you
 
				jabez
			pulling his chin
		sure does but ill have to sleep on it a 
		couple of nights
 
				tom sharp 
		thats fair enough jabez mans got a right to 
		mull things over well drive round again week 
		or so
 
they get up
 
				jabez  
		i am just thinkin  now they mightnt like 
		the idea down in washington
 
				tom sharp 
		why not theres a bill up in congress to give 
		us a uniform law of bankruptcy daniel webster 
		is fighting for it right now
 
				jabez 
		black danl

				van brooks 
		yep  the biggest man in the whole us  
		senator from massachusetts  and surely our 
		next president 

				jabez 
		he was born and raised at franklin  right 
		across the valley  mary is from there too
 
				mary 
			leaping in  flushed 
			with excitement
		he gave my father advice many times  about 
		crops and politics  and it was always right
 
				tom sharp 
		ive heard people talk a lot about his farm at 
		marshfield hes up at five there every morning 
		he aint one of our gentleman farmers he knows 
		all the ways of the land
 
				eli higgins
		they say when he goes out to fish the trout 
		jump out of the stream and right into his 
		pockets because they know its no use arguing
 
				jabez  
		why they say that when he speaks stars and 
		stripes come right out in the sky
 
the scene dissolves into websters study at night daniel webster is seated 
at his desk writing a speech a table lamp lights his face leaving the rest 
of the room in darkness on the wall behind him we see the shadow of scratch
 
				voice of scratch  
		listen black danl youre wasting your time 
		writing speeches like that why worry about the 
		people and their problems start thinking of 
		your own you want to be president of this 
		country dont you  and you ought to be  
			continues dreamily  
		 inauguration day parade  bands playing  
		horses prancing the sun shining on the stars 
		and stripes waving in the breeze  crowds 
		cheering daniel webster president of the 
		united states of america 
			more briskly  
		dont be a fool stop bothering with that 
		speech and get busy promoting yourself instead 
		of the people
 
webster at this point grabs the inkwell and throws it at the shadow on the 
wall the shadow disappears and webster turns back looking over his speech
 
then the speech in websters handwriting appears on the screen
 
		i would say to every man who follows his own 
		plough and to every mechanic artisan and 
		laborer in every city in the country  i would 
		say to every man everywhere who wishes by 
		honest means to gain an honest living beware 
		of wolves in sheeps clothing
 
this dissolves to a series of views montage shots of a group in a village 
square of men and women farmer types reading a copy of websters speech 
headed webster pleads for farm rights in bankruptcy bill
 
				farmer 
			reading
		the insolvent farmers cannot even come to the 
		seat of their government to present their cases 
		to congress  so great is their fear that some 
		creditor will arrest them in some intervening 
		state  
 
this dissolves to a field revealing a farmer reading from the same speech 
with his wife and son it is day

				farmer 
			reading
		we talk much and talk warmly of political 
		liberty but who can enjoy political liberty if 
		he is deprived permanently of personal liberty 
		to those unfortunate individuals doomed to the 
		everlasting bondage of debt what is it that we 
		have free institutions of government
  
this dissolves to the jabez stone kitchen in the afternoon revealing jabez 
dressed to go to town seated by the small table glancing over daniel 
websters speech copied in the cross corners gazette the sheriff is 
looking over jabezs shoulder on the other side of the table is mary on the 
table is the cracked teapot in which they have hoarded their small savings 
mary is counting the money
 
				jabez 
			reading from the paper  
			websters speech
		  and if the final vote shall leave 
		thousands of our fellow citizens and their 
		families in hopeless distress can we  
		members of the government  go to our beds 
		with a clear conscience can we without self
		reproach supplicate the almighty mercy to 
		forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
 
				mary 
		thats wonderful language it would move a 
		stone
 
				jabez
		if it would only move old miser stevens   
		weve still got to pay him 

				sheriff 
		yep  you cant get around that mortgage  
		 im sorry jabez
 
 				jabez 
		its all right sheriff
 
 				sheriff 
		wish i could really do something for you but 
		you know stevens hell throw you off your 
		farm tomorrow if you dont pay him tonight
 
				jabez 
		let him try it

 				sheriff 
		the law is the law goodbye mary

				mary 
		goodbye sheriff
 
the sheriff leaves
 
 				jabez 
		well  what are we going to do 

				mary 
		we can still use my butter money 

				jabez 
		your butter money

				mary 
		do you think im grudging it

				jabez 
		mary  its gone 

				mary 
		not all of it

				jabez 
		yes  i had to pay the vet in full he just 
		wouldnt have treated the horse this time 
		after all we cant very well do without a 
		horse
  
				mary 
		its all right jabez well find something 
		to pay stevens
 
				jabez 
		if the pig hadnt broke his leg we could have 
		taken him
 
 				mary
		jabez couldnt you take a sack of seed 
		instead
 
				jabez 
			bitterly
		to save us work on the spring plowing
 
 				mary 
		you always said the field uphill needs a rest 
		but if you think  
 
				jabez 
	 	mary im a farmer  always will be to me 
		seed isnt a thing to pay debts with its 
		alive more alive than anything  but i guess 
		youre right we just got to do it oh  hows 
		it all going to end
 
				mary 
		jabez  you ought to talk to tom about joining 
		the grange
 
				jabez 
		i will mary  always thought a man could be 
		stronger alone  seems ive been wrong about 
		that
 
ma stone calls from outside
 
				ma stones voice
		jabez youll be late 

				jabez 
			calling
		all right ma

he gathers up the worn bills and puts them in the inside pocket of his coat 

				mary 
		just a minute

she runs for the stairs that lead to the bedrooms
 
the side porch of the kitchen the wagon stands already hitched by the side 
door a fine whitefaced calf at the longlegged skittery stage is being 
held by ma stone by a piece of rope around its neck it is extremely nervous
anticipating a drastic change and jumps about a good deal tugging at the 
rope as jabez comes out from the house ma stone is jerking at the rope 
trying to make the calf quiet down
 
				jabez 
		howd you know to have the calf ready ma
 
				ma stone  
		i just figgered  knew you didnt have enough 
		bills
 
 				jabez 
		yes  and you figgered right consarn it
 
				ma stone 
			disapprovingly
		thats a word youre too free with lately 
		jabez consarn this and consarn that 
 
				jabez 
		helps sometimes to say it
 
 				ma stone 
			with understanding
		all right son  if it helps
 
mary comes out of the house she holds a scarf in her hand
 
				mary 
			as she sees the calf
		jabez
 
				jabez 
		seed alone wont do mary we have to throw the 
		calf in
 
				mary 
			very much disappointed
		oh jabez and we were counting on 
			stopping 
		its a lovely calf
 
				jabez 
			still glum
		youre right mary its a fine calf thats why 
		stevensll take it for the rest of the payment
 
he sighs and starts to get the calf up on the wagon and mary climbs up on 
the wagon to help at this moment the horse moves mary loses her balance 
and falls over backward from the wagon jabez rushes over to her

				jabez 
		mary  are you hurt 

mary is unconscious and doesnt answer
 
				ma stone 
		she hit her head  carry her in the house

he lifts her up carrying her into the house
 
the kitchen jabez puts mary into a chair
 
				ma stone 
		fetch some water  quick 

jabez rushes out to the pump while ma tends to mary
 
the yard as jabez comes out of the house with a bucket and hurries toward 
the pump shep the dog is seen by the corner of the house his muzzle 
raised to the sky howling dismally and strangely
 
				jabez 
		keep quiet shep
 
he continues on the way to the well to fill the bucket but shep howls again
 
				ma stone 
			calling from the kitchen door
		whats ailing that dog
 
				jabez 
			at the well
		i dunno
 
				ma stone 
		well  make him keep quiet

				jabez 
 		and why should i let him howl if it makes him 
		feel good 
			with a sudden rush of bitterness 
		consarn it hes better off than i am i wish i 
		could tell him 
			with an angry motion up to the sky 
		 up there just what i think
 
				ma stone 
		hush up such talk jabez 

				jabez 
		i cant help it i mean it i tell you ive 
		had more than my share nothing ever goes right 
		for me  nothing
 
he draws up water quickly and returns to the house

the kitchen jabez enters with the bucket of water and sets it down

				jabez 
			bending over mary tenderly
		mary

				mary 
			coming out of her faint
		jabez 
 
				jabez 
		mary  how do you feel
 
				ma stone
		let her be son shell do all right you 
		better get yourself straightened out
 
				mary 
			weakly
		yes jabez  dont worry
 
				jabez 
		ill get the doctor

				mary 
		no jabez  all i need is some rest  you go 
		and pay our debt everythingll be all right 
		then  everything
 
marys eyes close and she sinks into sleep while jabez leaves for the barn 

the barn jabez takes a sack of seed throws it on his shoulder at this 
moment the sack opens and all the seed runs out into a dirty pool of water

				jabez 
		thats enough to make a man sell his soul to 
		the devil and i would too for about two 
		cents
 
he stops abruptly realizing what he has said and appalled by it he looks 
around him fearfully

				jabez 
		i guess nobody heard i hope not
 
jabez jams his hands in his pockets and a horrified expression comes over his 
face he slowly takes out his right hand in the palm are two big copper 
pennies

				a voice 
			speaking smoothly
		good evening neighbor stone
 
jabez turns around and sees a figure  welldressed looking rather like a 
salesman jabez stares at him speechless
 
				the voice
		my name is scratch  i often go by that name 
		in new england
 
				jabez 
		i dont want to have any business with you
 
				scratch 
		do you deny that you called me ive known 
		people in other states who went back on their 
		word but i didnt expect it in new hampshire
 
				jabez 
			stung
		you cant say that to me im new hampshire 
		if i say i called you i did 
			in a lower voice 
		i guess i did
 
				scratch 
		youve had a lot of bad luck these days and 
		yet  its all so unnecessary when i think of 
		your opportunities  
 
				jabez 
		opportunities
 
				scratch 
		of course why man you have one of the richest 
		farms in the county 
			as jabez laughs bitterly 
			scratch persists  
		you just go about it the wrong way  so many 
		men do hard work  well thats all right for 
		people who dont know how to do anything else 
		its all right for people who arent lucky  
		but once youre lucky  you dont work for 
		other people you make them work for you

				jabez 
		well now mister that sounds all right but
 
				scratch
		a clever man like yourself  he can find money 
		anywhere money to pay his bills  money for 
		his wife and his children  money to be a rich 
		man all he needs is a friend to point it out 
		to him 
			kicks his suspiciously sharp 
			toe at a loose board in the barn 
		like that
 
the board rotten gives way underneath it is an iron pot filled with 
money scratch points down to it silently jabez looks at it dumbfounded
 
				scratch 
		dont be afraid of it pick it up feel it in 
		your hands
  
				sharps voice  
			from outside 
		jabez stone

jabez doesnt hear he still stares at the gold
 
				scratch  
		someones calling you mr stone
 
jabez looks up bewildered
 
				another voice from outside
		jabez stone
 
jabez runs across the barn to the other door tom sharp eli higgins and van 
brooks are approaching and jabez stops them in the doorway
 
				jabez 
			breathless
		what do you want
 
				tom sharp 
		howdy mr stone weve come round to ask you 
		if you made up your mind to join the grange
 
				jabez 
			in a daze
		what grange
 
 				tom sharp  
		that farmers association  we were talking 
		about the other day

				eli higgins 
		that is if you had time to mull it over 
		proper

				jabez 
			interrupting
		no no  i dont want to join 
			harshly 
		go away  leave me alone
 
 				tom sharp  
			retreating
		well  we dont mean to force you jabez stone 
		 but  its only for your own good
 
				jabez 
		ill look out for myself  now go away  
		leave me alone
 
he stands for a moment looking after them as they turn and leave then he 
quickly rushes back to scratch
 
				jabez 
			looking at the gold
		where did it come from
 
				scratch 
		oh you know the old story  the hessian wagon 
		train that was ambushed on the way to saratoga 
		some of the gold has been buried under your 
		barn
 
				jabez 
			feverishly
		yes why shouldnt it
 
				scratch 
		yes of course people forgot  or the men who 
		knew about it died you know how these things 
		happen

jabez goes forward to pick up the gold scratch stops him 

				jabez 
		its mine
 
				scratch
		thats right mr stone  there is  
			whipping a paper from his pocket  
		 just one little formality id like your 
		signature here  see and when its done  
		its done for seven years  
			as jabez looks up 
		its our usual form of course  we may be 
		able to take up the question of a renewal in 
		due time
 
 				jabez 
			staring at the paper 
			scratch holds before him
		what does it mean here  about my soul
 
 				scratch 
		well why should that worry you a soul  a 
		soul is nothing can you see it smell it 
		touch it  no  think of it  this soul 
		 your soul  a nothing against seven whole 
		years of good luck you will have money and all 
		that money can buy upon my word neighbor 
		stone if it werent for my firms reputation 
		for generous dealing

he starts to put the paper away

				jabez
		no no give it to me 

 				scratch 
			taking a pin from his coat lapel
		a pin neighbor stone im afraid youll have 
		to prick your finger  but whats a little 
		pain to a lucky man
 
jabez takes the pin pricks his finger and draws blood
 
				scratch 
			pointing
		sign here

jabez signs
 
				scratch 
		excellent a firm fair signature one that 
		will last till doomsday 
			tucking the deed away in his 
			pocketbook then shaking jabezs 
			hand 
		my dear neighbor stone i congratulate you 
		youre going to be the richest man in new 
		hampshire 
			he starts to leave
 
 				jabez 
		well ill be   
			he stoops to pick up some gold
 
				scratch
		yes indeed but not now not for seven years 
		oh i almost forgot  what is the date
 
				jabez 
		the seventh day of april  
  
				scratch 
		1840 well thatll take us to the seventh day 
		of april in 1847
 
they start for the door together
 
outside the barn the sunset fading from the sky jabez and scratch stand by 
a stunted tree near the door
 
				scratch 
		just to remind you  though of course well be 
		seeing each other in the interim 

he sweeps his five very pointed fingers across the bark of the tree and 
suddenly there is a date upon it april 7 1847 scratch moves toward his 
black buggy and black horse they are just shadows in the weird light
 
				scratch 
			lifting his hat
		good evening neighbor stone 
			he gets into the buggy 
		a beautiful sunset mr stone
 
jabez stands with the gold in his hands as we hear the buggy wheels drive 
away but we hardly can see it disappear it becomes part of the twilight so 
quickly
 
jabez left alone blinks as though waking from a fantastic dream he looks 
down at the gold in his hands and he brings a piece of it up before his eyes 
and stares at it blinking again

				jabez 
			in a low voice
		mary 
			the realization of his luck 
			coming over him in a wave 
		mary  mary mary
 
he rushes for the house the dog shep slinks out of the hall and follows 
jabez suddenly shaking off his fears and prancing by his masters side
 
the kitchen in jabez stones house the lamps are lit mary is propped up in 
a chair by the fire and ma stone is busy with supper jabez rushes over to 
mary so excited he cannot sit down he tosses the gold pieces in marys lap 
she is fingering them amazed  incredulous
 
				jabez
		mary  what would you do with a pot o gold 

				mary 
		jabez
 
 				jabez 
		mary  what would you do
 
 				mary 
		well  i  i dont know  i would pay our 
		debts and well  maybe get a new bonnet but 
		 really  i think i would live the same
 
				jabez

				jabez

		 there it was
 
				ma stone 
			skeptically as she carries plates 
			to the table  
		most outlandish thing i ever heard tell 
			as she thumps plates down on table 
		dont seem right somehow
 
				jabez
		but its true take em up in your hands mary 
		 feel em  theyre real all right

		more good than it did the hessians 

she drops it
 
				jabez
		well none of us have to worry any more ma 
		were rich  

he stoops down and kisses mary
 
				ma stone
			at the fire
		well  thats comforting 
			lifting the pot from the crane 
			and starting back toward the table 
			with it 
		supper
 
				jabez 
		say mary how is your shoulder
 
				mary
		it feels fine now jabez
 
				jabez
		will you come into town with me tomorrow
 
				mary 
		id love to
 
the scene fades out
  
a road fades in it is next morning and a bright spring day and jabez and 
mary both dressed for town are riding in the buggy en route to cross 
corners as we follow them jabez is in high spirits he is humming or 
whistling a little tune mary is too but with more reserve
 
this view dissolves to cross corners miser stevens office later in the 
day the buggy stops in a whirl of dust and as jabez jumps out of the buggy 
sheriff mays steps outside the office building
 
				jabez 
		hello sheriff
 
				sheriff 
		hello jabez  i was just talking to stevens 
		about a little extension on your payment
 
				jabez 
			laughing
		and you didnt get it hey come on well have 
		another talk with him
 
jabez takes the sheriffs arm and goes over to the office with him as jabez 
disappears through stevens door he turns and signals reassuringly to mary 
and gives her an elaborate wink
 
stevens office it is a bare cold room with a small iron stove near the 
desk a small iron safe and a few severe chairs a meager fire burns in the 
stove no more than a few coals stevens is behind his desk with various 
legal papers piled in front of him and is looking craftily at the door from 
the street as it opens and the sheriff enters followed by jabez
 
				jabez 
			closing the door and stepping 
			forward jauntily as he mockingly 
			sweeps off his hat
		stevens
 
				stevens 
			icily 
		well stone  have you got the money
 
				jabez 
			with mock humility
		i barely managed to scrape up a bit for you i 
		thought if i made a kind of part payment  
 
				stevens 
			hard as granite
		no stone
 
				jabez  
		 in gold
 
 				stevens 
			scornfully
		id like to know where youd get it
 
				jabez  
		you know  some folks are just lucky others 
		pick gold right out of the air  
			reaching up over his head as 
			though picking it from the air 
			and flinging a gold piece on the 
			desk 
		like that
 
				stevens 
			grabbing for the gold piece as 
			it rolls on the desk and biting it
		real sheriff you are a witness that this 
		money is paid me voluntarily and while it 
		does not satisfy the mortgage it has become 
		my property
 
				jabez 
		doesnt satisfy eh well  thats too 
		bad
 
he does another sly bit of hocuspocus and extracts another gold piece 
seemingly out of stevens nose and flings that one down
 
				jabez 
		rake that one in too 
			flinging it down 
		and this one  and this one  and that 
 
he takes them out now faster and faster flinging them down one after the 
other and laughing uproariously as stevens scrambles for them
 
				jabez 
			stepping close to the desk
		count it  count it the sheriffs here to 
		witness
 
he reaches out suddenly and grabs up a deed from stevens desk he glances at 
it makes sure it is his and deliberately tears it into bits and flings them
down on the desk
 
				jabez 
		that makes everything clean now come on 
		sheriff
 
he links arms with the sheriff and goes out leaving stevens staring at one 
of the pieces of gold as he holds it on his wrinkled palm he lets it fall to 
the desk suddenly realizing he has seen that kind of gold before with a 
motion of repulsion he pushes the gold aside moves back the top of his desk 
with a thrust of his trembling hand and stares down on something that is 
written there

there follows a close view an insertion of what stevens sees it is the 
present date april 8 1840 written in the same style of lettering scratch  
used on the tree on jabezs farm
 
then the previous scene reappearing we watch stevens staring at it for a 
moment then rising rather unsteadily and going quickly to his small iron 
safe he opens it snatches out some gold and some fat bundles of worn bills 
and stuffing them into his pockets leaves
 
the scene dissolves to the exterior of the church at cross corners a fine 
white new england structure opposite the village green stevens comes up the 
front steps hurrying up clutching his pockets heavy with their burden of 
gold and currency enters the vestibule of the church which now appears it 
is a shadowy corner where there is a poor box or box for contributions to 
foreign missionaries stevens begins stuffing his money into the box as he 
is thus engaged a shadowy figure in a black frock coat appears in the 
doorway starts to put his sharppointed foot over the threshold then draws 
it back he does not enter the church but speaks from the outside
 
				scratch 
			softly
		what are you doing mister stevens
 
stevens whirls about he stands trembling his head thrust forward
 
				stevens 
			stopping and cringing
		i wanted to give it all to the church
 
				scratch 
		my money why mister stevens what a quaint 
		idea come over to the door i want to speak 
		to you privately stop throwing away that 
		money we mustnt let people see any softness 
		in you mister stevens people take 
		advantage of softness you know come out of 
		there  ill give you an extension if youll
		forget this stupid repentance idea
 
				stevens  
			coming out of the church
		that isnt it its  the loneliness mr 
		scratch  the loneliness
 
				scratch 
			stroking his pointed chin 
			and chuckling softly
		the loneliness lonely with all your gold 
		mister stevens that hardly makes sense
 
				stevens  
			under his breath
		i want someone to talk to 
 
				scratch 
		you can talk to me 

				stevens  
		no no  
			beginning to whimper again
		i want to talk to men  to people in cross 
		corners to my neighbors 

				scratch 
		why dont you

				stevens  
 		i cant be honest with them
 
				scratch 
		oh thats what you want  well you can be 
		perfectly honest with jabez stone  now
 
the scene dissolves to the country store of cross corners disclosing jabez  
loading various things he has purchased on his buggy eddie the store clerk 
is coming out of the store with jabezs bill in his hand
 
				eddie
		that certainly was a big day for our store mr 
		stone
 
				jabez
			paying the bill
		here 
			handing eddie an 
			extra gold piece 
		 and this one is for you
 
				eddie
		golly mr stone i hope i stumble on a pot of 
		hessian gold one day myself
 
as eddie runs back into the store mary comes out accompanied by sarah
 
				mary 
			indicating the bonnet
		what do you think of that jabez
 
 				jabez 
		looks right elegant mary
 
				sarah 
			fluttering around her
		newest thing by last fall catalogue and 
		godeys ladies book
  
				mary
		you dont think it looks too fancy 

				jabez 
		did you say too fancy 

				sarah
		lans to gracious child not for you

				jabez 
		you take it  nothings too fancy for us 
 
 				mary  
			to sarah  
		well  maybe it wouldnt hurt  to have a 
		few roses
 
				sarah 
			smiling
		right pretty mary
 
 				mary 
			turning back to the store
		ill pick out a little shawl for ma  good 
		and serviceable
 
 				jabez 
			calling after her
		take your time mary ill be back in half an 
		hour
 
jabez leaves and as mary turns back she bumps into eddie who is coming out 
of the store with a trumpet under his arm
 
				mary 
		where are you going with your trumpet
 
				eddie
		didnt you hear mrs stone daniel webster 
		has promised to stop at cross corners today on 
		his way to franklin
 
				mary 
		daniel webster  here
 
				eddie
		arent you going to the reception
 
the scene dissolves to the village square in the late afternoon  the whole 
village has collected here and we see quite a gathering  the local fifeand
drum corps is prominently in evidence including at least one revolutionary 
veteran in buff and blue with a pigtail the sheriff lines up the band and 
the spectators the schoolmaster takes care of the children the squire 
stands in front of the band looking up at eddie who practices on his trumpet

				squire
		eddie  must you do that now
 
				eddie
		i want to get it right once before mr webster 
		arrives
 
				sheriff 
			joining them
		what do you think mr squire shall i find out 
		more about jabez and his gold
 
				squire
		you better find out about mr webster  he is 
		already more than an hour late  cant 
		understand it
 
he turns to the waiting crowd which is getting restless he is almost about 
to speak when eddie blows his trumpet again causing the squire to look at 
him exasperated
 
				eddie
		dont worry mr squire ill get it yet
 
				squire
		friends neighbors  i beg you to have a 
		little more patience so lets rehearse the 
		parade once more
 
he turns to the bandleader who gives the signal whereupon the band starts 
playing
 
the scene dissolves to a field behind the barn in the late afternoon as 
jabez arrives at the blacksmiths
 
				jabez 
			to a boy
		where is the blacksmith 
 
				boy
		hes pitching horseshoes with daniel webster
 
				jabez 
		with whom
 
as jabez turns we see daniel webster and the blacksmith pitching horseshoes
small boys stand about watching and cheering
 
				spectator 
			to his companion
		crazy galoot  thinking he can take on danl 
		webster
 
				another farmer
		danl pitched shoes from his cradle didnt 
		you danl
 
				webster 
		yes with my granny and she wasnt bad either 
		  now ill really have to go the people 
		must be waiting over at cross corners
 
webster has reached his buggy and there scratch is holding up websters coat
 
				scratch 
		its only a short drive mr webster
 
				webster 
			turning
		oh  its you again what do you want
 
				scratch 
		with the presidential election coming up i 
		thought i could be of some help sir
 
				webster 
		id rather see you on the side of the 
		opposition
 
				scratch 
		ill be there too

just then webster stops looks back and sees jabez throwing a horseshoe
 
				webster 
		say thats pretty good young man
 
				scratch 
		pretty good  thats perfect 

				jabez 
		ten throws  mr webster
 
 				webster 
		ten throws it is
 
the scene dissolves and reappears indicating that some time has elapsed a 
few more throws and jabez has won the game the farmers cheer
 
				webster  
			shaking jabezs hand very friendly
		you win will you ride to the village with me 
		mr stone
 
				jabez 
		thank you mr webster
 
the scene dissolves to the village square and as webster drives his buggy 
down the slope we suddenly see that the village square is empty  not a 
soul is in sight the people had apparently become tired of waiting for 
webster and gone about their various duties and now in websters buggy as 
two buggies come down the slope we see the amazed and then chagrined faces 
of the reception committee as they observe the deserted square
 
				webster 
			smiling his black eyes flashing 
			their lightning of humor to the 
			squire at his side
		i dont seem to be so very popular after all  
		in cross corners

				jabez
		seems like its my fault mr webster
 
				webster 
			slapping his knee 
		not at all lad  not at all 
			with tongue in cheek 
		for a good game of horseshoes i would always 
		sacrifice fame and acclaim
 
some boys jump off the rear of the buggy and dart away calling out as they 
run in their shrill piping voices
 
				martin 
			one of the boys running up 
			to the door of the inn
		black danls here
 
the inn which now appears is filled with farmers and town people who were 
seen before waiting in the square and heavy drinking is going on as martin 
goes up to the bar
 
				martin
		hey danl websters here
 
in the square in front of the inn the carriages now come to a stop as the 
tavern door opens and the host cy bibber round redfaced always a little 
mellow rushes out with greetings and a goodsized cup of rum for the great 
danl webster handed to him by mr scratch the squire redfaced rushes up 
to the carriage
 
				squire
		welcome  mr webster  welcome in cross 
		corners

				cy bibber 
			as he hands up 
			the cup to webster
		your good health sir

				webster 
			taking it
		what about my friends  lets all have a drink  
		and a bumper one for the champion  mister 
		stone
 
				cy bibber
		right away mr webster 

he bows and scrapes and is off immediately into the tavern
 
				webster 
			sniffing the cup
		heres a man who knows whats good for danl 
		webster medford rum ah a breath of the 
		promised land 
			he tastes it and smacks his lips 
		to the champion of the iron horseshoe jabez 
		stone
 
				jabez 
			who in the meantime got his drink
		thanks mr webster 
			lifting up his cup
		to the champion of the whole united states  
		danl webster 

cheers and they all drink at this moment however young martin stepping 
up to the buggy begins scrutinizing webster
 
				webster 
		what are you looking for colonel  
			as martin doesnt answer 
		whats your name
 
				martin
		martin van buren aldrich and my pas the only 
		democrat in cross corners he said you had 
		horns and a tall mr webster but i aint 
		seen em yet
 
				webster 
		well martin i only wear them in washington  
		thats the trouble but if you ever come down
		there ill show them to you
 
				martin 
			goggleeyed
		gee would you mr webster honest
 
				webster 
		of course and you tell your father for me  
		we may be on opposite sides of the fence but 
		im always glad to hear of a man who holds to 
		his own opinions as long as people do that  
		the countrys all right do you understand 
		martin
 
				martin
		yes sir  i guess i do  gee 

				scratch 
		speech mr webster  speech  
 
webster jabez and the squire schoolmaster and sheriff are still drinking 
and cy bibber is giving another cup to webster it is obvious that webster 
in a very pleasant way is a little under the weather for he slumps down in 
the front seat of the buggy holding the cup a little unsteadily in his hand 
voices in the crowd begin calling
 
				voices
		speech black danl speech 

				squire
		theyre asking for a speech mr webster

				webster 
		speech  oh no  im a little tired 
		slossum and besides its so pleasant here  
		in the sun 
			he stretches out his legs and 
			settles down on the small of his back  
		your sun and air are very pleasant in cross 
		corners 

he smiles and closes his eyes with a deep sigh
 
 				squire 
			sputtering
		 but  mr webster   

he looks helplessly around at the others
 
 				webster  
			to the squire  
		you tell them  
 
 				voices 
			from the crowd
		speech danl webster speech

 				squire 
	 		helplessly to the committee
		what are we going to do gentlemen
 
suddenly jabez who realizes the state webster is in moves away from the 
buggy and jumps up on the tavern steps he holds up his hands to the crowd 
they gradually stop calling and give him their attention 

				jabez 
			beginning with a frog in his 
			throat scared by his own 
			temerity
		listen folks  folks i want to say  folks 
		i  i dont know much about speechifying   
			swallowing dryly
		 but i feel it my duty  
 
there is an expectant silence and jabez still scared looks out at the 
crowd  and gropes for further words
 
at this point we get a fairly close view of mary in the crowd she is 
standing next to a tall thin woman susannah orr
 
				susannah 
			looking off at jabez
		whats the matter with him cat got his tongue
 
				mary 
		hush up susannah
 
				susannah 
		jabez is a smart farmer but making tall 
		speechess different kin he do it
 
				mary 
		of course he can  i mean he never has  but 
		 oh cant you keep quiet

now we get a close view of jabez stone still standing on the steps of the 
tavern
 
				jabez 
			continuing his speech
		well folks  what i want to say is  well 
		when a man like danl webster visits us  we 
		shouldnt ask him for a speech  it is for us 
		 to speak to tell him that we farmers thank 
		our lucky stars every day in the year for what 
		danl websters done for us if anybodys got 
		corn in his crib and hay in his barn its all
		due to our good neighbor danl webster who 
		stood right up in congress to protect us from 
		loan sharks by a new law and after hard work 
		like that its only natural danl webster 
		gets tired hes tired of making speeches and 
		just wants a little rest in the sunshine  
		and folks if he dont choose cross corners 
		sunshine to rest in now thats mighty fine 
		and i want to say this before i quit talking  
		were hoeing corn in franklin county all due 
		like i says to danl webster and well keep 
		on hoeing it till hes in the white house in 
		washington  where he belongs  

jabez bows and steps down from steps and is rewarded with applause and 
cheering webster has been soundly asleep but now he opens his eyes he 
smiles at jabez and stretches out his open hand jabez grips it looking 
exalted
 
				webster 
			still a little drowsy
		eloquent speech neighbor stone  couldnt 
		have done better myself  
			with a sly smile  
		 under the circumstances 
			he squeezes his hand 
		thank you
 
				jabez  
		mr webster  id like you to meet my wife 
		mary
 
				webster 
		well  ill be  if it isnt little mary 
		sampson from franklin
 
				mary 
			smiling
		it is
 
				webster 
			putting out his hand to mary
		youve got a smart man mrs stone hang onto 
		him
 
				mary 
			as they shake hands
		  im going to try mr webster

she blushes then pauses
 
 				webster 
		thats fine  
			then picking up horses reins 
		well  im getting on to franklin before night 
		goodbye mary  goodbye jabez  god bless 
		both of you  goodbye everybody and thank 
		you

he raises his hand to the crowd they begin to cheer the horses start 
trotting off now the band in a last minute rush comes and plays a farewell 
tune for the departing webster webster turns and waves as the crowd goes on 
cheering jabez and mary stand together waving goodbye
 
the steps in front of the inn the squire and the others are about to enter 
the inn
 
				squire
		coming along jabez
 
				jabez 
			to mary
		shall we
 
				mary
		we must go on home jabez
 
				jabez 
		yes mary 
			with a selfsatisfied 
			sigh and stretch 
		its been a long day
 
the scene dissolves to the washington arms tavern barroom where we find the 
squire the sheriff the schoolmaster and a few other men they have all 
been drinking heavily even the host cy bibber who is not behind the bar 
where he should be instead in his place is scratch smoothly and very  
efficiently mixing and serving the drinks
 
				scratch
		another drink sheriff
 
				cy bibber 
		i want to make a toast  
			holding up cup that 
			scratch fills again 
		 a toast to danl webster  greatest man  
		in whole united states 

others cheer thickly and drink
 
				scratch 
		excellent mr bibber excellent  and id 
		like to make another one 
			raising his cup 
		to jabez stone  who so ably today supported 
		the  
			slurring it 
		great danl webster  sometimes people dont 
		recognize great men in their own community
 
				cy bibber 
			to the squire
		did you hear squire slossum
 
				squire
		mr stone  a great man  well now  i  
		he seems to be a little overbearing  driving 
		in mr websters carriage no  i am not so 
		sure about him
 
 				scratch
 			to the squire
		another rum squire slossum
 
				squire
			thickly 
		 well  i  i dont know  

				scratch 
		what you dont know 
 
				squire 
		well just one more  and this is the last 
		one
 
the scene dissolves to the main street of cross corners dark and silent the 
lights are out in the houses from out of the tavern their arms locked 
together come the figures of scratch the squire sheriff cy bibber and the 
schoolmaster scratch is in the middle
 
we follow them as they weave in an unsteady line down the dark street softly 
they chant in their mellowed dulcet tones as the scene dissolves
 
				all of them
		we want jabez stone  for selectman  jabez 
		stone jabez stone
 
jabez stones bedroom a small room under the slope of the eaves it is still 
that night the lamp is lit there is a big fourposter new england bed with 
a canopy and patchwork quilts jabez and mary are preparing for bed mary is 
finishing braiding her hair and jabez is taking off his shoes
 
				jabez
			still in the dream
		remember mary how he said it couldnt have 
		done better myself jabez stone and it was my 
		first speech i dont know what came into me 
		mary i just stood up and the words came 
		flowing like water out of my mouth
 
				mary 
			having said this 
			many times since
		oh jabez  it was a wonderful day 

a pause she finishes with her hair and begins to unbutton her dress
 
				mary
		but im glad to be home again 

				jabez
			looking up at her
		tired 

				mary 
		worried

				jabez
		there is nothing to worry about now
 
				mary
			anxiously
		youll never change  will you

				jabez 
		mary  you just wait and see  its all  
		just the beginning  just the beginning  of 
		everything ill be the biggest man in new 
		hampshire and youll be the wife of the biggest 
		man
 
but now shep is barking in the yard jabez turns from mary and goes toward 
the window to open it unbuttoning his shirt we get a close view of jabez at 
the window as he opens it and the curtain flutters in the breeze that smells 
of earth we see the new moon from jabezs angle just sinking over the sharp 
hills
 
				jabez 
		quiet shep  
			taking in a deep breath 
		its a new moon mary  
 
				marys voice
		yes i know jabez  a new moon and i saw it 
		over my right shoulder too that means good 
		luck  for both of us
 
				jabez 
		yes  we are rich  
 
				mary 
			after a pause
		theres hope and promise in it jabez   
		planting and promise of good harvest to come
 
				jabez 
			taking another deep breath
		yes  you are right mary i can almost hear 
		the little blades of grass astarting up 
		all the seeds astirring underneath the 
		ground  
 
				mary 
			after a pause softly
		dont take cold jabez 
			after another pause 
		come  its warm in here
 
the lamp is blown out and the room becomes dark except for the thin light of 
the moon jabezs figure is bathed in it for a moment he turns from the 
window just as the unmistakable figure of scratch is seen watching from the 
shadow of a tree but jabez has no eyes for him now
 
in the gentle glow of moonlight jabezs tall figure is seen going toward the
bed while mary is lying under the covers her face turned to him on the 
pillow waiting
 
				jabez 
		mary  
 
				mary
		jabez 

he kisses her then reaches out and touches the very edge of the bed as the 
scene fades out
 
a hillside field back of the stone house fades in it is just before noon 
next day and jabez is doing his spring plowing the horse is old and so is 
the plow but we should get some feeling of the essential strength and beauty 
of earth here  and of jabezs real kinship with it  his stride across the 
furrows and the feeling of his feet honestly gripping the good earth then a 
closer view picks out jabez plowing and now a horn is heard blowing from the 
house it is a horn used to call men in from the fields thereupon jabez 
stops and goes to the house
 
the kitchenside of the stone house near the porch as jabez and ma stone 
come up mary sleeves rolled back is fresh from her washtub
 
 				mary
 			seeing jabez
		oh jabez  i hated to call you from spring 
		plowing but
 
the squire his wife lucy schoolmaster phipps and the sheriff the squire 
sheriff and schoolmaster all look suspiciously bleary and are suffering from 
headaches the squire in particular looks unfortunate being so pompous 
anyhow
 
				jabez
			excited
		why  good morning squire
 
				squire
		morning jabez
 
				others
		morning jabez

be a marble vault jabez ushers the squire sheriff and schoolmaster into it

shrugs turns back to the men and begins passing out cups to them
 
				squire
			holding up his cup
		to our new selectman jabez stone
 
they drink taking it down in one thirsty gulp and smack their lips 
suddenly all three who drank look at each other  strange foiled looks 
coming over their faces their lips pucker up

they all look bewildered at jabez

mrs slossum swallows her last piece of pie  wipes her fingers and rushes 
out

in it

		jabez  once you said wed never change  
 
				jabez 
		i wasnt used to being big  wasnt used to 
		thinking in big ways now ive made up my 
		mind
 
he leaves the two women looking after him thoroughly puzzled
 
the yard of the stone farm jabez coming from the kitchen sees hank a 
neighboring farmer lingering about it is day
 
				hank
		howdy jabez
 
				jabez 
		howdy hank
 
				hank
			meekly with a feeling of apology
		kin you spare a moment for me jabez
 
				jabez
			condescendingly
		why of course hank  ive always got time 
		for a neighbor whats on your mind
 
				hank
		well  heres how it is tom sharp eli 
		higgins and a couple of others been talking to 
		me about  that new sort of organization  
		grange they call it what you think about it
 
				jabez 
		i dont know  dont seem much of an idea to 
		me
 
				hank
		yes but what does a farmer do if he dont want  
		to get roped in some more by them loan sharks
 
				jabez

		while im around
 
				hank

		jabez
 
				jabez 
		not at all hank  not at all glad to help 
		you
 
				hank
		thanks jabez  i really wouldnt need very 
		much  if you could let me have some seed to 
		start off with enough for spring planting 
 
 
 
				jabez 
		seed  easiest thing in the world come 
		along hank well pick out everything you 
		need right now
 
they walk toward the barn
 
				hank
		say  about the interest 
 
				jabez 
		now dont you worry about that you just leave 
		it all to me we wont talk business now  
		just bear this in mind  im not the man to 
		get rich on other peoples hard luck no 
		sir not me 
 
they enter the barn
 
				jabez 
		i been through the mill myself an i know 
		just how you feel here 
 
in the barn jabez bends over the seed bin hank standing beside him
 
				jabez 
		here thats the best seed youll find anywhere 
		around new hampshire
 
and as the seed runs through jabezs hand the scene dissolves to a series of 
views montage shots of the stone farm by day we see it prospering under 
the skies of late spring and then summer we see all the stony fields 
blossoming  the little blades of green starting from the earth the corn 
growing thick and mighty high in one field  the barley rank and heavy
headed in another we see a fine new bull being led to the barn and two new 
cows the corn and barley stand ripe and golden in jabezs fields
 
this dissolves to the bedroom on a late afternoon mary her eyes closed is 
lying on the fourposter bed she is fully dressed her bosom rises and falls 
in the breathing of gentle sleep jabez has just come in his hair is 
boyishly rumpled his face however seems more mature and serious with a 
growing selfimportance
 
				jabez 
			in a whisper
		mary 
 
he stops on seeing her asleep and turns away from the bed he starts back 
toward door turns to the bed again comes back to it and pulls the patchwork
quilt up over mary covering her then he tiptoes out
 
in the kitchen ma stone sits by the fireplace knitting she readjusts her 
spectacles and squints a bit jabez enters having come downstairs again and 
paces up and down the room
 
				ma stone 
		it wont be the first baby ever born in this 
		house 
			fumbling with her knitting 
		there made me drop a stitch 
			as jabez continues his pacing 
		sit down you make me nervous 
			but he doesnt sit 
		lans thats the way a man always is thinks 
		his sons the most important thing in the 
		world
 
				jabez
		my son do you really think ma
 
				ma stone 
			laughing
		oh go along with you as if it mattered to a 
		grandma but praps you got an even chance
 
there is a sudden blink of lightning at the window

				ma stone 
		looks like a storm all of a sudden hope it 
		wont wake mary
 
she lights a lamp
 
				jabez 
			looking out the window
		queer sort of weather were having  queer 
		like everything else
 
				ma stone 
		well thank the lord you can always depend on 
		new england for weather weve got enough for 
		the whole united states
 
				jabez 
		i feel  fidgety ma  not right at all

				ma stone 
		lans id think you was having the baby to 
		hear you
 
				jabez 
			after a pause
		me  a son
 
he pauses and glances at the window as though somebody might be there looking 
in at him he sees only the dark clouds and the racked tree on which his doom 
is carved he speaks out of his fears
 
				jabez 
		money  moneys a funny thing aint it ma 

				ma stone 
		i figure that depends a mite on how you get it 
		and how you spend it son
 
				jabez 
			eagerly
		do you really think that
 
				ma stone 
		why thats just sense son now a man like 
		daniel webster  guess they pay him high for 
		what he does but hes worth it  and he helps 
		others makes all the difference
 
				jabez 
		i know ma but  suppose a man got his money 
		in bad ways  
 
				ma stone 
			with a snap of her jaws
		wouldnt profit him none 
 
jabez is glancing again at the darkened window when there is a flash of 
lightning as though mocking him
 
				ma stone 
		you see son im old and ive lived when a 
		man gets his money in bad ways  when he sees 
		the better course and takes the worse  then 
		the devil is in his heart  and that fixes 
		him
 
				jabez 
		ma  and yet a man could change that 
		couldnt he
 
				ma stone 
		a man can always change things son thats 
		what makes him different from barnyard 
		critters
 
jabez having stared out of the window at the racked tree now heads with 
determination for the door
 
				ma stone 
		where you going son
 
but jabez does not heed her and goes out silently
 
outside the stone farm dark clouds are rolling up steadily and there are 
occasional flashes of distant lightning
 
we follow jabez as he hastens along and comes up to the racked tree he looks 
about him rather furtively taking care not to be seen then takes out a 
large pocket knife and attempts to gouge out the date that scratch had fixed 
on the tree but he finds that the lettering is too deep and makes no headway 
and giving up the attempt jabez determines on something else he rushes to 
the barn
 
now jabez enters the barn and hunts about he finds an ax and is about to 
start out to attack the tree again when the drumming of a great burst of hail 
is heard on the roof and sheets of it are seen falling outside the barn door 
the pellets of hail are enormous then as jabez stops and whirls about 
scratch emanates from the shadows or is suddenly revealed in a flash of 
lightning standing calm suave and smiling
 
				scratch 
		good evening neighbor stone 

				jabez 
		look here now
 
				scratch 
		oh come neighbor stone i wouldnt cut that 
		tree if i were you it means a breach of 
		contract
 
				jabez 
		i dont care
 
				scratch 
		but you should now that you are becoming a 
		father
 
				jabez 
		leave your tongue off of that
 
				scratch 
		oh certainly i shant even come to the 
		christening  it would be tactless and in 
		wretched bad taste 
			laughing 
		but i may send a friend of mine  just for old 
		sakes sake yes i might do that 

he strokes his chin thoughtfully
 
 				ma stones voice
			outside calling
		jabez jabez
 
				scratch 
		your mother i find her a little difficult  
		hardly the type for our sort of thing
			stepping back  
		good night neighbor stone
 
scratch bows and leaves almost imperceptibly through the rear door one 
moment he is there the next he is gone leaving jabez staring after him the 
hail continues to fall the cattle come out of their trancelike silence the 
horse stamps jabez goes toward the warped board where the money is hidden  
when ma stone enters through the front door over her head she holds an old 
coat to protect her from the hail
 
 				ma stone
			breathless
		oh here you are jabez lans i was worried 
		about you hail in august the crops will 
		be ruined
  
				jabez 
		it dont matter
 
				ma stone 
		whats that you say son 

				jabez 
		i say  it dont matter
 
				ma stone 
			also greatly relieved
		now thats the way to talk son i know you 
		worked hard for that crop but well make out
 
				jabez 
		make out well do better than that  i never 
		thought id be glad for bad luck but i am i 
		never thought id be glad of a hail storm at 
		harvest time but i am oh bless ye the works 
		of the lord in the hail and the storm and the 
		rain

ma stone nods again lips still pursed hail drums loudly on the roof 
twilight has dropped outside and it is dark
 
the scene dissolves to jabez stones cornfield early next morning we see not 
only jabezs cornfield but the fields of neighboring farmers farther down 
the slope and up the valley in the bright light of the glistening morning 
jabezs field of corn stands straight and high the golden banners waving in 
the breeze unscathed by the devastating hail of the night before but in 
tragic contrast the neighbors fields are laid low to the earth pelted down
into worthlessness jabez mary and ma stand by the stone fence near the 
road staring in wonder at the miracle of their standing corn
 
				mary 
		ruined  all the fields  ruined 
			kneels down as in prayer
 
				jabez
		mary  but look  it didnt touch an ear of 
		my corn  well have a rich harvest

				ma stone
		for unto everyone that hath shall be given  
		and he shall have abundance

jabez lifting his head looks at her with a sudden and unpredictable 
challenge
 
				jabez 
		thats right ma
 
as he stands there silent under the bright morning two farmers owners of 
the blasted fields beyond pass him on the road going down to their fields 
they walk with a discouraged slump to their shoulders and lagging steps as 
they come up to jabez he greets them
 
				jabez
		helloh hank  halloh lem 
 
but they dont answer they raise their eyes and look at him and then at his 
prosperous field and then back at him again their eyes seem to bore through 
him with a burning accusation and they hardly nod their heads in greeting as 
they trudge on jabez looks after them consciencestricken then he turns 
abruptly and starts back toward his farmhouse
 
at the washington arms tavern later that day a group of farmers is 
congregated in corners where the bar is located some of the farmers we have 
seen before are there  lem noah tom sharp and others we have not seen 
keep on drifting in cy bibber the host and bartender is serving drinks

				lem
			at the bar
		charge me up for another rum cy only way i 
		kin forget my troubles

				cy bibber
		sorry lem but ill have to count my pennies 
		too

				stevens
			to bibber
		let him have one more  on me 
			to lem 
		youd think stones standing in good with 
		providence somehow

				lem 
		my corns no more use than a last years crows 
		nest

				stevens
		maybe youd let me help you out a bit

				seth
		seems like someones giving us the horselaugh
 
 				tom sharp 
		guess youre ripe and ready now to join our 
		grange eh boys
 
				stevens
		now wait a moment folks  i can make you 
		some better terms
 
at this point scratch in farmers clothes enters and comes to the bar
 
				cy bibber
		howdy

				scratch 
		howdy  never did see such a hail big as 
		bowling balls out my way broke all the winders 
		an nearly killed the cat ill have cider   
		hard 
			turning to the others 
		boys im here with an offer from jabez stone
 
				lem
		whats that
 
				scratch
		well  seeing as how due to yesterdays hail 
		nobodys got nothing to harvest in his own 
		fields jabez says maybe you could help him 
		harvest his
 
there is a pause as the farmers look at each other uncomfortably they feel 
the humiliation of this but they know they are in no position to refuse
 
				seth 
			bitterly
		never worked fer anybody else in my whole life
		ceptin when i was a shaver and that was for 
		my old man

				tom sharp 
		i wouldnt do it
 
				lem
		well  dunno  ill think it over
 
				scratch 
			with a smile
		whats there to think about boys heres a 
		dollar in advance for every one who will work 
		for jabez 

he throws down money on the bar
 
and now stones fields come to view the farmers are cutting and shocking 
jabezs bumper corn crop  seth lem noah tom sharp and others jabez 
rides through the fields on his sleek new horse watching his neighbors 
harvest his crops he shows a certain condescension toward them which is akin 
to arrogance
 
another view of jabezs fields discloses the harvest in great bursting 
wagons rolling into the barn the big new barn is fast approaching 
completion the wagons keep on rolling into the barn watched over by jabez 
like a lord of the manor not only is jabez harvesting corn and hay but  
autumn fruits too in abundance
 
the scene then dissolves to the outside bedroom in the evening while faint 
festive music is heard  simple folkmusic played on fiddle fife and banjo 
mostly it is coming from jabezs new barn where the harvest festival is in 
full swing outside is the great red harvest moon just rising jabez goes to 
the closed door and listens putting his ear against it he makes as though 
to rap on the door but changes his mind he walks away again digging his 
hands in his pockets and paces back and forth suddenly ma stone opens the 
door
 
				jabez 
			rushing to help 
		ma  is she 
 
				ma stone 
			complacently
		youll be a father any minute now
 
				jabez 
			gulping
		golly ma  
			as music from barn swells up 
		consarn that music shouldnt ahad the 
		harvest festival tonight
 
				ma stone 
		fiddlesticks she dont hear it got better 
		music to listen to than that 
			as there is the sudden cry 
			of a newlyborn child 
		there  thats what i mean
 
jabez stands spellbound as the strident cry of the child drowns out the music 
of the dance and ma stone turns back into the room presently jabez on 
tiptoes moves to the room frightened and trembling
 
the scene dissolves to the other bedroom at night mary is lying in a 
fourposter bed a maid typically new england and the doctor are there the 
doctor is just placing the baby wrapped up in blankets beside mary and 
prepares to leave things necessary to a birth are about the room  kettle 
and basin of hot water towels and other articles mary looks down from her 
pillow at her baby parting the cocoon of covers to see its tiny wrinkled 
face jabez tiptoes up to the bed
 
				jabez 
		mary  
 
				mary 
			smiling up at him weakly
		hello jabez   
			after a pause 
		heres your son
 
jabez too emotional to speak stares down at the baby a suspicion of 
moisture in his eyes mary closes her eyes weakly but happily ma stone 
watching mary anxiously speaks in whisper to the maid
 
				ma stone 
		fetch a bed warmer dorothy
 
the maid nods and goes out jabez still stands looking down on the baby as 
the doctor is putting things back in his bag jabez takes up the baby 
awkwardly as though handling something made of glass and steps to the 
window that looks out on the new barn he raises the window and the music 
comes floating into the room he leans from window holding the baby high in 
his arms
 
the new barn at night seen from jabezs angle there is a view of the front 
barn door thrown open providing a glimpse of the merrymakers inside 
dancing groups bathed in the light of the moon stand near the door 
talking and laughing
 
				jabez  
			calling down boyishly
		hey look everybody look here its a boy
 
the group at the door stands transfixed for a moment then they begin to 
cheer
 
				group
		hurray for jabez stone more good luck for 
		jabez stone hurray jabez stone and his new 
		son
 
the good word travels into the barn others crowd to the door musicians 
swing into something gay and triumphant cups of cider are passed about they 
drink to jabez and the new boy  and to mary stone
 
				ma stone
			behind jabez
		lans shut that window jabez want him to 
		catch his death of cold
 
she takes the baby away from him
 
				jabez 
			a little sheepishly
		well  i  i
 
				mary
		dont be cross with him ma this dont happen 
		every day
 
ma stone puts the baby down beside mary again in the curve of her arm mary 
opens her eyes she smiles weakly and snuggles her cheek down against the 
baby the baby cries and she hushes it
 
				ma stone 
		you go down and see whats keeping dorothy 

				jabez
		sure ma
 
he hurries past the doctor still collecting his things he pats him on the 
shoulder as man to man

				jabez
			as he goes out
		thanks doctor
 
the kitchen in front of the fireplace with her back turned to the door a 
woman is standing she is looking into the fire seemingly musing over the 
blinking coals jabez comes hurriedly downstairs
 
				jabez 
			bursting in
		dorothy  whats keeping you so long mary 
		needs that  
 
he stops and looks intently the woman turns slowly and looks him straight in 
the eye she is a young slender woman with a strange sultry prettiness 
she is externally demure but underneath there is a definite feeling of 
seething fire like the coals in the fireplace she is simply dressed but 
still better dressed than any woman we have yet seen in the picture
 
				jabez 
			taken aback
		youre not  dorothy
 
				the woman  
			quietly in a low toned musical 
			voice  unhurried and deliberate
		no shes gone
 
				jabez 
			looking about incredulous
		she couldnt be gone
 
				the woman  
		but she is  ive taken her place dont you 
		remember  you wrote me a letter mrs stone 
		was too ill
 
she digs down into the bosom of her gown and produces a letter she shows it 
to him jabez stares at it
 
				jabez
		it  it looks like my hand
 
she lets the letter drop from her hand and it twirls into the fire where it 
flares up abruptly
 
				the woman  
		i have other recommendations too from a very 
		good friend of yours 

she makes a movement as if to produce them from the same place
 
				jabez 
			hoarsely
		never mind whats your name 

				the woman  
		belle
 
 				jabez 
		belle 

				belle
		belle dee im from over the mountain
 
 				jabez 
			as if hypnotized
		from over the mountain  
 
jabez continues to look at her and she holds his eye steadily

				ma stones voice 
			calling down the stair
		jabez jabez

belle turns to the fireplace to fill the warming pan with coal 

				jabez 
		ill take it

				belle
		no  thats for me to do
 
she starts for the door passing on her way up ma stone who has gone to show 
the doctor out

the bedroom as belle enters the room with the pan
 
				mary 
			out of a dream
		jabez  

				belle 
			her voice very gentle and soothing
		ive brought you something to keep you warm 
		mrs stone  
 
belle props up marys pillows making them more comfortable and puts the bed 
warmer in place mary simply stares at her instinctively her arm tightens 
about her little son the music from the harvest festival is heard from 
outside
 
				belle
		youre not resting well are you i know  
		its that music 
			she closes the window 
		you need your sleep is there anything else you 
		want
 
				mary
			very gratefully
		no thank you  whats your name 

				belle
		belle  

				mary 
		thank you belle 

she leaves as ma stone comes in

				mary 
			dreamily as her eyes close
		what a nice  and kind girl   who is she 

				ma stone 
		the new girl  jabez says she is from over 
		the mountain

				mary 
		what mountain 

then her voice trails off and she sinks into sleep

the new barn the fodder bins and loft spaces are stuffed with the fruits of 
the harvest it is a very large barn representing the prosperity of jabez 
stone now it is brightly lit by lantern light and is decorated with sheaves 
of barley tall stalks of corn pumpkins and golden leaves from the autumn 
woods the platform for the musicians is at the other end of the barn and a 
refreshment table where cider is being served is on one side of the wall 
on the opposite side are tables groaning with food   cakes pies cold 
meats sausages chickens ducks etc

a square dance is just beginning as belle appears moving gracefully through 
the gay crowd she has found a gay shawl to drape about her shoulders  an  
exotic shawl that might have come into new hampshire from the cargo of a 
clipper ship smelling of the far east and dark ports of call everybody is 
having a good time except miser stevens who sits gloomily in a corner near 
the musicians stand where couples are gathering for the next dance the 
fiddler is mr scratch and as he looks down at belle he tucks his fiddle 
under his sharp chin and begins to play very softly belle stands her hands 
loosely clasped on her hips jabez comes up behind her                                                

				jabez 
		lets dance together  belle
 
				belle
			turning slowly
		no jabez  your place is with your wife   

she smiles the fiddler plays a little louder and the other musicians pick up 
the tune belle dances forward alone and is leading the couples as they 
start to dance

				belle 
			gaily
		faster  faster  

scratch over his fiddle smiles down at her and nods

				belle 
			dancing on
		faster  faster 

she breathes this out at jabez as she passes him the dancers move faster and 
faster there is something utterly abandoned about it the harvest moon 
gleams in at the great door then the scene fades out

the bedroom cold moonlight in the room it is a winter night and a candle 
burns beside mary between mary and jabez lies the baby the baby cries and 
mary turns and tries to soothe it
 
				mary 
		shh  go to sleep little daniel  go to 
		sleep
 
the baby continues to cry mary hums a little song to the child
 
				mary 
			singing
		potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun 
		sleep sleep my baby 
		raccoon sits in the spruce all night 
		sleep baby sleep 
 
				jabez 
			who has not been asleep 
			speaks irritably
		what in sugar hills the matter with him
 
				mary 
		nothing jabez  just natural for a baby to 
		cry sometimes 
			as the baby still cries she 
			tries to quiet him again 
		shh little daniel  sleep  sleep  
 
she continues her song but it does not help
 
				jabez 
			flinging back the covers angrily
		consarn it 

he gets up

				mary
		jabez

jabez is getting into his trousers
 
				mary
		where are you going  
 
jabez opens the door still struggling with his clothes and goes out
shutting the door after him mary sits up in bed looking bewildered at the
closed door
 
				mary 
			calling
		jabez jabez
 
his footsteps dwindle down the stairs a silence mary drops back on her
pillow tears start to her eyes she blinks them away the baby keeps on
crying
 
the scene dissolves to a country road in winter the sun shining on the banks
of snow visible now is jabezs sleigh the graceful swanlike kind of 1840
and jabezs new sleek horse is pulling it there are bells on the harness
gaily jingling as the sleigh goes skimming over the icy road up hill then
onto a lake locked in ice 
 
next jabezs sleigh appears at close range and jabez is seen driving with
belle in becoming winter costume seated beside him the keen wind blows
against her cheeks reddening them into the semblance of christmas berries
hard and brightly scarlet her eyes glitter like sparklets of frost jabez
wears a coonskin cap and a great winter coat he is urging on the horse
faster and faster flicking its rump with his whip
 
				jabez
			laughing
		golly belle that was a good idea  we should 
		do that every morning
 
				belle
		we will  
 
jabez laughs belle laughs too very softly 

				belle
		make him go faster jabez  faster  
		faster  
 
jabez calls to the horse and flicks the whip they skim on toward the lake
 
the lake is seen closer it is day and the lake is like a jewel of crystal 
in a setting of black spruce trees we see the dark figure of a man on the
ice of the lake stooping over a hole he has cut there

now the sleigh appears on the edge of the lake
 
				jabez 
			standing up in sleigh 
			and waving his whip
		hey you hey
 
a close view discloses a man by the hole in the ice bundled up in heavy
clothes the man is fishing he is pulling up a fish through the hole beside
him a pile of fish he has just caught he turns as he hears jabezs voice
 
				jabezs voice
		you cant fish there private property im 
		jabez stone ill have the sheriff after you
 
the man frightened begins to run he leaves his other fish behind him but
holds onto his line with a fish dangling to it he runs across the ice
slipping falling getting up again and running he plunges into the spruces
on the other side of the lake
 
a close view of jabezs sleigh discloses belle laughing as she watches the
man running and falling on the ice jabez is still standing up in the sleigh
brandishing his whip and laughing too he drops back in the sleigh again as
the man disappears
 
				jabez 
			still laughing
		its wonderful to frighten people like that  
		and watch them run
 
as jabez picks up the fish the scene dissolves to the kitchen where a bright
fire is burning in the fireplace ma stone is standing by the doorway to the
stairs dressed in her sunday clothes wearing her new shawl and putting on
her bonnet the baby is lying in its cradle by the fire
 
				ma stone
			calling  upstairs
		mary ready first bells aringing
 
				mary 
			coming downstairs
		yes ma  im ready  
 
she enters the room dressed in sundaybest also the baby whimpers and
mary starts toward the cradle but before she gets there jabez and belle
enter they are dressed as we last saw them in the sleigh and their faces
are ruddy from the wind over the snow belle instantly crosses to the cradle
she throws off her heavy wrap and kneels beside the baby crooning to it and
the baby stops crying jabez strides to the table and throws the fish down on
it
 
				jabez 
			turning to mary
		good morning mary brought some fish for us 
		want you to cook em for breakfast
 
mary turns and looks at him her soft eyes filled with pain and confusion
 
				ma stone 
		shell do nothing of the kind shes going to 
		church with me right away
 
				mary 
			voice shaking
		jabez  for the good of your soul  please 
		come with us

 				jabez
		i want you to fix these fish 

				ma stone 
		and i say she wont ill not have the scorn 
		of god on this place  with the smell of fish 
		in it polluting up the sabbath
			turning to belle 
		and as for you  let me tell you young 
		woman

church bells are heard faintly  

				mary 
		come along ma second bells aringing

mary crosses to ma stone and they go closing the door behind them we hear
mary and ma driving away in the buggy 

				jabez 
		well cook em ourselves youll help me belle

				belle 
		of course i will

at this moment the front door opens and stevens enters

				stevens
		mornin jabez 

				jabez 
		hello stevens  youre early today

				stevens
		yes i wanted to get here before the others 
		i want to talk to you alone

				jabez 
		some other time stevens
 
jabez hurries about the room arranging chairs and pulling out a table from
the wall he seems to know exactly what to do from long practice he goes to
the cupboard brings out some bottles of rum and hard cider and cups and
goes to a drawer in the table and produces a dice box and dice there is a
rap on the back door and belle goes gracefully to the door and opens it
making a low curtsy squire slossum aaron coffin the heavyset banker of
cross corners and two other silent pokerfaced men sneak in

				squire and others 
			the squire beating his 
			cold hands together
		good morning mam  good morning jabez  

				jabez and belle 
		good morning 

				belle
		sit down gentlemen 

				squire 
			ogling her
		thanks mam
 
he sits pompously at the head of the table the others sit about the same
table jabez draws up a chair too and takes up the dice box rattling the
dice
 
				squire
		i almost forgot  
 
he brings out a roll of bills and hands them reluctantly over to jabez
 
				jabez 
		i hope youll have better luck today squire

jabez counts the bills avidly and overcarefully holding some up to the
light to see that they are not counterfeit then pockets the bills he begins
to roll the dice as each man silently stacks up his betting money before him
the game proceeds and belle serves the rum and hard cider watching the men
as they play suddenly the baby begins to cry again belle goes to it
instantly and takes it up from the cradle and rocks it in her arms she
croons to it the song she croons is a french lullaby it has a strange
haunting melody and the french words fall curiously in that new england
kitchen

				squire 
			again ogling her
		you french 

				belle  
			looking at him through 
			halfclosed eyes
		no  im not anything 

she goes on singing

				jabez
		your game squire

there is a commanding rap on the door the players are startled and they
pause

				belle
			looking out the window
		sheriffs coming 

belle very calmly goes to the door

				jabez
		come in sheriff
 
 				sheriff
	  	jabez  seems  like ive been hearing talk 
		around reverend harper thinks more cross 
		corners folk oughter be in church sabbath 
		morning
 
				jabez 
		belle give the sheriff a cup of rum 

the cross corners church with the congregation assembled it is the very end
of the service the severity and serenity of the sabbath peace lies like a
blessing over the bowed heads of the faithful in the third pew we see ma
stone and mary with an empty place beside them

				voice of minister
		almighty god who hast given us this good land 
		for our heritage we humbly beseech thee that
		we may always prove ourselves a people mindful
		of thy favor and glad to do thy will save us
		from discord and confusion from pride and 
		arrogancy and from every evil way 

				mary
		save jabez from pride and arrogancy and
		from every evil way

				voice of minister
		in the time of prosperity fill our hearts with 
		thankfulness and in our day of trouble suffer 
		not our trust in thee to fail  amen

				voice of congregation
			in unison
		amen

they lift their heads the church bell begins to peal another service is
ended

the kitchen the bells peal through this and now faintly come to the ears of
the players among them the sheriff they look up the last dice are rolled
quickly money is gathered in debts are paid silently and in haste the 
guests collect their coats and hats and mufflers they begin to file out the 
door

				squire
		goodbye stone  next sunday as usual

he smiles unctuously at belle and goes out when they are all gone jabez 
closes the door belle is putting away the table and the cups and jugs jabez 
hides the cards belle returns to her care of the baby she sits demurely
down on a low stool beside the cradle and begins to rock it humming softly
to the child the bells from cross corners gradually stop ringing over the
snowlocked countryside jabez draws up a chair to the table and begins
adding up his winnings in his account book and ledgers

he hunts for the date in an oldfashioned almanac  finds it  puts his
finger on it we see jabezs fingers turning the pages of the almanac  the
leaves turning swiftly and we see the years drop away faster and faster 
leaves of the years falling from the tree of time

blueprints of a house jabez stones mansion appear jabezs hand makes
notes and corrections details of the front view of the new house appear
until finally the full view of the mansion is seen over the shoulder of a man
on horseback dressed for fox hunting workmen are still putting the
finishing touches on the new house furniture is carried in through the
doors the man on horseback slowly turns his head  it is jabez stone he
looks back at the old farm where he was born then the scene fades out
 
the exterior of the farmhouse fades in it is morning and ma stone in her
regular old working clothes grimly sticking to them in a spirit of defiance
is tending her flower beds and herb garden near the side porch
transplanting tender new slips her sleeves are rolled up and her arms and
hands are covered with good earth she is kneeling over a flower bed jabezs
little son daniel is with her

				daniel
		granny when do we move to the new house

				ma stone
		move  we are not going to move  the old 
		one is good enough for us

 				daniel
		but i like the new one better

				ma stone 
		thats just too bad 

daniel very cautiously takes out his beanshooter a mother hen and her
chicks come around the side of the house pecking up bugs and worms from ma
stones garden daniel loads his mouth with dried beans and aims the
beanshooter at the chickens he makes a direct hit on the old mother hen she
squawks and flies up in the air with a great flapping of wings the chicks
cheep frantically and run about

				ma stone 
			startled out of her skin
		lans to goodness what happened to that hen 
		did you use that beanshooter again
 
				daniel 
			all innocence hiding 
			the beanshooter
		i did not grandma
 
				mary 
			coming from kitchen 
			door behind them
		yes you did daniel i saw it from the window 
		and then to lie about it give me that 
		beanshooter daniel
 
				daniel 
			jumping up and dancing away
		its mine ma pa made it for me  and im not 
		going to give it to anyone
 
				mary
			reaching for it
		daniel give me that beanshooter
 
				daniel 
			attacking mary
		no no i wont

				mary 
		daniel  
			catching him 
		ive stood just about as much as i can bear

mary drags the yowling daniel toward the woodshed that is not far from the 
kitchen door a sort of leanto on the rest of the house as was the custom 
then at this moment jabez rides up on horseback with belle beside him
 
				jabez 
		what happened where are you taking him

				mary 
		i am going to lock him up 

				jabez 
			dismounting
		youre not supposed to punish my son mary

				belle

		daniel  
			to mary as daniel 
			continues to cry 
		what did he do
 
				mary 
		he lied to me again

				belle
			to mary
		he never lies to me 
			to daniel 
		dont cry daniel  i believe you youre 
		always a very good boy and  now come along
 
she leads him into the house
 
				mary 
			to jabez
		jabez  how can you let her talk like that 
		when the boy is present he wont respect me 
		any more
 
				jabez
			coldly
		isnt that your own fault
 
				mary 
		my fault  oh jabez  all i want is to be 
		proud of him he can be such a fine boy if we 
		show him how to be
 
				jabez 
		hes my son and i like him the way he is why 
		do you always have to pick on him if its not 
		the boy its me you dont like the way i live

				jabez 
		it shows on your face
 
				mary 
		well  i am worried about the way youve 
		changed that was one thing you said youd 
		never do  remember
 
				jabez
		oh for heavens sake leave me alone
 
daniel and belle are coming out of the house jabez picks him up

				jabez

		upper pasture
 
				daniel
		hurray 
			pulling out beanshooter from 
			his pocket and waving it

		beanshooter
 
jabez laughing lifts daniel on his horse 

				daniel 
			calling to ma stone
		grandma look at me
 
				ma stone 
			squinting up at him but still 
			squatting beside the flower bed
		i see you riding pretty high aint you look
 		out you dont fall off
 
 				daniel
		not me 
			pretending to balance 
			himself using his arms
 
jabez daniel and belle ride off
 
 				ma stone 
			to mary
		fox hunting  a stone going fox hunting on a 
		week day  and the earth crying out for the 
		touch of him
 
				mary 
		now ma  you just try to set an example for 
		me and keep hold of yourself
 
				ma stone 
			rising from flower bed
		me why look here mary stone  im worried 
		about you thats all

				mary
		worried about me well you just stop it

 				ma stone 
		whats that
 
				mary 
			something steely in her voice
		i said you should stop worrying because ive 
		made up my mind
 
she turns and goes quickly into the house ma stone looks after her  
concerned

the scene dissolves to a road through marshfield on daniel websters farm in 
the late afternoon this is a fair fertile countryside and all about are 
the green fields smiling under june skies mary is seen driving jabezs old 
buggy up the road a farmhand with buttonlike black eyes and a friendly 
smile is walking along the road
 
				mary 
			stopping the horse
		mr websters place
 
				farmhand
		yes mam  musta come many a long mile mam 
		horse looks tired  moving like cold molasses
 
				mary 
		yes  we have come a long way  all the way 
		from cross corners to see mr webster i hope 
		hes at home
 
				farmhand
		yes mam  hes here
 
the field of the west two hundred discloses webster mowing his clover field 
two farmhands giant young men working with him
 
				old farmhands voice 
			calling through this
		hey there danl black danl
 
				webster 
			pulling in the oxen turning 
			toward road and calling lustily
		hullooo
 
				old farmhands voice 
		someone to see you danl
 
				webster 
		if its the british minister take him around 
		to the pantry and give him some madeira  
 
				old farmhands voice 
		just someone from new hampshire
 
				webster 
			shouting
		why thats different
			to the other farmhands
		well boys i guess well knock off ive got 
		to see a friend
 
he turns over the oxen to the other men and starts striding across the field 

the scene dissolves to the dining room at marshfield that evening it is a 
splendid big room of the period full of comfortable living and good cheer 
webster is at the head of the board and mary sits at his right a generous 
meal has just been eaten they have finished their dessert with most of the 
dishes cleared away
 
				webster 
		well mary its too bad i didnt know  i 
		would have given you a real dinner but with my 
		wife being in washington  have another piece 
		of pie 
			starting to cut a generous slice
 
				mary 
		no really thank you  is mrs webster 
		coming back soon
 
				webster
		well  she hardly ever comes here  shes not 
		the type of woman who cares to live in the 
		country yes  im all on my own  sometimes 
		it makes you feel a little lonely   
			he pulls out a big cigar 
		do you mind if i indulge
 
				mary 
		of course not 
 
				webster 
		no you wouldnt  youre not the sort of 
		woman thats afraid of smoke  or fire  
		but now lets talk about your affairs
 
				mary 
		goodness mr webster ive done nothing but 
		talk about that all through dinner
 
				webster
		yes youve chatted a lot womanlike nibbling 
		around the edge  but mary forgive an old 
		lawyers legal mind i dont think you ever 
		once came to the point and there is a point 
		isnt there
 
				mary 
		why  yes  its hard to put it into words 
		mr webster theres this matter of little 
		daniels schooling and the new house  and 
		well  theres something else thats wrong  
		it gets worse year after year  its like a 
		shadow growing  i cant really talk about it 
		even to ma  she puts it all on jabez and i
		wont stand for that
 
				webster 
		ive heard some odd things about jabez lately 
		 he seems to make the wrong kind of name for 
		himself
 
				mary
		mr webster you mustnt believe all that 
		people say
 
				webster 
		you dont have to defend him to me mary  
		ive been called names myself

				mary

		i dont care if were big or small all i care 
		about is jabez he was the first man i loved 
		he never used to care about money  we were
		poor as jobs turkey but none of us minded 
		now ive seen him drive the poor from the door 
		and we used to be poor ourselves ive seen him 
		get hard and mean and he isnt hard or mean 
		ive heard him mock at the church bells  the 
		bells that rang for our wedding thats not 
		like him mr webster  it must be my fault
		somehow  my fault
 
				webster 
		mary  youve talked to me as you might have 
		talked to your father and i believe he wants me 
		to help you a little you see sometimes we 
		think were licked in this life  but we 
		werent put here to be licked dont you 
		believe it sometimes the shadows seem to get 
		hold of us  the shadows and the evil  but 
		it is still up to us to fight now i was 
		thinking before you came of coming over to 
		cross corners end of the month to get 
		acquainted with my godson  and other things
 
				mary 
			breathlessly
		oh could you mr webster 
 
				webster 
		and now come on mary i want to show you the 
		allfired biggest parsnips in the whole united
		states raised right here in marshfield  of
		course

he links arms with her in a warm affectionate fatherly manner and walks 
her toward the door
 
the scene dissolves to the hall of jabezs new house at night the last 
finishing touches are being done by the workmen for that part of the 
country the house is ostentatious to the last degree perhaps it is borrowed 
freely from the adams period jabez stands in front of a mirror getting a 
fitting from the tailor who is just about to take off the sleeve from the 
evening coat jabez is wearing belle is looking on
 
				jabez 
		looks all right  do you have to tear it all 
		down again
 
				tailor

				jabez

				squire
			glancing over the list
		the only one you missed  is the president
 
				jabez

		too but i was afraid danl webster might feel 
		insulted
 
the squire makes a move to return the list  
 
				jabez

		folks really come

				jabez 
		how much

				squire 
		5000  thats just what i owe you

				jabez 
			extending his hand
		shake
 
they shake hands
 
the scene dissolves into a road to cross corners it is day and a carriage 
drawn by two magnificent horses appears driven by webster the carriage is 
brought to a stop as it reaches little daniel who is reading a handbill from 
a circus
 
				webster 
			calling
		hello colonel want a lift

				daniel
		well i wouldnt mind 
			as he runs up to carriage
		but my names daniel stone
 
				webster 
		all right daniel jump in 

daniel does so and they drive along the road
 
in websters carriage as webster and daniel are driving along the road toward 
cross corners

				daniel
		gee  that fair  
 
				webster 
		it hasnt opened yet 

				daniel
		no  but i can hardly wait  mister  tell 
		me will there really be 
			spelling it out
		 a man that eats fire

				webster 
		guess there will if it says so
 
				daniel 
		and two unpara unparalleled circassian 
		beauties what is that
 
				webster 
		young man  you got me there
 
				daniel 
			looking at the handbill again
		n daniel webster will be there
 
				webster 
			chuckling
		a varied list of attractions and which would 
		you like to see first danl
 
				daniel 
		i think id like to begin with the fireeater  
 
				webster 
		and what about daniel webster
 
				daniel
		well i thought hed come in the middle
 
				webster 
			laughing
		and serve him right
 
webster is driving faster now he talks softly to the horses daniel fumbles 
in his coat pocket and slyly brings out his inevitable beanshooter he puts 
beans in his mouth and when webster isnt looking blows a bean at the rear 
of one of the horses the horse shies webster turns and catches daniel 
before he can hide the beanshooter
 
				webster 
		daniel dont ever let me catch you doing that 
		again
 
				daniel 
		why it dont hurt
 
				webster 
		it does hurt and dont you do it again
 
a pause webster urges on the horses as he chooses not to say anything more 
the horses fly along the road
 
				daniel 
		make them go faster mr 
 
				webster
		no daniel  they are not race horses they 
		are good old friends of mine i call em 
		constitution and bill of rights the most 
		dependable pair for long journeys ive got one 
		called missouri compromise too and then 
		theres a supreme court  fine dignified 
		horse though you do have to push him now and 
		then
 
				daniel 
		golly  id like to see all your horses
 
				webster
		maybe you can sometime daniel im a farmer 
		you know and like to show my farm  but the 
		thing id like to show you most youll have to 
		see for yourself
 
				daniel 
		whats that sir
 
				webster 
		well  its high and its wide and it goes a 
		long way and there is a wind blowing through it 
		and a blue roof over it  its the hills up 
		here and the rivers running south and the new 
		states growing in the west
 
				daniel 
		anybody can see that
 
				webster
		youre wrong mr stone there are people who 
		live and die without eer seeing it they cant 
		see the country for the money in their pockets 
		 and some think their states the country or 
		the way they live is the country and theyre 
		willing to split the country because of that 
		well i hope youll meet all those when youre
		grown youll meet the fireeaters and the 
		circassian beauties  thats part of the fair 
		to be sure but if wed had to depend on them 
		in a permanent way the country would have 
		stopped at the allegheny mountains
 
				daniel 
		but it didnt stop i know it didnt stop 
		granny told me it didnt
 
				webster
		no siree it didnt and it wont  no matter 
		what happens  just as long as the folks at 
		the fair believe in freedom and union so   
			to the horse 
		giddyap constitution  and lets keep going 
		mr stone
 
they drive ahead
 
				daniel
			shouting excitedly
		faster  faster  
 
he takes out his beanshooter and uses it again on the horses webster brings 
the buggy to a stop
 
				webster
			grabbing daniel more firmly
		i think this is coming to you young man  
 
he turns him over his knee taking the boy completely by surprise

				webster
		i told you not to do that again 

he begins to spank him daniel yowls 

at the inn in cross corners with a crowd of farmers
 
				the crowd 
			calling
		black danl hurray for daniel webster the 
		union and black danl hip hip hurray
 
they rush forward and now we see websters carriage webster is just 
finishing spanking daniel as the rest of the crowd surround the carriage to 
greet him a close view reveals the boy daniel sprawled across websters 
knee he looks up with tearstained face as he hears the magic name of daniel 
webster his eyes open wide he stares then in complete humiliation he 
escapes through the crowd  now we see webster as the squire approaches him
 
				webster
		well  well  whats this i thought id meet 
		you all down there at jabez stones house
		warming i hope you didnt wait for me to lead
		the parade
 
				squire
		not exactly mr webster  we wanted to have 
		a little chat with you before we go to the 
		party do you mind having a drink with us
 
				webster 
		do i mind having a drink with you gentlemen 
		what a question to ask daniel webster
 
webster climbs from his carriage and goes to the inn followed by the squire 
and the rest of the crowd
 
the scene dissolves to the kitchen of the old farmhouse at night ma stone is 
sitting by the window shelling peas she interrupts her work to peer out into 
the darkness steps are heard above and as ma turns around mary appears at 
the foot of the stairs in her party dress there is a moment of silence
 
				ma stone 
		so youve made up your mind to go to the party

				mary 
		you arent angry with me 

				ma stone 
		ah fiddlesticks  you are old enough to know 
		what you are doing
 
they go to the door
 
the front yard as mary walks away through the darkness ma stands in the 
doorway looking after her
 
				ma stone 
			calling
		be sure to let me know if daniel is over there
 
				mary 
		i wont forget
 
mary walks on as ma looks after her in the distance we see the flickering of 
the lights in the new house
 
the scene dissolves to the reception room of jabezs new mansion moving up 
impressive front stairs and through the great door into the hall with its 
grand staircase and then into a reception room here are found a great many 
of the treasures that jabez has bragged about servants of every description 
are waiting and a small orchestra is in one corner tuning up there is a 
decided air of pretentiousness about it all contrasting pointedly with the 
dance in jabezs barn years before
 
mary dressed in a simple but becoming party gown moves quietly about 
seeing that all is correct and in readiness  a demure and charming hostess 
hiding her real feelings quite successfully for the moment jabez enters 
just having come downstairs dressed to kill he goes to a fulllength 
mirror on the wall tying his cravat there is something utterly pompous 
about him at the same time tragic in its implications
 
				jabez
			looking at his watch 
			then turning to mary
		why dont they come  
 
				mary 
			helpless
		i dont know jabez
 
jabez walks up and down waiting suddenly he turns to the orchestra
 
				jabez 
		play some music  something gay and jolly
 
the orchestra starts to play then jabez after another interval of nervous 
waiting turns to mary again
 
				jabez 
		think this room is larger than anything 
		websters got at marshfield youve been there 
		what about it mary
 
				mary
		its  different jabez  thats all
 
				jabez 
			looking again at is watch
		whats the matter with em why dont they 
		come

little daniel comes running down the stairway followed by belle who is 
dressed elaborately for the party jabez doesnt take any notice of the boy 
being so worried he continues to walk up and down
 
				mary 
		daniel you ought to be in bed
 
				daniel
		no no i dont want to go to bed i want to be
		here for the party 

he runs from the room jabez in his walk approaches the window where faces 
appear pressed against the glass
 
				jabez 
			to belle
		what are those people doing there what do they 
		want
 
				belle
		theyre just outsiders they want to see how 
		fine jabez stone lives these days theyre 
		waiting for your guests too 
 
jabez turns away from the window and as he passes the orchestra which has 
just finished a piece he relieves his tension by shouting at them
 
				jabez
		consarn it  im paying you for playing  so 
		keep on playing
 
the musicians hurriedly start to play another selection but before they can 
begin a bell is heard it cracks the silence jabez jumps to attention and 
belle moves from the window mary stands stiffly as a servant or lackey 
hurries to the great front door the orchestra strikes up triumphantly
 
a lackey hurries to the door and opens it a small pinched figure in rusty 
black stands on the great steps it is stevens he takes off his old beaver 
stovepipe hat and cringes in stepping with an obsequious air the lackey 
takes his hat which he hardly wants to let go he crosses to mary mary makes 
a curtsy and stevens takes her hand eager for the warmth of it
 
				mary 
		welcome mr stevens  
 
				stevens
		good evening mrs stone
 
nervous and cringing he crosses the threshold and enters the reception room
 
the reception room stevens crosses to jabez
 
				stevens
		good evening  im sorry jabez  im a 
		little late

				jabez 
		no youre not

				stevens
			looking  around
		wheres everybody
 
				jabez 
		i dunno  i cant figure it out ive invited 
		them all why dont they come

				daniel
		theyre all at the inn ive seen them mr 
		websters there too

the scene dissolves to the inn in cross corners where webster is sitting 
with tom sharp eli higgins hank and a number of other farmers around a 
table webster is looking over a number of contracts  the same which the 
farmers signed with jabez
 
				tom sharp 
			to hank
		show mr webster that foul contract you got 
		with jabez stone
 
hank produces a worn bit of legal paper and hands it over to webster webster 
compares it with the other contracts
 
				webster
		hes certainly made himself the big frog in the 
		little puddle around here hasnt he

				farmer
		and it all looked so simple when it started  
		like getting loans for nothing 
			to tom sharp 
		i should have listened to you tom
 
				webster 
			slowly
		well  hes got you im afraid  got you
		sewed up tight in his money pocket guess 
		youve sold your souls gentlemen
 
the scene dissolves to the reception hall in stones mansion where the 
situation hasnt changed  no guests are there but miser stevens belle goes 
over to mary who is still waiting at the foot of the stairs to play her part 
as the hostess
 
				belle
		i see why youre here  you knew that nobody 
		was coming

				mary 
		i didnt

				belle
		youre lying
 
				mary 
		lying to you  why should i
 
				belle
		you know that youre in my house
 
				mary 
		i know  and you could show me the door you 
		would too if you werent still hoping the 
		guests might arrive
 
				belle
		you think youre so smart mrs stone you 
		wanted to be near jabez it looked like your 
		big chance tonight but youre wrong you cant 
		win him back  not that way
 
				mary 
		thats my problem belle 

and she walks away

stevens is sitting at the table jabez sits next to him just dismissing the 
little boy daniel

				jabez 
		now run along daniel
 
				stevens 
			as daniel leaves 
		what a fine boy you have jabez how old is he 
		now 

				jabez 
		almost seven 
			correcting himself quickly 
		no  no hes not seven yet i am sure  
 
				stevens 
		well  it seems to me  i remember when you 
		paid me

				stevens 
	 		interrupting quickly
		oh never mind  lets have a drink

stevens looks strangely

				jabez 
		whats the matter with you 

				stevens
		you are afraid
 
				jabez 
		afraid  of what

				stevens
		 of what happens after we die
 
				jabez 
		are you plumb crazy man what do you think 
		happens were buried  thats all

				stevens
		but what becomes of our souls
 
				jabez 
		why do you fret about something that isnt 
		there

				stevens
			with a frantic note in his voice
		dont say that  i know it is 

				jabez 
			swigging down another drink 
		all right  so its buried with you
 
				stevens
		what if one hasnt a soul any more what of 
		that
 
				jabez 
			disturbed
		huh  whats that 
			a pause he gulps 
			then hurries on 
		well  what about it who cares anyhow

				stevens 
		i do  and i think you should too
 
				jabez 
			suddenly excited
		stevens  whats all this leading up to you 
		know something come on out with it  you 
		know something about me
 
at this moment they are interrupted men and women with common faces the 
same faces we have seen behind the windows are pouring in belle leads them 
the guests who have flocked around bow to jabez
 
				jabez 
			to belle
		who are these people
 
				belle 
		they are all friends of mine  from over the 
		mountain 
			to the crowd 
		welcome help yourselves to drinks glad you 
		could come have a good time
 
jabez dumbfounded shakes hands with people he has never seen before
stevens is shoved aside the orchestra begins a strange dance tune and belle
glides over gracefully to stevens
 
				belle 
		lets dance mr stevens
 
				stevens 
			frightened
		no  no  i cant dance  
 
				belle
		oh yes  you can dance with me ill guide 
		you   
			taking his hand 
		you see  it is all so easy  like that   
			and she takes a few steps 
		you see  so easy 

they begin to dance slowly at first around the room others are dancing  
the strange thinlyclad people in their heavy boots that clump over the fine 
oak floors mary stands in the doorway watching miserably seeing jabez 
drinking more rum laughing loudly  all this to cover his growing fears 
and mary knows that
 
the hallway just in front of the big outside doors there is a rap on the 
door and mary rushes to it getting there before the lackey can she opens 
the door herself and webster comes in
 
				mary
			taking his hand
		oh  mr webster  im so glad you came
 
				webster
			peering at her eager 
			but distressed face
		are you mary  well i guess im glad myself 
		 seeing as how you feel this way 
			he looks into reception room 
			at the whirling dancers 
		party seems to be quite a success 
			with a wry smile 
		lots of guests anyhow
 
mary looks at him and webster sees that her eyes are moist and that her lips 
tremble she might say something might break the shell of her new england 
reserve but before that can happen jabez comes strutting out his face is 
flushed from rum and his eyes are unnaturally bright he comes to webster 
his hand thrust forward
 
				jabez
		well  mr webster this is a great day for 
		me come on in sir i want you to take the 
		seat of honor and meet all my guests
 
				webster
		thats just fine neighbor stone  but  i 
		have to be pretty careful of my seats of 
		honor  where i sit i mean you see the 
		whole country sort of has its eye on me 
		jabez  anybody in public life has that 
		difficulty  even you jabez they watch us 
		carefully our neighbors and our enemies and 
		they see much more than we think they do  and 
		understand much more my friends all like to 
		think that ive got the good of mankind always 
		at heart and ive got to make sure that those 
		i deal with have the good of mankind always at 
		heart too do you know what im talking about 
		jabez
 
				jabez 
		what  whats on your mind
 
				webster 
		you jabez stone  you and a lot of poor 
		farmers hereabouts  good men of the earth 
		who are in trouble because of you or  am i 
		wrong about those contracts mr stone
 
				jabez 
		contracts  yes they have contracts with me 
		 lots of em  but  but thats all right
		without me and my money they wouldnt have 
		anything
 
				webster 
		theyd have a good neighbor jabez  and 
		thats worth much more than anything else  
		much much more
 
jabez laughs uproariously webster shakes his head with the wisdom of real 
sadness in his eyes
 
 				webster 
		im sorry you cant see that i know you could
		once  you made a little speech once that 
		ill always remember and i know the others 
		do too   they remember and they see how you 
		have changed thats why they didnt want to
		come tonight to you jabez  youre as blind 
		as a burma bat with your gold pot mind you 
		its not the money ive been talking about 
		its what you make of it
 
				jabez
		i  i dont know what youre talking about i 
		 i havent time to listen to all this  

				webster
			still shaking his head
		no  you havent time  you havent time 
		for your mother or your wife or your child

				jabez
			turning on mary
		its your fault you brought daniel webster 
		here  just to try to make a fool of me you 
		played the sneak behind my back  made up all 
		sorts of lies against me you can get yourself 
		out of my home  go back to the other house 
		 that old place where you belong  i dont 
		want to  to talk to you again

over his shoulder in the doorway to the reception room the whirling dancers 
pass and belle still dancing with stevens is seen for a moment
 
				webster
			calmly gently to mary
		come along mary  
 
mary goes to him and they move to the door little daniel frightened by the 
strange motley dancers comes running out of the reception room into the 
hall 

				mary 
		daniel  you come with me
 
mary takes his hand webster mary and daniel go out of the house down the 
stairs and the doors close with a bang jabez turns and calls into the 
reception room where amidst the other guests belle dances with stevens
 
				jabez 
		belle

she doesnt listen  the music is playing faster and louder
 
				jabez 
			to a footman
		close the windows and make a fire 
			as the footman leaves 
		belle belle
 
				a voice
		what is it 

jabez turns around and sees scratch standing in the doorway to the reception 
room
 
				scratch
		why mr stone you look so worried can i be 
		of any service
 
				jabez 
			facing scratch
		you promised me prosperity happiness love 
		money friendship  
 
				scratch
			interrupting
		just a minute neighbor stone i promised you 
		money and all that money can buy i dont 
		recall any other obligations but lets look at 
		the contract

he takes out a large black pocketbook stuffed with paper he flicks papers 
over reading the names

				scratch
		sherwin slattery stevens stone  

but something has fluttered from his pocketbook  a small white thing that 
looks like a moth  the soul of miser stevens it flutters toward jabez 
jabez catches it in his hand and closing his fingers holds it tightly a 
thin small voice is heard  the soul of miser stevens speaking from jabezs 
hand
 
				soul of stevens
		neighbor neighbor stone help me
 
				jabez 
			astounded
		thats miser stevens voice  miser stevens  
 
				scratch
			smiling
		 miser stevens soul mr stone yes  i 
		am sorry for the disturbance
 
				jabez 
		he aint dead  hes dancing in there
 
				scratch 
		he was 

he steps near and drapes a big bandana handkerchief over jabezs hand and 
transfers the soul to the handkerchief and starts tying the ends together 
jabez looks into the reception room its empty except for the dead body of 
stevens lying on the floor
 
				scratch 
		in the midst of life  one really hates to 
		close these long standing accounts but 
		business is business
 
jabezs eyes fix on the bandana

				jabez 
			hoarsely 
		are they all as  small  as that
 
				scratch 
		small oh i see what you mean why they vary 
			looking at jabez 
		now a man like daniel webster if i ever get 
		hold of him id have to build a special box 
		for him and even at that i imagine the wing 
		spread would be astonishing 
			looking again at jabez 
		in your case  
 
				jabez 
		my time isnt up yet
 
and as he turns around the scene changes quickly to the stone farm at the 
blasted tree that bears the date of jabezs doom jabez is hacking blindly at 
the tree trunk with an ax he is making little headway mr scratch is 
standing beside him
 
				scratch 
		trying to break our contract again mr stone
 
				jabez 
			furiously hacking away
		im through with you
 
				scratch 
		what a headstrong fellow well  i guess 
		youre quite prepared to suffer the 
		consequences
 
				jabez 
		i have still a year  a year to make up for 
		everything
 
				scratch 
		oh no you violated clause five of our contract 
		and i could collect right now if i chose
 
				jabez 
			desperately
		not now not now   let me make up  let me 
		make up
 
				scratch 
		suddenly you seem quite desperate mr stone 
			a pause 
		 you know im a goodnatured man im always 
		open to reason with a little security  i 
		might
 
 				jabez 
		anything  anything  you can have it all 
		back  that money  the new house  my farm 
		 the whole caboodle
 
				scratch 
		im afraid thats hardly the sort of security i 
		was thinking of 
			after a pause 
		you see  there is that promising little 
		fellow your son 
 
				jabez 
			violently
		no no no not him  not my son  id rather 
		go with you  right now
 
				scratch 
		come come mr stone you are a little upset 
		its not fair to bargain with you now  ill 
		give you until midnight mr stone but not one 
		minute more ah then youll come with me 
		indeed
 
and scratch disappears jabez turns and runs from the tree off into the 
night in the direction of the old farmhouse
 
the exterior of the old farmhouse the place is dark forlornlooking almost 
desolate in contrast to the false gaiety of the mansion we follow jabez as 
he comes running from the tree along the path to the house he bursts into 
the kitchen door
 
now we see jabez inside the farmhouse as he runs upstairs into the bedroom 
calling frantically
 
				jabez 
		daniel  daniel mary
 
he looks frantically about he calls again and runs downstairs as the scene 
moves with him into the kitchen it too is empty and dark he calls once 
more
 
				jabez 
		mary  daniel
 
the scene moves with him as he runs outside jabez then comes running out 
more wildly than ever this time in the direction of the barn
 
in the old barn where jabez first met mr scratch jabez comes running in 
he pauses panting he looks about him helplessly hopelessly
 
				jabez 
			desperate
		mary  daniel
 
no answer suddenly he sinks down on an old barrel and buries his head in his 
hands groaning in mortal agony ma stone enters from the rear door she 
carries a smudged lantern
 
				ma stone 
		my son  whats the matter
 
				jabez 
			looking up
		ma  
			jumping up and going to her 
		wheres mary  and little danl
 
 				ma stone 
		gone with daniel webster  to marshfield 
		son you told mary to go
 
she stops not wishing to add to his pain but looks at his twisted face with 
great understanding and compassion jabez turns to one of the stalls and 
brings out a horse ma stone holding up the lantern he leaps on the horse 
and rides off
 
now there are views of a stretch of road in the direction of marshfield as 
webster with mary and daniel beside him on the front seat of the carriage 
is driving on toward marshfield
 
another part of the road farther back with jabez riding on  his horse 
galloping finally we see another section of the same road as jabez catches 
up to websters carriage mary sits beside webster holding the boy in her 
lap
 
				jabez 
		mr webster  wait  
			as webster slows down 
			and jabez rides up 
		mary
 
				mary 
			turning on front seat 
			with a glad cry
		jabez
 
				jabez 
		mary come back 
 
				mary 
			happily to jabez
		oh jabez  
			to webster 
		did you hear mr webster   now youll help 
		him wont you
 
				webster
		ill fight ten thousand devils to save a new 
		hampshire man
 
webster turns the horses about and starts back
 
the scene dissolves to the exterior and the interior of jabezs old barn a 
short time later jabez and webster making their way through a crowd of 
farmers enter the barn throughout the barn is thick darkness pierced only 
by the uncertain light from a farm lantern the corners loft and stalls are 
pools of night
 
				webster
		its here you said that you closed the deal 
		with him
 
				jabez 
		yes mr webster  it was here where it all 
		began
 
				webster 
		i see and this is where hed like to collect 
		too
 
				jabez 
		yes  at midnight
 
				mary 
			coming in through the front door
		jabez 
 
				webster 
			coming over to mary 
			stopping her at the door
		mary  what love and trust could do for your 
		husband youve done and frankly in a very 
		few moments this is going to be no place for a 
		lady

				mary 
		mr webster  you will help him 

				webster 
		ill do my best mary 

				jabez 
		you must go now mary  you must
 
				mary 
		all right jabez 
 
she turns and exits quickly
 
				webster 
		they make plucky women in new england 
			he consults his watch 
			holding it near the lantern 
		hm  how long have we to wait
 
				jabez
			trying to control himself 
			looking at his watch
		not long  now
 
				webster 
			going over to feedbin where 
			a dusty jug reposes in the hay
		then ill just christen the jug with your 
		permission stone somehow or other waitings 
		wonderfully shorter with a jug
 
he takes the jug over to a plank laid between two sawhorses and pours 
himself a drink into one of the cups mary brought he tastes it
 
				webster 
		hm  old medford
 
he smacks his lips sits down on a barreltop there are a few other barrels 
placed about the crude table
 
				webster 
		theres nothing like it i saw an inchworm take 
		a drop of it once and he stood right up on his 
		hind legs and bit a bee come  try a nip
 
				jabez 
		theres no joy in it for me
 
				webster 
		oh come man come just because youve sold 
		your soul to the devil that neednt make you a 
		teetotaler
 
he takes another swig of medford there is a knock at the rear door a subtle 
kind of knock that is different from anything else of its kind
 
				webster 
		come in
 
scratch enters he carries his collectingbox under his arm
 
				scratch 
			suavely
		mr webster i presume
 
				webster 
		attorney of record for jabez stone might i 
		ask your name 

				scratch 
		scratch will do for the evening may i  join 
		you
 
he slides easily onto a barreltop by the makeshift table and pours a drink 
from the jug then lifts his cup and toasts jabez and webster silently he 
drinks deeply
 
				webster 
		why certainly  but be careful mr scratch 
		 medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking 
		back even with oldtimers like yourself  
			he sips his medford 

				scratch 
			with a soft chuckle
		it even kicked back  once at you didnt it
 
				webster 
			professing indignant surprise
		me
 
 				scratch 
		oh   not that you ever get drunk no indeed 
		but a kind of overpowering lassitude or more 
		plainly a deep and enveloping sleep

				webster 
 		there isnt enough medford rum in the whole of 
		new hampshire to make me sleepy  
			he deliberately drinks again 

 				scratch 
		talk has never proved that question mr 
		webster 
			he drains his cup 
		cup for cup  what do you say
 
				webster 
			immediately
		cup for cup
 
they pour and drink and smack their lips at each other

				scratch 
		well now mr stone did you make up your mind
 
				jabez
		about what
 
				scratch 
		are you willing to give me your son in exchange 
		for an extension of our contract
 
				jabez
		never
 
the stone farmhouse kitchen where ma stone is busy making a pie mary stands 
by the window she turns from it as little daniel comes running downstairs in 
his nightgown and bare feet
 
				daniel
		mama
 
 				mary 
		daniel  you must go to sleep
 
				daniel
			throwing his arms around her
		i dont want to be up there all alone mama
		i want to be with you
 
				mary 
		all right darling

voices are heard outside and there is a quick rap at the window

				ma stone 
			to mary
		you see who it is i have to get my pie in the 
		oven 

mary opens the door there are tom sharp and a few farmers outside

				tom sharp 
		jabezs new house is aburning down

				ma stone 
			calling from the stove
		well you just let it alone  the consarn 
		thing oughter burn
 
she closes the window on their astonished faces and turns to mary with her 
head tossing and her lips pursed
 
the barn with webster and scratch still drinking with a chuckle scratch 
rises perfectly steady on his nimble legs webster sits at the table a 
trifle slumped
 
				scratch 
		your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients 
		do you credit mr webster  if you have no 
		more arguments to adduce ill take him along 
		now
 
				webster 
		not so fast mr scratch produce your evidence 
		 if you have it
 
 				scratch 
			taking out the pocketbook
		there mr webster 
			passing it to him 
		all open and aboveboard and in due and legal 
		form
 
				webster 
			looking over the deed
		hm this appears  i say appears  to be 
		properly drawn but you shall not have this 
		man a man isnt property mr stone is an 
		american citizen and no american citizen may 
		be forced into the service of a foreign prince
 
				scratch 
		foreign and who calls me a foreigner
 
				webster 
		well i never heard the dev of your claiming 
		american citizenship
 
				scratch 
		and who with better right when the first wrong 
		was done to the first indian i was there when 
		the first slaver put out for the congo i stood 
		on the deck am i not spoken of still in 
		every church in new england tis true the 
		north claims me for a southerner and the south 
		for a northerner but i am neither to tell the 
		truth mr webster though i dont like to 
		boast of it my name is older in the country 
		than yours
 
				webster 
		then i stand on the constitution i demand a 
		trial for my client
 
				scratch 
		you mean  a jury trial
 
				webster 
		i do if i cant win this case with a jury you 
		shall have me too if two new hampshire men 
		arent a match for the devil wed better give 
		this country back to the indians
 
				scratch
			smiling
		very well  you shall have your trial mr 
		webster the case is hardly one for an ordinary 
		jury  
 
				webster 
		let it be the quick or the dead  so it is an 
		american judge and an american jury
 
				scratch 
		the quick or the dead you have said it 
			he raises the cup again to webster  
		may  the best man win mr webster
 
				webster 
		ill drink to that mr scratch
 
webster raises his glass also both drink deeply scratch watching webster 
closely to see the effect then scratch goes to a door in a dark corner of 
the floor that opens into a cellar he throws the door back and a black hole 
yawns at his feet a ruffian in pioneer dress captain kidd appears others 
follow
 
				scratch 
		you must pardon the leathery toughness of one 
		or two  captain kidd  he killed a man for 
		gold simon girty  the renegade he burned 
		men for gold governor dale  he broke men on 
		the wheel asa the black monk  he choked 
		them to death floyd ireson and stede bonnet 
		the fiendish butchers walter butler  the 
		king of the massacre big and little harp  
		robbers and murderers teach the cutthroat  
		morton the vicious lawyer  and  general 
		benedict arnold  you remember him no doubt 
		dastard liar traitor knave  americans 
		all 
 
they now go toward the stalls that in a crude way resemble a jury box
 
now in the kitchen of stones old farmhouse ma stone sits by the fire 
reading from the big family bible mary at her side it is still night
 
				ma stone 
			reading from psalm 102
		hide not thy face from me in the day when i am 
		in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the 
		day when i call answer me speedily for my days 
		are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned 
		as an hearth my heart is smitten and withered 
		like grass so that i forget to eat my bread
		but thou o lord shalt endure forever and thy 
		remembrance unto all generations
 
then back in the old barn we see that the jury has filled up the stalls 
that serve as a jury box they sit silently in shadow real and yet at the 
same time unreal justice hawthorne a tall lean terrifying puritan 
appears
 
				clerk 
			in a gabble

		midnight court of the state of new hampshire in 
		the county of franklin is now in session

				webster 
		i object to general benedict arnold your 
		honor for being a flagrant traitor to the 
		great american cause 

				hawthorne
			cutting it short
		objection denied the prosecution will proceed
 
				scratch 
			stepping out briskly
		your honor  gentlemen of the jury  this 
		case need not detain us long it concerns one 
		thing alone  the transference barter and 
		sale of a certain piece of property to wit 
		his soul by jabez stone that transference 
		barter or sale is attested by a deed i offer

scratch hands the deed to the clerk who hands it to hawthorne
 
				scratch
		i shall now call jabez stone to the witness 
		stand

				clerk
		jabez stone to the witness stand
 
webster gives jabez an encouraging pat on the hack and jabez takes his place 
in the witness stand which is an empty corncrib he looks scared the eyes 
of the jury fasten upon him

				scratch
		jabez stone  did you or did you not sign this 
		document
 
				jabez
			sweating
		yes i did  but you tricked me into signing 
		it you told me my soul was nothing  that i 
		could forget all about a soul in exchange for 
		money that was a lie a lie a lie
 
				scratch 
			only smiling
		that is highly irrelevant to this case your 
		honor
 
				hawthorne
			nodding sagely
		leave out the soul proceed

				scratch 
		i would like to ask mr stone whether or not i 
		faithfully fulfilled my part of the contract 
		didnt i give you seven years of good luck and 
		prosperity didnt i make you the richest man 
		in the country
 
				jabez
		yes  yes i am the richest man  too rich i 
		cant think of anything but money thats the 
		trouble with me

				scratch 
			smiling
		but mr stone i am hardly to blame for the 
		pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience 
			he holds out deed 
		is this your signature

				jabez
			almost shouting
		you know darn well it is
 
				scratch 
			turning to the jury
		gentlemen the prosecution rests
 
				hawthorne
		does the jury wish to consider the case

they do not speak

				hawthorne
		it appears they do not take your man mr 
		scratch 

scratch moves toward jabez who shrinks back the jury sits motionless

				webster 
		i protest your honor i wish to crossexamine 
		 to prove  
 
				hawthorne
		there will be no crossexamination in this 
		court
 
				scratch 
		your honor you will lose a great experience if 
		you do not let him speak there is only one 
		daniel webster
 
				hawthorne
			to webster
		you may speak if you like but be brief
			as  webster steps forward 
		and let me warn you mr webster  if you 
		speak and fail to convince us then you too  
			pointing his finger 
		 are doomed
 
there now appears a close view of daniel webster his face shows his struggle 
to concentrate
 
				voices of jury
		drag him down with us   drag him down with 
		us

				jabezs voice
		save yourself mr webster  dont speak

				scratchs voice 
			ironically
		there isnt enough medford rum in the whole of 
		new hampshire to make me sleepy 

				voices of jury
		lost and gone  lost and gone  
 
a bell stroke and music

				webster 
			his voice mounting over it all
		be still
 
the timbre of his mighty voice stops the murmur and the music and bell 
strokes recede a breathless silence ensues he is facing the jury his eyes 
like anthracite seeming to burn through the murk

				webster 
		gentlemen of the jury  it is my privilege to 
		be addressing tonight a group of men ive long 
		been acquainted with in song and story but men 
		i had never hoped to see

he pauses they stare back at him eyes fixed and benedict arnold starts to 
raise his head
 
 				webster
		my worthy opponent mr scratch has called you 
		americans all and mr scratch was right  you 
		were americans all oh what a heritage you 
		were born to share gentlemen of the jury i 
		envy you for you were there at the birth of a 
		mighty union it was given to you to hear those 
		first cries of pain  and to behold the 
		shining babe that was born of blood and tears 
		tonight you are called upon to judge a man 
		named jabez stone what is his case he is 
		accused of breach of contract   he made a 
		deal to find a short cut in his life  to get 
		rich quickly the same deal all of you once 
		made 
			a pause 
		you benedict arnold  i speak to you first 
		because youre better known than all your other 
		colleagues here what a different song yours 
		could have been a friend of washington and 
		lafayette  a soldier  general arnold you 
		fought so gallantly for the american cause 
		till  what was the date oh yes  in 1779 
		a date burned in your heart
 
arnold bows his head again
 
				webster
		the lure of gold made you betray that cause
 
another pause as his words sink in then he whirls about and points at simon 
girty
 
				webster 
		you simon girty now known to all as renegade 
		a loathsome word  you also took that other 
		way 
			steps along the jury box 
		you walter butler  what would you give to 
		have another chance to let the grasses grow in 
		cherry valley without the stain of blood  
		you captain kidd and you governor dale  i 
		could go on and name you all but theres no 
		need of that why stir the wounds i know they 
		pain enough 
			his voice rises 
		all of you were fooled like jabez stone  
		fooled and trapped in your desire to rebel 
		against your fate gentlemen of the jury  
		its the eternal right of man to raise his fist 
		against his fate but every time he does he 
		stands at crossroads you took the wrong turn 
		and so did jabez stone but he found out in 
		time he is here tonight to save his soul 
		gentlemen of the jury i ask that you give 
		jabez stone another chance to walk upon the 
		earth among  the trees the growing corn 
		the smell of grass in spring  what would you 
		give for one more chance to see those things 
		that you must all remember and often long to 
		feel again for you were all men once clean 
		american air was in your lungs  you breathed 
		it deep for it was free and blew across an 
		earth you loved these are common things i 
		speak of small things but they are good 
		things yet without your soul they are nothing 
		without your soul they sicken mr scratch told 
		you that your soul is nothing and you believed 
		him it has cost you your freedom freedom is 
		not just a big word  it is the bread and the 
		morning and the risen sun it was for freedom 
		we came in boats and ships to these shores it 
		has been a long journey a hard one a bitter 
		one there is sadness in being a man but it is 
		a proud thing too out of the suffering and 
		the starvation the wrong and the right a new 
		thing has come a free man when the whips of 
		the oppressors are broken and their names 
		forgotten and destroyed free men will be 
		walking and talking under a free star yes we 
		have planted freedom here in this earth like 
		wheat we have said to the sky above us a man 
		shall own his own soul now  here is this 
		man  he is your brother you are americans 
		all you cannot
			pointing at the devil
		 take his side  the side of the oppressor 
		let jabez stone keep his soul  this soul 
		which doesnt belong to him alone which 
		belongs to his son  his family  his 
		country gentlemen of the jury  dont let
		this country go to the devil free jabez 
		stone god save the united states and the men 
		who have made her free
 
a long pause the jury does not stir webster steps back goes to the table 
and sits down quietly the pause holds for a moment longer and then 
hawthorne speaks
 
				hawthorne
		the jury will consider its verdict
 
he hands the deed to the foreman of the jury they form a little circle and 
put their heads together jabez looks at them the sweat of his agony in 
beads on his forehead scratch only smiles slowly the jury turns again and 
the foreman tears up the deed
 
				hawthorne
		the jury finds for the defendant
 
a longdrawn crow of a cock is heard
 
				scratch 
			wryly to webster
		my congratulations  as between two gentlemen

				webster 
			catching scratch by the collar
		why you longbarreled slabsided lantern
		jawed noteshaving crook be off with you 
 
he runs scratch to the door and kicks him out

the yard outside of the barn morning light is shining scratch is tearing 
out of the barn he turns and calls back
 
				scratch 
		youll never be president  ill see to that
 
he practically thumbs his nose but the farmers rush in and chase scratch out
through the gate he runs wildly down the road

immediately outside the barn door mary is just flinging her arms around
jabez
 
				mary
		jabez  jabez
 
				jabez
		mary

				webster 
		you were worried jabez werent you
 
				jabez

				webster
		i know  that was mighty queer medford  knew 
		it the minute i tasted it but it takes more 
		than that to down daniel webster
 
				mary 
			turning to him and 
			clasping his hands
		youve done it mr webster  god bless you

and as they stand together jabez runs toward the house

outside the kitchen ma stone is busy setting the breakfast table that is 
under an apple tree in the yard jabez comes running to her gleefully like a 
boy let loose from school

				jabez 
		ma  ma  its all right ma

of medford rum under his arm is surrounded by the farmers including tom

he hooks his arm into jabezs and they go up toward the house tom sharp 
walks next to jabez 
 
outside the kitchen as they all sit down webster is at the head of the 
table the jug of medford beside his chair jabez sits next to mary and next 
to mary sits little daniel

dish everybody is dumbfounded

his hands and munching it lustily as the scene fades out
