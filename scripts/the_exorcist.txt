electrical activity of the brain in the case of your daughter in 
the temperal lobe up here in the lateral part of the brain its 
rare but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just 
before a convulsion 

chris
convulsion 

dr klein
the shaking of the bed thats doubtless due to musuclar spasms 

chris
oh no that was no spasm i got on the bed the whole bed was 
thumping and rising off the floor and shaking the whole thing 
with me on it

klein and tanney exit regans room and approach them chris 
stands 

dr klein
shes heavily sedated shell probably sleep through tomorrow 

chris
what was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like 
that 

dr tanney
pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated 
motor performance for example a ninetypound women sees her 
child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the 
wheels half a foot up off the ground you know the story same 
thing here same principle i mean 

chris
so whats wrong with her 

dr klein
we still think the temporal lobe 

chris
oh what are you talking about for christ sake did you see her 
or not shes acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or 
a split personality or 

dr tanney
there havent been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so
called split personality mrs macneil now i know the temptation 
is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would 
exhaust the somatic possibilities first 

chris
so whats next 

dr tanney
a pneumoencephelogram i would think pin down that lesion it 
will involve another spinal 

chris
oh christ 

dr tanney
what we missed in the eeg and the arteriogram could conceivably 
turn up there at the least it would eliminate certain other 
possibilities 

interior medical laboratory day

kinderman
you this director was doing a film here burke dennings 

karras
ive seen him 

kinderman
youve seen him youre also familiar with how last week he died 

karras
only what i read in the papers 

kinderman
papers tell me what do you know about the subject of 
witchcraft from the witching end not the hunting 

karras
i once did a paper on it 

kinderman
really 

karras
from the psychiatric end 

kinderman
i know i read it these desecrations in the churchyou think 
they have anything to do with witchcraft 

karras
maybe some rituals used in black mass maybe 

kinderman
and dennings you read how he died 

karras
yeah a fall 

kinderman
let me tell you how father and please confidential burke 
dennings good father was found at the bottom of those steps 
leading to m street with his head turned completely around 
facing backwards 

karras
couldnt it of happened on the fall 

kinderman
its possible possible however 

karras
unlikely 

kinderman
exactly so on the one hand weve got a witchcraft type of murder 
and a black mass style of desecration in the church 

karras
you think the killer and the desecrator are the same 

kinderman
maybe somebody crazy someone with a spite against the church 
some unconscious rebellion perhaps 

karras
sick priest is that it 

kinderman
look father this is hard for you please but for priests on the 
campus here youre the psychiatrist youd know who was sick at 
the time who wasnt i mean this kind of sickness youd know 
that 

karras
i dont know anyone who fits the description 

kinderman
ah doctors ethics if you knew you wouldnt tell huh 

karras
no i probably wouldnt 

kinderman
not to bother you with trivia but a psychiatrist in sunny 
california was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he 
knew about a patient 

karras
is that a threat 

kinderman
no i mentioned it only in passing 

karras
incidentally i mention only in passing that i could tell the 
judge that it was a matter of confession 

karras walks off toward his dormitory and kinderman chases him 

kinderman

exterior barringer clinic day 

the leaves blow as the camera zooms in on the barringer clinic 

interior barringer clinic ward day 

clinic director
it looks like a type of disorder that you rarely ever see 
anymore except in primitive cultures 

we see regan on a monitor screen shes in another fit in bed 
and restrained by straps 

clinic director
we call it a somnambuliform possession 

we cut to another angle of regan who has slightly visible welts 
on her face shes still screaming we then cut to regan now 
flat on her back mumbling to herself 

interior barringer clinic directors office day 

clinic director
quite frankly we dont know much about it except that its 
starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the 
patients delusion that his bodys been invaded by an alien 
intellegence a spirit if you will 

chris
look im telling you again and youd better believe it im not 
about to put her in a goddamn asylum 

clinic director
its 

chris
and i dont care what you call it im not putting her away 

clinic director
im sorry 

chris
youre sorry christ eightyeight doctors and all you can tell 
me is all of your bullshit 

clinic director there is one outside chance of a cure i think 
of it as shock treatment as i say there is an outside chance 

chris
will you just name it for gods sake what is it 

male doctor
do you have any religious beliefs 

chris
no 

female doctor
what about your daughter 

chris
no why 

clinic director
have you ever heard of exorcism 

chris looks at him baffled 

clinic director
its a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive 
out the socalled invading spirit its pretty much discarded 
these days except by the catholics who keep it in the closet as 
a sort of embarrassment it has worked in fact although not for 
the reason they think of course it was purely the force of 
suggestion the victims belief in possession helped cause it 
and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can 
make it disappear 

chris
youre telling me that i should take my daughter to a witch 
doctor is that it 

the clinic director nods and looks at chris

interior macneil house kitchen day

karl

karl stands in the background chris turns to him 

chris
its okay karl 

karl exits 

kinderman
strangestrangeso baffling the deceased comes to visit 
stays only twenty minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl 
and speaking plainly mrs macneil as you say its not likely he 
would fall from a window besides that a fall wouldnt do to his 
neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand my hunch 
my opinion i believe he was killed by a very powerful man point 
one and the fracturing of the skull  point two  plus the 
various things i have mentioned would make it very probable  
probable not certain  that the deceased was killed and then 
pushed from your daughters window but noone was here except 
your daughter so how could this be it could be one way if 
someone came calling between the time miss spencer left and the 
time you returned the servants they have visitors 

chris
no not at all 

kinderman
you were expecting a deliver y that day 

chris

of regans artwork he picks up a small sculpted turtle and 
examines it 

kinderman
thats cute 

chris looks over at kinderman 

kinderman
your daughter shes the artist 

chris smiles she hands him the coffee 

kinderman
incidentally just a chance in a million i know but your 
daughter  you could possibly ask her if she saw mr dennings in 
her room that night 

chris
look he wouldnt have any reason to be up there in the first 
place 

kinderman
i know that i realize but if a certain british doctor never 
asked whats this fungus we wouldnt today have penicillin 
correct 

chris
when shes well enough ill ask 

kinderman
couldnt hurt in the meantime 

kinderman falters embarrassed 

kinderman
i hate to ask you this but for my daughter could you maybe 
give an autograph 

chris

kinderman pulls out a pen and a calling card and gives them to 
chris 

kinderman

chris
so howd a shrink ever get to be a priest 

karras
its the other way around the society sent me through med 
school

karras
harvard bellevue john hopkins

chris
about my daughter 

karras
no i didnt know you had one 

chris
he didnt mention 

karras
no 

chris
didnt tell you of what she did 

karras
he didnt mention her 

chris
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then 

karras
that depends 

chris
on what 

karras
the priest 

chris
i mean what if a person lets say was a criminal like maybe a 
murderer or something you know if he came to you for help 
would you have to turn him in 

karras
if he came to me for spritual help id say no 

chris
you wouldnt 

karras
no i wouldnt but id try to persuade him to turn himself in 

chris
and how do you go about getting an exorcism 

karras
i beg your pardon 

chris
if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go 
about getting an exorcism 

karras
well the first thing id do is put them into a time macine and 
send them back to the sixteenth century 

chris
i didnt get you 

karras
well it just doesnt happen anymore mrs macneil 

chris
oh yeah since when 

karras
since we learned about mental illness paranoia schizophrenia 
all the things they taught me in harvard mrs macneil since the 
day i joined the jesuits ive never met one priest who has 
performed an exorcism not one 

chris
yeah well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is 
probably possessed and needs an exorcist 

chris bursts into tears 

chris
father karras its my little girl 

karras grabs chris arm and walks her over to a bench they both 
sit chris is still crying 

karras
thats all the more reason to forget about exorcism 

chris
why i dont understand 

karras
to begin with it could make things worse 

chris
but how 

karras
well before the church approves an exorcism it conducts an 
investigation to see if its warranted that takes time in the 
meantime 

chris
you could do it yourself 

karras
no i couldnt i have to have church approval and frankly 
thats rarely given 

chris
could you see her 

karras
yes i could i could see her as a psychiatrist 

chris
not a psychiatrist she needs a priest shes already seen every 
fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you now 
youre gonna send me back to them jesus christ wont somebody 
help her 

karras
no you dont understand your daughter 

chris
oh will you help her just help her 

chris bursts into tears again and buries her head into karras 
shoulder karras puts his arm around her

karras stares at him then gives chris a look he plucks up his 
courage and enters the room 

interior macneil house regans bedroom day 

karras stops as he sees regan on the bed arms held down by a 
set of restraining straps it seems no longer entirley regan but 
something somehow demonic that now lies on the bed and stares at 
him her face is puffy scratched and bruised from self
mutilation there is a sustagen flask used for a nasogastric 
feeding the tube is placed up her left nostril karras is 
momentarily taken aback then reining in his revulsion he 
slowly and warily closes the door behind him and walks around 
the other side of the bed 

karras
hello regan im a friend of your mother id like to help you 

regandemon

angry stare he rises and moves to her bed side

face karras wipes it off coughing regan keeps her eyes fixed 
on him with green vomit covering her night gown 

interior macneil house basement early evening 

karras is looking through some of regans drawings chris 
approaches him with his sweater now clean she hands it to him 

karras
thanks look im only against the possibility of doing your 
daughter more harm than good 

chris
nothing you could do would make it any worse 

karras
i cant do it i need evidence that the church would accept as 
signs of possession 

chris
like what 

karras
like her speaking in a language that shes never known or 
studied 

chris
what else 

karras
i dont know ill have to look it up 

chris
i thought you were supposed to be an expert 

karras
there are no experts you probably know as much about possession 
than most priests look your daughter doesnt say shes a demon 
she says shes the devil himself and if youve seen as many 
psychotics as i have youd know its like saying youre napoleon 
bonaparte you ask me what i think is best for your daughter six 
months under observation in the best hospital you can find 

chris
you show me regans double same face same voice same 
everything id know it wasnt regan id know in my gut and im 
telling you that that thing upstairs isnt my daughter and i 
want you to tell me that you know for a fact that theres nothing 
wrong with my daughter except in her mind you tell me you know 
for a fact that an exorcism wouldnt do any good you tell me 
that

judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the ritual

 voice over 
especially important is the warning to avoid conversation with 
the demon 

interior macneil house study night 

karras and merrin are dressing in vestments taken from the case 

merrin
we may ask what is relevant but anything beyond that is 
dangerous he is a liar the demon is a liar he will lie to 
confuse us but he will also mix lies with the truth to attack 
us the attack is psychological  damien and powerful so dont 
listen remember that do not listen 

karras
i think it would be helpful if i gave you some background on the 
different personalities regan has manifested so far there seems 
to be three shes convinced 

merrin

regan spits and hits merrin in the eye with a yellowish glob of 
mucus that slowly oozes down his cheek karras quickly hides 
behind the bed post as merrin pulls out a handkerchief and 
unhurriedly wipes away the spittle 

merrin
hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on 
earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and 
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass 
against us and lead us not into temptation

the ritual

regan continues to scream at the two priests 

merrin

the clutches of the noonday devil this human being made in your 
image and likeness strike terror lord into the beast now 
laying waste your vineyard let your mighty hand cast him out of

of all creation who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp

tongue in and out at him 

merrin
and the power to confront this cruel demon 

karras

regan falls back on her pillow and begins to groan both priests 
trace the sign of the cross merrin holds his purple stole to 
regans cheek as green vomit slowly oozes from her mouth regan 
turns her head and vomits on the stole 

merrin
see the cross of the lord be gone you hostile power olord hear 
my prayer 

karras
and let my cry come unto thee 

merrin

and also with you 

merrin takes the bile covered stole from around his neck and 
hands it to karras who quickly washes it in regans bathroom we 
hear banging as cupboard doors open against the wall regan is 
flat on her back laughing wickedly merrin holds his hands to his 
ears because of the noise karras hands the stole back to merrin 
who kisses it before applying around his neck regan continues to 
laugh as merrin begins to cough violently 

merrin
i cast you out unclean spirit 

regandemon

you he who flung you from the heights of heaven to the depths of 
hell

of the cross with his fingers in her hair 

merrin
be gone in the name of the father and of the son and of the 
holy spirit by this sign of the holy cross of our lord jesus 
christ who lives and reigns with the father and the holy 
spirit 

regan sits up and with a nightmare slowness a fraction at a 
time her head begins to turn swiveling like a mannequins and 
creaking with the sound of a rusted mechanism once again 
damiens attention is diverted and merrin has to prompt him 

merrin
damien 

her head completly turns in a 360degree turn and stares at 
karras 

karras
amen 

merrin
defender of the human race 

a thunderous earthquake knock both priests to the ground 

merrin
look down in pity 

regandemon
you killed your mother you left her alone to die shell 
never forgive you bastard 

karras
shut up 

merrin
 upon this your servant regan teresa macneil 

another quake knocks them to the ground regan falls back the 
bed sheets fly off of the bed and the straps slowly rip apart 
regans eyes roll back into the socket and she slowly starts to 
levitate 

merrin
i command you by the judge of the living and the dead to depart 
from this servant of god 

regan is now levitating toward the celing arms out stretched 
like a cross 

merrin
its the power to karras holy water 

karras runs to the bedside table and grabs the bottle of holy 
water he runs back and gives it to merrin 

merrin
its the power of christ that compels you 

merrin  karras
the power of christ compels you 

merrin sprinkles holy water 

merrin  karras
the power of christ compels you 

merrin sprinkles holy water and we see a cut appear on her skin 

merrin  karras
the power of christ compels you the power of christ compels you 
the power of christ compels you the power of christ compels you 

regan begins to descend 

merrin  karras
the power of christ compels you the power of christ compels you 
the power of christ compels you the power of christ compels you 
the power of christ compels you the power of christ compels you 
the power of christ compels you 

regan lands back on the bed once more 

merrin  karras
the power of christ compels you 

karras rushes to the bed and ties her hands together to symbolize 
the cross 

merrin
he brought you low by his bloodstained cross do not despise my 
command because you no me to be a sinner its god himself who 
commands you the majestic christ who commands god the father 
commands you god the son commands you 

as karras turns away regan raises her tied hands and deals him a 
powerful blow on the back of his head he falls to the floor 

merrin
god the holy spirit commands you 

merrin sprinkles more holy water on regan she falls back and 
screams in pain 

merrin
the mystery of the cross commands you the blood of the martyrs 
commands you 

the priests are again knocked to the floor by an earthquake 
briefly regan lifts herself toward an apparition of the demon 
statue pazuzu 

merrin
give way to christ you prince of murderers youre guilty 
before almighty god guilty before his son guilty before the 
whole human race its the lord who expels you he who is coming 
to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire 

as merrin kneels by the bed karras crawls over and covers regan 
with a blanket 

merrin
are you tired 

karras nods 

merrin
lets rest before we start again 

merrin leaves the room but karras stays sat on the bed 
shivering with both coldness and fear regan is asleep 

interior macneil house second floor hallway stairs night 

an exhausted merrin and karras are sitting in the hallway on the 
stairs outside the bathroom 

karras
why this girl it makes no sense 

merrin
i think the point is to make us dispair to see our selves 
as animal and ugly to reject the possibillity that god 
could love us 

merrin
will you excuse me damien 

merrin rises and moves toward the bathroom 

interior macneil house bathroom night 

merrin sits on the toilet and takes out his pilbox he extracts a 
nitorglycerin tablet and places it under his tongue he is 
shaking with fear as he holds his head with exhaustion 

interior macneil house second floor hallway night 

karras moves back toward the bedroom and enters 

interior macneil house regans bedroom night 

karras is shocked to see an instant apparition of his mother 
laying on the bed in place of regan it vanishes he moves toward 
regan who is shivering and drenched with sweat 

reganmrs karras

karras gets out a stehoscope and places it on regans chest

phrases in greek to karras

interior macneil house foyer night 

downstairs karras sits brooding as chris enters 

chris

karras shakes his head negatively 

chris
is she gonna die 

karras
firmly
no 

he rises and starts ascending the stairs with renewed conviction 
the doorbell rings and chris moves toward the door before 
opening she applies the chain lock on she opens the door slowly 
and we see kinderman staring at her from the gap 

interior macneil house regans bedroom night 

karras reenters regans room and sees merrin face down on her 
bed regan is sitting up against the bottom right hand bed post 
as karras pulls merrin to the floor karras feels for merrins 
pulse then tries frantically to pump life back into the priest 
with blows to his chest but gives up when he realises merrin is 
dead he hears a giggle and turns to regan 

karras
you son of a bitch 

he grabs her and pulls her to the floor he begins to punch her 
in the face and head then shakes her and nearly strangles her in 
his fury 

karras
take me come into me god damn you take me take me 

a gargantuan struggle is visible in the demonic features of 
regans face his face has taken on a demonic shade and his eyes 
have turned bright green she screams out as karras body jerks 
back apparently manipulated by some inner force which now 
reaches toward regan to strangle her karras fights the force for 
control of his body and he screams compelling it toward the 
window 

karras
no 

with his last angiushed cry karras leaps out of the window we 
see him roll down the concrete steps outside and hit the floor at 
the bottom his cry was immediatly followed by frightened sobs 
and whimpers that are unmstakably those of an ordinary little 
girl 

regan
crying
mothermothermothermother 

chris rushes in and pauses to make sure that its really regan 
again shes follwed in by kinderman 

chris
rags 

she dashes over to where her daughter is cowering on the floor 
she flings herself down on top of regan cradling her and crying 
in hysterical relief as kinderman looks at karras body from the 
window looks at merrins dead body on the floor and then looks 
at chris and regan 

exterior mstreet steps night 

a crowd is gathering at the scene of an accident their 
attentionis focused by a man lying in a pool of blood on the 
pavement at the foot of the steps under regans window 

bystander
somebody fell at the bottom of the steps here 

father dyer pushes through the crowd and kneels beside karras 
fighting back tears he grasps karras hand and leans close to 
whisper in his ear 

father dyer
do you want to make your confession are you sorry his voice 
catches
are you sorry for having offended god with all the sins of your 
past life he breaks down for a moment then starts 
administiring the last rites
ego to abslovo in nomine patris et filli et spiritus sancti 
amen 

as a wailling siren signals the approach of an ambulance dyer 
weeps openly 

exterior prospect street top of steps day
