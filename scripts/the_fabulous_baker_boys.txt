	back yard turning he glances at the cake then exits


	21 	int franks hallway  early evening

	at the end of the hallway shadows cling to the ceiling
	outside the kitchen and voices can be heard  the sound
	of family as jack moves towards the light a halfopen
	door catches his eye stopping he pushes the door open
	flips on a lamp

	clippings photographs of jack and frank at every age
	always dressed alike smiling identical smiles the first
	standup is there carefully mounted and framed sheet
	music dusty and dogeared is everywhere piled in
	drunken stacks

	but most noticeable are the pianos two tiny uprights
	perfectly matched their simulated ivory keys yellowed
	with age

	jack enters and surveys all around him there is a shelf
	crowded with shot glasses from a hundred hotels and
	next to that a stack of souvenir coasters from another
	hundred seeing a tiny monkey with hula girl
	hideaway printed on its belly lighter jack gives one
	of the little plastic arms a flick and  snap  the little
	tiki torch in the other hand flames up jack lights the unlit
	cigarette in his mouth replaces the monkey

	slowly jacks eyes come back to the pianos he taps a
	key on the one nearest him and a curious expression falls
	over his face he moves to the other piano taps a key
	theyre in tune

	turning jack sees that little cindy is standing behind him
	holding a pocket radio she looks at it then takes a step
	forward and holds her arms up to him jack looks wary
	she shakes her arms impatiently and he bends down
	putting her hands on his neck she gives him a kiss then
	runs out of the room

					donna

	monica smiles she likes jack

					frank
			well shall we

	probably not but jack begins to play anyway swinging
	her arms and tapping her foot monica gets a feel for the
	rhythm then launches in   between beats  so that jack
	has to scramble over a chord to rescue her

					monica
			who can take a sunrise
			sprinkle it with dew
			toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie
			the candy man can
			the candy man can

	there would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
	mother of monica nee blanch opposes her daughters
	career

					frank
			thank you miss moran thats enough

	monica  eyes closed arms flung wide  is fully caught
	up in the moment frank looks at jack jack shrugs and
	continues to play

					monica
			oh sorry i get so caught up in it sometimes its
			 scary

					frank
			yes it is

	unique interpretations of

	a feelings

	b i gotta be me sung by twins

	c this is my song and perhaps most appropriately

	d “what kind of fool am i”

	smoking nervously offstage susie checks her wrists
	which is fitted with tiny cards each containing the lyrics
	to a song

					frank
			as far as i’m concerned she couldn’t have chosen

	trying to free it but pulls so hard that the rubber band
	holding the cards snaps

	she’s frozen stiff

	to him as all heads swivel to jack

			“i’m one of those lady teachers
			a beautiful hostess you know
			one that the palace features
			at exactly a dime a throw”

	jack’s voice  damning evidence that he and frank are
	related  brings susie around she takes the next lines
	right out of frank’s mouth

					susie
			“ten cents a dance
			that’s what they pay me
			gosh how they weigh me down

			ten cents a dance
			pansies and rough guys
			tough guys who tear my gown”

	compared to what preceded her susie sounds like
	streisand the audience  bewildered but oddly charmed
	 applauds spontaneously the effect on susie is
	immediate hitting on all cylinders now she grips the
	microphone like a trophy

					susie
			“seven to midnight i hear drums
			loudly the saxophone blows
			trumpets are tearing my eardrums
			customers crush my toes

			“sometimes i think i’ve found my hero

	love” while jack and frank underscore her voice with
	lush phrasings the atmosphere is dreamlike hypnotic

	almost too good to be true


	72	ext frank and jack’s terrace – night later

	susie glances at jack

					jack
			the mood just hit me

					frank
			hey “moonglow”

	frank turns up the volume of the radio and looks at
	jack with a smile jack shoots him a warning glance

					susie
			“moonglow”

					frank
			high school formal i didn’t know how to dance
			jack did the boxstep with me for a week

					jack
			it wasn’t a week it was an afternoon

					susie

					frank
			worth every penny it was my first big social
			with donna we fell in love on the dance floor
			 i have a beautiful wife two beautiful children

					jack
			i think you’re overestimating the boxstep

	suddenly frank slips into susie’s arms and begins to
	dance with her humming to the radio susie laughs then
	goes with him jack takes a sip of champagne watching

					frank
			it was just like this on our honeymoon the moon
			the stars remember jack

			i am i am a lucky guy she could’ve married
			anyone but she chose me
				to susie
			you know i’ve never kissed my wife on new

			somewhere

	this seems to make frank a little melancholy and he
	almost stops dancing finally he pulls away

					frank
			i think i’m drunk you two dance i gonna go
			sit with the wallflowers

	as frank turns susie toward jack they glance at each
	other awkwardly

					susie
			i don’t know i’m not used to leading

					frank
			come on jack give the girl a glide

					susie
			i think maybe your little brother prefers to dance
			alone

	susie smiles slightly offers jack a cigarette

					jack
			no thanks i never touch french cigarettes

	susie’s drunk enough that this tickles her a bit jack steps
	forward and takes her hand and they begin to move

					susie
			your brother’s a pretty good dancer

					frank
			big heartbreaker never had to say a word
			couple turns on the dance floor and that was it

					susie
				amused

					susie
			how thrilling

					jack
			frank why don’t you have another drink

	frank grabs a bottle and disappears into the bedroom

					susie

					jack
			i think you’re safe

	jack presses in closer moving smoothly to the music

					susie
			so where do you keep all your blue ribbons
			baker

					jack
			frank keeps them

	jack slides his hand  a little lower on susie’s back

					susie
			nice night huh

					jack
			hmhm

	susie swallows melting into the rhythm of jack’s
	movements into his body drifting to the purr of the
	music swirling under the stars suddenly she dips in
	a little quivering motion and jack catches her

					jack
			careful

	susie looks a little shocked by her body’s betrayal she
	separates from jack and takes a step back

					susie
			i i think i’ve had too much to drink champagne
			goes right to my head

					jack
			maybe we should call it a night

	susie nods a smile flickers on jack’s lips then he turns
	away susie looks down

	at her knees


	73	int frank and jack’s room  next morning

	seemingly empty both beds unmade and unoccupied a

	opposite end

	susie’s pov

	as eddie disappears into the grand dining room curious
	she follows as she draws closer the sound of a piano
	becomes clear peering inside she finds jack playing
	alone at one of the grands onstage


	76	int “king’s manor” dining room  morning

	in the vast emptiness of the room the piano resonates
	powerfully and the music jack makes is like nothing
	we’ve heard him play before fluid and unpredictable it
	is played with the focused abandon of a jazz hand susie
	watches transfixed

	as he finishes jack notices susie but says nothing
	instead pouring himself another glass of whiskey and
	starting to play again

					susie
			working overtime

					jack
			i like the crowd

	susie smiles slightly

					jack
				the roses
			win a pageant

					susie
			first runnerup story of my life

	jack doesn’t react just keeps playing susie drops the
	flowers onto a table and walks over to the piano

					susie
			what’s this you’re playing

					jack
				shrugging
			just thinking out loud

					susie
			nice

					jack
			hm

	susie watches jack’s hand glide deftly over the keys
	then looks at his face he is oblivious to all but the sounds
	he is making

					susie
				quietly
			nice


	77 	int kings manor lobby  morning

	frank steps out of the elevator looking like a man with
	the worst hangover in history

			training wheels are removed hes locked himself
			in the bathroom and he has cindy with him hes

			corner if you like

	frank nods wearily he goes to the phone begins to dial
	then hears the sound of jacks piano hanging up the
	phone he wanders down to the dining room and looks
	inside


	78	int dining room  morning

	susie is leaning over the piano smoking a cigarette a
	shoe dangling from her toe as she watches jack play
	there is something intimate in her posture

	there is something about it frank doesn’t like


	79	int “king’s manor” backstage  night

	as jack smokes calmly frank paces tensely he takes a
	few steps glances at jack then resumes pacing stops
	looks at jack again

					frank

	jack looks at frank puzzled

					frank
			jack this isn’t some hatcheck girl you can leave
			behind at the sheraton you got two shows a

	as jack realises what frank means his eyes harden

					jack
			you don’t know what you’re talking about

			i know trouble and its name starts with an “s”

					jack
			do me a favour frank relax

					frank

					jack
			so what do you want to open with tonight


	103	int “king’s manor” dining room  night

	a banner stretched between two chandeliers proclaims
	“happy new year” as the camera descends
	jack can be heard picking out a familiar tune but
	showering it in blue notes drawing it out giving it
	smoke

	susie’s face drifts up into frame her eyes closed
	but the camera continues to drop moving like
	syrup down her body over the silk that clings to her hips
	and thighs down her legs to a pair of wicked
	archbreaking heels

	she’s standing on jack’s steinway

					susie
				cooing
			“another bride
			another june
			another sunny honeymoon
			another season
			another reason
			to make whoopie”

	caught somewhere between ray charles and marilyn
	monroe susie’s voice slides silkily from a whisper to a
	growl her fingers running like sand over her body

					susie
			“a lot of shoes
			a lot of rice
			the groom is nervous
			he answers twice
			it’s really killin’
			the boy’s so willin’
			to make whoopie”

	as jack knocks hell out of the bridge susie melts onto
	the piano like a kitten stretching out languorously on her
	back on the dance floor men in tuxedos sneak guilty
	glances while their wives just stare mouths agape in less
	that a minute susie’s managed to turn a dignified resort
	hotel into a sizzling roadhouse

					susie
			“picture a little lovenest
			down where the roses cling
			picture that same sweet lovenest
			see what a year can bring
				toying with jack’s chin
			i tell you the boy’s washing dishes
			baby clothes
			he’s so ambitious
			ooooh i tell you he sews”

	susie runs her fingers through jack’s hair and slides
	ohsoslowly off the piano slinking toward the audience
	and suddenly it’s apparent she’s winning them over

					susie
			it’s really killin’
			the boy’s so willin’
			to make whoopee”


	104	int dining room  night hours later

	now a mass of swarming jubilation suddenly the
	lights begin to dim

					susie
			all right boys and girls find a friend this is it
			ten nine

	gradually the entire room joins the chant

					susieeveryone
			 eight seven six five four three two
			one happy new year

	a blizzard of confetti fills the air as people scramble for
	that certain someone to kiss in the new year in this
	moment jack and susie find themselves oddly distanced
	from the happiness below them

	susie glances at jack then finally goes to him as their
	lips touch they kiss lightly then pull away awkwardly
	as susie turns away jack sounds the first chord of
	“auld lang syne” and the room rises as one voice

					susieeveryone
			“should old acquaintance be forgot”


	105 	int dining room  night hours later

	dark and lonely now the tables and floors covered with
	confetti like virgin snow jack sits on a table looking
	out at the moonlit ocean susie comes up behind him
	carrying a halfempty bottle of champagne

					susie
			so make any resolutions

	jack shakes his head susie sits down on the table next
	to him their arms almost touching

					jack
			you

					susie
			nah i figure that stuff’s all a bunch of crap
			anyway you do what you do right

					jack
			right

	susie takes a drink looks over at the empty stage

					susie
			boy ol’ egghead would’ve blown a gasket if
			he’d seen us tonight wouldn’t he

	jack just takes a drag on his cigarette says nothing

					susie
			you’re good aren’t you

	as jack looks up susie’s eyes shift staring straight
	into his

					jack
			i can carry a tune

					susie
			better than that

	jack just looks out the window again takes another drag
	on his cigarette susie studies his face then pushes off the
	table walks over to the window

					susie
			you know i saw you guys once you and frank
			at the roosevelt

					jack
			must’ve been a cheap date

					susie

	jack glances over at susie

					jack

					susie
			yeah they got a convention for everything this
			guy was some big roller in suds at least he was
			clean some of the guys i met through the service
			you wouldn’t believe the older ones they were
			okay nice polite pulled the chair out for you
			but the younger ones

	jack watches as susie takes another hit off the bottle

					susie
			it wasn’t so bad though i’d get a nice piece of
			steak flowers sometimes even a gift usually
			whatever the guy was into got a set of socket
			wrenches once believe it the guy looked like
			he’d just given me four dozen roses

	susie smiles to herself then her face changes becomes
	almost wistful

					susie
			but i stayed at the hartford once you should see
			the rooms all satin and velvet and the bed royal
			blue trimmed in lace clean as snow hard to
			believe sleeping in a room like that don’t change
			your life but it don’t the bed may be magic but
			the mirror isn’t you wake up the same old susie
				pause
			i didn’t always you know if i liked the guy

	susie glances at jack uncomfortable

					jack
			i never liked the hartford much myself

	susie’s eyes lock into jack’s then she turns a little and
	starts to roll her neck

					susie
			my neck is so tight usually singing relaxes me
			but i don’t know tonight

	jack watches her a moment then stands up and sweeps
	the hair off her shoulder placing his hands on her neck
	massaging the muscles softly she swallows

					susie
			thanks

	jack hesitates then unhooks the catch letting the panels
	divide a bit

					susie
			thanks

	as jack’s fingers work down to susie’s shoulders the
	dress begins to divide slowly the fabric pulling silently
	apart susie turns her head a little just as jack’s fingers
	slip under the silk skimming down her sides just below
	her breasts he leans in and kisses her neck

					susie
			oh shit

	from one side of the bedroom door frame to the other
	droops with paper letters “welcome home”

	in the kitchen jack opens the refrigerator a container
	of cottage cheese two desperate bananas one beer
	opting for the beer he goes to the piano by the window
	sits down

	he taps out a skeleton phrase teases it then like the
	morning susie found him in the dining room begins to
	expand on the idea filling the room with music


	113a	ext diner  day

	in the front window the usual photos of celebrity patrons

	114	int diner  day same

	susie and the brothers sit at a table strews with empty
	coffee cups and halfeaten food frank has several slips
	of paper before him with names and dates

					frank
			that takes care of the week of the fifth after that
			we got the avedon downtown or the plaza four
			day turns what do you think jack

	jack is staring out the window bored

					jack
			you with me jack

					susie
			the avedon’s a dump no cover no minimum
			and they water their drinks it’s strictly for the
			fuller brush crowd

	susie as she says this pours sugar into her coke

					frank
				watching
			it’s not that bad besides blackie carson books
			the avedon he’s always been good to us

					jack
				drily
	he’s hasn’t been that good to us

					frank
			all right we’ll take the plaza after that we’re
			locked into the capri for five days then we got
			our choice

					susie
			the capri oh christ not the goddamn luau
			lounge again

					frank
			what’s the matter with the luau lounge they
			don’t salt their peanuts

					susie
			singing “feelings” knee deep in paper orchids
			and plastic tiki lamps isn’t exactly my idea of a
			fun evening

					frank
			fun who promised you fun we get paid
			remember

					susie
			i’m just saying maybe we should vote on it or
			maybe we should ask jack what he thinks

					frank
			i don’t have to ask jack what he thinks i know
			what he thinks

	jack hearing this shifts his eyes coolly to frank

					frank
			it’s five days the money’s green we’re there

	susie looking tense watches frank go back to his slips
	jack taps an unlit cigarette on the table

					frank
			and by the way speaking of  “feelings” you
			might think about brushing up on the lyrics the
			other night at the resort you sang the first verse
			twice

					susie
			really that must explain the gasp i heard from
			the audience

					frank
			okay let’s hear it we’ve trashed the avedon and
			the luau lounge what’s our beef with
			“feelings”

					susie
			nothing

	frank nods starts to go back to the slips

					susie
			except who cares i mean does anybody
			really need to hear “feelings” again in their
			lifetime it’s like parsley
				taking a sprig from her plate
			take it away and no one would know the
			difference

					frank
			“feelings” is not parsley

					susie
			to you “feelings” may be goddamn filet mignon
			to me it’s parsley less that parsley

	jack mildly amused settles against the window to listen

					frank
			look “feelings” despite what you may think of
			it has always been one of the bright moments in
			the show and a consistent crowd pleaser
			consequently we have an obligation to play it if
			we didn’t the audience would be disappointed

					susie
			yeah well they weren’t exactly crying their eyes
			out on new year’s

	frank stops shuffling the slips looks up slowly

					frank
			you passed over “feelings”

					susie
			yeah and for your information “bali hai” went
			out with the bathwater too

	frank looks from susie to jack

					frank
			well i see the cat goes away for a night and the
			mice take over the orchestra

					susie
			hey i ain’t no mouse

					frank
			that’s right you’re parsley

	big silence

					jack
			i think you better calm down frank

					frank
			i think you better make sure it’s your head that’s
			doing the thinking these days little brother

	susie stands up takes her coat

					susie
			this food’s been sitting here too long it’s starting
			to make me feel sick

	susie turns and slams out the door

					jack
			why don’t you loosen the leash

					frank
			let’s not let a whiff of perfume blow off fifteen
			years be reasonable jack

					jack
			i play three hundred nights a years with you
			frank how much more reasonable you expect me
			to be

	frank stares at jack for a moment then turns back to the
	boxes

					frank
			if you see anything you want take it

	jack stands there staring at his brother’s back defeated
	he starts to leave then something catches his eye from a
	dusty shelf he pulls out a bottle

					jack
			okay if i take this

	as frank turns jack tosses the bottle to him hard frank
	scrambles to catch it then looks at it it’s the bottle from
	the photograph in jack’s apartment

					jack
			come on frank i’m trying

	frank looks up reacting to the nakedness of jack’s
	statement then looks at the bottle it seems to hold some
	special magic for him

					jack
			how’re your hands

					frank
			my hands are fine don’t worry about my hands
			and don’t worry about me i don’t need this any
			more than you do little brother we both know i
			can make just as much teaching “campdown
			races” to these snotty kids in the neighbourhood
			as being a lounge rat don’t kid yourself

	jack just nods frank studies him for a long moment then
	looks at the bottle again finally making a decision he
	flips it back to jack

					frank
			open it

	jack just looks at him

					frank
			open the fucking bottle

	as jack holds the bottle carefully he watches frank grab
	a handful of souvenir shot glasses

					frank

			we got the travelodge on 410 and the mallory

					jack
			i’ll take the mallory

					frank
			forget it i want the mallory you take the
			travelodge

	jack smiles slightly and takes the glass as he and frank
	settle on the tiny piano benches frank notices the dust on
	the glasses

					frank
			looks like these got a few years on them

					jack
			this’ll kill ‘em

	frank nods jack hesitates then breaks the seal on the
	bottle pours as they swallow each grimaces looks at
	the other

					jackfrank
				in unison
			not bad

	it suddenly grows silent each sitting in his old familiar
	place staring into his glass

					jack
			how come you keep them in tune

	frank looks suprised then shrugs

					frank
			habit

	frank looks at his glass and his mind leads him to
	something uncomfortable

					frank
			maybe this is horrible i mean i know it’s like
			breathing to you but sometimes when i was up
			there with you playing it was almost like i had it
			too that feeling

	jack glances at frank he looks old sitting on the tiny
	bench suddenly frank lifts his glass eyes the tiny hotel
	rendered there

					frank
			jesus when was the last time we played the
			mallory

					jack
				thinking
			‘78 november

					frank
			right it was someone’s birthday halloran

					jack
			daughter sweet sixteen

					frank
			christ that’s right how could i forget what a
			nightmare

					jack
			she asked for it

					frank
			i told halloran we didn’t do vocals but he said 

					jack and frank
				in unison
			“what my sissy wants my sissy gets”

					jack
			she got it alright

	jack and frank glance at one another little boy mischief
	glowing in their faces suddenly they swivel on the
	pianos and begin to play “you’re sixteen”

					jack and frank
				singing
			“she comes on like a dream
			peaches and cream
			lips like strawberry wine
			she’s sixteen she’s beautiful
			and she’s mine

			ribbons and curls
			ooh what a girl
			eyes that sparkle and shine
			you’re sixteen you’re beautiful
			and you’re mine”

	as jack and frank finish they’re laughing after a moment
	their voices die and the room is quiet again full of ghosts
	each stares at the tiny keyboard before him awkward with
	the intimacy of the moment is quiet for a very long time
	finally frank looks over

					frank
			well one more time

	jack glances up and sees that frank has his empty glass
	held out he picks up the bottle and pours

					jack
			one more time

			fade out
