bag entranced by the sight  a skeletal hand falls on his shoulder  omar
turns to an ancient priest in a rough milled black cannock

						priest

	startled but obedient omar gives the water bag to the priest

						priest
				go with god be safe from evil

	the priest makes the sign of the cross on the boys forehead dismissing

from the skin

				the implications

						priest
				only too well here you must be
				parched

	he hands the cup to the professor  the professor takes it has it almost
to his lips when

						professor
				i mean look it is like a battle plan

	in his excitement he does not drink much to the priests chagrin

						professor

	the professor raises the cup to drink and then

						professor
				we cannot toast with water billy 
				in my sack the grappa

	the priest watches disconsolate as the professor tosses away his water
billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel

4	ext  colonnade  day

	a muffled sound grows steadily louder outside a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kids game and gradually darkens the temple entrance

5	int  tunnel  day

	billy is looking for the grappa in the professors bag  he comes upon a
machine pistol  when the muffled sound suddenly grabs his attention  he
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear  billy is
paralyzed

6	int  temple  room  day

	the professor keeps reading over the inscription

						professor
				this perfect person this perfect
				being i do not understand this perfect

						professor
				where is that boy billy

7	int  tunnel  day

	billy presses himself against the wall in the shadows terrified but
sketching away like mad as large shadowed figures lumber past him  he
begins to blink feeling the effects of the priests potion

8	int  temple  room  day

	the professor reads the wall

						professor
				and this divine light they talk
				about what is divine light

	at that moment the reflection from azizs mirror drops again  the light
fails

						professor
					without turning
				aziz light

	the room is flooded with light all of the sudden

						professor
				better this is the most unbelievable thing
				i have ever seen

	the professor turns around and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two mondoshawans  a dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light large luminous globes  aziz is fast asleep

						professor
					uncomprehending
				uh yes

	the professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens
the kommander stops in front of the priest who is still on his knees face
to the ground

						priest
				master he was about to discover everything
				but i had the situation under control

	the two mondoshawan guards hold the professor three feet off the ground

						professor
					in a panic
				who are you  are you germans  sprechen

9	int  tunnel

	billy staggers forward a machine pistol in his hand

10	int  temple  room

	the kommander holds out his hand to the priest

						priest
				what did i do wrong

	the priest jumps to his feet excitedly

						kommander
				servant you and the thousand guards
				before you you have done your work well
				but we have to recover the elements war will
				soon engulf your planet we must keep them safe

	the kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock
he finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe  he turns his hand activating a mechanism that opens
the wall

						professor
				unbelievable

	the kommander turns around and crooks a finger  one of the mondoshawans
	waves his hand puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening  he is followed by his men  the priest slips in
behind them

11	int  room 2  temple  day

	the kommander steps into a vast room  the ceiling is very high pyramid
shaped  in each corner of the room four vessels contain four
rectangular twelveinch stones the four elements  in the middle an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar  the kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment

						priest
					to himself
				the fifth element

						kommander
				take them and put them in a safe place

	his men carry out his order

12	int  room 1  temple  day

	billy staggers across the floor struggling to stay awake

13	int  room 2  temple  day

	the kommander opens a case  his men come and put the four precious
stones in it one by one

						priest
					moved
				will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place

						kommander
				when mankind comes to its senses
				we will return

						priest
				knowing mankind as i do that could take
			centuries

						kommander
				time is of no importance only life
				is important

	the priest nods and lowers his eyes

	angle on  billy staggering forward raising his pistol blinking his
eyes to focus

	a mondoshawan puts the fourth element in the case the kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the priest

						kommander
				when evil returns so shall we

						priest
					head lowered
				we will be ready lord

	billy suddenly staggers into the room brandishing his gun

						billy
				stop

	billy trips the gun goes off  he empties the clip  the mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground  the wall immediately begins to
close  billy fires wildly unable to control the powerful kicking gun

						priest
				no  dont

	the priest rushes billy  the weapon has such a kick to it that billy
starts shooting into the air backs up then stumbles and knocks himself
out  the priest is on the ground seriously wounded  so is the kommander
the warriors are in a panic

						clerk
				hurry kommander  the walls closing

	the wall continues to close  sand pours in from everywhere  the vast
room fills up like an hourglass

						kommander
				a mission is a mission savoia
				youll learn that

	the kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but cant get
through it  his
	armor is too bulky the opening too small  he manages to get his arm and
the case through

						kommander

						president
				gentlemen

						head chemists
				i think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive without first
				taking the time to study it more
				besides it has shown no signs of hostility

						president
					worried
				no its just getting bigger

						head chemists
				so do people but thats no reason to shoot
				them

						president

						priest
				cornelius vito cornelius 50th level parish
				i have a different theory to offer you
				mr president

						president
				im listening

						cornelius
				imagine for a moment that this thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are
				because it is evil total evil

						president
					a little sarcastically
				one more reason to shoot first eh

	all the generals nod in agreement

						cornelius
				evil begets evil mr president
				shooting would only make it stronger

				time is of no importance mr president
				only life is important

						president
					exasperated
				thats exactly what we are going to try and do

small flame appears on the tip  a breeze goes through the room  korben
feels like hes got tnt in his hands  he approaches the flame to the stone

of miniature fire appears korben sighs snuffs out the match  the fourth

the temple floor and begins to smoke eating away at it like acid  loc
rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff  korben quickly straightens
leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams

						korben
				leeloo if you dont get on with the
				program were all gonna die and thats

	 korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like hes never kissed
anybody before   the white beam the divine light immediately forms
around leeloo and korben  the stopwatch hits zero   the absolute beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle slowing it down   korben and leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow

	 the beam hardens and slowly solidifies the evil planet  inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet  screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying

	 streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites

remain stuck together lost in their kiss  cornelius has dropped to his

smile

kissing

of officials in ceremonial dress

to see what is going on under the blue shield

	leeloo and korben are naked arms wrapped around each other kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa
	mactilburgh looks troubled
