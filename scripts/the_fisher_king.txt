        his chair as a radio commercial begins

        his expression seems grave  not one you would expect
        after a successful broadcast  he appears tired and
        annoyed  he sighs in relief that it is over  the studio
        team work around him in silence  with no indication of
        the relationship they have on air  jack pulls out a
        bottle of aspirins and takes two

                         continuing annoyed

                  my fucking ass is freezing for the
                  first hour

        techy suppresses a laugh

        over his shoulder a homemade bow and arrow set

        is mumbling to himself incoherently another bum appears from

        bum stepping out of the dark menacingly

        taken by themselves the bums would look harmless and pathetic
        but in the context of their uncharacteristic organization 
        they appear frightening

        leather and windbreaker automatically whip out switchblades
        and take a rumble stance  as if protecting their
        catch jack jack sort of sides with them if for no other
        reason than  hes known them longer

        leather tries to remain confident he laughs

        jack stands close to leather and windbreaker who prepare
        themselves for attack

        parry lowers his hand which acts as a signal for the bums
        the bums reach into their coats and each pull out a flashlight
        which they shine at each other as they sing

                                     three bums

        jack leather and windbreaker are at a loss the bums arent
        getting all the words but theyre definitely in sync

        parry lowers his hand proudly the bums keep singing and turn
        their flashlights upon jack leather and windbreaker  blinding
        them to parry

                   shit

        thinks parry stands but parry takes a flying step back
        as he speaks the bums stop singing andhumthe song

        gaining force

                                     parry

        the sock flies out of the darkness and with amazing
        accuracy  beans leather on the forehead between his eyes he
        drops his knife to rub his head he sinks out of camera

                                     leather
                   owowow

        windbreaker grows worried as parry reaches in to the lining
        of his coat pulls out another sock weapon and starts swinging

                                     parry
                   however the ability to bean
                   a shithead can be a fabulous advantage

        windbreaker runs to the car and drives away
        parry crosses to a speechless jack

                                     parry
                      picking up leathers knife

                                     parry
                   oh beings blind what ignorance besets you

        parry kneels down pulls out some rope from his coat and proceeds
        to tie up leather who is disoriented and dazed parry hands

                                     parry
                      pulls down leathers pants exposing his butt
                   you wont be alone for long

        parry pulls out a triangle and begins ringing it

        ext a lot beneath the manhattan bridge  night

        a violent explosion between warring factions of bums who
        are defending territories and rights

                                                     cut to

        scene  a black a middleaged irishman and an exhippy 
        and the pinnochio doll  the foursome sit against the giant
        base of the bridge discussing the issues of the day as they pass
        a bottle other bum cliques are scattered throughout the lot

                                     irishman
                      explaining further
                   he gets to kill him  thats democracy see

        a lull takes over as they all consider this
        jack sitting the furthest apart from the group looks like hes
        in the middle of a nightmare

                                     jack
                     mumbles to himself
                   this is it im in hell damned to
                   an eternity of idiotic conversation

                                     parry
                      leans in and smiles
                   great place huh

        the irishman lets out a bloodcurtling scream

                                     parry
                      responds
                   aaaahhhh

        jack jumps irishman looks to parry  speaks in calm monotone

                                     irishman

                                     irishman
                   cant complain

        the irishman absent mindedly flicks his cigarette ashes onto
        jacks sleeve which is soaked with gasoline the sleeve ignites
        jack panics  waving his is arm trying to get it out
        parry is both amazed and impressed  seeing it as a sign
        the bums talk casually as jack tries to rip off his coat

                                     black
                   crazy fuck

                   no fucking gift  lifes too goddamn short

        with the fire out jack tries to leave saying

                   have a drinkdont be shy
                      jack sits quickly

                                     parry
                   i think they like you

        this worries jack parry retrieves him and brings him back
        to the group

        the irishman removes the bottle from his saliva soaked mouth and
        hands it to jack who is disgusted

                                     jack
                   oh no thats all

                                     black
                   drink goddamn it

        jack grabs the bottle and drinks  holding back his nausea

                                     parry
                   would anyone like a fruit pie

                   no thank youtoo sweetto fatteninggoddamn it

        jack feels sick as the cheap liquor running through him
        irishman begins reciting a chaucer passage in old english
        the black stares off half listening parry turns to jack
        his face beaming he clasps his hands and says

                                     parry
                   et in arcadia ego

                   manwhy did god invent mediocrity

        this remark acts like a slap in the face to jack the others
        consider it in silence  not really knowing what it means
        the cheap liquor begins to take its effect and from jacks pov
        we fade out of the scene on the next lines  as he close his eyes
        and slips into a drunken slumber

                                     hippie oc
                   you were phenominal tonight parry

                                                     fadeout

        fadeup on

        int parrys basement hideaway  morning

        jack is asleep on a mattress beside a boiler spewing steam
        he is slowly awakened by water dripping on his cheek  
         the first dull pangs of a mean hangover making itself known

        he opens his eyes confused  not knowing exactly what
        happened

                                                   cut to

        the giant face of parry

        lying parallel beside him  like a kid waiting for his
        parents to wake up xmas morning

                                parry
                         loud and cheery
                  how are you feeling

        jarred jack nods suspiciously  he notices the
        surroundings 

                                jack
                  have i died

                                parry
                         friendly
                  hahahahaaa nononono not yet
                  hahahaha

                                jack
                         his head throbbing
                  if youre going to murder me thats
                  fine just dont laugh

        he tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room
        there is an extremely organized living area  a make
        shift kitchen with hot plate a nail in a wall with
        clothes on hangers there is also a dumpster sitting
        beneath a garbage chute  the dumpster has planets and
        stars painted on its side

        jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage
        mural  pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard
        manner all medieval in origin grassy landscape with
        castles knights and maidens on horses crests and
        symbols of the crusades and various renditions of the
        holy grail one maiden stands out from the rest  a
        frail looking doelike creature

        on the adjacent wall however there are no pictures
        only frantic scribblings in red marker out of the
        scribblings we can see  an evil looking face with a bear
        amateurishly drawn a large red horse drawn as if it
        hurt to get out the image the style is violent and
        erratic

        jack looks to the other wall and finds parrys arsenal
         homemade weapons that also look medieval like
        lances made from mop sticks nets made of knotted rope
        slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover
        with a rose painted on it  against each wall are piled
        what seems to be hundreds of books  jack doesnt know
        what to make of all this  he is frightened

                                jack
                  where am i

                  sshhhh

        parry looks like hes listening to someone  then he
        smiles broadly at jack which makes jack worry even more

                                parry
                         continuing to the
                          air

        he kneels beside jack which makes jack lean up against
        the boiler

                                parry
                         continuing
                   can you keep a secret

        jack shakes his head

                                parry
                         continuing
                  do you know what the little people
                  just told me

                                jack
                  the little people

                                parry
                  they said youre the one

                                parry
                         stands abruptlyoh shut up

        he picks up a can of wintergreen air freshener and starts
        spraying with violent strokes to shut them up jack
        gets more nauseous from the smell parry yells to the
        air

                                parry
                         continuing

                  hands here

                         to himself
                  now where are those shoes

        jack makes a move to stand when parry stops spraying and
        yells

                                parryhheeyy

        jack sits back down  parry whispers to the air

                                parry
                         continuing
                   youre frightening him

        parry kneels before him  jack presses against the
        boiler

                                parry
                         continuing
                   do you know who i am

                         shouts to the airlet him guesstch

        he goes for the air freshener but jacks reply stops him

        jacks face drops  parry gets comfortable and explains
        casually

                                parry

                          intellectual
                  but i dont think god made man in his
                  own image  no  cause most of
                  the bullshit that happens is because
                  of men  no i think man was made out
                  of the devils image and women were
                  created out of god  because women
                  can have babies which is sorta like
                  creating and which also explains why
                  women are attracted to men because
                  lets face it the devil is a helluva
                  lot more interesting  i slept with
                  a few saints and let me tell youbooooorring and so the whole
                  point of life i think is for men
                  and women to get married so the devil
                  and god can live together and ya
                  know  work it out

        the gay bum jack stands a safe distance away unable to
        take his eyes off the scene before him  seated against the
        wall are an assortment of derelicts drunks screaming withdrawl
        victims and jacketed schizophrenics jack has a hard time moving

                                     parry
                      to jack referring to gay bum
                   will you watch him for a minute

        before jack can respond parry shifts the gay bums body
        into jacks arms then moves about the room introducing
        himself to the various patients as jack watches he moves
        down the linesaying hello wiping peoples brows
        holding the hands of an angry bag lady mumbling incoherently
        smiling and saying hello to each one no matter how frightening
        they seem  he appears to have a soothing affect

                      the gay bum cries in frustration

        jack stares at him at a complete loss for a response

                   i wanna diei just wanna die

        jack against all better judgement pats the bums hand in
        comfort unexpectedly the gay bum leans his head on jacks
        shoulder and cries jack wideeyed with embarassment looks
        over to parry

                   what does all of this really mean
                      jack nods in a knowing metaphysical aggreement
                   that and the fact that all my friends are
                   deadgod i sound like a veteran
                   dad would be so proud

        at that moment a pizza boy enters making a delivery

                                     pizza boy
                   pizza

        suddenly doctors and nurses appear out of the wood work and
        swarm around the delivery boy

        int grand central station a bank  rush hour

        parry and jack sit on the floor enjoying a cup of coffee
        a vietnam vet in a wheelchair with no legs sits near the opposite
        wall along with at least fifteen other homeless beggers

        another man sits against a cash machine crying a woman passes
        by and drops some change in the vets cup without saying
        a word the vet sid smiles broadly

                                sidgod bless youhave a nice day

                  ya hear jimmy nickels got picked up
                  yesterday

        parry is too busy scanning the grand central main floor
        to answer  realizing parry isnt answering jack feels
        obliged to pick up the conversation

                                jack
                  oh yeah

                                sid

                  anarchy when people start pissing on
                  bookstores

        jack smiles at this observation  he then tries to get
        parrys attention

                                 jack
                  youll never see her in this crowd

        parry doesnt answer  he looks like a dog waiting for
        its master  people walk by jack at a frantic pace  he
        sits uncomfortably against a wall  a man almost steps on
        him as he walks by and tosses a coin at sid missing the
        cup and forcing sid to bend over jack picks the coin
        up for him

                                sid
                  bless you

                  every day and for eight hours seven
                  days a week he bends over and gets
                  it right up the ass till he cant
                  stand

        parry stands up and begins pacing before the main floor

                                sid
                         continuing
                   but one day right before
                  quitting time on friday his boss is
                  going say something like say bob 
                  come into my office and kiss my

                  stab him with these pair of
                  scissors

        parry looks at the clock above the information booth 
        500

                                sid
                         continuing
                   but then he thinks of me  wait
                  a minute he says its not so
                  bad  at least i got two arms and two
                  legs and i aint beggin for money
                  he puts down the scissors and
                  puckers up

        jack is impressed with this man

                                sid
                         continuing

                                sid
                         continuing smiles with

        int grand central station  photo lab  rush hour

        margaret a black woman in a paisley kaften stands near
        a photo lab across from jack and sid  with a box in
        front of her for donations she starts singing song to
        be chosen  some rush hour commuters stop to listen
        her voice is strong and soulful she performs
        uninhibitedly

                                sid
                  you have to admit though like at
                  500 in grand central pretty
                  breathtaking dont cha think

        jack looks around this mad rush hour scene taking it in
        through sids eyes parry however keeps his gaze on
        the main floor  suddenly he spots her

                                                   cut to


        int grand central station  main floor

        hordes of people are moving in every which way
        zigzagging across the floor lydia moves through the
        crowd avoiding touching anyone


        parry

        camera pans in slowly as we hear margarets song os
        the closer the camera gets to parry the more her song
        changes at first a blend of two melodies that sound
        distruptive cachophonous but as parry smiles with
        joy his song overtakes margarets it is a waltz

                                                   cut to


        main floor  parrys pov

        the hordes of people continue their zigzagging for a beat
        then

        suddenly they pair up and waltz around the main floor
        circling around the center information booth

        only lydia remains walking  gliding through the dancers
        with grace and ease

        parry watches in a state of rapture  moving as she
        moves to keep her in eye view as long as possible

                                                   cut to


        jack

        listening to margarets song taking in the scene around
        him watching people listen to her song while others
        walk by as if they were deaf and blind

        feeling strangely at ease strangely apart of everyone
        around him  a group of lost souls listening to a woman
        bare her soul in song  he looks to spot parry rises and
        crosses to him

                                                   cut to


        main floor

        parry watches as lydia exits the main floor the waltz
        has ended just as jack speaks his line

                                jack
                  its such a great song

                                parry
                         referring to his own
                          song
                  its a classic

        jack looks in the direction of parrys stare and sees
        lydia exit

                                parry
                         continuing
                  god  just one night with her  id
                  die happy

        jack hears this as if a light bulb went off above his
        head

                                                   cut to

        int lydias apartment  dusk

        a door opens  lydia enters with a bag of groceries she
        picked up on the way  she turns on the light to reveal
        an extremely neat albiet modest one bedroom apartment
        she carries the grocery bag into the kitchen

        out of the bag she removes a lean cuisine a giant
        bottle of cream soda and four giant bars of chunky
        chocolate  she pops the lean cuisine into the oven and
        walks back into the living room to an old stereo  she
        turns the turntable on  a record already set upon it
        she stands by her coffee table as if taking position

        suddenly we hear ethel merman  as lydia lipsyncs
        every word with complete commitment  giving a full out
        performance

                                ethellydia
                  got no sunshine got no rain
                  still i think im a lucky dame
                  i got the sun in the morning
                  and the moon at night

        her attempts at hand gestures and choreography are
        awkward  bunking into the coffee table banging her
        hand against a lamp  but we see a part of lydia that
        few actually no one sees  her abandon her joy her
        smile  from upstairs neighbors bang for her to keep the
        music down  lydia casually crosses to the stereo turns
        off the turntable and heads back to the kitchen  as if
        the neighbors interference were all apart of her nightly
        ritual

        anne sits alone at her formica table smoking a
        cigarette  two plates are set  she waits for jack  she
        is hurt and pissed off  tony orlando and dawn play on
        her stereo

                                tony orlando
                  knock three times on the ceiling
                  if you want me twice on the
                  pipes

        the song continues as the camera slowly pans up to
        closeup of anne who is fighting with an imaginary jack

                                anne
                  ya fuckin bastard  i dont need

        parry takes off his pants and stands there naked

                              continuing

                                                     cut to

        ext central park sheeps meadow  ten minutes later  night

        jack fully clothed lies next to parry looking up at the clouds

                                     jack
                   theyre not moving

        they stare up jack raises his head he unbuttons his shirt 
        maybe that will help

                                     jack
                   what if some homophobic jogger runs by and
                   kills us to get back at his overbearing father

        parry remains focused on the sky  in his own world
        something about cloudbusting makes parry behave in a way we havent
        seen beforehe is un characteristically quiet

                                     jack
                   jack lucas found dead  beside
                   a dead naked manthe two were
                   deadhis companion was nakedi hate
                   when they use the word companionits
                   so insinuatingalthough itll probably boost my
                   biography sales the public loves
                   stories about successful people falling into
                   degenerate behavior makes them feel
                   lucky to be boring and ordinarypeople stink

        parry suddenly speaks  as if talking to a lecture hall

                                     parry
                   are there any questions

                                     jack
                   what

                                     parry
                   then lets begin with the story itself
                   its a story of the grail mythand although
                   there are several variations my favorite
                   begins with the fisher king as a young boy
                   who had to spend a night alone in the forest
                   to prove his courage and during that night
                   he is visited by a sacred vision out of the
                   fire appears the holy grail  gods highest symbol of
                   divine grace and a voice says to the boy
                   you shall be the guardian of the grail that it
                   may heal the hearts of menbut the boy was
                   overcome innocent and foolish he was
                   blinded by greater visions  a life ahead filled
                   with beauty and glory hope and powertears
                   filled his eyes as he sensed his own invincibility
                   a boys tears of naive wonder and inspiration
                   and in this state ofradical amazementhe felt
                   for a brief moment not like a boy but like god
                              jack listens intently
                   and so he reached into the fire to take the grail
                   and the grail vanished and the boy hands were
                   left caught in the flamesleaving him wounded
                   and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him
                   when he became king he was determined to
                   reclaim his destiny and find the grail
                   but with each year that passed with each
                   campaign he fought the grail remained lost and
                   this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse
                   he became a bitter man life for him lost its reason
                   with each disappointment with each betrayal
                   with each loss  this wound would grow
                   soon the land began to spoil from neglect
                   and his people starveduntil finally
                   the king lost all faith in gods existance and in
                   mans valuehe lost his ability to love or be loved
                   and he was so sick with experience
                   that he started to die as the years went on
                   his bravest knights would search for the
                   grail that would heal their king and
                   make them the most respected and valued men in
                   the land but to no avail  pretty soon finding
                   the grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious
                   men vying for the kings power which only confirmed
                   the kings worst suspicions of man causing his
                   wound to grow his only hope he thought was death
                   then one day a fool was brought in to the king
                   to cheer him  he was a simpleminded man
                   not particularly skilledor admired he
                   tells the king some jokessing him some songs
                   but the king feels even worsefinally the
                   fool says what is it that hurts you so much
                   how can i helpand the king says i need
                   a sip of water to cool my throatso the fool
                   takes a cup from the bedstand fills it with
                   water and hands it to the kingsuddenly
                   the king feels a lot better and when he looks
                   to his hands he sees that it was the holy grail
                   the fool handed himan ordinary cup that had been
                   beside his bed all alongand the king asks
                   how can this behow could you find what
                   all my knights and wisest men could not find
                   and the fool answers i dont know i only
                   knew you were thirsty and for the first time
                   since he was a boy the king felt more than a man 
                   not because he was touched by gods glorybut
                   rather by the compassion of a fool

        jack doesnt know how to respond hes never known parry to
        be eloquent he gets a glimpse of parry as he once was and
        the words come out of his mouth before he knows it

                                     jack
                   im so sorry

        but parry seems far away he speaks like a professor

                                     parry
                   the fisher king myth has alot of
                   derivationsi remember i was at
                   this lecture in princeton once 
                   and there was this one speakerhenry sa
                   henryuhhenry

        he stops as if this memory escaped with any warning

                                     parry
                             continuing
                   what was i saying

        jack is as surprised as he is parrys face is frightened
        and confused again there is panic in his voice

                                     parry
                             continuing
                   what was i saying

        he raises his head to look and sees

        ext sheeps meadow several yards away  night

        the dark silouette of the red knight upon his horse staring 
        knowing exactly where parry lies even though its dark

        parry looks frightened as he lays his head back down
        jack tries to snap him out of it by saying

                                     jack
                   how come youve never asked that
                   girl for a date

        parry looks back to see that the red knight has vanished
        he snaps out of it somewhat

                                     parry
                   i cant ask for heri have to earn her

        taken the wind out of his sail

        the gay bum strolls nonchalantly into the office and down the aisle 
        relishing in the amazed expressions of the employees he approaches
        a cubicle on which he reads a small name plate  lydia sinclair
        lydia has her back to him but slowly turns as she feels someone
        watching her she lets out a tiny scream when she sees him
        standing there like a deranged clown the gay bum take notice of
        her outfit  a cordoroy forest green jumper with a lime
        green turtleneck

        classical musical number song to be chosen after a big finish

                  parry

        parry snaps out of it and crosses from behind the counter
        to the laminating machine next to jack

                  yeah

        anne backs off  she stands next to an equally perplexed
        jack as they watch lydia fill out the card  her abrasive
        demeanor is not what they expected  lydia finishes the
        card and pushes it toward them

                                lydia
                  now what

                  theyre 299 a rental

        lydia eyes anne suspiciously then turns to survey the
        shelves  parry picks up her card and laminates it  all
        the while keeping his eyes fixed upon lydias every
        move  anne and jack having set the trap watch with
        interest

        lydia surveys the film boxes hl  she spots one of
        interest and pulls it off the shelf  causing two other
        boxes to fall down on her  she catches one box and as
        she replaces it back on the shelf causes three more to
        fall  she catches two of the three

        parry anne and jack watching with an odd fascination
        jack nudges parry to forget the laminating and go help
        her  parry gathers up his nerve and moves from around
        the counter up behind her

                                parry
                   can can i help you

        lydia quickly turns  she is uncomfortable by his
        closeness

                                lydia
                  no  no i can look myself

        she moves away abruptly  like a fox terrier who
        pretends to ignore the mess she made on the living room
        rug

        parry turns to jack and anne as if to say what do i do
        now  jack encourages him to keep trying  parry
        organizes the boxes and picks one out

                                parry
                  how about the hell merchants

                  purple bread an intensely portrayed
                  tale of love and envy set against the

                                parry
                  got any more bread crust

        as anne resentfully rises and crosses into the kitchen
        parry focuses on her robust breasts bouncing beneath the
        sweater  annes expression as she serves him is a
        mixture of repulsion and fascination she sits at the
        table

        lydia sits at the formica table already set up with nail care
        paraphernalia  with the gleaming steel nail files it looks a

        parry puts his arm on jacks shoulder and speaks very sincerely

        jack is surprised by the remark and abruptly focuses on parry

        lydia is a little more loose and talkative now as anne refills
        her glass then takes lydias other hand to apply the stars

                   her for that long if i had to live

                      she takes a slug
                   maybe i was a man in a former life
                   and i used women for pleasure so
                   now im paying for it  which would
                   be fine if i could just remember

        lydia smiles at the thought of having such an impressionable
        personality

        ext video pop  night

        jack tries to calm parry down

        jack adjusts parrys tie then undoes it and reties
        parry takes wallet keeping his eyes on jack as jack primps him

                                     parry
                   youre a nice man jack
                   doing all this for me

        jack doesnt pay attention as parrys expression grows pale and
        frightened he suddenly raps his arms around jack and whispers

                                     parry
                   im scared jack

        jack uncomfortable at the intimacy tries to comfort him

        jack turns to find that parry is still outside the apartment
        he crosses to parry the two whisper intensely

        lydia smiles as parry and jack reach an agreement
        all four turn to each other spontaneously and say

        ext street near brooklyn bridge  night

        parry and lydia walk and talk  anne and jack walk behind them

                                     lydia
                   iuhi get to read some of the books
                   but mostly ijust calculate production
                   costs from first edition hard cover
                   publication to paperback after
                   paperback its basically someone
                   elses problem

                                     parry
                   it sounds exciting

                                     lydia
                   why does it sound exciting theres
                   absolutely nothing exciting about it

        as parry talks he picks up a piece of garbage on the sidewalk

                                     parry
                   well youre calculating costs that
                   could have an affect on whether or
                   not the book is published and if
                   it is it could be a book that
                   might somehow change the way people
                   think or act  a book can do that
                   and you would be a part of creating
                   a cultural shift that could change
                   our society forever

        parry drops the garbage in a garbage can and is almost
        about to browse through it when

                                     jack
                   parry

        parry is alerted by jack that this would be inappropriate
        however he does take a wire champagne cork wrapper indiscreetly

                                     lydia
                   we mostly publish trashy romance novels

                                     parry
                   well  empires have fallen
                   because of trashy romances

        parry seems to be fashioning something out of the wire

                                     parry
                             continuing
                   romance is romance no matter what kind
                   it isit could be a victorian lady
                   kidnapped by a viral sea captain
                   with a hairy chestor a horny pizza boy
                   seduced by a housewife with a hairy upper lip
                   as long as theres heart passion
                   and little bit of fantasyromance is
                   the stuff of dreamstheres always
                   more to trash than meets the eye

        with this parry shows her his creation  a little wire chair
        made from the champagne wire lydia is impressed their
        eyes meet for a dangerous moment until

        a large man walks by bumping into lydia without apology and
        knocking parrys gift to the ground

                                     parry
                   hey

        the large man continues walking as parry reaches to his back
        pocket to pull out his slingshot when

                                     jackanne
                   parry

        parry spots a familiar homeless face sitting on the curb

                                     parry
                   hey martin

        parry smiles proudly  a mortified lydia reachs in her purse
        and hands martin a quarteranne and jack watch in disbelief

                                     martin

        lydia hurries away parry followsthe walk continues

                                     lydia
                   how do you know him

                                     parry
                   we were neighbors for a couple for weeks
                   on sutton place

                                     lydia

                   huhthe restaurants just around the
                   corner here

        they nod after a beat lydia asks

                                     lydia
                   what do you do  for a living i mean

                                     parry
                   well im in search of the holy grail

        jack smacks his own forehead exasperated anne gives up

                                                     cut to

        int chinese restaurant  night

        anne and lydia sit opposite jack and parry
        they are served three large orders of dumplings

                                     anne
                   ohi could eat all of these

        lydia is nervous about this as everyone begins to eat she
        eyes her chopsticks with reluctance

        parry looks at her and smiles encouragingly
        lydia forces a smile back picks up her chopsticks and dives in
        parry watches her in adoration jack subtly tries to get parry
        to stop staring but parry is glued to his vision

        lydia even more awkward now with her new nails drops her first
        dumpling into her lap

                                     lydia
                   ohgod

        to save her from embarassment parry drops his dumpling into his
        lap as well

                                     parry
                   oh boy

        lydia takes her napkin and dips it into a glass of water
        parry follows suit

        when lydia removes the napkin her glass falls over
        parry forces his glass over as well

        anne and jack are looking at this mirror exercise in fascination

                                     parry
                      to lydia
                   cant take us anywhere huh

        lydia cant help but smile  a little more at ease now grateful
        she is not the clumsy center of attention

        jack leans over and whispers to anne

                                     jack
                   what do you think

                                     anne
                   i think theyre made for each other
                   and it scares me

                                                     fade to

        later in the evening

        we pan the table as everyone eats their main courses

        lydia we discover has another eating idiosyncracy she
        unconsciously but quite loudly smacks her mouth when she chews

                                     lydia oc
                   smacksmacksmack

        we hear this smacking off camera as we begin on jack trying not
        to look at lydia but having difficulty enjoying his own meal
        camera moves to parry staring at her helplessly in love not
        paying any attention to his own food moving to lydia smack
        smacking  beginning to accept parrys attraction in her and
        warming up to the idea she throws a smile at him in between
        smacks and finally anne chewing quietly staring at jack
        with her eyes widened twice their normal size indicating her
        disbelief at lydias vocal variety of noises

                                                     cut to

        parry

        gazing at his sweetheart a song to seranade comes to
        mind and he softly begins

                                parry
                  lydia oh lydia that
                  encyclopedia  oh lydia the tattooed
                  lady

        his gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes
        it sound like a love song

        anne eyes jack to stop him

        jack is about to make an attempt but cant seem to find
        the way so he doesnt bother

        lydia doesnt know how to respond either  at first she
        smiles politely then she pretends to be too busy eating
        to listen  but something about parrys sincerity pulls
        her in  his face glows as he floats the lyrics across
        the table to her  slowly her smacking subsides she
        lowers her fork forgets her selfconsciousness and
        listens to parry  slightly hypnotized like a little
        girl watching a ballerina for the first time

        jack is fascinated by parrys complete adoration of this
        mess of a woman  he looks to anne who tries to continue
        her meal nonchalantly  he notices her bra strap hanging
        out from her sweater

        camera cuts back and forth between the exposed strap and
        jack as parry continues seranading os  anne realizes
        jack is staring at her and immediately thinks somethings
        wrong  but jack just smiles at her  his hand reaches
        across the table not to fix her sweater but to take her
        hand  anne is in shock  she slips her hand into his and
        smiles back her eyes almost tearing

        when parry finishes he smiles

                                parry
                  would it be all right i mean would
                  you mind if i walked you home
                  tonight

        lydia nods  from os parrys hand holds a napkin and
        gently dabs a stain of soy sauce on her sleeve

        he kisses her hard and long anne pulls away to catch her breath
        she is surprised to say the least

        jack tenderly brushes her hair off her face he kisses her again

        ext the end of the promenade  night

        the two juvenile delinquents leather and windbreaker
        come strutting down the promenade in slow motion  parry
        looks toward them as if surrendering

        through parrys pov we see the two youths are being lead
        by the red knight on his horse

        parry tearstained face rises to meet them  the youths
        reach parry and surround him  leather flicks open a
        switchblade

                                leather
                   were tired of looking at you
                  people

        parry stands before them surrendering to his fate

        through his pov the red knight is pointing a sword at
        him in front of leather and his switchblade  he slashes
        at parrys chest as we

                                                   cut to


        wide angle of promenade

        as parry sinks to his knees the youths close in around
        him

        jack stops organizing for a beat

                                anne
                         continuing

                  so sure thats gonna happen im not
                  even thinking about it

        jack brings out his sports jacket then returns to his
        tapes hoping he can avoid having to respond

                                jack
                  ugh these tapes are a mess  i dont
                  know where to begin

                                anne
                   i would love to start looking at
                  least  you know maybe a two bedroom
                  or even maybe the top floor of a
                  house  like in brooklyn or staten
                  island

        jack looks at her not knowing what to say

                                anne
                         continuing
                   what you dont want to
                  commute

                  no its not come here

        he turns her around and cuddles her up in his arms with
        her back to him

                                jack
                         continuing
                  youre an incredible woman anne

        anne breaks away suddenly and looks at him sternly

                                jack
                         continuing
                  what

                  this

                                anne

                  the future or what

                  no its just

        anne shifts her body to face him directly

                                jack
                         continuing
                   listen so much has happened and
                  i think it would be a good thing for
                  both of us if we slowed things down a
                  little

                                anne
                  slowed things down  where have i
                  been  have we been going fast

                                jack
                  right now im just not sure about
                  making such definite plans

        pause  anne stares at him like hes speaking dutch

                                anne
                  im lost  what are you saying

        jack sits them both down takes her hand in his takes a
        breath

                                jack
                  its been a real real difficult
                  time for me the past year or so
                  and now for the first time anne i
                  feel like im above water

                  did and i dont want to make any
                  mistakes so i think what i need is
                  some time to make the right
                  choices  and i think that
                  maybe i need to be alone for
                  awhile

        anne is speechless  for the moment

                                jack

                                anne

        his chest tightly rapped  he has been severly beaten jack
        and anne stand at the foot of the bed in shock a doctor appears
        the doctor is young dedicated and inexperienced enough to
        still feel compassion

                                     jack
                   parry

                                     doctor
                   he cant hear you
                      jack and anne turn
                   hiim dr weintraub
                      shakes hands
                   i was on duty when they brought
                   him inive been going over his record
                   he was brought in once before i understand
                      reads
                   catatonic  stuporcondition  rendered
                   him nonverbal for a period of 

                                     jack
                   yeah so the guys beat up  hehe

                      doctor doesnt reply
                   hell snap out of it

                                     doctor
                   im afraid not  then again im not sure
                   the beatings bad but its not the problem
                   it seems hes reexperiencing the catatonia
                   so like before he could snap out it in an
                   hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years
                   i dont know theres no way to tell

                                     jack
                   buthow could that happen

                                     doctor
                   well its not unusual in his case
                   sometimes victims of tragedies are
                   subject to the brains replay system
                   the brain never loses anything  it just
                   stores it up and waits a person could
                   actually reexperience the full effect
                   of a tragedy long after the event took place
                   are you relatives
                      jack shakes his head
                   well it doesnt matter well take care
                   of it hell have to be sent back to
                   the same institution

                                     jack
                   what if i was a relative

                                     doctor
                   youd have the option to care for him at
                   home but my advice is it wouldnt be the
                   best thing for him he needs hospital
                   care i just thought you could sign the
                   release forms but the city can do that
                   i wouldnt feel responsible in any way
                   theres really nothing you can do im sorry

        with that the doctor exits jack and anne face parry

                                     anne
                   just like a guy finds the woman of
                   his dreams then falls into a coma
                   poor lydia
                      she looks at jack
                   some women just have no luck huh

        including herself in this remark and having cried all she could
        cry she and jack exchange one final look she turns and
        with all her dignity walks out of the ward after a beat

        camera pauses on jack for a moment as he sits in silence he
        looks neither happy nor said neither satisfied nor unsatisfied
        he looks blankemotionlessas if he knows something is lacking
        but he hasnt the strength or interest to find out
        the phone rings  breaking the silence jack picks up

                                     jack

                   but its not depressing in any way
                   we want to find a happy upbeat way of
                   bringing the issue of homeless to television
                   there are three wacky homeless characters
                   but theyre wisetheyre wacky and theyre wise

        jack approaches the entrance to the lot from the street
        carrying an open box of assorted deli food and coffee
        he stops in the entrance and looks at the deserted lot

        gone are the little cliques of homeless once scattered
        throughout the place  gone is the magic and danger that
        night cast upon the surroundings  all jack sees is
        garbage and decay

        suddenly sirens from an ambulance pulls his his attention
        away  at the same time the black and the irishman from
        that same first night with parry come running out from
        between the two giant foundations of the bridge and bolt
        out of the lot  jack smiles in recognition as he moves

        into some exterior lighting that lines the balcony

        a light is jarred loose falling to the ground making an
        awful sound and lighting a stained glass window jack raises his
        eyes and sees the red knight standing six feet tall as pictured
        in the design of the stained glass window he stares until
        he hears the sound of a horse gallopinghe freezes then
        cautiously looks toward the street  but the street
        is vacant the galloping stops an eerie silence hangs in the air

        jack reaches the roof and climbs over  he pulls the rope
        up and quickly moves to the skylight  he looks down into
        it and sees a dark void  he takes a breath and pulls out
        some masking tape   he makes three big tape loops and
        applies them to the glass  he then takes out a glass
        cutter and begins to cut a pane  the sound at first is
        starting  an os voice says

                                voice
                  youre being too loud

        jacks heart stops  he looks into the darkness of the
        roof but sees nothing  he tries to slow down his heart
        and shake away thoughts of demons in the dark  he
        continues cutting  when he finishes the entire pane he
        replaces the cutter in his pocket then plasters his arm
        against the tape  he gently bangs the pane and it comes
        loose sticking to the tape  he is impressed  he places
        the pane on the roof and fastening one end of the rope
        to a pipe lowers the other end down

        jack eases himself down into a pitch black room  but the
        rope doesnt reach the floor  he dangles for a moment
        fearful of falling until he realizes it is the only way
        to get down  he takes a breath and releases falling to
        the floor with a thud the room is dark  the moon
        light barely illuminates the austere castlelike
        surroundings  jack pulls out the page from the
        architecture today and lights a lighter  the grail is
        in the library on the first floor  jack cautiously makes
        his way out


        int fifth floor hallway of townhouse  night

        jack looks down the dark hallway  at the far end he can
        see the top of a staircase he heads towards it until he
        sees something that makes him stop dead in his tracks

        slowly a shadow holding a shotgun emerges up the stairs
        against the back wall jack is paralyzed  he closes
        his eyes  the shadow reaches the top of the landing  it
        is edwin malnick wearing the same expression we saw on
        the tv broadcast  sad and harmless  jacks heart is
        bursting out of his chest  edwin calmly raises the gun
        cocks it and fires  the shot blasts down the hallway
        deafening jack  but when he opens his eyes to see if he
        has been hit there is no blood no wound and when he
        looks up no edwin  he pulls himself together and
        continues

        is lit on a small table beside a large chesterfield
        chair which is turned facing the fireplace  jack spots
        the antique commode and crosses to it within the
        commode sitting innocently behind two small glass doors
        is the grail jack gently opens the doors and takes
        out the goblet  he holds it reverently for a moment
        then noticing an inscription reads

                       to little lannie carmichael
         for all his hard work ps 247 christmas pagent 1932

        jack cant help but smile  he takes the chalice and
        turns to leave when suddenly he notices

        the bare foot of a man barely sticking out from in front
        of the chesterfield chair  jack slowly moves around the
        large back of the chair to the front and sees to his
        amazement  langston carmichael wearing only his silk
        pajama bottoms asleep in the chair  on the table beside
        him is an empty bottle of vodka and an empty bottle of
        pills

        jack doesnt know what to do when it suddenly strikes
        him that carmichael hasnt moved at all  at first he
        thinks it is another hallucination but then he notices
        the pill bottle  he takes a step toward it the floor
        squeaking beneath him but carmichael remaining
        unconscious  he reads the bottle  seconal  jack looks
        at carmichaels limp body and checks his heart  it is
        very faint scared jack slowly starts backing out of
        the room

        jack is panicked  he wants to run away  he looks to the
        front entrance and sees an alarm system indicated by a
        tiny beam of light that sits a few inches above the
        floor  suddenly jack feels calm  he has an idea  he
        knows what he is going to do
