     feingold cocks his head reappraising him  then with a smile he
     calls to an attractive young woman passing in the hall schuyler
     meanwhile flips through the pages of the tests 

                             feingold 
                     ms nelson are you busy  we need

                             feingold 
                     ill catch up with you after the physical 

     schuyler reacts a physical  he throws up a hand and follows the
     woman into the hall  alone now feingold cracks a fortune cookie
     and glances at the slip of paper inside  he furrows his brow with
     concern at the fortune then tosses it aside

     and ekg  we see him on a doctors table wearing a medical gown

     schuylers name is steady at the top of the screen with an account

     schuyler in the gown sits on an examination table with his hands
     in his lap in a small featureless cubicle he seems vulnerable 
     looks around blankly  to himself irritated and bemused

                     david you suck 

     feingold bursts in a slew of computer printouts under his arm

     he throws open a closet door  schuyler reaches inside for his
     clothes which are neatly folded and on hangers  feingold turns
     his back on him as he dresses perching on the examination table
     and studying the unburst printouts 

                             feingold 
                     looks promising at this point

                     i dont know the object i dont
                     know how much it costs 

                             feingold 
                     its a leap of faith  but at this
                     stage theres no commitment we
                     just need to process your 
                     application  and if you qualify
                     youre in for the ride of your 
                     life  what have you got to lose 

     schuyler clicks the ballpoint pen they both lean over the papers 

                             feingold 
                     initials initials sign here 

     schuylers about to sign when feingold grabs his wrist

                     in blood 
                             a wink
                     just kidding 

     close as schuyler signs on the dotted line 

     feingold snatches up the forms suddenly seems in a hurry for
     schuyler to go 

                             feingold 
                     very good mr van orton  please

     schuyler shrugs sticks it in his breast pocket starts out

     schuyler in casual clothes hair still wet from a shower comes 
     out of a locker room area toward an outdoor bar by a swimming pool
     at this upscale country ciub  he passes pete and john two middle 
     aged rich men sitting at a table near the bar he overhears a
     snippet of their conversation 

                             john 
                     like fuckin wildfire just

                     not likely would you 

     schuyler slows down eavesdropping then moves toward the bar
     addresses the bartender with a nod toward john and pete

     38n same location later the bartender brings another round of
     drinks to the table schuyler and the men have been chatting a 
     while all seem relaxed  pete the friendlier drunker of the
     two puffs a cigar as he speaks

     the others chuckle knowingly  schuyler sips his drink blinking
     and coughing discretely at the smoke theres a slight pause 

                             schuyler

     schuyler pulls up in his mbz the electric gate glides shut  he
     gets out of the car and sets the alarm  he heads for the front
     steps of his home then freezes blinks 

     on his doorstep lies a body facedown apparently a wino in a

     across the steps in much the same position as the wino flat on his 
     stomach head twisted at a grotesque angle  his bathrobe is even
     similar in color to the winos overcoac

     schuyler shakes off the memory looking alarmed  he calls out

                             schuyler 
                     hello  what are you doing here 

     the body doesnt stir  he approaches gingerly

                             schuyler 
                     wonderful  you ok  you dead 

     he crouches by the wino winces at a strong smell covers his nose
     he reaches out to touch the body but hesitates pulls back  alive
     or dead he doesnt want to have anything to do with this person 

                             schuyler 
                     shit shit shit

     the wino suddenly springs up like a jackinthebox bending
     backwards impossibly at the hips  schuyler lets out a cry and 
     scrambles back toward his car

     the head swivels to face him its a grotesque harlequin its head
     made of colored glass lit from within  the mouth drops open and a 
     tongue in the shape of a corkscrew springs out 

     a small key on a hook dangles from the tip of the tongue  one of
     the harlequins glass eyes winks 

     schuyler stares in amazement for a few moments 

     close on the dangling key as schuyler fingers it  the key catches
     the light and we see the letters crs embossed on it

                     then kiss your lilywhite ass goodbye 

     on this last line shaws voice starts to echo and change

     schuyler rises staring at the tv mouth agape

     shaw winks  his voice is utterly transformed

     the house  he fingers a box with a miniature loop and rabbit ear
     antenna thats been spliced into the line with a tiny sshaped 
     wire  he starts to unscrew it then thinks twice heads back in

     schuyler comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a 
     briefcase  he joins up with a driver carrying a sign that says van

                             schuyler 
                     im expecting a package with some

     the man shakes his head schuyler exasperated whips out his cell
     phone and dials  as he and the driver move through the crowd they
     pass a redeyed dredlocked homelesslooking rasta man in a 
     brightly colored outfit with knit cap hassling other travelers
     he turns his attention to schuyler and begins walking alongside

     the rasta man jogs alongside holds up a stained newsprint
     religious tract schuyler glances at it without taking it 

     close we see the words crisis revelation solution  the
     letters c rand s are printed in a different color from the rest

     schuyler looks uncomfortable with this prospect  the driver is
     already loading his bag into the chopper  baer claps a hand on 
     schuylers shoulder leading him under the wash into the chopper

                     management team 

     as he speaks schuyler moves to the fax machine  a transmission
     has come through he picks up the sheaf of papers 

                             baer

                     bastard i watched you grow up and
                     now you kick me in the balls 

     schuyler squints at the papers in his hand flipping through them 

     close the entire transmission has been garbled  the words all
     bleed together incomprehensibly it looks like a childs scribbles 

                             baer os 
                     thats not how you play the game

                             schuyler
                     what game 

     schuyler studies the senseless pages for a moment then puts them
     down shaking off his apprehensions 

                             schuyler 
                     never mind well just have to
                     go with the earlier draft 

     in bg one exec picks up a page whispers to an assistant who
     moves out of the room  schuyler moves to his briefcase  its
     locked  he starts patting his pockets 

                             baer
                     cant find your keys 

     baer has a malevolent expression  schuyler looks at him 

                             schuyler
                     where are they 

                             baer

     a couple of execs stifle chuckles  schuylers suspicions mount 

                             schuyler
                     up my ass very funny 

     his eyes drift to a piece of corporate stationary on the table in
     front of him  he picks it up

     insert  under baergrace letterhead we see a handscrawled note
     crs called  we dont see whats written below 

     schuyler is reeling paranoia confirmed 

                             schuyler 
                     i dont ok  ok youre with crs 

     baer stares at him blankly  schuyler puts a hand over his eyes
     seems disoriented trying to piece it all together 

                             schuyler
                     so the game its just a screen to
                     blow this deal

                             baer

                             schuyler 
                     like hell you arent  how did you
                     get my brother involved thats
                     unforgivable

     the assembled execs are looking at schuyler in utter confusion  as
     he speaks the assistant returns with some paperwork  schuyler
     stares at him menacingly  hesitantly 

                             assistant 
                     um sorry to interrupt  weve
                     been having some trouble with this 
                     fax so they resent the material
                     its all ok now 

     the assistant comes over cheerfully places the crucial documents
     in front of schuyler  the assistant fishes in his pocket 

                             assistant 
                     oh and mr van orton are these 
                     yours  the pilot found em on the
                     floor of the chopper 

     schuyler gingerly takes the keys which the assistant holds out
     looks from them to the paperwork  then he glances back at the
     handwritten note on the table 

     insert note  it actually reads cbs called  schuylers thumb or
     a postit note covered the base of the b before making it look 
     like an r  it continues re interview with alan b on sun 

     schuyler takes a breath reassembles his composure and consults his
     watch  he rises anxious to put the last few minutes behind him 

                             schuyler 
                     everything seems to be in order 
                     please disregard my last comments
                     the shareholders meeting is about
                     to get underway shall we 

     he heads for the door  as he leaves the execs exchange looks 

                                                       cut to

     51  i n t    s e a  t a c   t e r m i n a l    n i g h t 

     schuyler wanders through the terminal carrying his bags glancing 
     periodically at the departures monitor and the clock  his manner
     now has changed he eyes every passerby especially the odd ones 

                             p a voice filter 
                     flight 177 to san francisco is now
                     boarding at gate 14 

     suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk 
     schuyler trips and goes sprawling  the rasta man steps out now
     wearing sunglasses with pink lenses 

                             rasta man 
                     shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention 

     schuyler gets up dusts himself off  as calmly as possible

     he snatches up the briefcase dances back a few paces  schuyler
     speaks as if to a child 

                             schuyler 
                     no cretin  im quitting the game 

     the rasta man keeps backing away puts a hand to his ear

                     whas that mon  i didna hear you

                             schuyler

     the rasta turns and runs schuyler bolts after him unable to 
     believe this is happening  they draw a lot of looks during the 
     brief chase through the terminal the suited businessman garment
     bag flapping behind him in pursuit of the crazy rasta 

                             rasta man 
                     help help  the mon is crazy 

     he runs into a mens room schuyler follows a moment later 

     52  i n t    a i r p o r t   m e n  s   r o o m    n i g h t 

     schuyler has the rasta cornered now but he doesnt have the
     briefcase  both are out of breath  pissing men look wary 

                             schuyler
                     where is it 

                             rasta man 
                     got something better 

     the rasta men holds out a shiny key on a chain  schuyler narrows
     his eyes hes trying not to lose control of his temper 

                             schuyler 
                     i realize youre just some bit 
                     player but id like you to get a

                     work its breaking my concentration
                     and i cant allow that to happen 

     the rasta makes a sad face sniffles still dangling the key 

                             schuyler 
                     if i take that stupid key will you 
                     give me back my briefcase and go away 

     the rasta nods with a big grin  schuyler steps forward hand
     extended  the rasta flings open the door of a stall beside him and
     hurls the key into the toilet  instinctively schuyler moves to
     grab it reaches into the toilet pulls out the chain his hand and
     sleeve dripping  the key is missing from the end of the chain 

                             schuyler 
                     what the fuck am idoing 

                             rasta man

     he drops the rasta schtick speaks with an ivy league accent 

                             rasta man 
                     so try looking at it through rose
                     colored glasses here 

     he takes off his sunglasses folds them and tucks them in the
     pocket of schuylers suit  then he reaches above him and pulls 
     down the briefcase which was perched on top of the stall
     schuyler grabs it from him raises his voice 

                             schuyler

                             rasta man 
                     they all say that at first 

     he gives schuyler a hearty slap on the back and strolls off
     humming  schuyler leans against the wall shaking his head  he
     puts down his luggage pulls the sunglasses from his pocket 

     close on sunglasses theres the image of a tiny gold key embossed
     on each of the arms 

     schuyler puts them on looks around for a moment catches a glimpse
     of himself in the mirror he looks silly  he quickly takes them
     off  as schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind the
     rasta has slapped a colorful sign that reads kick me on his back 

                                                       cut to

     the neon sign fizzles in front of this lowrent establishment

     bells ring and lights flash as a drunk plays a pinball machine with 
     a lot of body english  schuyler stuck at a table right next to 
     the machine winces at the noise checks his watch and rises  he
     makes his way through the lunch hour crowd to the bar leans toward

     he drums his fingers then whips out a cellphone spins around
     quickly as he starts to dial

     kitchen carrying a tray 

     schuyler gets hit in the chest with a tray of desserts colorful
     jello cream pie etc  he stands there stunned and dripping 

                             christine

     she starts picking up plates and silverware oblivious to 
     schuylers own plight ronnie charges out from behind the bar 
     after the first shock schuyler chuckles with annoyance  he wipes
     the phone clean pocketing it 

                             schuyler

     she throws a plate on the ground it shatters then storms off into
     the kitchen  schuyler chuckles angrily pushing through the slop
     on the floor with his shoe looking for something 

                             schuyler

     55  i n t    l e o  s   k i t c h e n    d a y 

     he crosses past a shortorder cook in the grimy industrial kitchen
     pulling a cube of jello out of his lapel pocket  he finds
     christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers as she finishes
     changing into her street clothes  her brown uniform hangs from a
     locker door the nameplate chris prominent 

     close as his fingers touch the crs of chris they even look a bit
     brighter than the h and the i 

                             schuyler 
                     i wish you people could be a
                     little more subtle 

     christine notices him for the first time

     she waves a hand at him go away and ducks out of view finishing
     dressing into punkgrungy street clothes  she slams the locker
     starts to push past him pulling on her backpack bag 

                             schuyler 
                     dont you have something for me

     she puts her hand into her side pocket pulls it out with her
     middle finger extended moving away from him in a hurry
     schuylers face falls he made another mistake 

                             schuyler 
                     wait you really work here

     shes out the swinging kitchen door  schuyler absorbs his blunder
     for a moment then hurries after her 

     56  e x t    l e o  s    d a y 

     schuyler catches up as christine hurries toward a muni station
     lighting a cigarette  a few pedestrians come off the steps from
     the arriving elevated train in this residential sf neighborhood 

                             schuyler
                     slow down you dont understand i
                     thought it was a gag

                     mace and i know how to use it 

     she reaches into her pursebackpack schuyler backs off 

                             schuyler 
                     i was only trying to apologize

                             schuyler
                     fine 

     he starts to move away then they both hear gasping o s 

     on the steps a heavy man 60 in a coat and tie has collapsed 
     struggling for breath very pale  christine and schuyler are the
     only pedestrians around now 

                             christine
                     shit 

     she rushes to help the guy loosening his tie he jolts 

     schuyler looks up at them dubiously brushing a scrap of food still
     clinging to his suit 

     christine reaches in to clear the guys throat starting cpr  she
     shoots a look at schuyler 

                             christine 
                     you got a fucking phone call an
                     ambulance 

     schuyler approaches slowly pulling out his phone studying the guy as
     christine gives him mouthtomouth 

                             schuyler 
                     this is just too weird it cant
                     be real 

                             christine 
                     you really are insane 

     schuyler leans close to look at the man 

     on the mans face sweating contorted unnaturally pale his eyes
     rolling back as he gags his last

     christine grabs the phone away from schuyler dials 

                             christine

     she stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the mans chest returns
     to the mouthtomouth  schuyler looks around uncomfortably 
     starting to believe this is a real heart attack 

                             schuyler 
                     is there anything i can do 

     christine ignores him all attention on saving this guys life

     56a wide as an ambulance pulls up siren blaring  a couple of
     male paramedics hurry out with a stretcher 

     on the steps the two paramedics lift the unconscious heavy man
     onto the stretcher while christine and schuyler stand aside  both
     have small earpieces that look like hearing aids with wires into
     their clothes  throughout the following theres a lot of medical
     business feeding the victim oxygen giving him injections etc 

                             paramedic 1

     she climbs into the back they start to shut the doors 

                             schuyler 
                     wait a minute youve got my phone 

     he climbs in to get it back they slam the doors and start moving 

     the ambulance peels out  we now see the logo on the back
     citywide rescue systems with the c r and s in red 

     57  i n t    a m b u l a n c e    d a y 

     the paramedics are intent on the gasping man  the siren blares a
     bit muffled in here  schuyler looking out the back is extremely
     pissed makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance 

                             christine 
                     chill will you

                     outta their way 

     a bump almost sends him flying atop the stretcher  schuyler sits
     near christine on a ledge near the back doors  petulant 

                             schuyler 
                     id like my phone back please

     an underground ramp signs reading emergency vehicles only a set
     of doors leading into the lobby of an emergency room medical
     personnel visible inside injured people etc a few people mill
     outside the doors 

     the ambulance screeches to a stop the back doors fly open the
     paramedics wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance
     automatic doors open and close for them  schuyler and christine
     climb out disoriented walking more slowly to the doors  the
     ambulance pulls away behind them  schuyler nearly slips in a
     mysterious dark puddle 

                             schuyler 
                     oh this day keeps getting better 

                             christine 
                     what is your problem you think 
                     the whole fucking world revolves
                     around you 

     as she says this she walks right into the electric doors which
     fail to open for them 

     their pov through the doors the gathered staff and patients all
     turn at once to regard christine and schuyler  they grin and wink 

     on schuyler and christine who barely get the chance to register
     this before 

     the lights go out pitch blackness and sudden silence  we hear 
     only schuylers bitter laughter  dialogue over darkness 

                             schuyler 
                     as a matter of fact 

                             christine 
                     what the fuck is going on 

     we hear rustling in a purse but still see next to nothing 

                             schuyler 
                     its a little hard to explain

                             christine
                     try 

     we hear the striking of a match theres some orange light
     christine holds the match  the whole area is deserted except for 
     the two of them  schuyler kicks at the glass doors theyre not
     going to give nothing is visible beyond them 

                             schuyler 
                     i seem to be playing a game  this
                     is supposed to be funny 

                             christine
                     i dont get it

                             schuyler
                     a challenge a puzzle 

                             christine 
                     ok im puzzled  wherearewe 

     schuyler has found a steel door with a glowing red sign  emergency
     use only  he yanks it open and a pail swings down dumping water
     on his head  hes facing a brick wall through the door 

     christine cant help but laugh then yelps in pain as the match
     burns her fingers  lights another  schuyler flips open his phone

                             schuyler 
                     damn it no signal 

                             christine 
                     heres a lightswitch 

                             schuyler
                     i wouldnt 

     she flips it on a blinding strobe flashes for a few seconds both 
     cry out then the bulb explodes in a shower of sparks 

                             schuyler 
                     i dont know the rules if there are
                     any but it seems the obvious move
                     usually backfires

                             christine 
                     of course  i have no idea what 
                     youre talking about

     theyve taken a few steps forward exploring the dark  she lights
     a cigarette with the next match nearly running into another door
     she rattles it locked 

                             christine
                     son of a bitch 

                             schuyler 
                     i think i have a key 

     schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold crs key nope 

                             schuyler
                     damn it 
                       a beat thoughtful
                     wrong key 

                             christine
                     last match 

     in the matchlight we see schuyler fumbling in his pockets pulling
     out the rosy sunglasses from the rasta  he puts them on 

                             christine
                     too bright for you is it 

     schuylers pov as the last match goes out christine glows red in
     the matchlight for a moment then as soon as it goes out we see a
     glow of fluorescent paint on the ground a series of stripes and
     arrows in different colors glowing  these start parallel near
     where he stands then radiate in different directions  christine
     is but a silhouette against the colored lines

                             schuyler 
                     i can see now  grab my arm 

                             christine 
                     no way  youre crazy 

     christine moves away from him 

                             schuyler
                     stay on the path 

     a burst of flame erupts from the ground close enough to scare the
     shit out of christine who screams  schuyler hurries toward her 

     the flames vanish she lurches in a differrent direction 

                             schuyler 
                     christine dont move 

                             christine
                     leave me alone

     she loses her footing on a slippery surface falls sliding down a
     gentle slope 

                             christine
                     help 

     schuyler follows  falling himself  they try to reach toward each 
     other for purchase but its no good the slope is getting steeper

     58a in a moment schuyler tumbles on top of christine in a four
     foot deep round childrens pool but it isnt full of water
     theres a bit of black light here enough to make out 

     cockroaches thousands of them a teeming roil of insects in a
     churning liquid  theres a buzzing noise both scream 

                             christine
                     aaggh  bugs 

     schuyler quickly helps lift christine out  she starts to pull him
     upward but 

                             schuyler 
                     where are the glasses 

                             christine
                     fuck the glasses 

                             schuyler 
                     we cant get out of here without them 

     he steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs about to get sick
     finally coming up with the glasses  he shakes them free of insects
     and clambers out to join christine whos gasping and brushing the
     bugs off of her  schuyler puts on the glasses and holds up a bug 

                             schuyler 
                     theyre rubber  hold onto me
                     ill get us out of here

                             christine
                     ha 

                             schuyler
                     fine stay 

                             christine
                     no 

     she grabs his arm both are now covered in muck from the bug soup 

                             schuyler 
                     whats your favorite color

                             christine
                     blue 

     he takes off the glasses puts them on her  she looks around

     her pov the rainbow of colored lines on the floor

                             christine 
                     wow ok this is kinda cool  hey 

     schuyler slips the glasses off her puts them back on

                             schuyler 
                     sorry its my game  but well
                     take blue 

     his pov a blue line moves in a snaking path ahead of them going
     in circles now and then intersecting or moving parallel to other
     colors up a series of ramps  this space sometimes resembles a
     parking garage scmetimes a sewer or a steam tunnel 

     christine keeps a hand on schuyler as he follows the path 

                             christine
                     talk about the blind leading the
                     blind whats your name anyway 

                             schuyler
                     sky van orton 

                             christine 
                     sky  were your folks hippies or
                     something 

                             schuyler
                     far from it 

                             christine 
                     im christine kaminsky 

                             schuyler
                     nice to meet you 

     58b later christine almost hugs schuyler now as they move in a
     seemingly random pattern in the darkness 

                             schuyler 
                     its a company called consumer 
                     recreation services crs  i never
                     know whats gonna happen next 

                             christine
                     well who does 

                             schuyler 
                     until recently i had a pretty
                     good idea duck 

     the blue line has led them into a narrow tunnel soon theyre
     crawling on hands and knees 

                             christine 
                     so are you like a serious masochist
                     or just really really bored 

                             schuyler 
                     im sorry you shouldnt have been
                     dragged into this 

                             christine
                     well i have to tell you 
                     something  some guy came into 
                     leos yesterday showed me your 
                     picture offered me 250 bucks to
                     spill that food on you 

                             schuyler
                     ah 

                             christine 
                     said it was a practical joke  i
                     figured what the hell i can use
                     the money i got him up to 500 
                     i hated that fucking job anyway 

                             schuyler 
                     wait so the heart attack you
                     knew that was a joke too 

                             christine 
                     no  it scared the shit out of me 

                             schuyler 
                     but that cpr routine 

                             christine 
                     i used to be a lifeguard 

                             schuyler
                             points 
                     were getting somewhere 

     the tunnel has opened up again  theres even a tiny bit of visible
     light now  he takes off the glasses gives them to her 

     her pov the colored lines are all joining up from different
     directions  a few steps onward they all converge at a point like
     the spokes of a wheel at a white spot on the ground

     schuyler and christine look around then schuyler points upward 

     a white ring overhead it looks like the underside of a manhole
     cover with an illuminated circle of light around the rim a halo 

                             christine 
                     how do we get up there 

     schuyler steps on the circle of white its a button  a rope
     ladder drops down 

     59  e x t    w a l k w a y    e v e n i n g 

     a manhole cover slides aside schuyler climbs out and helps
     christine up  its a short covered wooden walkway in an alley 

                             christine
                     well that was pointless but
                     different kind of fun 

                             schuyler 
                     mm a different kind of fun
                     whats your middle name 

                             christine
                     louise why 

     schuyler points to some graffiti a heart with svo  clk 

                             schuyler 
                     youre supposed to be here they
                     picked you for a reason 

                             christine
                     but why 

     they start to move shakily down the construction walkway both
     bedraggled covered in goo  handbills cover one wall 

                             schuyler 
                     probably knew youd play good 
                     samaritan for that guy drag me 
                     along but they could have hired an 
                     actor for that less of a risk

     on the wall a series of handbills say arent you forgetting
     something  schuyler puzzles over these as they move gets to one
     last one behind you stupid 

     schuyler looks back toward the end of the alley 

     a yellow dumpster with the logo consolidated refuse supply and
     the smaller image of a key  schuyler moves quickly to it throws
     open the lid 

     angle in dumpster a mountain of shredded paper 

     schuyler rolls his eyes sorting through it  christine approaches

                             christine 
                     this is really sick  i think
                     theyre trying to fix us up 

                             schuyler 
                     maybe you cant play alone 

                             christine 
                     who says i want to play
                             a sigh 
                     ok what the fuck are you doing in
                     the dumpster 

                             schuyler 
                     theres something in here i need 

     he climbs inside dives in and pops up again in a moment with 

     close a zshaped window crank  sure enough theres a key
     embossed on the side 

     schuyler climbs out again brandishing the small crank 

                             christine
                     whats that for 

                             schuyler

     60  e x t    c r s   b u i l d i n g    e v e n i n g 

     schuyler pockets the crank as he and christine emerge from the
     alley  pedestrians give them a wide berth  to a passerby 

                             christine 
                     what areyoulooking at 

     schuyler heads straight for the crs doors the large numbers 636
     printed above its locked  he tries his little gold key on a
     deadbolt its useless of course 

                             schuyler 
                     this is their offices  we must
                     have been in their garage my 
                     office is just a few blocks from 
                     here we can get cleaned up there 

     he walks a few steps on she stands still for a moment then nods
     agreeably and follows 

                                                       cut to

     61  i n t    s c h u y l e r  s   o f f i c e    n i g h t 

     start on the skyline schuyler moves from the window as we hear a 
     door open  christine emerges from the attached dressing area and
     bath toweling damp hair in an oversized harvard sweatshirt and
     gym shorts with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes
     she looks good clearly she put some effort into her makeup 

                             christine
                     your turn 

                             schuyler 
                        moving past her 
                     find everything you need 

                             christine 
                     youre outta conditioner 

                             schuyler 
                     my apologies ill have it taken care
                     of  help yourself to the fridge 

     he points to a minifridge shuts the door a moment later we hear
     water running  she looks around the office letting down her
     facade  she seems quite impressed and intimidated by the place
     she looks back toward the bathroom door maybe this guy isnt so
     bad after all  from this point she takes a more seductive tack 

     62  i n t    d r e s s i n g   a r e a  b a t h    n i g h t 

     later schuyler has cleaned up is finishing dressing pulling a
     pair of jeans over boxer shorts tucking in a sport shirt
     christine talks through the closed door 

                             christine o s
                     so um how rich are you anyway

     schuyler emerges shoes in hand

                             schuyler 
                     basically  beats working huh 

     christine sits on his desk with her bag slung over her shoulder
     eating an apple  she slides off the desk flirting rather bluntly 

                             christine

                             schuyler 
                     mm  so where do you live 

     christine realizes her comeon is falling flat she pulls back
     tossing her unfinished apple in the trash 

                             christine 
                     out in concord with my folks

     christine nods disappointedly as schuyler moves to the door 

                                                       cut to

     64  i n t    l i m o    n i g h t 

     schuyler and christine ride in silence in the back seat

                     mind if i smoke in here

                        leaning forward
                     up here on the left 

     as the limo pulls over he and christine turn to each other  its
     a somewhat awkward moment 

                             christine 
                     so whats our next move  i mean in 
                     the game  obviously we need to figure
                     out what that crank thing is for 

                             schuyler

                             christine 
                          disappointed
                     why not

                     yeah maybe ill get in a little
                     ballroom dancing before bed 

     the limo has stopped now  schuyler has started to open the door 

                             christine 
                     wait what about your clothes 

                             schuyler 
                     forget it 

                             christine 
                     cmon its a brand new sweatshirt 

     so saying she pulls it off  shes wearing a black bra a rose
     is tattooed on her shoulder  schuyler cant help but react  she
     thrusts the shirt at him hes half out of the car 

                             schuyler 
                     no its not just back from
                     the cleaners 

                             christine
                            throatily 
                     you dry clean your sweatshirts 

     he nods slightly as he reaches to take it 

     christine leans forward cups the back of his head and gives him
     a long hard kiss 

     jack the driver middleaged and trustworthy turns and catches a
     glimpse of this quickly turns away 

     christine breaks the kiss sinks back against the red leather seat
     waiting for schuyler to make the next move 

                             christine
                     see ya 

     schuyler nods again torn  shes looking at him expectantly  hes
     clearly aroused but this is such an inappropriate female  sadly
     he waves a hand 

                             schuyler
                     good night 

     65  e x t    l e o  s    n i g h t 

     schuyler shuts the door sweatshirt in hand the dome light slowly
     dims out out on the crestfallen christine we see her mouth a 
     curse  schuyler moves toward his mbz the limo idling  hes about
     to get inside when he sees a ticket in an envelope under the
     windshield wiper  he snorts insult to injury tosses it on the
     dash as he climbs in 

     66  i n t    s c h u y l e r  s   m b z    n i g h t 

     he sits behind the wheel watching the lights of the limo 
     disappear  he sniffs the sweatshirt a moment then starts at the
     sound of a motor starting across the street 

     angle through side window an mbz the same year model and color
     as schuylers pulls away from the curb schuyler gets a glimpse
     of something reflecting street light in the window of the car a 
     gun  a camera with a long lens  the car makes a quick uturn and
     drives in the same direction as the limo 

     schuyler curious starts the engine as if to pursue  then he
     glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye  he
     doesnt put the car in gear picks up the envelope instead 

     close on envelope the words open me are printed in block 
     letters on the outside  he opens it quickly theres no ticket
     inside but he shakes out a rainbowcolored condom in a clear 
     wrapper and a note in kidnapper letters  better safe than sorry 

     schuyler frowns at this and throws the note aside  he flips on the
     windshield wipers its started to drizzle and pulls out 

     pov through windesield a dark figure runs from the curb by leos
     right in front of the car schuyler slams on the brakes 

     its david  he hurries around to the passenger door and jumps
     in looking haggard scared a man on the run 

                             david
                     drive  anywhere 

                             schuyler

     schuyler pulls forward

                             schuyler 
                         slowly evenly 
                     calm down  what are they doing to you 

                             david

     david slugs him in the face schuyler staggers back clutches his 
     bleeding nose  david runs full tilt into the woods near the
     japanese tea garden 

     schuyler pursues amidst the trees and vegetation running out of
     breath calling after david whos vanished  he leans against a 
     tree panting dabbing at his bleeding nose with a scrap of tissue
     from his pocket  he hears a phone ringing moves toward it
     emerging through bushes near the academy of science 

     he pauses at the ringing payphone  he decides not to pick it up 
     looking around at the deserted museum buildings and hurrying toward
     civilization  he passes other payphones en route to the park 
     exit each one starts ringing as he approaches it  he moves
     faster freaked  at the edge of the park he snatches one up 

                             schuyler on phone

     schuyler slams the phone down  he dabs his nose one more time
     tosses the paper scrap into the trash

     a hearing aid a round piece of plastic a tiny wire disappearing
     into his shirt  and theres something familiar about his face
     schuyler glances at the driver id on the back of the seat

     the cabbierasta hits the ground and rolls in a perfect stunt fall
     the cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and 

     goes flying off the edge into the san francisco bay illuminated
     by spotlights from the end of the wharf

     to his neck by now angry at himself for not realizing it sooner
     he pulls what he needs out of his pocket the handcrank he found
     in the dumpster  he takes a deep breath and 

     90 submerges  underwater he inserts the crank into the window
     handle hole a perfect fit  he cranks fast water floods in

     before  he proceeds to the checkin desk  before he can even 
     introduce himself the desk clerk turns to him with a tight smile

     doing here  he glances at a virgin mary statue squints then
     unscrews the head its a decanter  he takes a sniff and puts it
     back with a bemused expression  he takes another sniff noticing
     something else in the air

     a wisp of smoke rises from the lamp christine turned on 

     schuyler peers beneath the shade  on the table is a framed
     photograph of a little girl who could be christine in a frilly
     white dress holding flowers 

     angle inside lampshade a new pricetag dangles from the shade
     against the bulb starting to turn brown smoking 

     schuyler licks his fingertips reaches inside the shade to pull off
     tag in doing so he burns his fingers on the hot bulb stifles a

     schuyler curious now opens a cabinet absently drying his hand on

     schuyler picks up the photo to replace it on the table 

     angle on photo  schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard 
     mount its an advertisement clipped from a glossy magazine text
     printed on the portion previously unseen 

     schuyler quickly returns the clipping to its mount puts the photo
     back on the table as christine comes downstairs dressed and made
     up for a night on the town 

                             christine 
                     can you get us into chez panisse  i
                     always wanted to eat there 

     schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him 

                             schuyler
                     is that you

     he grabs her hand away  icily

                             schuyler
                     dont touch me 

     his tone alarms her he stares at her with hatred  a silent beat
     between them each tries to assess the new situation  she realizes
     hes onto her  she swallows makes a quick decision  suddenly she
     leans close to him reaching around him to shut off the table lamp
     she leaves her arms around him and hisses in his ear she drops
     her lowerclass accent speaks in a clipped educated voice 

                             christine 
                     dont be stupid  dont say anything

                        sickened to himself
                     god damn it 

     she kisses him he doesnt open his mouth neither shuts their
     eyes  then she gets up quickly moves to a corner of the room 

                             christine 
                       back in character accented 
                     ok i know a good place we could
                     go and like be alone

     she glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling 

     on ceiling a large smoke detector with a red light a cable from
     it theres a small lens in the center a hidden camera 

     schuyler looks at this starting to rise  she moves to a window
     out of range of the camera beckons him over

     he stares at her she looks sick and truly scared  he climbs in
     the car  for once without a comeback she gets in the car quietly

     they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly
     humble somewhat decrepit cabin on it  a flash of lightning

     rundown hewn wood fishing rods cobwebs rain damage dust
     water drips from the ceiling in a few places  lightning flashes in
     bg through the scene the storm has gotten pretty bad 

     schuyler finishes taking out his contacts dropping them in cups
     full of water he slips on his glasses then looks at a few framed
     family photos on the coffee table in front of him  christine
     barefoot brings him a cup of coffee which he sips gratefully 

                             schuyler

     schuyler gives her a sidelong glance looks back at a photo 

     on photo he rubs away the dust from a shot showing schuylers
     father with young schuyler on a boat with fishing equipment 

     christine takes a step and cries out clutching her foot and 
     sitting beside schuyler  a small fishhook protrudes from her foot 

                             schuyler
                     hold still 

     he talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot 

                             schuyler 
                     sorry this place hasnt been cleaned
                     in a while  my dad built it himself
                     spent a lot of time here alone
                         regards a leak
                     rotten carpenter

     he pulls out the hook puts it aside she rubs her foot 

                             christine

                     to hide right before he i even
                     look like the bastard 

     christine looks at the photo of mr van orton then at schuyler 

                             christine
                     not that much

                     gullible than he ever was

     the cellphone chirps schuyler shakes off his selfpity snatches
     up the handset 

                             schuyler

     during the following christines eyes go wide she shakes her head
     frantically draws a finger across her throat 

                             plympton filter 
                     ive been on the phone all morning your

                     theres been no activity whatsoever

     schuyler struggles to absorb the import of this as well as
     christines behavior  she shakes her head with a sigh rises to
     refill his coffee cup 

                             schuyler
                     wait thats not true 

                             plympton filter

                     it is true no one is after your 
                     money no one is trying to hurt you 

     schuyler looks at christine with horror  she nods and whispers 

                             christine
                     hes in on it 

                             schuyler

                     a while forget about everything
                     its all under control 

     schuyler hangs up breathing hard pacing clutching the phone 

                             schuyler 
                     we have to get out of here 

     christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee which he sips
     the phone chirps again schuyler throws it violently against the 
     wall its silenced  he gulps more coffee rising again looking
     at the smashed phone sickened by his own loss of control 

                             schuyler 
                     well that was stupid 

     christine watches him closely  he keeps balling his hands into
     fists as he paces trying to think out his next play 

                             schuyler 
                     ok theyve gotten to him  ok

                             christine 
                     its out of your hands 

     he takes a step stumbles shakes his head to clear it  she rises
     picks up his halfempty cup and heads for the kitchen area  his
     gaze follows this he realizes hes been drugged 

                             schuyler
                     christine

                             christine 
                     thats not my name 

     with a cry of rage he lunges after her but crashes into the wall
     clutching at a hanging rod which falls when he does he knocks
     over the table of photos as he goes down panting for air like a
     fish out of water clutching his stomach nauseated 

     his pov sideways low angle  sfx blood pounding in his head
     schuylers eyes follow the grooves of the wet warped hardwood
     floor they lead to and almost seem to point to christine 

     another angle close from the counter she picks up a small vial
     with a bit of powder at the bottom slips it into her pocket 

     schuylers eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the
     effects tries to get to his hands and knees  he gasps

                             schuyler
                     why

     christine approaches stands a few feet away lights a cigarette

                     cellular calls can be intercepted
                     rerouted yknow

     she crouches by him flicking ashes a few inches from his nose 

                             christine 
                     all those calls to switzerland and 
                     chase manhattan you were talking to

                     fucking stupid but thanks 

     he claws at her helplessly with a groan but misses  his glasses
     fall off he collapses again

     schuylers pov everything a blur now except in extreme fg the 
     photo of himself and his father which now lies on the floor

     dim light through cracks in the walls this is an old and moldering
     mausoleum other coffins nearby  fresh flowers surround his 
     resting place otherwise everything is completely decayed

     by the time schuyler gets out of the coffin his arms are bloodied
     hes been dressed in an allwhite burial suit  a red rose is taped
     to his chest  he blinks and stares about wildly 

     his pov blurry cant make out much 

     schuyler blinks breathing hard utterly freaked  he notices the
     rose on his chest tears it off sniffs it then throws it aside
     with a frustrated cry  he stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt
     tugs then realizes it opens the other way he gives it a push

     it collapses immediately  schuyler tumbles out of the crypt into
     the hot sunlight  hes in a ramshackle city of the dead a spanish
     graveyard  there are endless rows of tombs rioting tropical
     vegetation many flowers impossibly bright colors  it should be
     quite beautiful and peaceful

                             schuyler

     he walks around tentatively squinting  an old woman in black sits
     contemplating a grave fingering her rosary  schuyler slips a hand
     absently into his pocket and finds something there pulls it out 

     schuylers pov blurry shot of a note in spanish with a key on
     the stationery

     schuyler blinks slips the note in his pocket

     trying to wish it all away 

     a cop in beige uniform suddenly prods at him with a nightstick
     yelling at him in spanish to move on 

     schuylers pov the cop looming over him a blurry menace the end

     this doesnt seem to help  he tries to get away from the stick
     but the cop pursues  he bangs into people as he tries to move

     schuyler falls over a beggar on the ground in far worse shape than
     he is  the cop yells at him  schuyler covers his head holding 
     out the note with the key which the cop finally snatches away  he
     studies it for a moment then barks with laughter

     weapon  the punk throws his hands up scrambles to his feet

                     psycho pulled a knife on me 

     the cop has grabbed the still prone schuyler flipping him over and
     slapping a handcuff on him

     the cop has dropped his guard the punk spins and bolts into the
     next car squeezing through the door  the transit cop hastily
     cuffs schuyler to an armrest 

                             transit cop
                     wait here

     he dashes into the next car after the punk  schuyler looks at the
     floor of the car sees 

     the small radio and its earplug attached by a wire  the radio has
     a tiny looprabbit ear antenna on it  he snatches it up then
     yanks at the cuff  he spots the knife under the seat grabs it
     starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post

     from the next car he hears shouts screams a serious commotion
     going on he doesnt know whos winning  schuylers almost gotten
     free as the train slows when 

     the door at the far end of the car opens its the punk bruised
     and bloody ready to kill 

     he lunges at schuyler just as he pries the armrest off the seat and
     clobbers him with it  the punk reels back  the train has stopped
     the doors have opened schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out
     onto the platform just before they shut again

     schuyler emerges and walks quickly checking over his shoulder
     blinking in the bright morning sun  he fiddles with the radio the
     plug to his ear  we hear static bleeping noises filtered voices
     for a few moments the voices on the radio become clearer 

                             radio voice 1 
                     cant let him get away with this

                     button and well all be dead 

     schuyler listens intently leaning against a wall in the shadows
     breathing hard  he stares nervously at a couple of nearby street
     people huddled by a shopping cart they stare back  another voice
     on the radio talks over the first 

                             radio voice 2

     recognizing the voice of radio dj howard stern

                     ugh we gotta do commercials this is

                     they own the whole building they
                     just move from floor to floor 

     schuyler takes this in for a moment thinking 

                             schuyler 
                     ok they know you youve worked for

                             feingold 
                        shaking his head 
                     uhuh im sorry and all but

                     no way its too dangerous

     schuyler cocks his head steps in front of him  right in his face

                             schuyler 
                     you dont seem to understand  right

     feingold gets the message 

                                                  dissolve to

     182  e x t    c r s   b u i l d i n g    n i g h t 

     lights off in the building  a battered station wagon rounds a
     corner pauses before the ramp to the garage entrance the same
     garage he and christine were once tormented in 

     183  i n t    s t a t i o n   w a g o n    n i g h t 

     feingold drives looking very tense a kiddie seat strapped next to
     him junk galore hes apparently alone 

                             feingold 
                     were here sky  they said theyre on
                     the twelfth floor 

     behind the seat schuyler crouches under a blanket 

                             schuyler
                     drive in then 

                             feingold 
                     look what are you gonna do  really 

                             schuyler 
                     really i dont know  improvise  go 

     183a  i n t    c r s   g a r a g e    n i g h t 

     the station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp  a beefy gate
     guard behind glass glares at feingold who waves timidly  the
     steel gate rises and the station wagon drives in 

     the station wagon parks near an elevator bank a handful of cars a
     few white crs security vehicles and vans parked nearby  feingold
     climbs out trying hard not to look scared  elevator doors open 
     and a beefy frighteninglooking security man in a suit steps out
     he looks around carefully as feingold joins him  he takes
     feingolds arm and pulls him toward the elevator  they wait

     schuylers pov from the back seat just as the doors open the
     gate guard steps up behind feingold puts a gun in his back 

                             gate guard 
                     youre not authorized to be here 

     he fires schuyler glimpses a spray of blood feingold collapses
     the security man grabs the body as it falls starts dragging it out
     of sight while the gate guard puts a hand to his ear talks into a
     minitransmitter in his other hand  he follows the security man
     out of sight  the elevator doors remain open 

     with the guards out of sight schuyler rises slowly  he looks
     stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously sneaking 
     behind vehicles  the main gate is sealed he has no idea how long
     the guards will be gone  the open elevator doors beckon 

     schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards starts finding

     close a rubber bug on its back 

     schuyler creeps military style on hands and knees the rest of the 
     way to the elevator  he puts a hand in some of feingolds blood
     winces then gets in the elevator 

     184  i n t    c r s   e l e v a t o r    n i g h t 

     schuyler presses the button for 12 the top floor 

     on panel nothing happens the button lights for an instant but 
     goes out again  the elevator wont move

     schuylers getting exasperated 

     on panel he tries buttons allover same story 

                             gate guard
                     yo 

     angle into garage the gate guard jogs toward the elevators
     pulling his gun 

     schuyler starts to panic pulls his own gun and points it at the
     guard who freezes and raises his hands  behind him the security
     man approaches schuyler from a different angle his gun out 

     schuyler cant get a bead on both of them 

                             security man
                     youre a dead man 

     schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel 

     at base of panel a gold keyhole  closer the letters crs are
     printed beneath it very small 

     schuyler shakes his head it couldnt be but what else can he do

     angle into garage the guards are fanning out and getting closer 

     schuyler reaches with one hand for his keys fumbling for the small 
     gold key he received at the start of the game 

     on panel his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key it
     fits into the hole he turns it and pushes the button for 12 

     wider as the doors close both guards train their guns but too
     late  schuylers on his way up 

     184a the glass elevator rises through completely blackened spaces 

     schuyler stares at a bullet hole in the back of the glass elevator
     a remnant of feingolds murder  he holds the gun in front of 
     himself in both hands then he closes his eyes steeling himself
     almost in an attitude of prayer 

     185  i n t    a t r i u m    n i g h t 

     pitch black but for the lit elevator ascending swiftly through the
     darkness schuyler like a solitary spaceship pilot looks upward
     toward his unknown destination 

     186  i n t    c r s   e l e v a t o r    n i g h t 

     the digital readout slows as it comes to 10 11 and stops at 12 

     schuyler comes out of his trance slips the revolver back into his 
     jacket pocket keeps a hand there and stands against a wall of the
     elevator as the doors open on 

     187  i n t    1 2 t h   f l o o r   c o m m i s s a r y    n i g h t 

     a bustling noisy commissary  schuyler keeps the gun concealed
     as he steps out of the elevator nobody here is paying any 
     attention to him anyway  theres a cafeteria style counter along
     one wall people chatting and laughing at formica tables amongst
     others everyone from his game appears to be here theres the 
     rasta the paramedics with the heart attack victim john and pete
     from the mens club the girl from the boat the desk clerk and 
     bellhop also the honduran truck driver the security people from
     his house the punk and the transit cop and a lot of engineers 

     schuyler inches into the room meets the eyes of 

     christine whos just come away from the cafeteria counter with a
     tray of food  she nearly drops it looks over her shoulder to see
     if anyone is watching  suddenly schuyler is in front of her 
     backs her into an alcove she holds the tray between them as if to
     protect herself

                             christine 
                     what are youdoinghere 

     for a moment schuylers not sure  his voice is flat monotonal

                             schuyler 
                     im back from the dead 

                             christine

                     touched your money nobody stole a
                     thing thats impossible 

                             schuyler

                     i wanna know whos behind this who 
                     did this to me how why 

                             christine
                     its just a game 

     even though shes keeping a surface cool he notices the glass and
     silverware on her tray rattling  she starts to move toward a
     table he blocks her path 

                             schuyler 
                     youre not going anywhere 
                     feingold or or fisher was that
                     just a game too 

                             christine 
                     what are you talking about

                             schuyler 
                     i watched him die

     schuyler shows her his bloodstained hand  christine looks utterly
     perplexed then shrugs finding a place to put down her tray 

                             schuyler 
                     seemed like a nice guy actually
                     father of three 

                             christine 
                     well look im sure its just
                     another stunt that cant be 
                     real taste it

                             schuyler 
                     you taste it you fucking vampire 

     he pushes his palm in her face she flinches swipes him away then
     puts a finger to her ear as 

     the elevator doors open and the guard and security man from
     downstairs burst into the commissary 

     suddenly the room quiets many others are touching their ears 

     they all turn in the direction of schuyler and christine  the gate
     guard gestures at schuyler attempting a smile 

                             gate guard 
                     could you come with us please 
                     youre not authorized to be here 

     schuyler grabs christine wraps an arm around her throat puts his
     gun to her neck 

                             schuyler
                     back off  everybody back off 

     he uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally
     toward the nearest door she chokes and gasps

     188  i n t    s t a i r w e l l    n i g h t 

     the door shuts behind them the stairs only lead up

                             schuyler
                     shit how do we get out 

     christine stomps his foot and elbows his gut breaks free and bolts
     up the stairs  schuyler catches his breath and pursues  beneath
     him the stairwell door opens guards pursue

     a high ledge surrounds the roof on all four sides a roof entrance
     at each side as well  the number 636 is painted large for
     helicopters there are air conditioning vents ducts etc  a
     muffled alarm sounds as christine bursts through the door followed
     by schuyler  she spins her back to the edge of the atrium a 
     black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken glass skylight a
     white railing around it 

     schuyler slams the door a large number 1 painted on it in blue
     he throws the heavy bolt  he and christine circle each other 
     warily his gun trained on her  pounding from the other side
     muffled voices that cant be heard 

     for the first time christine focuses on the gun in his hand then
     clutches the railing 

                             christine 
                     wait a minute  whats that 

     schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child 

                             schuyler

                             schuyler 
                     guess you fucked up again 

     christine touches her ear listening to something then puts her
     hand to her mouth speaks urgently 

                             christine 
                     hes armed hes got a real gun 
                     real situation real 

     schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the ear piece and
     hand mike away from christine the wire tears her blouse open 

                             schuyler 
                     yeah its real all right

                     stop it  every word out of your
                     mouth is a lie 

     christines desperately panicked fumbling for words

                     the key  they we gave you a key
                     to the elevator  why would we do 
                     that  we wanted you to come up 

                             schuyler

                     me or or frame me for murder

                             christine

                     door and ill show you 

     schuyler hesitates a moment looking in the direction of the door 

                             schuyler 
                     i open the door and i die 

     on the door pounding desperate but the alarm drowns out the
     sounds of voices on the other side 

     schuyler turns quickly as she takes a step towards him  he points
     the gun at her again  he looks ready to use it  the following
     dialog overlaps and collides growing aural chaos 

                             schuyler 
                     you move again i swear ill kill

                     shut up shut the fuck up 

     axes dent the metal door which bulges 

     he looks at the monitor in his hand the one he tore from her body
     putting it in his own ear letting the rest of the device dangle 

                             radio voice filter

     schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead the gun trembling
     in his hand  christines regaining control  schuylers mind
     whirls he groans almost crying as he considers for the first time
     that she might be telling the truth  she steps closer

                             christine 
                     youre all right its ok just relax

     he looks at her almost ready to lower the gun  he raises his
     bloody hand to his lips about to taste it 

                             radio voice filter

     schuylers eyes dart toward

     another doorway on the other side of the atrium like the one
     thats bolted  the number 2 is painted on it in red  the handle
     starts to turn just as 

     christine lunges at him to wrest the gun away 

     schuyler comes to his senses struggling  the gun goes off the
     report should be deafening 

     he spins points the gun at door 2 and fires again several times
     the alarm stops silence 

     christine stiffens falls backwards onto the ground clutching her
     blooddrenched stomach  schuyler just stares  dark blood spills 
     from her mouth as she chokes in pain

                             christine
                     oh god  i blew it we blew it

     door 2 opens and 

     david steps through  he wears a brightly colored silly looking
     party hat carries a magnum of champagne bearing a huge bow that
     reads surprise  blood pumps from his chest  he drops the
     bottle which shatters david collapses amidst the broken glass 

     a blow of the axe severs the deadbolt and door 1 flies open behind
     schuyler  feingold is the first of a group to come charging 
     through he wears a tuxedo with a rose in the lapel holds the axe

     schuyler spins points the gun at this axewielding man then
     utterly stunned lowers it in disbelief 

     feingold looks from schuyler to the wounded christine her agony
     is painful to watch  he drops the axe with a clatter and runs to
     her side kneels  his voice cracks 

                             feingold 
                     youshother  no
                       looking toward david 
                     qh god no 

     the guard and security man come out on the roof looking very
     disturbed followed by the rasta and a few others  many are
     dressed for a party now  feingold looks to their horrified faces 

                             feingold 
                     he fuckingshotthem 

                             rasta 
                     ill call an ambulance 

     the rasta dashes downstairs  schuyler backs away drops the gun
     staggers over to david  hes gasping for breath  crs employees 
     give the brothers a wide berth move toward feingold and christine

                             schuyler 
                     david david no no 

                             david

                     dont wanna die i dont wanna

                     youre not gonna die  im here
                     youre not gonna die 

     davids already dead eyes wide body limp 

     with feingold and christine  he holds his colorful cummerbund over 
     her stomach to staunch the bleeding  she chokes in pain

                             feingold
                     hang on just hang on youre
                     gonna make it 

                             christine
                     that stupid 

     they stare over at schuyler registering davids death  schuyler
     is now drenched in his brothers blood rocking him in his arms
     most of the assorted crs people move to get out of the building
     before the cops show murmuring amongst themselves in fear 

                             feingold 
                     oh god  i thought you could 
                     handle it  all the tests they
                     said you could handle it

     christine yells at schuyler unable to stand 

                             christine 
                     you fucking psycho you piece of 
                     shit how could you 

     schuyler gently lowers his brother and rises like a zombie now
     the big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it
     keeping it out of his reach 

     schuyler backs away from the body starts to shake looks as if he
     really has lost his mind  feingold sobs aloud

                             feingold 
                     god why there was no point  it was
                     supposed to be fun

     schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded christine who
     gasps silent curses beyond speech to davids body

     he slowly turns to the atrium pit directly in front of him  hes
     strangely calm

                             schuyler
                     fun 

     shift to slow motion 

     schuyler moves for the edge of the atrium pit

     the others react in horror shout no lunging toward him

     davids head suddenly moves he blinks

     schuyler leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit

     christine jumps to her feet perfectly alert a hand extended
     screaming just as 

     schuyler catapults himself into space and

     david sits bolt upright 

                             david 
                     sky noooo

     schuyler sees this too late 

     he and david make terrified helpless eye contact across the void 
     arms outstretched  schuyler has time to register his irrevocable
     error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an
     agonizing moment 

     then he falls  leave slow motion

     190  i n t    a t r i u m    n i g h t 

     schuyler crashes through the skylight tumbling sparkling shards 
     surround him like stars as he plunges spins screaming 

     191 rapid cuts the clown christines face schuyler and david
     as children his fathers head striking the landing  these flash
     past so rapidly we cant quite process them 

     192 intercut with  increasing darkness ground rushing closer 

     on schuylers face as he experiences the epiphany that comes before
     the end  brilliant angelic light suddenly illuminates him his
     eyes roll into his head closing 

     angle from above the lights are real theyve come on to show 

     schuylers impact he lands on his back arms outstretched eyes
     squeezed shut 

     and is swallowed by an enormous inflated lifesaving cushion that
     covers the floor of the atrium 

     schuyler bounces in the cushion a few times gradually coming to a
     rest harmless bits of breakaway glass showering down around him 

     he doesnt move a muscle his eyes still closed 

     closer on his face muscles twitch  his eyes open 

     his pov up the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the 
     building around the atrium  the full moon in the very center
     through the hole in the glass 

     all the lighted glass elevators come to earth packed with people

     schuyler stares upward mouth open motionless 

     david comes running from an elevator leaps up onto the cushion and
     bounces over to schuyler a huge smile on his face 

                             david 
                     hey bro how you doin 

     getting no response david hops closer squats by schuylers side 

                             david 
                     admit it you werent bored

     schuyler remains motionless davids worried now grabs his arm and
     starts shaking him

                             david 
                     jesus  sky cmon sky 

     schuyler begins to laugh a tremendous catharsis  david laughs
     too greatly relieved as he helps schuyler to his feet 

     the two brothers clutch each other for support on the bouncing 
     surface laughing  crs employees have gathered around the cushion
     cheering and applauding 

     schuyler wipes his eyes shaking his head with amazement  then he
     hauls back and slugs david in the jaw sending him flying onto his 
     back on the cushion  more cheers from the crowd as if they were
     watching a boxing match

     the hallelujah chorus from handels messiah plays  schuyler and 
     david enter together from the atrium the cushion deflates behind
     them  david licks blood from his lips rubs his jaw 

                             david 
                     youve been wanting to do that for
                     a long long time havent you 

     schuyler halfsmiles  the security man unlocks schuylers 
     handcuffs giving him back his gun which schuyler stares at 

                             david 
                     like theyd really leave a loaded gun
                     lying around  they went over the 
                     whole place with a metal detector 
                     then packed that thing with blanks 

     they turn a corner into the main lobby schuyler absently pockets
     the gun looks up in wonder

     schuylers pov a surprise party  a stereo streamers and
     balloons a champagne fountain cake and food  crs employees
     mostly ordinarylooking office workers clap and cheer for
     schuyler  they wear party hats blow plastic horns 

     smiling people eager to offer congratulations surround him  hes
     pretty shaky like a newborn calf  john and pete shake his hand

                             john 
                     good one buddy really had you

                             a wink
                     joke 

     the rasta slaps his back schuyler instinctively looks over his
     shoulder for a gag message

                             rasta 
                     that look on your face up there

     the boat kisses his cheek  technicians men with stunts unlimited
     tshirts the nurse from the asylum the security people crs
     guards agents all want a piece of him at once 

     the messiah fades and an r  b band breaks into rousing music as
     feingold approaches and sticks a cigar in his mouth lights it 

                             feingold 
                     sure glad you jumped compadre

     arm  her voice is soft for the first time accents gone
