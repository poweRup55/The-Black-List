moments carol starts to speak but doesnt he is
preoccupied lost in his own thoughts

his coat folds it lays it on the grass then turns and
starts walking towards a tree

suddenly he takes off his shoes breaks into a run and dives
for the rope

carol is already on her feet her sweater off shoes kicked
aside she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward
splash she is a brief second behind him

they come up together and he laughs with the pure joy of
being free and alive she joins him in his laughter and with
their arms around each other they turn as they are swept
down stream

as carol places both of her arms around him holding him
tightly

doc unsnaps the top fastener the second one catches remains
unyielding he closes his eyes for a second the pressure
of the moment is again too intense for doc once more he
pulls gently away from her carol looks at him her eyes very
reassuring

and examines it the patient pants in relief

as the bulbs dim

doc running down the sewer stopping at the manhole he
scrambles up the permanent ladderway tossing his wire
cutters up into the truck parked over him

carol  in the drivers seat  again she tries to start the
engine

doc pulling himself back up into the van with a gymnastic
thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs

carol  the engine still wont start

doc drops the hatch door back down into place on the floor of
the truck

                       doc
                 snapping his look to carol
             okay

carol turns the ignition switch back on

carol  as the engine roars to life she engages the
gearshift the truck begins to move forward suddenly the
motor does stall

docs pace tightens the cars behind the van continue
honking

carol  again grinding away at the engine her lips are
compressed into a thin line after a moment the motor
catches the truck again moves forward

doc picks up the large black suitcase from the floor of the
panel truck then begins to move toward the cab and carol

the panel truck whips off main street and onto a side avenue
carol pulls the van up to the curbway jerking to a stop

doc is now in the front seat beside carol he pulls the truck
door open then hesitates he touches her arm their eyes
meet briefly both their faces warming for a moment doc
gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck

on the sidewalk

doc turns and begins walking toward an open alleyway behind
him the panel truck pulls smoothly away

walking up the alley  doc pulls on a pair of black gloves
he turns again now moving down a totallydeserted side alley

the alley opens at one end onto a back street the opposite
end is bounded by a large brick building doc removes his
pistol from his coat pocket then approaches a doorway along
the side of the brick building at the last moment he pulls
down the watch cap mask

int bank

rudy disengages the latch on the side door

ext alley

doc kicks the door open with a violent jerk of his leg

int the bank

rudys gun is trained prom the back of the building over the
tellers and patrons spreadeagled across the floor their
heads are down several of them are trembling

doc stands holding the 45 in one hand suitcase in the
other he moves into the building shutting the door behind
him

rudy is now stationed near the front door ready to intercept
any incoming bank patrons  he covers the room from the end
opposite jackson

rudy stands near the bank guards outstretched right hand 
the guards head is bloodied from rudys pistol whipping his
gun has been kicked against the wall a short distance away
rudy is watching

the bank president lies face down on the floor directly
under the arc of jacksons gun who is continually turning
to watch the guard

doc quickly crosses the distance between the side door and
the vault passing the bank president he slips the 45 into
his jacket side pocket sets down the suitcase then either
cuts the lock or picks it

                    rudy
              looking at his watch

carol  in the van  she has stopped the panel truck near the
deserted lot where the hay truck is parked

she drops the bombladen grocery bag inside the truckbed she
moves back towards the van

in the bank

doc finishes rips the door open lifts the suitcase and
moves into the vault

rudy looks at the bloodied guard notes the distance
separating the man from his gun though unconscious the
guards head begins to move

jackson holds his gun hand fully extended again he takes a
brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and
at the guard

angles and inserts  the vault is lined with safety deposit
boxes and large cabinet drawers

a metal table stands offcenter the black suitcase resting
on its surface doc opens the satchel he then pulls open one
of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money
pads into the open suitcase

the bank president lies near the open vault he listens to
the sounds of doc at work he slightly cranes his neck
trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault

rudy watching the front door a patron enters rudy gestures
with the gun she hits the deck

jackson is getting more nervous by the minute

doc continues working within the vault

the woman now on the floor quietly crying

jackson watching the guard

rudy watching jackson calling out time

the bank guard glassyeyed but conscious he has the look
of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout but is
ready for one more round

the bank president in his prone position he looks at
jackson then to the vault

the panel truck  now at the other end of main street

carol exits the van carries the second sack to a large
rubbish bin in front of an empty store she deposits the
grocery bag

doc working the suitcase is now filled he snaps the
fasteners shut 

doc exits the vault after withdrawing his 45 from his coat
pocket 

jackson sees doc leave the vault he edges around the side of
the tellers cages toward the front of the bank

doc moves towards jacksons old vantage point near the side
door he passes the bank president

rudy now watches doc

doc carries the heavy suitcase in his left hand he gestures
to rudy and jackson with his pistol while moving towards the
side door

jackson half runs passing rudy on his way to the front
entrance still watching the bank guard

the bank guard still punch drunk pulls himself up to his
hands and knees the guard looks at his pistol

doc stops at the kicked in side door he covers the entire
bank with his gun

the bank guard begins to crawl with agonizing slowness
towards his pistol

rudy eyes still on doc

jackson now at the front door is paralyzed watching the
guard

doc gestures to rudy and jackson to get moving

ext street  day

                      doc
                shouts
            just pick it up

                      rudy

jackson pulls the trigger three times

the bank guards body turns endoverend from jacksons
bullets some of the bank patrons scream others sob with
fright

doc  his eyes are furious

rudy and jackson  rudy shoves jackson out the front door

doc covers their exit then slips out the side door and into
the alley

ext main street

rudy guns the buick forward the wheels tearing at the
asphalt jacksons shoulders rock back as the big car
accelerates

                    the alley
          doc gun and suitcase in hand nears the
          end of the alleyway

carol  in a ford  suddenly pulls up filling the roadway
opening

doc tosses the suitcase into the back of the car then
slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel
as carol slides over to the passenger seat

int the ford

doc pulls off the watch cap mask his face taut

the ford smokes off as doc kicks it into gear

main street beacon city a series of angles

the buick streaks down the center of the roadway two bombs
detonate into fireballs the hay truck blazes upward bales
instantly igniting

the grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange
flame inferno

traffic stalls on the boulevard drivers and pedestrians gawk
at the twin blazes

rudy zig zags the buick along maneuvering through the
stopped traffic

doc slides the ford through a right and left turn emerging
onto smokecovered main street

the speeding ford avoids a halting car then suddenly spins
out of control jumps across the sidewalk splinters a wood
bench and finally slides in a complete circle across the
grass of a small park

int ford 

doc looks more than a little embarrassed as carol stares

at him

police cars roar by them

ext small park

doc zips the car off the grass and back onto the traffic
clogged roadway

rudy driving through the bedlam suddenly a gun appears in
his right hand aimed at jackson the pistol roars bucks
roars bucks again jackson is shot through the head twice

the ford is several blocks behind rudy doc downshifts
avoiding stalled cars carol grasps at both the seat and the
dashboard handholds to maintain her balance

the buick emerges through dense plumes of smoke fire licks
along the one edge of the sidewalk

rudy in the buick has now almost cleared the town he tears
along the highway sweating a little but becoming cool he
is a pro his watch cap is now removed

on the curve  jacksons body is kicked out of the automobile
and bounces across the pavement

doc in the ford powers along he approaches the flaming
building then hits the brakes as 

a big diesel truck and trailer is coming in the opposite
direct ion jackknifes across the road desperately trying
to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street 

doc as the truck and trailer suddenly appear through the
smoke in front of him throws the car broadside into a four
wheel drift now sideways then straight he bumps across the
sidewalk over a patio of a house knocking down two pillars
through a parking lot taking with it a large cleaners sign
then bores back onto the road

rudy in the buick stroking along the open highway looks in
the rear view mirror

rudys pov  through the buicks rear window black smoke is
visible billowing skyward

doc and carol in the ford now driving calmly through the
countryside a police car with light turning and siren
wailing passes them heading for the conflagration in beacon
city docs eyes follow the patrol car until it disappears
from sight

the buick  series of angles  it pulls off the highway and
bumps down a dirt road rudy strains to hold the big car on
the rutted pathway

the dirt road becomes a lane

a farm house and barn appear at a clearing rudy powers the
car up a fairly steep hill the crest of which is occupied by
a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn

rudy jumps out of the buick trots to the front of the barn
and pulls the doubledoors open a station wagon with wooden
panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within

the ford sweeps off the highway and onto the dirt road

within the ford  doc is driving carol peels off her
sweater she has worn a faded blouse underneath she pulls
a ribbon her hair falls changing her appearance

rudy  in the barn  the buick is now parked near the station
wagon standing in the shadows he intently reloads his gun
then moves towards the large doors of the barn

carol  in the passenger seat of the ford  she watches as
doc drives up the lane

rudy stands outside the barn as the car approaches

doc studies rudy through the windshield watching him wipe
his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer

int barn

doc pulls the ford to a stop just within the double doors he
passes rudy leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway
station wagon

doc jumps out of the ford as soon as the ignition switch is
cut carol a beat behind him on the opposite side

rudy moves into the archway created by the barns open doors
he stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks
around him

doc snaps open the door of the car his back turned to rudy
he reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase
not by the middle handle but by each end as if it contained
a great weight

                      doc
                speaking over his shoulder
                 not looking at rudy
            wheres jackson

rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat

                    rudy
              pointing his gun lazily at
               doc supremely confident
          he didnt make it doc you didnt
          either

doc straightens still holding the suitcase he starts to
turn to rudy eyes wide helpless carol fumbles for the gun
in her purse

rudy extends his arm ready to begin the execution doc
swings the suitcase around slowly seemingly ready to face
rudys bullets then he shoots rudy in the middle of the
chest docs 45 slug driving him backward

doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel he
drops the suitcase with his first shot fires again blasting
rudy in the middle two large holes now show at the chest of
rudys raincoat

rudy is knocked back over the hillock tumbling down the
precipice and into a grassy meadow below doc stands at the
crest of the hill he looks down as rudys body stops
turning doc shifts the 45 to his right hand

rudys body lies still

doc turns quickly away prom the hilltop not giving rudys
body a second glance carol gun in hand stands outside the
barn transfixed

                    carol
          how did you know

doc doesnt answer motioning her into the car the getaway
car as she starts to change clothes he reloads doc
takes a long look at carol

they get in the car and leave

ext bottom op hill  day

carol is driving tooling comfortably along a country road
doc is beside her the suitcase resting in the back seat
after several moments of silence

                    carol
          what about the bank

                    doc
              after a moment
          jackson panicked and nailed the guard

carol takes a deep breath then turns her look at the side
window

                    carol
          oh christ

doc leans forward snaps on the radio

ext abandoned farm  day

rudy butler stumbles back over the crest op the hillock and
onto the pathway in front of the barn his figure is slightly
grotesque the raincoat shows two holes from docs 45 slugs
along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on
his assovertea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill he is
obviously in some pain his walk is a halflurch

ext side of the barn  day

rudy turns on a rusted tap which sends allpocketed water
gurgling down into a moldcovered trough rudy pulls off the
yellow raincoat revealing the fact he has worn one of the
padded bulletproof vests rudy undoes the vest lets it fall
to his feet a huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone

rudy touches the blood with his right hand then looks at his
hand breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash
the purling water across his face and then he laughs

int station wagon  day

dialogue comes on the radio describing the robbery 750000
stolen

                    doc
          we got between four and five

carol starts to open the bag and count

doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing doc
reflectively studies the roadside ahead they are heading
along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that
carries only a sparse amount of traffic

docs eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead

                    carol
              now noticing the road
          doc

                     doc
              flat
          i see it

on the road ahead highway patrolmen have formed a traffic
barricade several cars and trucks are being waved through
the checkpoint wearing sunglasses and stetson hats the
uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing
vehicle

doc analyzes the situation without changing expression he
slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line
of slowlypassing vehicles

she turns starts to reach into the back doc gently catches
her arm preventing her from moving further

                    doc contd
          theyre looking for three men
          remember

a young officer looks into the cab of the pickup then
glances at the empty flatbed another patrolman flanks the
other side of the truck repeating the procedure several
patrol cars fully loaded with additional officers are
parked nearby the pickup truck is waved through the station
wagon rolls up to the checkpoint

doc rolls down his window he smiles and nods to the young
patrolman

                    doc contd
              big smile
          whats the problem

carol studies the officer on her side of the car through the
closed window the officer peers back at her then into the
rear seat

the station wagon is waved ahead without a second glance by
the patrolman doc accelerates away from the roadblock
after a moment doc leans forward snapping on the radio

ext the farm  rudy  day

inside the barn behind the wheel of the panel truck rudys
matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face he
starts the engine painfully bringing it to a roar the panel
truck leaps crazily forward careening across the barn floor

out into the sunlight

the wagon continues moving down the road

ext a narrow dirt road  late afternoon

two hours before sunset a chill southwest wind is blowing
the station wagon appears moving slowly down the roadway
bouncing along its rutted surface

at a small intersection two mail boxes stand close to one
another the name beynon is printed in black paint on one of
the letter bins doc stops the wagon momentarily looks at
the box then turns down the indicated road

ext the station wagon  late afternoon

of the house as he shuts off the engine he pulls the 45
out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband
carol watches the gesture doc starts to open the car door
then hesitates

                    doc
          you can wait here ill wrap it up
          fast

doc steps out of the wagon then pulls the leather suitcase
out of the back he quietly shuts the car door and moves
around the side of the house toward the barngarage at the
rear

he looks carefully around the area his eyes searching for
signs of beynons men nothing seemingly amiss he moves
toward the front door tries it moves away

                    doc
          no applause

beynon pauses a moment doc looks steadily across the table
into beynonts eyes prom beyond there might be the quiet
sound of a screen door opening beynon gets out of the chair
stands beside the table

                    beynon
          lets examine the situation one an

          man who can easily get a parole for a
          convict why should he

beynon sips his glass slowly docs hand edges down toward
his waist band

                    beynon contd
              continuing
          a simple reason mccoy the obvious
          reason to rob a bank

                    doc
          i knew that life didnt add up to the
          obvious when i was 8

                    beynon
              cautiously
          what do you add up to here

                    doc
          one the radios rappin about 750000
          we only got a half a million

                    beynon
          a little more was taken out before
              a beat
          my brothers a director of that bank mr
          mccoy i had a few pressing debts

                    doc
          so we did that crackerbox to cover for
          you

                     beynon
              smiles nodding
          the obvious
              as his smile fades
          but we are both not interested in that
          right now

                    doc
          no
              a long beat
          my old lady must have made a lot of
          promises

                    beynon
          close but it takes a hell of a lot
          more than promises to pull the kind of
          strings i pulled

                    doc
          i bet

doc senses a movement from the shadows behind beynon turning
his head slightly doc can see carol standing at the entrance
to the kitchen she holds a 32 automatic the pistol seems
to be pointed directly at doc

carol fires the automatic the big gun belches the full slip
in a stuttering explosion the slide remains back and in an
ejected position

beynon is driven back to the kitchen wall he shrieks aloud
the noise strangely like laughter his body flattens
against the surface slips downward riddled by the big bore
slugs doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned
table he looks up from beynons crumpled body carol takes
two steps forward then drops the automatic sending it
clattering and spinning away across the floor

doc looks at carol their eyes find each other he turns
moves to the sink splashes water across his face then fills
a glass of water from the tap  drinks it he looks back at
her

carol stands watching doc tears scream down her cheeks

doc crosses to carol takes her arm picks up the gun spent
shells and the suitcase then leads her out of the kitchen
toward the back door beynons body has slipped from sight
only a few traces of blood show along the white wall

the station wagon is parked along the cement road standing
in isolation against the vast texas bg

doc stands away from the car his back turned to it 
gazing at the horizon

carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open
her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the
ground doc suddenly turns walks to her and gives her a
stinging slap across the face

                    doc

tears begin to roll down carols face

                    doc contd

int multistoried auto park  san antonio  day

the station wagon enters the building doc takes a bright
orange ticket from an attendant behind a glass window then
accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper
levels of the building

                    doc
          checks his watch momentarily as he prowls
          the wagon between long rows of
          automobiles

the station wagons tires

whine through a sweeping turn within the auto parks
uppermost level  through the buildings portals the bright
morning sun can be seen reflecting off the citys rooftops

doc pulls the wagon to an abrupt halt within a parking stall 
 at an isolated area he steps out onto the concrete
flooring slams the door shut

doc turns away from the car as he approaches the elevator
doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops
them into a trash bin without missing a stride

int train station  morning

carol is standing in a ticket line that moves slowly foward
she struggles clutching the heavy money laden suitcase and
her oversize purse between both arms the line of ticket
buyers moves forward just fast enough to make it impractical
to set the suitcase down the station is ancient vaultlike
baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend
off into clumped rows within the wings of the station

carol approaches the ticket window she places the suitcase
flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in
place with one leg carol pops open her purse a clumsy
item in itself as she lifts her wallet and the elderly
ticketseller looks across to her

                    carol
          two day coach tickets  on the flyer

                    ticketseller
          thirtyfour fiftysix with tax leaves in
          fortyfive minutes gate three

carol pays the tariff places the tickets into her purse
along with the change wearily she labors the satchel back
into her hand then turns and begins to slowly walk down the
seemingly acreswide station promenade

near a portico within the main lobby carol sits
uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench  the suitcase rests
on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles she glances
across the promenade walls her eyes finding

a clock reading 940

on a lobby bench  later

carol stares across the room at the scattering of passengers
waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her

carols nervous boredom increases she looks down at her lap
pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins
rubbing the cuticles carol finally rises impulsively from
the bench immediately reaching for the brown leather
satchel

carol walks back down the promenade while carrying   the
suitcase as other baggageladen passengers scurry   around
her she looks across the arcade her eyes finding   a glass
walled cocktail lounge she hesitates then begins   to trudge
in that direction

a bank of lockers stands near the cocktail lounge as carol
approaches an elderly woman deposits a coin in one of the
numbered lockers opens the metal door and places a small
suitcase inside closing and relocking the door the woman
quickly moves away having noted the woman and more than
tired of hauling her burden around the station carol steps
to the end locker takes a quarter out of her purse then
studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
of the locker she slips the quarter into the slot and opens
the locker door as carol bends to pick up the suitcase the
locker door swings closed she tries to open it but the
door has relocked itself carol quite disgusted with her
predicament again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
out of her change purse as she again reads the numbered
directions a young man appears at her shoulder

the man is a prototype of urban sleaziness doberman pinscher
features are broken by a weedybrown moustache a cheap
corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie the
mans appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness

                    dapper man
          kind of tricky isnt it

she turns startled by his sudden proximity in one smooth
movement the dapper man plucks the quarter from carols hand
deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open
setting the heavy suitcase inside he closes the door tests
it to show that it

has been relocked then removes the key from the lock and
puts it into carols hand she is intimidated momentarily by
the mans sudden appearance and forcefulness as well as his
intentions

                       carol
          thank you

                    dapper man
              toothy grin
          no trouble lady

stepping backward his canine features disappear into a
welter of station activity carol watches his receding figure
for a moment then simultaneously placing the key into her
purse she turns and begins moving towards the cocktail
lounge

int barn  day

empty cages stacked along a wooden wall

a young kitten in a cardboard box wrestling with the barrel
of a 44 a thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the
fur along the cats neck and backbone

rudy butler is preoccupied with the cat giving little
attention to the thirtyish man standing nearby

harold clinton puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the
medical bag rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn
like animal hospital the large room is lined with stalls
cages and pens many of them vacant

the wonded criminal is barechested a plaster cast has been
attached to his left arm and shoulder

fran clinton sits on a high wooden stool opposite   rudy five
years younger than her husband tight sweater and   skirt

suggests sensuality frans bare milkwhite legs   are crossed
under her rumpled skirt

                    rudy
              to harold

                    harold
          collar bone is broken no infection
          yet the bandages should be changed
          twice a day

                    rudy
          i got a nurse in mind

                    harold
              going along oblivious to the
               implication
          the glucose will begin working in half an
          hour youll feel better then

                     rudy
              flashing a grin despite the
               pain
          the three of us are going to do some
          traveling were going to take your car
          to el paso

                    harold

                    rudy
          is it possible mrs clinton

                    fran

               friendly

rudy looks back down at the gun and cat the following
silence is like a scream finally

                    rudy
          what kind of car do you have harold

                    fran

he points the gun at mrs clinton

                    rudy contd
              continuing
          she gets her clock fixed right away

a long pause

                    fran

                    fran
          they dont think he married well

                    rudy
              smiling
          that makes things a little easier for us
          then doesnt it

int trains station bar  day

carol sits in the bar a young soldier approaches and sits
down at the counter next to her she is finishing a vodka
gimlet

                    soldier
              to a bartender

                    soldier contd
              continuing  begins with the
               obvious
          guess you have to catch a train

                    the soldier

          shave maybe twice a week twentyone
          years old not goodlooking his best
          feature is his gentle easy grin and not
          a hustler he just wats to meet a girl

                    carol

                    soldier
          i never have any luck

carol smiles at the soldier her features suddenly freeze as
she glances toward the entrance to the bar

at the doorway

doc stands looking at carol and the soldier

                    carol
          stands and pauses for a moment

                    carol contd
          i really hope you have a nice trip

                    soldier
          thanks i hope yours is okay too

carol moves towards the exit

the soldier quietly sips his beer his face a bit grim

at the doorway

carol stops near doc

they look at each other

                    doc
          wheres the suitcase

carol continues looking at doc for a moment

then suddenly moves past him leading him out into the main
lobby

                                       back within the promenade

series of angles

carol emerges from the cocktail lounge followed by doc

they cross to the lockers

she retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
proper slot it doesnt turn puzzled she tries again then
forcing the key shakes the lock violently

her eyes widening into a quiet panic she next looks at the
locker number and then the number on the key her features
are now totally ashen

she walks up the bank of lockers puts the key in another
locker the door opens the compartment is empty

carol turns away from the locker eyes glazed with fear
doc at her shoulder

                    carol
          a man helped me open it

                    doc
              deceptive calm
          and switched keys

                    carol
          he must have

                    doc
              angrily
          it isnt another boyfriend is it

carol winces containing her anger

                    doc contd
              continuing  icily
          how long ago

                    carol
          fifteen minutes

                    doc
          sure

carol nods

                    doc contd
              continuing  with quick
               calculation
          hed figure you for longer enough time
          to try another hit hes probably still
          in the station

as doc pushes carol forward

                    doc contd
              continuing  lashing out
          there better be a guy with the

                    carol
              lashing back
          you bastard

walking at a rapid pace they start through the station doc
forcing their speed clutching carol under her elbow they
reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
promenade eyes straining

carol stops suddenly she stares down the long corridor her
eyes finding the thief he stands near another bank of
lockers the black suitcase at his feet

the thief looks up at carol  virtually within the same
moment that she spots him his expression never changes he
takes a step towards her smiling then with a movement
that is both abrupt and casual he snatches up the money bag
and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons

doc has seen the thief recognizing the suitcase he moves
immediately after him carol follows doc but is unable to
keep up she watches as doc vanishes behind the row of
lockers

carol rounds the last locker in the row but both men have now
disappeared from view she sags back against the edge of the
metal compartments exhausted fearful

                    loudspeaker voice
              indistinct above the roar of
               the station
          attention please
                    more

                    loudspeaker voice contd
          the flyer now boarding at gate three the
          flyer now boarding at gate three

carol again raises her eyes still breathless her face glows
with moisture

int the clintons barn  morning

fran is still seated on the stool rudy stares at her from
the cot harold is now absent

                    fran
          i dont think you have to worry much
          about harold he wont do anything

                    rudy

                    fran

rudy continues looking at her

                    rudy
          come over here a minute

he gestures with his gun fran crosses the distance slowly
moving with apprehension

                     fran
          look im not going to be any trouble to
          you either fact is this may sound
          funny but maybe you and i could be close

rudy gestures her closer

                    fran contd
              continuing
          you dont always have to have your gun
          out ill get whatever you want really

fran smiles she is now standing over the cot looking
directly down at rudy he jerks her down

                    rudy
              still polite
          get rid of that nail polish i dont like

rudy smiles

int train station  a series of angles  day

doc moving like a gun dog on the hunt between the rows of
lockers catching sight of the thief momentarily he closes
in

after a series of crisscrossed movements among the banked
locker corriders doc again loses sight of the thief as the
slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse
doc is faster and more agile than the thief but the station
is unfamiliar territory to him both doc and the thief move
carefully they must not arouse enough attention to make
themselves conspicuous thus risking police interference

the thief hurries along the main concourse weaving between
the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
corridor

doc in pursuit down the concourse he passes several sealed
off departurearrival gates

the thief steps off the concourse into gate three an open
stairway winding downward

doc follows his quarry down the stairway to the train area
where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
loading platform emerging from the short tunnel doc isnt
surprised that the thief is again nowhere in sight doc steps
behind a pillar  he waits watchfully after a moment or
two the thief edges out from behind another column and
starts back up the platform towards the concourse

doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but as the thief
spots his approach he turns and joins several passengers
scurrying toward the awaiting train

the flyer stands gleaming at trackside perpendicular to the
boarding gate two doors to the train stand open one in the
pullman section the other entrance admitting day coach
passengers

carol  on the main concourse  moving along with the flow of
abouttodepart passengers the flyer comes into sight
visible on the next level below

the conductor  at trackside  stands smiling broadly by the
coach entrance he grins at the boarding passengers as he
speaks to a nearby brakeman the thief skirts around a
baggageladen elderly couple and moves up the twostep and
into the rail car passageway

doc moving quickly again he sees the thief slip past the
conductor and into the train

the thief is now inside the day coach he heads toward the
forward compartments

doc expertly squirms through the boarding throng and
disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car
vestibule

on the concourse

carol watches as a blondish man in a grey suit skips aboard
the flyer standing below she is unable to get a clear look
at the man and is unsure as to whether or not it was doc
she hesitates then moves forward to gate three which will
take her down to trackside

carol stands at the edge of the gate  the last of the crowd
having already passed through she hesitates again staring
down at the shining train

int flyer  day coach

the aisle is clogged with passengers people hesitate over
their selection of seats put baggage into overhead racks
clumsily remove their overcoats the thief continues to
move forward squirming around the passengers at a hurried
but controlled pace

at the end of a pullman

doc enters threading his way forward scanning faces he is
one car behind the thief and losing ground due to the fact
that doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he
passes doc is further delayed by a woman blocking the aisle
she struggles painfully trying to fit a suitcase into an
overhead carriage

doc with the most forced of smiles reaches up to help her

30 the thief moves through another vestibule and into an 30
empty car  now unobserved he immediately breaks into a
run

doc looking moving nimbly into another vestibule and car
the passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the
front of the train

the thief runs through another vestibule and into a smoker
this car also deserted he maintains his trotting pace
swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes reaching the end of
the smoker he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move
into the following car but the thief is brought to a halt by
the sudden dead end of the passageway the next car holds
only baggage he has reached furthest forward passenger car
the thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door
hoping to escape by jumping off the train but the doors are
tightly locked he begins to retrace his steps

doc moves carefully into the next car forward still
unknowingly two cars behind the thief

the thief passes back to the vestibule at the rear of the
smoker his eye suddenly catching the mens lounge he tries
the door  locked the thief snaps out a pen knife picks
the lock with a deft movement passengers are visible behind
him as he works filtering into the pullman car following the
smoker none of them notes his activity the restroom door
swings open

int mens lounge

the thief immediately snaps the boltlock shut behind him
crosses the small murky room and tries to lift the window
he strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly
jammed

doc enters the final passenger car notes the half 313 dozen
travelers and continues moving forward going next into the
smoker

the smoking car is empty although several passengers and a
porter enter it moments after doc leads the way doc passes
through the length of the car moves into the vestibule and
like the thief a few moments before finds his passage
blocked by the baggage car doc hesitates then turns and
begins going back in the opposite direction

doc stops at the mens lounge  staring hard at the door for
a moment he tries the handle the door remains firmly shut

                       porter
                 appearing suddenly at docs
                  shoulder
             be open five minutes out of the station

doc nods and moves away continuing to retrace his steps
toward his point of entrance onto the train

the thief having abandoned the jammed window is now undoing
the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed the lid
pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands the
thief grabs a money pad runs his thumb over it then shoves
the stack of greenbacks into his coats inside breast pocket

doc moves with determination back through the passenger cars

int mens lounge

the thief has again closed the suitcase he nervously looks
about his tightwalled sanctuary then crosses back to the
window and stares out through a corner of the pane he pulls
the shade lower

ext track

metal wheels grind against the rails the train shudders
then begins to move forward

the thief is watching through the mens room window as the
train edges forward his body suddenly tightens he sees doc
outside the train walking slowly between a narrow passage of
moving passenger cars and several parked tinders

                       thiefs pov
             doc glancing between parked passenger
             cars walking cautiously ahead as the
             flyer continues to move slowly forward
             doc disappears from view

the thief allows himself a quick smile turning away from the
window he picks up the suitcase unbolts the lock and steps
back out into the vestibule

at the back of the smoker the thief seats himself next to a
window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
opposite from him in the forward position of the car well
behind the thiefs back a dozen passengers are scattered
about the lounge chairs a conductor appears at the end of
the smoker opposite the thief and begins to collect and punch
tickets

as the train begins to pick up speed the thief lifts an
abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him
he glances at the front page then unfolds the width of the
paper as a precaution against regaining poverty the thief
rests one foot against the suitcase all seems secure then
doc sits down next to the thief

doc companionably slides an arm behind the back op the
thiefs neck pulling him close

                    doc
              softly almost gently
          when you pop a lock dont mark it

the thiefs knife instantly flashes into his hand but before
he can bring it into play doc catches his arms

the knife is tightly wedged into the thiefs hand docs
fingers are viselike at his wrist

the other passengers remain preoccupied at the other end of
the car taking no note of the quiet encounter

the conductor is still at the opposite end of the car from
doc and the thief he continues collecting and punching
fares

int station gate  day

carol is exiting there is an announcement over the

loudspeaker  the train has left

int train  day

the conductor as seen by the thiefs widening eyes he
methodically punches the tickets never looking more than two
seats ahead

thief goes out is he dead

doc pulls the thiefs hat down over his head

mercury seemingly blocking the way

                    doc

carol stands on the accelerator the mercury goes screaming
forward as doc shoots out the back window then as the
terrified cops duck to the side he shoots out their front
windshield the mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the
empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll
across the concrete the car slams back down through a vacant
space on the opposite side and moves around in a semicircle
across the asphalt heading for the highway exit

doc smashes out the rear window with the butt of his shotgun

the black and white now in reverse zooming back trying to
get between the mercury and the highway

carol bringing the car around she can see the squad car
streaking backward she pulls the wheel to the right and
brings her car across the front of the still stopping police
car

the officers try to bring their guns into play as the mercury
streaks in front of them

doc fires the shotgun twice

the police car explodes the hood is lifted off the car both
officers jump out of the vehicle pouring shots after the
retreating mercury

carol  screaming as the front and back windshields shatter
around her

the mercury badly riddled pulls out onto the highway

another squad car comes speeding up in the opposite
direction the driver hits the brakes the tires smoke along
the street as the black and white screams to a stop

carol pulls the mercury by the squad car

doc fires another two bursts

the police car  the front and back fenders are hit the
wheels disintegrate  the impact of the shells rocks the
black and white upward

the mercury as it streaks down the road three holes open up
on the trunk of the auto

doc can see both officers jump out of the second black and
white through the rear window carol makes a quick turn off
the highway

the mercury roars down the dark street into the citys
commercial section suddenly slow makes another sharp turn 
this time through a red light

down a smaller street filled with shops  carol rounds the
corner whips up to the curb  doc and carol jump out of the
car she carries the suitcase he hangs onto his big gun

doc and carol moving down a deserted sidewalk the sound of
sirens they round a corner then quickly move into an alley

the alley is narrow deserted doc and carol pull back into
an alcove as a prowl car goes screaming down the street and
off into the night they continue down the alley

the opposite entrance to the alley is blocked by a large
metal garbage container and the driver empties two cans of
garbage into it then he starts across the narrow street
beyond in order to grab several others

doc looks behind him then grabs carols arm they run for
the container doc tosses the suitcase into the container
jumps in reaches back pulls carol in beside him sirens
again sound close by

after a moment a large garbage truck pulls up lifts the
container with hooks and dumps the garbage and doc and carol
into the truck

a series op angles as a crusher begins to move towards them
inside the truck doc and carol start to panic but they have
room enough

within the truck doc wiggles his 45 out of his jacket and
into his hand he carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly
amongst the garbage a moment after doc frees his gun a load
of garbage descends on their shelter partially obscuring
them

the truck pulls out

doc and carol sweating breathing hard again the sound of
sirens the truck lurches forward

prowling squad cars

more refuse the truck continues along

doc and carol  their faces covered with perspiration and
flies buried within their enclosure under the moist
garbage

a garbage dump  morning

the truck growls along the rutted pathway surrounded by acres
of open trash areas within the dump reveal the slow
smouldering fires

the truck backs up to a huge crater halffilled with refuse

the driver revs the engine pulls the bed lift gear

the truck bed rises and tilts forward as the load of trash
tumbles down the face of the crater

doc and carol slide down the mountain of filth and stumbling
forward they climb into a large cardboard box

the driver gets out of the cab checks to see that the
garbage is gone from the truck bed on his way back to the
cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto
tire with his newlyfound prize the driver reenters the
truck and drives away

the box lies at the bottom of the crater amongst the broken
bottles melon rinds flashlight batteries tin cans used
tires

doc saws at a corner of the cardboard box with his penknife
the matted paper gives away allowing them more room within
the box

                    doc
          okay

                    carol

blood from a scratch

                    doc

carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while

                       doc

doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the
crate

the heat and the flies have become unbearable carol begins
to scratch her leg

                     doc contd
          dont scratch it just rub youll get an
          infection

too late as docs 45 crashes against his head rudy drops
fran screams rudy looks at doc still smiling eyes glazed

int lobby

the accountant stands at one corner op the reception counter
in the lobby of laughlins within an alcove behind and to one
side of the desk the area serving as an office cully swain
and hayhoe have stretched laughlin across the pine desk the
accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the
hotel3 acting as lookout

cully inside the alcove lifts a snapped off leg of the heavy
chair to use as a club the thug turns back to the desk where
swain and hayhoe have laughlin pinioned

                       cully
             just tell us the room number

laughlin looks back at cully he is very frightened but says
nothing

cully slams the wooden club down on laughlin kneecap

                       cully
             now you want to tell me

                       laughlin

he again whacks laughlins knee

int lobby stairs

they get five steps before simultaneously seeing the
accountant

                       carol
             doc 

doc and carol freeze for an instant

the accountant snaps his fingers twice

cully lowers his club looks to the accountant as do swain
and hayhoe the accountant smiles staring at doc and carol

                       accountant
                 calmly to his men
             out here

cully swain and hayhoe appear from the alcove behind the
accountant they look over his shoulder toward the rear of
the hotel their eyes finding doc and carol

int within the main lobby

doc has one hand in his outside coat pocket wrapped

around the 45 carol continues to hold the suitcase up in
front of herself almost like a shield the distance between
doc and carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut
off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk
carol edges backward a few steps toward the massive wooden
staircase

                    accountant
          just have her set it down

docs hand comes out of his coat pocket a slow gesture
revealing that his palm is empty

                    doc
          you want it come and take it

the accountant now planked by the three men

                    accountant
              quietly
          get him

as the three men reach for their guns

doc moves much paster he ducks to   the right levels the
disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement the
reception desk near the accountant   splinters from the blast
and he is hit painfully the other   three men duck away from
the sudden burst of fire power

doc and carol jump for the stairs

hayhoe levels his pistol at the retreating couple another
shot from docs riot gun this one breaking open the floor
at hayhoes feet and cutting him down at the knees cannon
cully swain and max open fire as they dive for cover they
miss their shots digging up walls stairs and flooring

on the winding stairway doc and carol flee upward she
struggles with the heavy suitcase doc transfers the riot gun
to his left hand pulls out the more accurate 45 to use with
his right

within the lobby the six men split forces

cully and the accountant run to the elevator enter it pull
the door shut swain and hayhoe limping and cannon and max
start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of doc and carol
all the men save the accountant now have guns in their
hands

swain and hayhoe cautiously going upward still below the
first level landing their eyes search overhead the sound of
doc and carols pounding feet can be heard

hayhoe leans out over the banister points his gun directly
up and fires

doc and carol between the first and second floor landings as
hayhoes bullet tears by ripping through the wooden banister
supports

inside the elevator the accountant and cully watch the arrow
indicator pass two

doc aiming his 45 resting it on the banister he fires two
shots back down the stairwell

swain and hayhoe moving up the steps two at a time suddenly
hayhoes leg buckles as a 45 slug tears through his hip the
other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder

swain is now beside the banister he points his 54l revolver
straight up empties it

doc and carol as swains bullets break around them doc pulls
carol down lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell
with a huge roar

the staircase ten feet in front of swain is smashed by docs
blast swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to
continue moving upward cannon following

the elevator indicator stopping at three

cully pulls open the door moves out into the corridor the
accountant remains within the elevator

swain on the stairway fires his pistol upward

carol on the stairway above as the shots smash past runs
ahead of doc by three steps they pass the second landing
keep moving upwards towards the third

docs focus of attention is downward he knows that he and
carol are being pursued up the stairwell but he isnt aware
of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces

rudy on the third floor again rises like lazarus from the
dead his head bloodied from docs heavy pistol he slowly
wobbles to his feet rudy looks down at fran she sobs
violently her back leaning against the wall rudy picks up
his 44 then stumbles into the open door of doc and carols
room he unsteadily crosses to the bathroom closes the door

carol frantically moving upward doc has now fallen five
steps behind

doc fires the 45 down the stairwell at

swain on the third floor

cully walks cautiously down the corridor pistol raised he
moves toward the landing having covered one quarter of the
distance from the elevator the accountant is still within
the elevator

carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for doc the
sound of swains pistol and docs answering 45 carol senses
a movement she turns and sees cullys gun leveled at her as
carol screams

doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor his plane
of movement knee high the riot gun in his left hand 45
in his right

cully is hit in the chest by buckshot the killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun his aim destroyed
by the death blows the bullets stray above carol high of
their mark

doc fires three times more at the elevator cable

the corridor wall near the elevator is smashed by one of the
riot guns jumbo shots as is the top of the elevator the
plaster flies away revealing further damage the cables are
smashed the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward

the emergency cable inside the shaft

the mechanism transfers over line catching within the pulley
housing the line snaps taut  halting the speeding car

within the lobby

as the elevator slams to a wrenching stop five feet

above the floor level the accountant bounces from the floor
of the car to the ceiling then back to the floor

laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain he
sees the suspended car through the iron grill door

the accountant lies completely still on the floor of the
elevator his head and neck twisted at an oblique angle

doc on the third floor landing

he jams several shells into his riot gun while holding his
45 ready for an appearance by swain reloading completed he
stands with carol he again begins to move upward

swain fires from the stairwell

doc stops sets both the riot gun and the 45 on 562 the
banister he waits on the winding staircase below him
there is a dark movement

doc fires both guns

the stairwell around swain disintegrates the thug is
obliterated by the firepower

doc cannot see the effect of his shots he again resumes his
flight upward

int docs bathroom

rudy holds his bloody head in the sink bowl dumbly splashing
water over himself carols underwear is still present
rudys pistol lies on the soap tray

the landing as doc and carol come pounding into view no
further avenues open they turn down the corridor doc grabs
carol and pushes her into the room past fran he kicks the
door shut

int the room

doc grabs the suitcase runs to the window tears off the
shade lifts the frame looks the drop is too far he grabs
carol and runs into the hallway

int corridor

they run down two doors and break in over the door is the
sign fire escape

int fire escape room

doc helps carol out onto the fire escape he aids her with
his left hand the riot gun now clutched tightly in his
right he motions she hands him the suitcase and follows

ext fire escape

they descend the fire escape they reach the end the fire
escape stays rigid

doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps he turns and
with the suitcase crosses to the end throws the bag and the
shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall
preparing to jump

rudy comes out of the room onto the fire escape holding his
44 he looks down at doc then slowly raises his gun carol
screams

doc jumps rudy fires doc is hit in the side flesh wound
in the air he spins and lands rudy fires again and again as
he runs down the fire escape doc rolls picks up the shotgun
and fires

rudys time has come the jumbo charges mash him back against
the wall and off the fire escape

carol runs almost staggering and gets ready to jump the six
feet

the fire escape begins to sink carol looks at doc mutely
as she sinks beneath the retaining wall

                    doc
              his hand out
          jump

and she does he catches her and pulls her up

they look at one another for a long moment then he stands
and helps her to her feet and leaving the shotgun behind
they walk into the alley

rudy lies dead behind them

in a parking lot at the end of the alley slim a tough
grizzly western is about to pull out doc opens the back door
and carol gets in doc opens the front door as slim turns and
looks at him

onto a larger boulevard
