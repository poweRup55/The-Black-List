additional title  part two 

int don corleones old office  close view on michael
corleone  day

standing impassively like a young prince recently crowned
king

close view on michaels hand  rocco lampone kisses his hand
then it is taken away  we can see only the empty desk and
chair of michaels father vito corleone  we hear over
this very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance
as the view moves slowly closer to the empty desk and chair

								dissolve to

ext a sicilian landscape  full view  day

we can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burntbrown of a dry river bed  the figures move
slowly seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past

the musicians walking unsteadily on the rocky bed their
instruments harsh and blaring

they are followed by six young peasant men carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders  then the widow a
strong large woman dressed in black and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her

behind her not more than twenty relatives few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin

suddenly we hear the shots of the lupara and the musicians
stop their playing  the entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed

the young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground
we hear a woman screaming

				woman
			sicilian
		theyve killed young paolo  theyve
		killed the boy paolo

ext sicilian landscape  med view  day

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy lying on
the parched ground  in the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils running up to the body of the boy  they begin to
wail and cry out in anguished sicilian as the widow the
mother of the murdered boy holds her child in her arms his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands

ext baronial estate  tight moving view  day

a boy eight or nine with wide frightened eyes being
pulled quickly by the hand  this is vito andolini who is
to become the godfather

the view alters revealing that he is being pulled along by
his mother the widow across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a baronial estate of some forgotten noble

at various positions near the gates are men with shotguns
or lupara  the gates are opened and the widow and her boy
are shown before don francesco a man in his sixties  he
wears his trousers with suspenders and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly  he wears a hat
to protect him from the whitehot sun and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest

he sits in a chair near a group of his men in the garden
listening to the widow who stands before him with her only
son

				widow
			sicilian
		don francesco  you murdered my
		husband because he would not bend
		and his oldest son paolo because
		he swore revenge  but vitone is
		only nine and dumbwitted  he
		never speaks

				don francesco
			sicilian
		im not afraid of his words

				widow
			sicilian
		he is weak

				don francesco
			sicilian
		he will grow strong

				widow
			sicilian
		the child cannot harm you

				don francesco
			sicilian
		he will be a man and then he will
		come for revenge

as she pleads the widow moves closer to the don until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him

				widow
			sicilian
		i beg you don francesco spare my
		only son  he is all i have  in
		the name of the holy spirit i
		swear he will never be a danger to
		you

suddenly she reaches under her skirt where she has hidden
a kitchen knife

				widow
			continuing
		but i will kill you myself
			she lunges at the
			mafia chieftain
		vitone go

the boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates  then
there is a lupara blast  he turns and sees his mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun  then he sees the men turn
their attention to him  one fires at him but the boy is
quick and disappears into a grove of olive trees

ext streets of corleone  night

two men roam the deserted streets of corleone carrying
lupare  every so often they stop and one shouts in a
loud almost singsong voice like a fish peddler  their
names are mosca and strollo

				mosca
			sicilian
		our friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy vito
		andolini
			he turns and shouts
			in the other direction
		our friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy vito
		andolini

int a house  night

a family quietly eats their dinner  the father is the local
policeman as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun
hanging nearby

				strollo
			sicilian os
		our friend will be hard with any
		family who gives help to vito
		andolini

one of the children looks up about to speak  but the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said  they go
on with their dinner

ext the streets of corleone  full view  night

the men continue walking up and throughout the streets far
in the distance

				mosca
			sicilian os
		misery to any family who harbors
		the boy vito

int a barn  night

four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind vito tightly in swaddled cloth and then lift
him up to the side of a mule counterbalancing a heavy load
of firewood  the father looks at the boys almost stoically
calm little face

				father
			sicilian
		vitowe pray for you

he pulls the fabric over the boys face

				mosca
			sicilian os
		andolini

				strollo
			sicilian os
		our friend promises misery to any
		family

ext the church plaza  night

the men continue on their nightwalk up to the plaza of the
church

				strollo
			sicilian
		who harbors the boy vitone
		andolini

the figure of a single man on a mule passes them

				mosca
			sicilian
		let no one give help to the boy
		vito andolini

the man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance

we begin to hear very quietly the waltz repeated once again

ext steamship  close view on vito  day

huddled in blankets on the deck of the ship in steerage
he does not say a word  the waltz grows louder as the view
alters revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
america

then suddenly the waltz stops

the new york harbor  day

silence  we glide past the statue of liberty

view on the immigrants standing on shipboard silently
looking  vito is standing with them his eyes wide

camera moves in on the statue then moving past on to the
beautiful buildings of ellis island

ext ellis island  day

a tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
ellis island harbor  uniformed officials of the immigration
service load them up toward the main building

int ellis processing hall  day

the hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall  various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above

there is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously uncertainly in different languages

vito is bundled in an old coat with a large tag pinned on
it vitone andolini  corleone sicilia

he stands moves up in the line when several other immigrant
boys older than he rush up an push him back in the line
weak from the trip he falls to the floor  the boys laugh
derisive in a language he cannot understand  he struggles
to his feet lifting his makeshift bags staring at them in
an icy hatred

int processing room  day

three or four interviews are crowded into the small room
they are conducted in english  from the expression on
vitos face and from the fragmented of the english we
realize that he doesnt understand a word of it

				official
			english
		what is your name

the man waits impatiently

				official
		your name

vito doesnt answer  the official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form using a typewriter

				official
			speaking as he types
		vitocorleone  step up over
		there

he hands the form to another official

close view on the form  the name has been entered as vito
corleone

int medical exam  day

vito is stripped to the waist as other immigrants wait

the doctor is just finishing his examination  he shakes his
head and then writes on the medical form

				doctor
		can you understand me

vito stares blankly

				doctor
		you understand  smallpox  smallpox

he doesnt understand  the doctor turns to the immigration
official

the quarantine section of the island

int quarantine hallway  day

the official stops at each doorway and reads off a name

				official
		salvatore ormenta

the man moves into the room and the group proceeds

				official
		vito corleone

no one responds  the guard moves to the boy reads his new
name tag  and then not unkindly

				guard
		thats you

he opens the door and vito enters the room

ext the statue of liberty  day

the view slowly begins to pull back revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell where vito stands
on his bench looking out to the statue through the barred
window

then he turns and sits in the corner  he is silent for a
long time

then in a sweet pure voice he sings to himself in sicilian

large white silk bow tied to his shoulder moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white  he has dark black hair and his face is
unmistakably similar to young vitos  he moves slowly his
hands clasped around a golden missal  we hear only the pure
voice of vito in sicilian his sad song reaching out from
the past as anthony corleone his grandson moves on the
way to his first holy communion more than fifty years later

it

				hagen
		ive cleared it through the
		senators chief aide a man named
		turnbull  turnbulls a heavy
		gambler and into us for over a
		hundred grand so i figure his
		information is reliable

neri moves to the bar to prepare michael a drink

				hagen
		the senator can be set up but he
		thinks of himself as a clean
		politician  so its got to be on
		terms he can live with campaign
		contribution donation to a
		charitable cause that he controls
		things like that  if he gets even
		the inkling that you think youre
		buying him hell freeze up
		nevadas a funny state they like
		things both ways here all right
		turnbull says the senator will be
		here at twothirty and hes been
		primed  he knows youll want to
		meet with him alone and he knows
		its about the tropicanas license
		at any rate he expects to be
		introduced around to some of the
		influential people here today and
		generally treated as an ordinary
		guest  just go light on him
		mikey sometimes the biggest crooks
		dont like to think of themselves
		as crooks

michael glances at hagen as though that last remark was
unnecessary

				hagen
		im sorry of course you know that

				michael
		twothirty  that gives me time to
		see my boy

				hagen
		connies outside

michael doesnt want to see her

				hagen
		i promised she said it was urgent

			taking a cigarette

a moment goes by and then tom hagen enters closing the

we begin to hear senator gearys amplified voice resounding
over the lake  hagen moves to sandra  she takes him in her

		it was very kind of you to come to

		my wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy  if i can ever
		perform a service for you you only
		have to ask

the door opens and hagen sheepishly makes his way in

				michael
		my lawyer tom hagen  he arranged
		this all through your man turnbull

				senator geary
		i thought we would meet alone

				michael
		i trust these men with my life
		they are my right arms i cannot

				senator geary
			taking out some medication

he addresses that to neri who resentfully goes to fetch the
senator a glass of water

				senator geary
		alright corleone  im going to be
		very frank with you  maybe more
		frank than any man in my position
		has ever spoken to you before

michael nods indicating that he should do so

				senator geary
		the corleone family controls two
		major hotels in vegas one in reno
		the licenses were grandfathered in
		so you had no difficulties with the
		gaming commission  but i have the
		idea from sources
			takes the water from
			neri and swallows his pills
		that youre planning to move in
		on the tropicana  in another week
		or so youll move klingman out
		which leaves you with only one
		technicality  the license which
		is now in klingmans name

				michael
		turnbull is a good man

				senator geary
		lets forget the bullshit i dont
		want to stay here any longer than i
		have to  you can have the license
		for two hundred and fifty thousand
		in cash plus a monthly fee equal
		to five percent of the gross

michael is taken aback he looks at hagen

				senator geary
		of all three corleone hotels

hagen is frustrated all his information was wrong

				michael
		senator geary i speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state  i have
		made that state my home plan to
		raise my children here  the
		license fee from the gambling
		commission costs one thousand
		dollars why would i ever consider
		paying more

				senator geary
		im going to squeeze you corleone
		because i dont like you i dont
		like the kind of man you are  i
		despise your masquerade and the
		dishonest way you pose yourself and
		your fucking family

vito climbs down from the attic and finds fanuccis rear
door open  he slips in and makes his way past the open

tilts to vito caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them  then something catches his eye

what he sees

a small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man comes
up to him and rubs itself against him  vito rubs the
animal speaking softly in sicilian then gaining its
confidence lifts it up and carefully lets it into fanuccis

shouted in the house a loud sound from the cat and some of
the thumping footsteps of fanucci

holding the wrapped gun waiting

what he sees

the white blob of fanucci opening the door and cursing in
italian as he throws the cat out

squeezing the trigger the muffled but still loud blast
resounding in the building

he holds onto the door frame trying to stand erect trying
to reach for his gun  the force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose  his gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach  carefully as if plunging a needle into
this vein vito corleone fires a second bullet

fanucci falls to his knees propping the door open giving a
terrible groan  we begin to hear the voices of girls inside
the apartment

vito quickly opens his wallet removes the two hundred
quickly fires one last bullet into fanuccis sweaty cheek
now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire
literally on vitos hand quickly he throws it to the
ground stamps it outand disappears upward

vito moves like a cat along the rooftops we hear the
conclusion of the mass down below

pausing we can see the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below

he empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge  he reverses it in his hand and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney
he smashes it again and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle two separate pieces

he then moves along the rooftop dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts

turns almost in her sleep

				kay

his eyes dart back to the curved beautifully leaded windows
of the room  the drapes are opened  then without a
seconds hesitation he leaps to the floor still holding
his sons drawing as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows glass shattering all over the room

kay screams out rising still halfasleep  michael crawls
toward her and pulls her down to the floor to him

then for a moment there is silence soon filled by the
shouts of men as flashes of light sweep by the window as

wakened from their lodge house a barrackslike structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency

michael talks intimately to tom

				michael
		theres a lot i cant tell you tom
		i know thats upset you in the
		past and youve felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence  but it is because i do
		trust you that ive kept so much
		secret from you  its precisely
		that at this moment you are the
		only one that i can completely
		trust  in time youll understand
		everything

				hagen
			nods with this statement
		but your people neri rocco
		you dont think

				michael
		no i have confidence in their
		loyalty but this is life and
		death and tom you are my brother

hagen in very moved

				hagen
		mikey i hoped

				michael
		no tom just listen  all my people
		are businessmen their loyalty is
		based on that  one thing i learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you thinkand
		on that basis anything is possible
		fredo has a good heart but he is
		weakand stupid and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all  ive kept you out of things
		tom because ive always known that
		your instincts were legitimate and
		i wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice for your own protection
		i never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under sonny i know
		you were in a position of limited
		power and you did your best to
		advise and caution him  what i am
		saying is that now for how long i
		do not know you will be the don
		if what i think has happened is
		true i will leave tonight and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me  and even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary  i give you
		complete power over neri fredo
		everyone  i am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children
		and the future of this family
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent

a man who has steadily declined over the last five years
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him

				michael
			continuing
		but tom you must know that i do

				michael
		ive prepared this have had it for
		over a month  it wont explain
		everything but indicates where i
		will be so in a sense it is my

			he hands the envelope
			to hagen
		also there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately  pop
		would have given those to luca 
		you knew pop as well as anyone act
		as though you were him  it
		discusses kay as well that will be
		the most difficult  the men who
		tried to kill me tonight will
		never leave the estate

				hagen

				michael
		i dont think so  unless im very

general subdued laughter

a cuban street  late day

police are stopping traffic  michaels mercury is among the
cars a police officer seeing that some important person is
being driven walks up to the driver  he leans forward and
says something in spanish to the driver

the driver in turn leans over to michael

				driver
		he says it will just be a short
		time and theyll let us through

michael looks out the window

michaels view

the old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles  right at this moment they are waiting
lazily but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready
there is a momentary commotion inside the building and the
men brace up  a captain of the army detachment says
something in spanish over a megaphone and his men put their
weapons at the ready as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up

they are moved over to some military truck where they are
frisked before being loaded

all of a sudden one of the civilian rebels breaks loose
and rushes toward the command vehicle  he hurls himself
into the vehicle as two police try to pull him out  a
second later and there is an explosion the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the captain

there is a commotion but the military quickly quell it

sam prepares the drinks for his brother hyman and a group
of men including michael

				man
		cuba libres

				michael
		i was told the cubans now call this
		drink la mentira

				roth
		i still dont speak spanish michael

				michael
		it means the lie

a moments hesitation then a few of the men laugh  now two
cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it

				sam roth
		the cake is here

they all raise their glasses to the old man

				everyone
			ad lib
		happy birthday

roth glances at the cake and its inscription is pleased

				roth
		i hope my age is correct i am
		always accurate about my age

some laugh  he nods and they begin to cut it put a piece
on plates and carry them to the different men

				roth
		everything weve learned in vegas
		is true here but we can go further
		the bigger the swankier the
		plusher the store the more a sense
		of legitimacy and the bigger
		business we do
			looking at the plate
			brought to him
		a smaller piece  what weve
		proposed to the cuban government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis
			accepting a smaller piece
		thank you  we can find people in
		the united states who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action yet we will retain control

				one of the men
		how much

				roth
		a hundred million dollars  but
		only if this government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials well need some new
		laws too but that will be no
		difficulty

				another man
		what are import duties now

				roth
		as much as seventy percent  also
		im working out an arrangement with
		the minister of labor so that all
		our pit bosses stickmen and
		dealers can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas  as of now
		theyre only allowed in cuba for
		six months at a time  in short
		were in a full partnership with
		the cuban government

view on michael

is handed a piece of cake  roth moves over to a folder of
documents

				roth
			continuing
		here are applications from friends
		all over the states  i understand
		santo virgilio in tampa is trying
		to make his own deal  well the
		cuban government will brush him off
		the lakeville road boys are going
		to take over the nacionale here
		im planning a new hotel casino to
		be known as riviera  the new capri
		will go to the corleone family

med view

the cake is sliced and carried to each of the men

				roth
		then theres the sevilla biltmore
		the havana hilton which is going
		to cost twentyfour million 
		cuban banks will put up half the
		teamsters will bankroll the rest
		generally there will be friends
		for all our friends including the
		lieutenant governor of nevada
		eddie levine of newport will bring
		in the pennino brothers dino and
		eddie theyll handle actual casino
		operations

and seeing that all of his friends have been served roth
raises his fork

				roth
		enjoy

				michael
		i saw an interesting thing today
		a man was being arrested by the
		military police probably an urban
		guerrilla  rather than be taken
		alive he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket taking the command
		vehicle with him

the various men look up as michael eats his cake wondering
what the point of it is

				michael
		it occurred to me the police are
		paid to fight and the rebels are
		not

				sam roth
		so

				michael
		so that occurred to me

view on roth

he understands michaels point if the others do not

				roth
		this country has had rebels for the
		last fifty years its part of
		their blood  believe me i know
		ive been coming here since the
		twenties we were running molasses
		out of havana when you were a baby
		to trucks owned by your father
			he chuckles warmly
			over the memory
		well talk when were alone

and he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday

ext roths private terrace  day

michael sits alone with the old man on a terrace that
overlooks the city

				roth
		you have to be careful what you say
		in front of the others they
		frighten easy  its always been
		that way most men frighten easy

				michael
		were making a big investment in
		cuba  thats my only concern

				roth
		my concern is that the three
		million never arrived at batistas
		numbered account in switzerland
		he thinks its because you have
		second thoughts about his ability
		to stop the rebels

				michael
		the money was sent

				roth
		then you have to trace it  michael
		people here look at me as a reliable
		man  i cant afford not to be
		looked on as a reliable man  but
		you know all that theres nothing
		you can learn from me  you
		shouldnt have to put up with a
		sick old man as a partner

				michael
		i wouldnt consider anyone else

				roth
		except the president of the united
		states

he laughs slyly as though this is some private joke between
them  then his laughter becomes a cough which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief

				roth
		if only i could live to see it
		kid to be there with you  how
		beautifully weve done it step by
		step  here protected free to
		make our profits without the
		justice department the fbi ninety
		miles away in partnership with a
		friendly government  ninety miles
		just a small step looking for a
		man who desperately wants to be
		president of the united states and
		having the cash to make it possible

				michael
		youll be there to see it youll
		be there

		hes not like a little boy he
		doesnt talk to me he doesnt want
		to play he doesnt like other
		children he doesnt like toys
		its as though hes waiting for the
		time he can take his fathers place
			almost in tears
		you know what he told me when he
		was four years old  he said he had
		killed his grandfather

view on hagen

listening calmly

				kay
		 he said he had shot his
		grandfather with a gun and then he
		died in the garden  and he asked
		me he asked me tom if that
		meant now his father would shoot
		him out of revenge
			she cries
		how does a four year old boy learn
		the word revenge

				hagen
		kay kay

view on kay

				kay
		what kind of a family is this
		are we human beings  he knows his
		father killed his uncle carlo  he
		heard connie

				hagen
		you dont know thats true  but
		kay just for the sake of an
		argument lets assume it is im
		not saying it is remember but
		what if i gave you what might be
		some justification for what he
		did or rather some possible
		justification for what he possibly
		did

				kay
		thats the first time ive seen the
		lawyer side of you tom  its not
		your best side

				hagen
		okay just hear me out  what if
		carlo had been paid to help get
		sonny killed  what if his beating
		of connie that time was a deliberate
		plot to get sonny out into the open
		then what  and what if the don a
		great man couldnt bring himself
		to do what he had to do avenge his
		sons death by killing his
		daughters husband  what if that
		finally was too much for him and
		he made michael his successor
		knowing that michael would take
		that load off his shoulders would
		take that guilt

				kay
		hes not the same as when i met him

				hagen
		if he were hed be dead by now
		youd be a widow  youd have no
		problem

				kay
		what the hell does that mean  come
		on tom speak out straight once in
		your life  i know michael cant
		but youre not sicilian you can
		tell a woman the truth you can
		treat her like an equal a fellow
		human being

there is a long silence

then hagen shakes his head he can tell her no more

				hagen
		if you told michael what ive told
		you today im a dead man

				kay
		when is it finally over  i want it
		to be over before my baby is born

				hagen
		i dont know  i hope soon but
		its not over yet and thats why
		you and the kids have to come back
		to me

he looks at her its clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her childrens

he is a kind good man and seems very nervous and
overwrought

		youre a careful kid and thats

		american journalism not propaganda
		the government troops have all but

		there was this kid that i grew up

		than me and sort of looked up to
		me you know  we did our first
		work together worked our way out
		of the street  things were good
		and we made the most of it  during
		prohibition we ran molasses up to
		canada and made a fortune your
		father too  i guess as much as
		anyone i loved him and trusted him
		later on he had an idea to make a
		city out of a desert stopover for
		gis on the way to the west coast
		that kids name was moe greene and
		the city he invented was las vegas
		this was a great man a man with
		vision and guts and there isnt
		even a plaque or a signpost or a
		statue of him in that town  someone
		put a bullet through his eye no
		one knows who gave the order  when
		i heard about it i wasnt angry  i
		knew moe i knew he was headstrong
		and talking loud and saying stupid
		things  so when he turned up dead
		i let it go and said to myself
		this is the business weve chosen
		i never asked who gave the go
		ahead because it had nothing to do
		with business

he regards michael silently a moment

		theres three million dollars on

sight of the home he has been forced to be away from

looking out from his window  the last time he had seen the
estate it was warm and the trees were full

moving view

approaching the great stone gates closed  the bodyguards
are not readily visible but they are there  the iron gates
are opened and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect
as the car pulls in

new view

inside the estate the private roads have been freshly
plowed and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes

the grandchildren are in school now and so the estate is
especially quiet  although there are signs that children
live here a bicycle a sled a swing and gymnastic set wet
and with a rim of snow still on it

is very quiet no one is at home to greet him  he can see
the evidence of his family things his wife and his children
have been using and left on a sofa or a table

he moves toward his and kays bedroom where we can hear the
sound of a sewing machine running

quietly he opens the door

bodyguards following

ext don tomasinos villa outside of corleone  day

pats the heads of his children and leads them all into the
garden

int the villa  sumptuous med view  late day

ext corleone plaza  day

the family exits the church on the plaza of the town  vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest

int village cottage  night

the door is open  the footsteps of a man enter the room
we follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong  they lead us to a bed where we see asleep an old
man  he sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating covered
by mosquito netting

view alters

and we realize that it is young vito looking at the man

we remember that the man is mosca one of three men who
almost twenty years before had hunted down vito when he was
a boy  with lightning speed vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife  and with the movement
precise as a butchers he disembowls this man

ext olive oil warehouse  full view

vito has brought his wife and children to see the olive oil
depot which is the link to his new york importing business
they go inside

int olive oil warehouse  day

they are led by one of vitos associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil  vito very proudly shows
his associates in italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the united states  they all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine

ext the bay  day

a team of sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets
one sings accompanied by a guitar

view moves to one of the old fisherman

he is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
vito down  strollo  as he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels
it is vito  he moves quietly stepping up behind the old
man  in an instant he has thrown a garrote around his
throat twisting it tight so that there is very little
sound

then almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails

ext the impressive estate of don francesco  day

we see an old car approach  its driver is the young tomasino
sitting in the car with him is vito

the car stops at the gates and an old guard sees and
recognizes tomasino opens the gates allowing them to enter

med view

on an almost decrepit don francesco  he must be in his
early nineties sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever in his thronelike chair from which he manages the
power as the mafia chieftan of this village  young don
tomasino is speaking

we notice in a little distance in the rear there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders

				tomasino
			sicilian
		don francesco if you will honor
		me by allowing me to introduce my
		associate in america in new york
		his name is vito corleone

the old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name

				tomasino
		we will supply him with olive oil
		exclusively in the town of corleone
		his company is called the genco
		olive oil company here we have
		brought you an indication of how he
		will sell the product

tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it  the old man nods accepting the notion
of this business

				tomasino
			sicilian
		we have come to ask your blessing
		and permission to continue this
		enterprise

				don francesco
			sicilian
			 in a shrill high
			raspy voice
		where is this young man

				tomasino
		he is right here standing next to
		me don francesco

				don francesco
			sicilian
		have him come closer i cant see
		very well

vito takes those several steps so that he is standing right
in front of the old man

				don francesco
			sicilian
		you took the name of this town eh
		what was your fathers name

				vito
			sicilian
		antonio andolini

close view on the old man

the recognition of the name throws a shudder through him
it is as though he recognizes that this is the boy the son
of his old enemy whom he had killed and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out  the old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard and in his weak voice he shouts

				don francesco
			sicilian
		kill him  kill him

but he is too late vito steps forward

				vito
			sicilian
		in the name of my father and my
		brother

and uses the knife ritualistically plunging it into the old
mans belly and then up to his throat which is severed

view on tomasino

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards
helping vito to escape back into the motor car

view on a guard

raising his shotgun

int senate caucus room  med close view on michael  day

				senator kane os
		are you the son of vito corleone

				michael
		yes

				senator king
		did he use at times an alias  was
		this alias in certain circles
		godfather

				michael
		it was not an alias  godfather was
		a term of affection used by his
		friends one of respect

				senator weekler
			senator from new
			york very smooth
			partly liberal
			tammany hall
		let me agree with that  many of my
		constituents are italian and have
		been honored with that certain
		friendship by my close italian
		friends  up to this point before i
		have to leave this hearing to join
		my own committee let me say that
		this hearing on the mafia is in no
		way a slur on the italians by the
		senate nor is it meant to be nor
		will i allow it to be  italian
		americans are the hardest working
		most law abiding patriotic americans
		of our country  it is a shame and
		a pity that a few rotten apples
		give them a bad name  we are here
		to weed those rotten apples out of
		the vast healthy barrel of italian
		americans who are one of the
		backbones of our country

there is a pause for a while while the new york senator
poses for the tv cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff

				senator kane
		im sure we all agree with our
		esteemed colleague  now mr
		corleone you have been advised as
		to your legal rights  we have had
		testimony from a preceding witness
		who states you are head of the most
		powerful mafia family in this
		country  are you

				michael
		no

				senator kane
		this witness has testified that you
		are personally responsible for the
		murder of a new york police captain
		in the year 1947 and with him a man
		named virgil sollozzo  do you deny
		this

				michael
		i deny his every charge

				senator kane
		is it true that in the year 1950
		you devised the murder of the heads
		of the five families in new york
		to assume and consolidate your
		nefarious power

				michael
		that is a complete falsehood

				senator kane
		is it true that you own a
		controlling interest in three of
		the major hotels in las vegas

				michael
		that is not true  i own some stock
		in some of the hotels but only
		very small amounts  i also own
		some american telephone and ibm
		stock

michael had checked this point with hagen before answering
and then once again after the answer

				senator rogers
		why is it necessary for your
		counsel to advise you on that
		question

				michael
		senator ive observed the head of
		general motors before a senate
		committee and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear  that was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done

				senator kane
		mr corleone do you have any hotel
		interests in the state of arizona
		or any gambling interests in that
		state

				michael
		i do not

				senator kane
		do you have interests or control
		over gambling and narcotics in the
		state of new york

				michael
		i do not

a pause  silence as the chairman whispers something to his
assistant

tom hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase and addresses
the chair

				hagen
		senator my client would like to
		read a statement for the record

				senator kane
		i dont think thats necessary

				hagen
		sir my client has answered every
		question asked by this committee
		with the utmost cooperation and
		sincerity  he has not taken that
		fifth amendment as it was his right
		to do and which because of the
		extreme legal complexity of this
		hearing counsel advised him to do
		so i think in all fairness this
		committee should hear his statement
		and put it in the record

				senator kane
		very well

at this point senator rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room

				michael
			reading
		in the hopes of clearing my family
		name in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		american way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		i have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power  i consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all americans of italian extraction
		i consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		i am a criminal  i wish to have
		the following noted for the record
		that i served my country faithfully
		and honorably in world war ii and
		was awarded the distinguished
		service cross for actions in
		defense of my country  that i have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy whether it is called
		mafia or cosa nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give has
		ever been made public  only one
		man has made charges against me
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer arsonist and rapist  and
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name  my
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country  i
		can only thank god that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation  i
		thank god for our democratic due
		process of law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committees witness  i have not
		taken refuge behind the fifth
		amendment though counsel advised
		me to do so  i challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me and if they do
		not i hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it  i ask this
		without malice in the interests of
		fair play

the television cameras have documented this moment as hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer

				senator rogers
		we are all impressed  the committee
		will now recess over the weekend
		however it will continue monday
		morning at eleven am  at that
		time this committee will then
		produce a witness directly linking
		mr corleone to the charges we have
		made  and then mr corleone may
		very well by liable for indictments
		of perjury  however this document
		will be made a matter of record

ext army post  day

five cars brimming with army guards and agents are waiting
to move pentangeli  there is one empty car

int guarded house  day

the two fbi agents are helping pentangeli get dressed  hes
in brightly colored striped shorts and barechested  the
agents help him with the shirt and tie  one holds out the
trousers but pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror

				fbi man 1
		ready frankie

				pentangeli
		lets go

the agents open the door and precede him surveying the
area  they check the cars waiting each with two agents
they check the gate and note the military sentries  then
they stand aside and let pentangeli come out  they get
close to his side and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own

ext army post  day

the agents put him in the front seat of the empty car and
get in with him one at each side  another agent drives
now the first cars start out the sentries opening the
gates and letting the caravan pass

an army supply truck comes very close to them and the
agents next to pentangeli become very tense  pentangeli
grins  then the truck passes on and they relax

int senate caucus room  day

the room is crowded with tv journalists cameras etc  we
pick pentangeli up closely guarded being led to witness
chair

pentangeli is seated and made to take his oath  fbi agents
are all around him

med view

anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked
the five senators take their places

view on hagen

waiting at his long table very nervous  he seems startled
by the appearance of pentangeli

view on pentangeli

catching hagens eye  its as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor

view on hagen

cold then he turns away

view on the entrance

the bustle is settling down then michael corleone enters
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting  a burlychested imposing man of middle age
very powerfullooking with frightening magnetic eyes  his
dress is odd boots rough tie and shirt  he could be the
tenor out of a sicilian opera  he is clearly a country don
direct from sicily and he dominates the room

view on pentangeli

at first his view is blocked  then he sees michael and is a
bit shamefaced but still defiant

pentangelis pov

michael returns his glances without emotion  then the view
alters revealing the sicilian

view on pentangeli

he is terror stricken obviously he recognizes the man

view on hagens table

michael and the sicilian sit by hagen where they can stare
directly at pentangeli he is frozen with fear

view on the senator

notices the tension in the room  the chairman commences

				senator kane
		we have here a witness who will
		testify further on michael
		corleones rule of the criminal
		empire that controls gambling in
		this country and perhaps in other
		countries  this witness had no
		buffer between himself and michael
		corleone  he can corroborate our
		charges on enough counts for this
		committee to consider a charge of
		perjury against michael corleone
			then he turns to pentangeli
		your name please for the record

				pentangeli
		frank pentangeli

				senator kane
		were you a member of the corleone
		family  were you under the
		caporegime peter clemenza under
		vito corleone known as the
		godfather

there is a long silence

view on pentangeli

he seems unable to speak

view on the sicilian

gazing at him

view on pentangeli

				pentangeli
		i never knew no godfather  i got
		my own family

senator kane is stunned  the two fbi men are alert their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment

				senator kane
		mr pentangeli you are
		contradicting your confessions to
		our investigators i ask you again
		were you a member of a crime
		organization headed by michael
		corleone

				pentangeli
		no  i never heard of it  i never
		heard of nothing like that  i was
		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago  thats all

				senator kane
		we have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of michael
		corleone  do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you

the die is cast and like a good soldier pentangeli will go
all the way now  so he is brazen in his defiance of the
senator

				pentangeli
		the fbi guys promised me a deal
		so i made up a lot of stuff about
		michael corleone  because then
		thats what they wanted  but it
		was all lies  everything  they
		said michael corleone did this
		michael corleone did that  so i
		said yeah sure

he makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody

view on the fbi agents

glancing around the room their eyes have settled on the
sicilian  one of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper
and passes it to the committee lawyer  then in turn it goes
to senator kane

				senator kane
		mr hagen would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman
		sitting on your right hand

				hagen
			coolly
		yes sir  his name is vincenzo
		pentangeli

				senator kane
		is he related to the witness

				hagen
		he is i believe a brother

view on michael and vincenzo pentangeli

they wait with no expression

				senator kane
			to vincenzo pentangeli
		sir i would like you to take the
		stand

vincenzo stares at him uncomprehending  there may just be
a shadow of contempt  he doesnt answer

				hagen
		sir the gentleman does not
		understand english  he would not
		in any case take the stand  he
		came at his own expense to aid
		his brother in his trouble  he is
		not under any jurisdiction of our
		government and his reputation in
		his own country is impeccable

				senator kane
			furious
		the witness is excused take him out

the guards and fbi agents quickly remove pentangeli as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still

				hagen
		senator kane

				senator kane
		this meeting is adjourned

				hagen
			rising and shouting
		this committee owes an apology

				senator kane
		the committee is adjourned until
		further notice

for the first time in the midst of the confusion hagen
smiles  a bitter contemptuous smile

		michael  i promised myself i
		wouldnt talk about it and ive
		gone and spoiled it

				michael
		why too late

				kay
		tell me michael  what really
		happened with pentangeli

				michael
		his brother came to help him

				kay
		i didnt even know he had a brother
		and where is he now

				michael
		on a plane back to sicily

				kay
		and thats all he had to do  just
		show his face

				michael
		thats all  you see in sicily in
		the old days there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative only one  if he was a
		traitor

				kay
		you would have killed his brother

				michael
		kay youve got it wrong  that
		kind of things all over i promised
		you  this was between the two
		brothers  years ago frankie had a
		young girlfriend he called her his
		cowife  that was his joke but he
		meant it  he wouldnt divorce his
		wife because she was a great
		cook  he said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her  he set her up in a
		house in jersey  she had to be
		faithful and she had to have kids
		and she did two a boy and a girl
		he had her checked out and watched
		so she couldnt cheat but the
		girl couldnt stand that kind of
		life  she begged him to let her go
		he did  he gave her money and made
		her give up the kids  then frankie
		took them to italy and had them
		brought up by his brother vincenzo
		where he knew theyd by safe

kay begins to realize

				michael
		when he saw his brother in the
		hearing room he knew what was at
		stake
			pause
		i dont think vincenzo would have
		done it  he loves the kids too
		omerta kay  honor silence  it
		had nothing to do with me  it was
		between those brothers

				kay
		ill bring the children up now
		they want to say goodbye

				michael
		kay i told you

				kay
		goodbye michael

				michael
		i wont let you leave  christ do
		you think im going to let you leave

				kay
			meekly
		michael

				michael
		no i dont want to hear anything
		there are things between men and
		women that will not change things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years  you are my
		wife and they are my children
		and i love you and i will not let
		you leave because you are mine

				kay
		oh i do feel things for you
		michael but now i think its pity
		for the first time since ive known
		you you seem so helpless  you
		held me a prisoner once will you
		try again

				michael
		if thats what it takes then yes
		i will

				kay
		at this moment i feel no love for
		you at all  i never thought that
		could happen but it has

				michael
		well go back tonight  bring the
		children

				kay
		you havent heard me

he moves to her he does love her and is tender with her

				michael
		how can i let you leave how can i
		let you take my children away
		dont you know me  you understand
		its an impossibility  i would
		never let it happen no never not
		if it took all my strength all my
		cunning  but in time soon youll
		feel differently  you see youll
		be happy that i stopped you  i
		know you  youll forget about
		this youll forget about the baby
		we lost and well go on you and
		i

				kay
		the baby i lost

				michael
		i know what it meant and im
		prepared to make it up to you  i
		will make changes i can
			he clenches his fist tightly
		i can change that i have learned
		that i have the strength to change
		and we have another child a boy
		and youll forget the miscarriage

				kay
		it wasnt a miscarriage  and you
		with your cunning couldnt you
		figure it out  it was an abortion
		an abortion like our marriage is
		an abortion something unholy and
		evil  i dont want your son i
		wouldnt bring another of your sons
		into this world  an abortion
		michael it was a son and i had
		it killed but this must all end

view on michael

he had no hint not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing

				kay
		and i know that now its over i
		knew it then there would be no way
		you could ever forgive me not with
		this sicilian thing that goes back
		two thousand years

he is silent though raging  then with all his passion
and his strength he raises his arms and strikes her across
her neck literally knocking her down to the floor and
hurting her badly

				michael
			coldly
		you wont take my children
