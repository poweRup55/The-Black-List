	                    roy
	              full laugh
	          not very good
	
	she nods accepting the correction
	
	                    lilly 
	          a bad mother by any standards
	          ive thought about it you know
	          from your side since then i know
	          just how bad i was
	
	                    roy
	              closed against her
	          uhhuh
	
	                    lilly 
	          i wonder did you ever think about
	          it from my side
	
	                    roy
	              not worth discussing
	          never
	
	                    lilly 
	          no i guess not it was pretty
	          lousy of me i guess to be a child

	          had a child i guess i was a real
	          stinker not to be a grownup when
	          you needed a grownup
	
	roy didnt expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive and
	he resents it
	
	                    roy 
	          what do you want me to do pin a
	          halo on you youre doing a pretty
	          good job of that yourself

	          and making you feel bad at the same
	          time huh but thats the way i am

	          always picking on poor little roy
	
	                    roy 
	          for gods sake lilly
	
	                    lilly

	          need the money
	
	                    roy
	              not worth discussing
	          no
	
	lilly subsides back onto the sofa one hand rests on the
	attache case with the other she sips water puts the glass
	back down roy watches her unmoving expressionless lilly
	frowns not quite looking at him
	
	                    lilly
	          youre getting off the grift
	
	                    roy 
	          thats right
	
	                    lilly
	          thats good you dont really
	          belong on this side of the fence
	          you know
	
	                    roy 
	              amused
	          i dont
	
	                    lilly
	          if you stayed a crook do you think

	                    roy 
	          i dont see why not
	
	                    lilly
	          well i guess i got it wrong then
	          seems to me i heard about a guy
	          just your age that got hit so hard
	          in the guts it almost killed him
	
	roys again unexpectedly uncomfortable he shifts uneasily in
	his chair trying to think of a response
	
	                    roy 
	          well uh
	
	                    lilly
	          sure sure that doesnt count
	          thats different
	
	                    roy
	          well it doesnt matter does it
	          im getting out
	
	                    lilly
	              intense
	          and thats why youve got to get
	          rid of this money if you keep it
	          around itll just make you think
	          how clever you are
	          itll be a temptation to get back
	          into the game
	
	                    roy
	              full laugh
	          oh thats it youre stealing my
	          money for my own good how very
	          motherly of you lilly
	
	once again lilly drops back against the sofa back another
	round in the fight is over roy watches her patient waiting
	for her to give up seeing no other outcome
	
	an angle on lilly frustrated feeling the need to move the
	pressure of pursuit her head turns back and forth her body
	starts false gestures finally abruptly she gets to her
	feet looks at roy looks away picks up the attache case
	
	cu roy alert he wont let her reach the door
	
	an angle panning with lilly as she prowls the room pacing
	back and forth the attache case swinging at her side
	finally she stops standing the attache case on the coffee
	table her hand still on its handle
	
	                    roy 
	          lilly
	
	she looks at him attentive without hope
	
	                    roy 
	          if i should get out of the racket
	          that goes double for you thats
	          why youve got to change your life

	          square job live like a john

	          way what future is in it
	
	                    lilly 
	          a future the only future ive got
	
	                    roy 
	          that money wouldnt last forever
	          and then what youd be back in
	          some other part of the rackets
	          another bobo justus to slap you
	          around and burn holes in your
	          hands this way youve got to go
	          the square route you could send me
	          a card when youre settled i could
	          maybe help out sometimes
	
	                    lilly
	              bitter laugh 
	          thats what it is isnt it keep
	          me down your turn to be in charge
	          have the power
	
	                    roy
	              stonewalling
	          just trying to help lilly
	
	she sits on the sofa again this time leaving the attache
	case to stand on the coffee table she studies roy
	calculating
	
	                    lilly 
	          roy what if i told you i wasnt
	          really your mother that we werent
	          related
	
	                    roy
	              bewildered
	          what
	
	lilly leans back again but this time her manner is
	different languorous sexy she crosses her legs the upper
	leg swinging gently she smiles gently encouragingly at
	roy
	
	                    lilly 
	          youd like that wouldnt you sure
	          you would you dont need to tell
	          me now why would you like it
	          roy
	
	an angle on roy understanding and not wanting to understand
	
	                    roy
	              hoarse
	          whats that all about of course
	          youre my mother of course you
	          are
	
	two shot lilly leans forward toward roy inviting him
	
	                    lilly
	              very soft
	          roy roy
	
	roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface
	
	                    roy 
	          theres nothing more to talk about
	
	                    lilly
	              very soft
	          i have to have that money roy
	          what do i have to do to get it
	
	an angle on roy his face bruisedlooking eyes scared he
	will not know whats going on he shakes his head not
	trusting himself to speak
	
	an angle on lilly leaning forward tension showing through
	the seductive manner
	
	                    lilly 
	          no wont you give me the money
	          roy cant i change your mind what
	          can i do to change your mind
	
	two shot as lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
	him roys pressed back into his chair trying to maintain a
	cold facade
	
	                    roy 
	          lilly jesus what are you doing
	
	                    lilly
	          is there nothing i can do roy
	          nothing at 
	
	                    roy 
	          no
	
	they both turn away at the same instant roy turns to the
	side to pick up the glass of water to break the spell and
	the tension lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
	picks up the attache case roy lifting the glass to drink
	turns forward again as lilly spins forward swinging the
	attache case at his head with all her might the case crashes
	into the glass and into his face roy screams and topples off
	the chair as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
	money goes flying filling the air
	
	an angle down at roy face up expression horrified hands to
	his throat a large triangle of glass is in his throat blood
	pumps thickly fountaining up
	
	cu lilly staring down in horror she lurches forward but
	theres nothing to do she stares around
	
	ecu wads of bills on the floor getting bloody
	
	cu lilly in agony but looking down kicking
	
	ecu lillys feet kicking the bills away from the blood 
	
	two shot as lilly drops to her knees beside roy whos
	already dying blood spurts less forcefully his hands fall
	to his sides eyes stare upward mouth still moves slightly
	lilly shoving money away with her hands now stares at him
	willing it not to happen he stops moving his eyes dull
	lilly clasps her arms around herself she knows she doesnt
	dare scream lips drawn back in a snarl teeth clenched she
	hisses her agony through her teeth she hisses she hisses
	she hisses then slowly she regains control
	
	wide shot as lilly gets to her feet she seems dazed now
	like someone whos just been in a traffic accident she
	blunders around the room kicks the attache case bends to
	pick it up she studies the clasp sees it still works goes
	back to her knees
	
	low angle lilly in fg roy in bg as lilly repacks the
	money into the case wiping the blood from some wads onto the
	carpet finishing she closes the case then remains on her
	knees bending over the case she weeps grindingly
	
	wide shot entrance door in bg lillys weeping subsides
	she gets wearily to her feet and leaves the room camera
	holds sound of water running in sink sound stops lilly
	reappears she does not again look toward roy she picks up
	the attache case crosses to the door opens it steps across
	the threshold reaches back to switch off the light go to
	black
	
	                          the end
