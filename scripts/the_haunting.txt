     unintelligible babbling eerie  then a loud flapping sound  it 
     shifts from one side of the theater to the other like something 
     moving among the wall hangings

     as the title appears the noise mounts drowning out the voices

     on a housing project in the industrial outskirts of boston  the
     banging seems to flutter away leading us along searching to a 
     tiny balcony one of dozens ten stories up  and there the source 
     of the sound

     on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to 
     get in

                   you should be thanking lou for

                   pee

     nell reacts but rather than being amused or annoyed a wave of 
     trauma flickers over her face  the reaction is so strong we 
     instantly know something is very wrong

                               lou
                   richie knock it off before i beat

     jane picks up a jewelry box from a dresser

                               jane
                   youre sure this is all of 
                   mothers jewelry  the lawyer said

                   antique pieces  have you seen
                   anything  some of it might be
                   valuable

     can bear the weight of nells stare checks her watch  she nods at 
     lou  lou rises pocketing the coin set  richie follows him out

                               jane contd
                   think about our offer nell  you 
                   dont know how hard it is out 
                   there

     int nells kitchen  day

     nell rams through the door into the small kitchen spotless empty
     and then bursts into tears  shaking she digs in her back pocket 
     and pulls out a fine filigree necklace  her mothers  its from 
     an age gone by

     clutching the necklace she goes back out the door

     int living room nells apartment  day

     nell crosses the living room straight for the closed french doors 
     the glass obscured by gauze curtains  she throws them open and 
     enters 

     int sick room  day continuous

      what once was a dining room  transformed into a sick room  
     drawn shades  dim  the first traces of dust

     nell lingers in the doorway a beat daunted

     a perfectly made bed  the pillow however retains the impression 
     of a head  lodged between the bed and a nightstand a cane  on 
     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet  iv stand  
     shrouded white shapes

     on the wall above the bed a framed needlepoint counsels a place 
     for everything everything in its place  a bit of wisdom  a way 
     to live a life

     a way nell has lived for too long  seeing it galvanizes her into
     movement  she goes to an old armoire a medicine chest opens it
     removes a bottle of tylenol with codeine and marches out

     int living room nells apartment  day

     nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors exhales  she has 
     been holding her breath

     int nells kitchen  day

     nell sits at her tiny kitchen table water glass and tylenol in 
     front of her  the necklace dangles from her fingers  she stares 
     mesmerized by it  then she undoes the hasp  the clothes line 
     outside batters louder 

      and defiant nell puts the necklace on  she closes her eyes

     silence  the battering has stopped  a beat  and then the phone 
     rings  nell opens her eyes  the phone rings  keeps ringing  
     nell feeling the drug finds her way to the phone and picks up

                               nell
                   hello  yes this is eleanor
                    where  yes its right here

     wanted  research subjects  90000week  rmbd  beautiful 
     old house in berkshires  psychology studyend main title sequenceint psych observation lab  day

     the lab feels more like the video center of a security office than 
     a psychologists laboratory  two banks of black and white monitors 
     give us images of men and women different ages different races 
     wired to electrodes  they are taking psychological tests although 
     we never see the testers  the subjects are working through 
     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests  
     there are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors  on 
     the left the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time 
     on the right the subjects are also twitching but in no 
     discernible sequence  the subjects on the left are better able to 
     concentrate on their tasks  the subjects on the right keep 
     stopping and going over what they have done

     two menmalcolm keogh in his 50s is a graying professor the 
     head of the department someone we trust

     he facesprofessor james marrow  he is a man whose confidence 
     rests uneasily on his ambition and in the tension between the two 
     is the power that makes him the teacher students love  right now 
     though he is defending himself before a department review  this 
     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk its more free 
     form

     the men are having a fight and they are watched by other 
     professors

                               malcolm
                   its still an electric shock

                               marrow
                   come on malcolm its only seven
                   ohms its nothing its like a
                   joy buzzer  and its not about
                   the pain its about the
                   interference with concentration

     malcolm looks at the monitor  this is marrows chance to explain 
     it again

                               marrow contd
                   look look at what it does  the 
                   subjects on the left because they 
                   anticipate the shocks make the 
                   adjustment and lose nothing on 
                   their scores  the subjects on the 
                   right because the shocks are 
                   random cant anticipate and the 
                   distraction throws them off

                               malcolm
                   stop defending your science after 
                   the fact jim  the department 
                   protocol for research is very 
                   clear about this and you violated 
                   the rules  i know i know i know 
                   that fear and performance is a 
                   big sexy idea but as long as im 
                   chairman here you will need this 
                   departments endorsement to 
                   publish it and right now i cant 
                   do that

     at this momentmary lambretta late 20s marrows pretty ta 
     opens the door with an armload of files  whatever else shes 
     wearing she wears glasses  marrow seeing her motions for her to 
     go away  he doesnt break eye contact with malcolm  mary 
     hesitates

                               marrow
                   malcolm this is essential work 
                   im doing  just think what my 
                   research can do for education  
                   elementary school classrooms near 
                   train tracks or airports where 
                   loud noise is random this helps 
                   to prove the need for sound 
                   insulation if the children are 
                   ever going to learn to read

                               malcolm
                   and that will be a good place to 
                   end this study

                               marrow
                   no malcolm  individual 
                   performance is only part of it  i 
                   know why baseball players choke 
                   for no reason i know why 
                   violinists throw up with fear 
                   before every concert and need to 
                   to give a great performance but 
                   what i want to know is how fear 
                   works in a group

                               malcolm
                   not the way youve constructed 
                   your group its just not ethical

                               marrow
                   but if the group knows its being 
                   studied as a group you 
                   contaminate the results  the 
                   deception is minor

     malcolm sees mary lambretta

                               malcolm
                   are you working with her

                               marrow
                   mary ill meet you outside

     she understands and she closes the door

                               malcolm
                   why are you working with her  
                   mary lambretta was thrown out of 
                   the department for trying to get a 
                   phd in psychic studies

                               marrow
                   and after she was thrown out she 
                   needed a job

                               malcolm
                   you dont believe in the 
                   paranormal

                               marrow
                   no but she does and thats all 
                   that matters

                               malcolm
                   does she know thats why youre 
                   using her

                               marrow

                   shes smart  and she helps me

                               malcolm
                   i have a bad feeling about what 
                   youre doing

                               marrow
                   this is the last chapter  please 
                   please give me clearance  its 
                   for science

     marrow waits

                   im gonna hate myself for this

     but he nods  permission granted

                               marrow

     eyes and does a gypsy voice

                   describes him  the hostile man 
                   does not believe in madame velka

     this relieves the pressure  malcolm is not listening anymore and
     storms off

                               mary
                   you know what hes really upset

     mary studies the picture and she cant answer him  in her 
     glasses we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph a 
     glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys

     int nells car  day

     nell in a rustwormed old buick glances from the road to 
     computerdrawn directions to hill house  she hums a tune soft 
     lonely like a lullaby but eerie offkey

     life sounding like a pig  and it makes her burst out in
     embarrassing animal laughter

     ext hillsdale  day establishing

     the whitesteepled church five stores and gas station of hillsdale

     ext gas station  day

     nell is pumping gas at a country station  she is alone at the 
     pump  as she finishes she hears a baby crying  she looks up  
     she is immediately drawn by the sound

     she moves to a car at another pump  the car is empty  the windows 
     are rolled up  she peers into the car through the window and 
     sees a toddler in a car seat  the child is crying  nell looks 
     around no one is there  she makes faces at the baby coos to it

                               nell
                   hello baby

     she does a peekaboo game and the baby stops crying the baby 
     even starts to giggle

     a voice from behind

     nell turns  the mother is a busy country mom arms filled with

                   that

     the woman smiles in something like sympathy and gets in her car  
     when she does we see a friendly gas station attendant appear 
     behind nell

                               nell contd
                   umm im a little lost

     nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map

                               nell
                   they sent me directions and ive 
                   got a map but its kind of 
                   confusing  here its a place 
                   called hill house

     his helpful attitude changes dramatically

                               gas station attendant
                   hill house

     he takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up

                               nell
                   what are you doing

                               gas station attendant
                   you dont want to go there

     he turns abruptly and walks away

                               nell
                   did i say something wrong to you

     nell slams the buick door and breathing hard starts the engine  
     she gets control and puts the car in gear  shes shaken  badly

     ext country lane  day

     nells buick bounces over a country road  the car works its way up
     into the steep switchbacking hills

     int nells car  day

     nell looks out at the forest feels a chill  the road is more like 
     a tunnel through the forest than a road

     ext hills  day

     nells car speeds through the trees climbing the hills higher and
     higher into the awesome solitude

     int nells car  day

     nell takes a final switchback and something off to the right 
     catches her eye then is gone in the trees  she watches again for 
     it  there  a glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back 
     twenty yards from the road

     there it is again  mossgreened twenty feet high a wicked array 
     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it

     and then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of
     immense stone pillars  between them a steel gate as high as the 
     wall chained and padlocked

     ext hill house gate  day

     the gate stands immense  silent  forbidding  beyond them a 
     gravel drive curves away through the trees  nell kills her car 
     gets out instructions in hand  no one in sight  a long beat  
     she reaches in and blows the horn

     the horn shatters the air rackets off the trees beyond the gate
     echoing  silence

     nell blows the horn a sustained staccato in annoyance  the echo
     replies in a terrible deafening battering of sound  nell covers 
     her ears  silence once again

     in a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it  its
     locked good  she turns 

      and there is a man right behind her  it ismr dudley his hair
     tied back like an exhippie  he stands between nell and her open
     car door weed spear in hand  he smiles at her  rough dirty
     massive

                               mr dudley
                   what do you want

                               nell
                   oh  you scared me

                   dudley up at the house  is she 
                   here

     she hands him the directions  he glances at them  she uses the
     distraction to get into her car

                               mr dudley
                   maybe she is

     int nells car  day

     nell looks at the gate some part of her aware its a point of no
     return  mr dudley eases over to her window  mr dudley gives her 
     one last look and goes to the gate  he produces a keyring and 
     undoes the padlock

                               nell
                   why do you need a chain like that

                               mr dudley
                   thats a good question  what is 
                   it about fences  sometimes a 
                   locked chain makes people on both 
                   sides of the fence just a little 
                   more comfortable  why would that 
                   be

     he unwinds the enormous chain heavy turn after heavy turn  the 
     gates swing in revealing hill house

                               nell
                   is there something about the 
                   house

                               mr dudley
                   mrs dudleyll be waiting for you

     grinning dudley steps aside and nell rolls through  and at that 
     he just grins wider  nell pulls away  disturbed she watches him 
     in the rearview mirror  she turns and in front of her sprawls hill 
     house  at center the features of the oldest part of the house 
     dwarf all others towering eyelike windows and the jaws of a 
     grand entry with carved ebony doors

     ext hill house driveway  day

     the car rumbles up the drive toward the carport

     int nells car  day

     nell stops the car in front of the entrance right inside the 
     carport  in the silence all we can hear is her breathing

     ext hill house  day

     her car sits in front of the house tiny alone  its brake lights 
     go off

     the fingerlike pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning 
     the car in place under the houses gaze

     nell gets out of the car

     nell stares daunted yet there is something about the house  a
     romance in its lilac heavy gothic decay  nell feels it is drawn 
     to it

     ext grand entry  day

     nell suitcase in hand climbs the steps to the front doors  on 
     closer inspection the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a 
     garden of eden  at center on the knocker a tarnished silver adam 
     takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart eve

     nell lifts adam and knocks heavily  there is no answer  nell 
     looks around for some sign of life

     off to one side is a ladder and paint cans  somebody mustve been
     touching up the window trim

     when she looks back the door is ajar a fraction of an inch

                               nell
                   hello  hello  mrs dudley  mrs 
                   dudley are you here  anybody

     tentative she pushes it open into 

     int grand entry  day continuous

      a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far 
     above  rays of light filter through floortoceiling curtains  
     doors lead off in a half dozen directions

     every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved 
     filigreed painted or ornamented in wild ornate fashion  it 
     overwhelms the eye

                               nell
                   wow

     she turns around sets her suitcase on the marble floor  a short
     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space dimly 
     lit

     and then nell hears a sound  carrying through the empty halls from
     some distant place a low plaintive moan

     nell freezes  the moaning stops  nell strains her ears  and then 
     the moan again  it comes from the short hallway ahead  nell 
     starts for it  the moan stops

     int hall from entry to great hall  day

     nell moves down the hall  its dim stale lined with pier tables
     candelabra

                   hello  hello  mrs dudley

     her voice echoes from the room beyond  she follows her own voice
     into 

     int great hall  day continuous

      a long oval great hall  passages and doors lead off in all
     directions to godknowswhere  a doublegrand staircase at the far 
     end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the 
     next floor  magnificent animal heads carved on the newel posts 
     glare at her

     nell makes her way past clusters of furniture stops at the center
     silence  an enormous fireplace dominates one wall  large enough 
     to stand in  an iron mesh screen hangs in its mouth  mantle and 
     chimney rise in dark baroque masonry becoming lost in the shadows 
     above

     the moaning sound  nell spins away from the fireplace  the sound 
     rises from the door at the very back of the hall  nell takes a 
     step toward it

                               nell
                   mrs dudley

     she moves up to the door puts a hand out to it  the moaning 
     rises nell pushes through 

     int 1st floor hallway towards kitchen  day continuous

      into a much narrower curving hallway  doors all along it  the
     sound comes from the door right there across from the one nell just
     came through  she flings it open 

     int kitchen  day continuous

      and comes through into a vast kitchen  a woman in black with 
     her back to nell stands at a counter  the moaning comes from a
     disreputable old can opener

     nell breaths feels stupid  the woman senses her turns from her 
     cans of potatoes  she ismrs dudley sallow unsmiling

     mrs dudley glides up the stairs  nell follows hoisting her 
     suitcase after her  it appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a 
     hallway  but as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an 
     enormous oil painting  in it stands a man his features lost in 
     the shadows above only his body visible

     the nameplate reads hugh crain

                               nell

     int 2nd floor hallway north wing  day

     mrs dudley leads nell down a curved hallway over aged persian
     carpets and turns to a door on her left  she throws it open

                   house has had since mister crain

     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark coffered ceiling of carved
     ivory  a kingsize bed furniture all in blue purple  an open 
     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom

                   around if you need help  we 
                   couldnt even hear you in the 
                   night

                               nell
                   why would we 

                               mrs dudley
                    no one could  no one lives any 
                   nearer than town  no one will 
                   come any nearer than that  in the 
                   night  in the dark

     and with that mrs dudley grins rictuslike  she turns and closes 
     the door after her

     nell stands there a long moment the room silent heavy old  she 
     goes to the windows peers out  nothing but forest for milesthesun is setting

     nell removes her windbreaker opens her suitcase takes out a 
     blouse and skirt  decent enough clothes but cheap the tags still 
     on them

     int 2nd floor hallway north wing  day

     nell emerges from her room in her new clothes  the hallway curves 
     away into the distance lined with massive ornate doorframes like 
     the one to her room

     trying to get a better look nell searches the walls for a light
     switch but cant find one  she follows the chair rail back to 

     int mezzanine  sunset continuous

      the mezzanine at the top of the stairs  she searches in vain 
     for a light switch there  finally she spots a set of curtains and 
     slings them open

     the light lateday though it is makes her wince  the window 
     looks down on the driveway  outside a beige car crunches over the 
     gravel  somebody else has arrived

     nell watches the car move past trying to get a glimpse of the 
     driver but from up here all she can see is roof

                               nell
                   finally

     she backs away from the window spins around 

      and out of the darkness powerful mad looms the visage of hugh
     crain  it is the painting  it is only from up here on the second 
     floor with this curtain open that the face is visible in the late
     day sunlight

     despite the artists discretion the lines in the mans skin his
     eyes his posture cry of unspeakable sickness

     unconsciously nell takes a step back  in the far bg near the 
     end of one of the halls a door stands open the second or third 
     set of doors in the gothic hallway left of the painting  just as 
     it starts to come into view and were starting to see it it 
     swings silently shut

     but nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye

     int 2nd floor hallway north wing  day

     nell stares down the long hallway  which door was it

                               nell
                   hello

     no response  she starts down the hall slow at first then faster

     she passes door after door shadow after shadow and as she nears 
     the end of the hall there is no door here  not within 20 feet 
     of where we thought we just saw it

     a whisper  voices  nell backs away  and then laughter  behind 
     her  its coming from another stairwell  very real and very 
     human

     int back stairway  day

     nell looks down from the top of the stairs  below mrs dudley andtheo 20s exotic sophisticated in vera wang leather wrestle with
     a pile of designer luggage  theo peers up  shes dark sexy in an
     amused worldly way someone who has seen and done it all

                   with me everywhere is a cheap and 
                   exploitative way of making new 
                   friends  my names theo

     theo foists a very heavy bag off on mrs dudley who looks like shes
     been handed a snake  that makes nell smile  she comes running down 
     to help with the bags

                               nell

     the long hall is lost in shadow its long rows of doors waiting in 
     the deadening silence  a lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of 
     light  the walls glow in rich tones the lowrelief carvings a 
     wormswood of shadow

     nell runs her hand over a wall panel as theo peeks into a 
     neighboring room

     swirls of oil that compose his face  the figure is daunting but 
     dead  just a painting  four different hallways lead into the 
     mezzanine all dark and endless in the stray light

     forces a smile and points to one on the left  they both disappear 
     into the dark gothic hallway

     int small parlor confusing rooms  dusk

     theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains
     panelled walls rich settees  other doors lead off the room  nell
     follows

     another mysterious hallway 

     int statuary hall  dusk continuous

      into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary  theo
     strides down it pointing left and right bending over straddling 
     the pieces provocative

     int hall of mirrors  dusk continuous

     through a narrow passageway and large double doors they suddenly
     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors 
     and chandeliers  rows of mirrorcoated octagonal pillars rise to a
     vaulted mirrored ceiling far above  with the door opening theres 
     a click and a mechanism of some sort is activated  the floor 
     begins to move like a slow turntable

     theo comes right up looks over nells shoulder  nell steps out

     she traipses out across the room her million reflections waltzing
     with her into infinity  theo dances after her  they dance not 
     quite together  nell stops and pronounces

     nell blushes and they burst out laughing  they take off running
     their reflections with them stampeding for an archway on the far 
     side of the room and out 

     int 1st floor halls various  dusk continuous

      into yet another hallway  they race down the hall turn into
     another hall then another all dimly lit by the very last rays of
     day all furnished in the houses dark impossibly complicated
     impossibly ornate fashion  as they go the mood is growing darker 
     the women unaware that they are getting lost

     they stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the houses
     forgotten outlying wings  it is dark  too dark  nell and theo 
     regard the darkness

     at the far end of the hall stand a pair of mahogany doors closed
     almost black oilylooking  surrounding them an enormously complex
     geometrical frieze

     the doors themselves are plain  in their simplicity there is 
     something about them enormously disturbing  it is as if the doors 
     are looking back at them nell goes cold  theo holds herself

                               nell
                   we should go back

                   the man who completes the group

     for a long moment they stand there silent looking at each other 
     polite smiles but awkward even marrow  one by one they all look 
     to him for a cue

                               marrow contd
                   well why dont we get some dinner

                           to the great hall
                   welcome to hill house everyone

     int great hall  night

     marrow leads the way across the hall  the others check out the
     furnishings as they pass

                               todd
                   these old victorian houses are 
                   great arent they

                               luke
                          points to details 
                           adjust for set
                   its not victorian everyone 
                   thinks that the whole nineteenth 
                   century was victorian  this is 
                   gothic this is english craftsman 
                   this is romanesque  this is 
                   insane  who lives here

                               marrow
                   nobody  a local mill owner hugh 
                   crain built it in 1830  he had 
                   no heirs but he put the house in 
                   trust and the farmland around it 
                   with the stipulation that it never 
                   be altered or sold  crains 
                   executors made good investments 
                   and for the last hundred and 
                   twenty years hill house has taken 
                   care of itself

     mary is shaken by the house but shes honoring marrows request
     everywhere she looks she feels the presence of something

                               todd
                   so whats this study all about 
                   anyway  mary described the kind 
                   of tests well be doing but 
                   didnt fill us in on the big 
                   picture  she said you needed bad 
                   sleepers but this wasnt about 
                   curing the problem

                               mary
                   i can tell you what this is about

                               marrow
                   eat first questions later mary 
                   please

     they exit the hall mary and nell last and as they do nell sees
     marys strange look  she stops

                               nell
                   is something wrong

                               mary
                   no  just when i saw your 
                   picture i had a feeling about you 
                   and now that i meet you i know i 
                   was right

                               nell

                               mary
                   eat first questions later

     and suddenly awkward mary exits after the others

     int dining room  night

     a chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table  laughter  at 
     the end nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner 
     which has been going on for hours  luke is opening another bottle 
     of jug wine

                               luke

                   alone  nobodys talking to me but 
                   myself  my mind is racing with 
                   ideas and i can think

                               luke
                   nah youre going crazy with 
                   doubt all of your mistakes are 
                   coming back up the pipes and its 
                   worse than a nightmare 

     nell isnt used to people being so direct and at the same time
     playful  she glances at marrows left hand no wedding ring

                               theo contd
                   excuse me

                   everybodys problem we just have 
                   different variations i for 
                   example  i fall asleep easily  
                   but i wake up around two or three 
                   in the morning every morning  
                   its that time of night that 
                   fitzgerald called the deep dark 
                   night of the soul  i stare 
                   into the abyss  every night
                          breaks his own 
                           somber mood
                   its the price i pay for being 
                   such a jolly fellow
                          to mary
                   y usted

                               mary
                   i think id fall asleep easily 
                   but just as i start to feel 
                   comfortable i see things in the 
                   dark

     nell hears this nell is tuned into mary

                               mary
                   i feel the presence of something 
                   watching me  its not scary 
                   not by itself but i dont want 
                   to go to sleep because im worried 
                   about the thing attacking me  so 
                   when i finally do fall asleep im 
                   like a soldier whos fallen asleep 
                   at her post  i feel like ive 
                   betrayed myself  nell

     nell wishes she could hide under her plate

                   pretenses  its silly its not 
                   like well all of you have 
                   trouble sleeping because you live 
                   in the world and the world is 
                   complicated and scary but 
                   nothings ever happened to me  so 
                   i dont have a reason to sleep 
                   badly

                               marrow
                   you wrote that you had trouble 
                   sleeping

                               nell
                   yes because someone was always 
                   keeping me awake  ever since i 
                   was little  that was my job  i 
                   took care of my mother and i had 
                   to be there for her all night 
                   long and she woke up all the 
                   time  and after she died well 
                   its been a few months but i 
                   still i still wake up its a 
                   habit
                          beat
                   i know weve only known each other 
                   a couple of hours but im really 
                   glad to be with people who let me 
                   talk about this  im really happy 
                   to be here with you

     silence  the others are embarrassed by her sincerity  shes right
     nell is not of their world

                               marrow
                   were glad youre here

     he says this with enough sympathy for theo to see his interest in 
     the girl in the thrift shop dress

                               marrow contd
                   why dont we move to another room

     int red parlor  night

     the harp sings out lively expertly played by mary  theo luke 
     todd and nell are impressed with her skill

                               mary
                   its an erard  late 1870s

     she plays and as she does shes aware of the room and the house
     and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace or a window
     something at the edge of perception  she suddenly stops

                               nell
                   whats wrong

                               mary
                   the harp is out of tune

     she finds a key and begins tightening the strings  as marrow bangs
     open the door briefcase in one hand cell phone in the other  he
     cant conceal his irritation  marrow removes folders from his
     briefcase passes them around while she plays  nell again studies 
     the cherub of death on the spine of the leather bound books

                               marrow
                   ill have to count david watts as 
                   a noshow  so lets start  thank 
                   you mary

     that was a little abrupt she feels it  everybody finds a chair or
     spot on the sofa  mary remains on the stool by the harp  marrow 
     sits in a large wingedback chair

                               marrow contd
                   all right  so to answer your 
                   earlier question todd why are we 
                   here  what do we all need in 
                   life what are the basics  we 
                   need food we need water we need 
                   sleep  sleep  all of you resist 
                   it  why  what does that mean  
                   why do we resist sleep  my field 
                   of study is the individuals 
                   psychology of emotion and 
                   performance

                               luke
                   so why did you need the addams 
                   family mansion for a scientific 
                   test

                               marrow
                   i thought it best to be isolated 
                   to be in a location with a 
                   definite sense of history and i 
                   wanted to make sure that it wasnt 
                   so pleasant youd all sleep too 
                   easily  youll be taking a 
                   variety of tests none of them 
                   harmful and youve got the house 
                   the grounds and each other to 
                   keep you company

                               theo
                   when do we take the tests

                               marrow
                   every day  basically well be 
                   hanging out together like we have 
                   so far this evening

     nell and theo are looking through their folders sheets of paper
     bizarre geometric puzzles

                               marrow
                   also there is no phone service to 
                   the house and no tv  i have the 
                   cell phone for emergencies  well 
                   begin the tests after breakfast 
                   tomorrow  

     the others shuffle through papers nell and todd intent on them 
     theo interested but not overly so luke bored

                               mary
                   dr marrow what is this house

     when she says this we should be seeing her from an odd perspective
     the houses pov

                   there was once a king who built a

                   his heart was broken

                   thats so sad

     this has been tense between them a gunfight  pop  a log in the
     fireplace makes everyone jump  theo relishes it but nell shudders

                               mary

                   doctor marrow i can play it for 
                   you i can hear it

     mary plays channeling unholy music from the house from the walls
     from the curtain from the air  her fingers fly down the harp to 
     the thickest wire and 

      tang  like a steel whip the wire snaps

     mary screams in pain

                               mary
                   my eye oh my eye my 
                   eye oh no

     the others leap up in shock  blood lines the wall behind her  she
     clutches at her eye more blood spilling out from between her 
     fingers

                               todd
                   oh jesus

     marrow and theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain

     todd is frozen pale like hes about to be sick  nell turns the 
     other way but not because shes scared  shes searching for a 
     shot glass on a side table

     marrow wraps mary in his arms  her shrieking becomes a terrified 
     but quieter wail

                               marrow
                   mary let me see your eye

     nell appears by his side with the glass  marrow pries marys hand 
     from her face

     blood flows freely from the eyelid but her eye is intact

                               nell
                   here cover it  dont let her 
                   touch it

     sits there moaning glass covering her eye blood spilling out 
     around the edges  luke is on her side of the car

     moon

     int mezzanine  night

     luke catches up with nell and theo as he reaches the mezzanine  the
     painting of hugh crain barely visible in the shadows looms right
     behind

                   experiment  personally i dont 
                   think hes got a large enough 
                   sample for valid results but as 
                   long as the moneys good and the 
                   food is good im in

     he heads off  theo turns to find nell staring at the animal heads 
     on the stairs  theo touches her  she starts

     int marrows bedroom part of confusing rooms  night

     marrow sitting at a desk speaks into a digital voice recorder  
     his voice is cold analytical

                   publish or perish

     he turns off the light  the shadows in the room are too much for 
     him he turns the light on and then pulls the blanket over his 
     head

     int nells room  night

     nell finishes putting things away in drawers  theo watches leaning 
     in the doorway  nell looks around at the room and this is her new
     familys new home  theo smiles sweetly at her comes over  an 
     awkward moment as the seriousness drains away

                               theo
                   ever try putting your hair up in a 
                   french twist

     theo reaches for nells hair  nell pulls away  theo pauses  nell
     realizes she shouldnt have pulled back

                               nell
                   sorry  im not used to being 
                   touched

     she moves closer to let theo examine her hair  theo takes nells 
     hair holds it up in a french twist

                               theo
                   youve been out of the world for a 
                   long time havent you

                   yes  ive missed it

                               theo
                   no  the world has missed you

     cautiously nell peers in a mirror at herself and likes what she
     sees  theo lets nells hair drop  theo moves for the door

                               nell
                   good night theo

                               theo
                   you too  happy tossing and 
                   turning

     int nells room  night

     as nell steps out of frame and starts undressing the camera finds 
     the carved mantle the denselypacked scene of children at play 
     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles their eyes blind but 
     staring oc where we sense nell changing

     now in a long teeshirt nell crawls up onto the high bed  its
     headboard is heavy dark engraved with fanlike shapes maybe 
     plants

     she draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard

     something about it bothers nell but she cant put her finger on it
     she twists over on her side and turns out the light on the 
     nightstand for a moment all there is in the darkness is her 
     breathing 

     int great hall  night

      then almost silence  we pull back from the childrens faces on 
     the doors of the great hall to reveal the vast room standing in 
     darkness  covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows things 
     that in the day would be lamps the stuff of life  but now at the 
     very deepest limit of human hearing it is as if something exhales

     int grand stairway  night

     it is black at the top of the stairs  the carved animal heads on 
     the balusters are all turned up the stairway eyes starting in fear
     waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness

     int hall outside locked room  night

     eyes  eyes of all the mythological figures  staring down the long
     black hallway  awaiting something  afraid

     at the end of the hallway where all eyes are staring the double
     doors the ones that scared nell and theo stand shut

     that something gathering at the edge of our hearing rises  rises as 
     if the house itself is breathing

     int nells room  night

     bump  the sound thuds the stillness of the house  bump  bump  
     bump  deep hollow distant like a dream  nell sits up still 
     asleep body moving by reflex

                               nell
                   coming mother

     whump  the noise jars her consciousness lighting up her mind very
     real  nell remembers where she is

     bump bang  its coming from somewhere far off in the house  nell
     listens in cold dread

                               theo oc
                   nell

     nell spins to the bathroom door goes through 

     int nells bathroom  night continuous

      the unlit bathroom slamming the door to her room behind her
     across and out the other door 

     int theos room  night continuous

      into theos room  thump bump bump  nell finds theo right in 
     front of her hair wet kneeling in the bed clutching her covers to
     herself

                               theo
                   what is it

     the sound grows nearer  out in the hall  like something searching
     coming toward them

     nell lunges at the door  theo grabs to stop her and nell sees the
     door is deadbolted  theres a rushing sound on the other side of 
     the tall door  right there  nell freezes  bump  bump

                               theo contd
                   nell

     nell recoils to theos side drags theo out of bed to the corner of
     the room

     nell and theo stare out at us in terror  bump  bump  bump  bump

     nell and theos eyes travel over the walls following whatever it is
     which now seems to bemoving out here in the theater

     the sound moves along the wall to the right reaching its loudest as
     it crosses the back of the theater then seems to come down the left
     side

     theo shivers  nell clutches her close  nell writhes unable to 
     stand it any longer  she jumps up

                               theo contd
                   nell

     nell charges the door screaming

                               nell
                   no

     silence  the bumping goes dead  nell blinks looks back at theo  
     but theo is looking at her hands

                               theo contd
                   cold  oh god  feel it

     she looks up in horror at nell  their breath fogs in the air  nell
     holds her hand up in front of her and as we watch her hair prickles
     up goosebumps with them

     her eyes turn up to the door and bambabambam babba bam  the door
     jars in its frame leaping from the blows of whatevers on the other
     side

     nell backpedals but slips on the rug falls there on the floor right
     in front of the door  theo screams

     silence  the banging stops  with a rush whatever is outside the 
     door is no longer there

     nell looks at theo

     then theo looks at the bathroom

     nell starts for it grabs theos door but its designed to be 
     locked from the bathroom side  nell looks up 

     int nells bathroom  night continuous

      and takes a step into the pitchdark bathroom  theo appears in 
     the doorway behind her  across the bathroom the door to nells room 
     is closed  nell dashes for it 

      but a sudden scuttling sound stops her dead  on the other side 
     of the door  rasping over wood  like a thing without hands trying 
     to turn 

      the doorknob  a long beat  the metal creaks as something takes 
     hold of it on the other side

     nell mouth open in cold horror sees the deadbolt  its open  
     shes in nomans land too far from the door to lock it too close 
     to run

     the doorknob turns but just as the door starts to open nell flails
     forward and shoots the deadbolt home

     the door jams against it  nell jumps back  theo grabs her back 
     into 

     int theos room  night continuous

      her bedroom and slams the door  a long deadly silent moment

                               nell contd
                   its in my room

     but their breath no longer fogs  theo seems to notice the fact just 
     as nell starts for her room and knock knock knock  behind them  
     at the door to the hall

                               luke oc
                   hey  i heard screaming

                               theo
                   luke

     she grabs for the door and lets luke in

     int nells room  night

     nells room stands silent dark  the door to the bathroom is shut  
     the lock slides open  the door swings in  luke stands there the 
     two women behind him

     luke turns on the lights  the room is perfectly ordinary no sign 
     that anything has been in here  the door to the hall is shut  nell 
     reacts

     int kitchen  night

     nell and theo wrapped in blankets sit over mugs of tea at the
     kitchen table  marrow across from them clicks off his digital
     recorder  luke paces behind the women

                               nell
                   you really didnt hear anything

     marrow takes his glasses off  luke looks at him then goes to the
     kitchen sink  he turns both faucets on full blast and leans up 
     against the sink arms folded  theo and nell turn to look at him  
     a beat  and then

     bump  bump bump  its the sound  luke goes over to the door 
     pushes it open

                               luke
                   oh look  there he goes ol hugh 
                   crain

     int ground floor hallway  night

     various shots as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway  a
     rushing sound with it  theyre the same sounds from the scene 
     before but somehow have none of the impact none of the presence as 
     they did in theos bedroom

     int kitchen  night

     luke lets the door shut turns off the faucet  the sounds of the
     plumbing die away

                               luke
                   do you need me anymore  cause im 
                   going to bed  they can stay up 
                   talking another 45 minutes if they 
                   want but i gotta try to get some 
                   sleep

                               marrow
                   go ahead

     luke leaves the kitchen  theo and nell watch him go

                               theo
                   if this was some sort of joke im 
                   going to kill him

                               nell
                   you know it wasnt a joke theo

     marrow watches the exchange closely

                               marrow
                   the cold sensation  who felt it 
                   first

                               nell
                   theo i think  youve asked us 
                   that three times doctor marrow  
                   whats going on

                   how do you feel about lukes 
                   suggestion that it was just the 
                   old plumbing  water hammer 
                   something like that

     theo and nell look at each other in frustration  but theo tries to 
     get her mind around the question

                               theo
                   i did just take a bath  i dont 
                   know

     int theos room  night

     the room is a lot less frightening now especially with the lights 
     on  nell sits on theos bed  theo looks at the walls silent 
     normal

                               theo
                   i did just take a bath

     when nell doesnt respond for a moment theo turns to her sees her
     wrestling with herself

                               nell
                   mother always banged on the wall 
                   when she needed me  the night she 
                   died i heard her but i 
                   pretended i didnt  i was just so 
                   sick of it all  and then the 
                   banging stopped  and in the 
                   morning she was dead  this is 
                   the first ive ever said this to 
                   anyone  that was the job i had 
                   theo its the only job ive ever 
                   known and i failed  im actually 
                   a bad person theo  the world 
                   doesnt need me

     theo shakes her head brushes at her eyes  the confession on the 
     top of the fright has moved her deeply

                               theo
                   oh nell  eleven years  with all 
                   due respect to your mother who im 
                   sure was a saint id have called 
                   doctor kevorkian if not for her 
                   for me

     its such a horrible thought it makes nell smile and they share a
     tearful laugh

     int nells bathroom  night

     nell stands in the door to her room

                               nell
                   good night theo

     nell shuts the door  theo is about to close her door but 
     hesitates  she puts on the light and goes to the tub  she turns it 
     on waits  just the sound of the water  and no bumping

     int nells room  night

     nell lies asleep under her sheet the blankets off the end of the 
     bed  hovering over her on the headboard the carved faces of 
     children peering down

     flap  flap flap  the fanlight at the top of the window right next 
     to the bed is open a crack  the sheer curtains flap listlessly in a
     gentle breeze  the flapping grows louder and with a sudden gust 
     the curtain billows out  in its flowing form we sense the shape of 
     a girls face fleeting so insubstantial we know we just saw her 
     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us

     the curtain blows straight out touching the bedposts at the foot of
     the bed and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them  
     the wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows

     nell sleeps oblivious the wind filling the room stirring the
     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra  the shape of the little
     girls face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows
     toward nell

     nell turns restless the air catches the edge of the pillowcase 
     and travels towards nells face  and for a split second there is a
     lifelike impression of a small girls face  nell almost awakens  
     the crystal beads stir and in their tinkling in the sigh of wind 
     we hear

                               girl voicefind us find us eleanornells eyes open  and like that the pillowcase deflates the air
     rushes up the curtain to the window and is gone

     nell sits up looks about her  everything seems normal  just her
     sheets just the curtains but on the headboard remain the carved
     faces  benevolent  nell settles back down on her pillow with a 
     sense of peace

     int dining room  day

     morning sun filters in through heavy drapes falling on marrow at 
     the dining table  nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind 
     him to get at the coffee  nell wears make up badly applied and 
     her hair is up in a french twist

                               nell
                   sorry

                               marrow
                   for an american you do a good 
                   imitation of the british at their 
                   most apologetic
                          veddy british
                   pardon me  excuse me sorry 
                   sorry

     nell smiles  theo walks in the door sees nell and marrow nell
     squeezed in behind him

                               nell
                   am i that bad

     theo is aware of marrows curiosity and fascination with nell  
     theres a jealousy brewing

                               theo
                   well this is a cozy breakfast

                               marrow
                   good morning theo  luke

     luke comes in behind theo tiredlooking also  he goes to the
     sideboard starts helping himself to breakfast

                               luke
                   after i went to bed the second 
                   time after the noise i had 
                   the best nights sleep of my life  
                   anybody

     marrow slept badly we can see it in his eyes

                               nell
                   yes  i feel realy rested too  
                   theo

                   i guess  oh your hair  it looks 
                   good

     but she means exactly the opposite  marrow looks over nells hair 
     but she cant stand it  luke comes over to the table drops into a 
     chair next to nell digs into breakfast  theos face turns into an
     artificial smile

                               theo contd
                   your makeup too

     nell sits there flustered  marrow senses the jealousy isnt quite
     sure what to make of it and intervenes

                               marrow
                   eat your breakfast theo then 
                   well get started on the tests

     int great hall  day

     close on the complex puzzle of a fieldcognition test  nell 
     scratches solutions erases and finally looks up in frustration  
     she sits alone tiny in the murk of the vast vaulted great hall  
     the enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the room

     clusters of furniture  overwrought chairs with animal heads 
     splayfooted coffee tables limbed lamps  huddle in strange 
     silent covens throughout  nell in a plush chair lays the work on 
     a table beside her  the clatter of stone on stone makes nell look 
     up

     the fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs large enough
     for a man to stand in  a piece of mortar must have come loose  
     nell stares at the chimney  and a voice lets out a loud groan

     nell jumps  she pops out of the chair  it came from another circle 
     of furniture in the shadows  a figure stands and comes over  its 
     luke stretching

                               luke contd
                   ive been thinking about these 
                   carvings  kids  lots of kids  
                   fat little angel kids  wild kids  
                   kids with furry animals

                               nell
                   the children  the children hugh 
                   crain built the house for  the 
                   children he never had

                               luke
                   come on  these are the typically 
                   sentimental gestures of a depraved 
                   industrialist

     he puts his hand on a chair the back of which is heavily carved in
     the motif he just described

     nell turns him an appalled look

                               luke contd
                   theo was working in the dining 
                   room  shes probably done by now  
                   you finish

                               nell
                   couldnt get the last ones  you

                               luke
                   i did okay

     nell looks at the test tries to digest this

                               luke contd
                   we could do this stuff anywhere  
                   i dont know what hes up to yet  
                   but like i said thats the fun  
                   it has something to do with this 
                   environment

     luke just smiles rises  well see

     he walks off his footsteps echoing in the vast room  the door 
     shuts after him

     nell sags in her chair  then something catches her eye  on a table
     opposite a set of keys  nell goes picks them up  car keys house
     keys  must be lukes  she pockets them thoughtful but just as 
     she does 

      something moves in the fireplace  so fleeting nell can barely 
     see it and we only catch a frame of it  but the iron mesh curtain 
     hanging in front of the hearth is still swaying

     nell stands there frozen  the massive fireplace looms before her 
     like a monstrous mouth black as pitch beyond the black metal 
     curtains

     the swaying metal scrapes over brick floor  its eerie repetitive
     screep cutting to the nerve

     nell sits paralyzed rooted to the chair  screep  screep  screep

     a single strand of nells hair stirs toward the fireplace and 

      something inside the fireplace moves behind the mesh

     nell crashes back over her chair knocking over a lamp and table
     tripping stumbling out of the furniture

     holy shit  whatever moved in there was real  big dark like
     somethings head  it goes out of focus and we cant see it as we
     follow 

      nell flying away across the room in headlong terror

     int foyer  day

     nell slams out of the room skidding as the door slams behind her  
     she sways up off the floor to run 

      right into marrow and theos legs  nell aborts a scream 
     realizing who it is  theo stands there in surprise holding papers 
     in her hand

                               nell
                   theres someone in there  theres 
                   someone in there in the fireplace

     int great hall  day

     nell and theo stand behind marrow and luke across from the 
     fireplace  theo glances at nell  nell is shaken

     marrow nods to luke and they start forward together marrow among 
     the furniture to the left luke down the right side

     the iron screens hang silent in the fireplace black impenetrable
     marrow and luke come up on either side luke ducking this way and 
     that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh

     they stop before it neither breathing both listening  marrow 
     steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in  
     darkness

     nell and theo watch apprehensive

                               nell
                   jim

     marrow sticks his head into the fireplace  for a long moment 
     nothing happens

     in the fireplace pitch darkness  marrow feels up the chimney

     and then something swings down right in front of his face  marrow
     doesnt flinch

     he flings back the screen revealing the only things in the 
     fireplace two massive andirons and the stillswinging flue  its 
     castiron forged in the shape of a lions head

     luke throws back the other screen  theo comes over  nell follows
     theres nothing else in the fireplace

     luke and theo stare at nell  marrow squats to study the hearth  
     the large iron ashdrop is coated in soot

     not a mark on it  he opens it  inside a glimpse of ashes and 
     charred wood  marrow stands looks at nell

                               nell contd
                   somebody was in here  i saw him

     marrow looks at her not sure what to believe  nell turns to luke 
     and theo for help  not from that corner  then nell remembers 
     reaches into her pocket and produces the keys  she holds them up to 
     luke

                               nell contd
                   are these yours  i found them 
                   right over there

                               luke
                   who drives a toyota

     theo shakes her head  they arent marrows  marrow takes the keys 
     from nell turns them over

                               theo
                   maybe theyre marys

                               marrow
                   mary came with me

                               nell
                   when i first got here i saw a gray 
                   car pull up  i thought it was one 
                   of us

     ext hill house  day

     they stand on the front steps  nells car is right there under the 
     car port

                               nell
                   this is my car

     theo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive  two other cars
     are with it  they walk out into the driveway

                               marrow
                   and those are lukes and mine

                               luke
                   theres a carriage house around 
                   back

     ext carriage house  day

     together they approach a stablecarriage house off to one side of 
     the main house  it looks old unused  they enter through a small 
     door

     int carriage house  day

     light filters in through gaps in the wood  luke opens one of the 
     main doors with a loud squeak the sun revealing a tarpcovered 
     shape a carriage  unused in a hundred years  a row of tarp
     covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance

                               luke
                   well this lot is full

                               theo
                   he must have left  didnt like 
                   the looks of the place or 
                   something

                               nell
                   how could he have left without his 
                   keys

                               theo
                   two sets  i dont know  maybe 
                   theyre not even his

                               luke
                   then hes got to be in the 
                   house

     as they leave the camera lingers on a covered shape in one of the
     stalls smaller than the other carriages it could be a car  a 
     broken wagon wheel leaning against it

     int statuary hall and short montage through house  day

     marrow theo and luke move down the hall opening doors left and 
     right as nell stands at the center of it all

                   watts

     no answer  the statuary peers down on nell  dead faces on busts  
     blind marble eyes

     int various rooms and halls  day

     luke calls out

     marrow comes through the kitchen  mrs dudley chopping carrots
     stands by the counter  only the slightest pause in the rhythm of 
     her chopping says shes noticed him

                               marrow
                   do you know who these keys belong

     frustrated he continues on

     int hallway outside locked room  day

     nell and theo walk down the long hallway behind opening doors
     checking rooms

                               nell
                   david

                               theo
                   maybe he never came in  if hed 
                   come in he would have left his 
                   bags at the door right  or maybe 
                   he got here early and went for a 
                   walk and fell  maybe hes 
                   outside

     nell closes a door on the right and then stops dead  staring

     the shut dark door the one that scared nell and theo earlier
     awaits them at the end  ominous

     nell approaches  closer and closer  the door nears

     nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and trys to open the 
     door  its locked  her breath fogs the air  she doesnt notice 
     it  but then she suddenly gags  with a look of horror she recoils 
     from the door choking covering her face

     then theo smells it  the women are both sick from the smell

                               theo contd
                   oh my god what is it  oh the 
                   smell ohhh

     marrow comes into the hallway  he sees them from a distance

     on the two women

                               theo
                          looks to nell for 
                           an answer
                   is it over

                   no its getting worse

                               marrow
                   nell  whats wrong

                               nell
                   that smell oh god

     theo blanches looks at nell  she smells it too and in mirror 
     image fashion backs away from the doors also  marrow notices the 
     exchange and watches them intense  and then in a heartbeat the 
     moment is over

     ext veranda  day

     the red light on marrows digital voice recorder blinks  the device 
     is in marrows jacket pocket concealed from nell  theyre sitting 
     in adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the house  marrow 
     beside her observes

                               marrow
                   what did it smell like

                               nell
                   it was very specific

                               marrow
                          so tell me
                   all right

                               nell
                   in the bathroom in my mothers 
                   room the toilet was next to an 
                   old wooden table  it smelled like 
                   that wood

                               marrow
                   so smell is smell is the 
                   sense that triggers the most 
                   powerful memories  and a memory 
                   can trigger a smell

                               nell
                   i wasnt thinking about my 
                   mothers bathroom

                               marrow
                   what happened after you smelled 
                   it

                               nell
                   i looked at theo  she had a look 
                   on her face

                               marrow
                   like she smelled it too

                               nell
                   yes

                               marrow
                   and then what happened

                               nell
                   i got more scared

     marrow thinks about this

                               marrow
                   hmm

                               nell
                   im sorry  im messing up the 
                   study

                               marrow
                   no youre not  something moved 
                   you  you saw something

     nell looks to him  hes sincere  he believes her

                               nell
                   i dont know  maybe i

     didnt she almost says  she struggles embarrassed

                               nell contd
                   i havent been with people in a 
                   long time

     marrow settles in his chair looks out at the forest

                               marrow
                   i really havent either

     nell peers at him doubtful  is she being made fun of

                               marrow contd
                   i mean im surrounded by people 
                   day in dayout  students 
                   colleagues
                          beat
                   but most of the time even when 
                   im with them you know its 
                   all about power theres not much 
                   room for actually getting to know 
                   someone or having someone getting 
                   to know you

     nells face flushes with compassion  with longing  marrow looks at
     her  hes vulnerable  needing  she doesnt dare hope  the moment 
     lasts a few heartbeats

     he looks away  a flicker of distress crosses nells face  and then 
     she realizes marrow is looking at 

      luke

                               luke contd
                   you have to see something

     int grand stairway  day

     luke nell and marrow mount the stairs climb up and up  they find
     theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting  she 
     turns and looks at nell strangely

     nell confused turns around  on the wall and the painting are dark
     stains  black  blue  runny  almost like something leaking from 
     the roof has run down

     nell steps back  the stains are the letters n and o  pulling back
     farther the rest of the word eleanor

                               nell
                   my name

     she follows the streaking substance up blinking in rising fear as
     more running letters appear  the word welcome  and higher up the
     last home

                               nell contd
                   no

     but the substance doesnt come from the ceiling

     it is as if the oils on the painting of hugh crain have been boiled 
     by a heat gun and blasted off running down from there  hughs face 
     is gone  in place of the face the underlying ivory of the canvas 
     glares out like a skull

     nell screams and runs away the others calling out after her in 
     alarm  as they vanish around the corner the camera tilts down and 
     we discover smeared paint on the floor  smeared it seems with 
     little footprints in it

     int red parlor  day

     nell panic rising in her voice confronts the others

                               nell
                   welcome home eleanor  welcome 
                   home  ive never been here  who 
                   did this

                               luke
                   its somebodys idea of a joke

     she looks at all three of them

                               nell
                   who did this  why are you doing 
                   this  i dont know any of you  
                   you dont know me  why are you 
                   doing this to me

     luke shakes his head  theo starts getting pissed  marrow stands 
     there arms folded observing

                               luke
                   i didnt do it

                               theo

                   up idea of art putting someone 
                   elses name to a painting

                   no

                               nell
                   theo did you

                               theo
                   maybe you did it yourself

                               nell
                   why

                               theo

                   for a long time maybe you want 
                   attention
                          pointing to 
                           marrow
                   maybe he did it

                               marrow
                   i didnt  you know that nell

     this is horrifying to nell being doubted and accused of something 
     so ugly if it were true

                               nell
                   i dont know anything  whoever 
                   did this please just just say 
                   so just please this is 
                   cruel  dont be cruel to me  i 
                   cant stand it  you dont know 
                   me

     and she runs out

     nell grabs for the door to leave

     she flings open the door  monstrous arms seem to grab at her  but 
     its only a wildlooking coat rack in the hall

     ext 2nd floor balcony  day

     nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the houses second
     floor  the air stirs her hair  she peers up at the houses 
     roofline its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like 
     so many screaming heads

     chilled she pulls her sweater closer  marrow comes out onto the
     balcony from twin french doors behind her

                               nell
                   are you coming to confess

                               marrow
                   i wish i were  i wish i had done 
                   it then i could confess and youd 
                   be at peace  that great moral 
                   philosopher frank sinatra once 
                   said to someone he loved i wish 
                   you had an enemy so i could beat 
                   him up

     she smiles

                               nell
                   lets say it wasnt you  who did 
                   it

                               marrow
                   i dont know

                               nell
                   it was a stupid thing to do

                               marrow
                   it was

                               nell
                          for the absurdity 
                           of the idea
                   welcome home

                               marrow
                   youll never see it again  mr 
                   dudleys taking care of it

                          still too shaky 
                           for enthusiasm
                   sure

     int greenhouse  day

     marrow lets nell into a long victorianera greenhouse  its
     overgrown lush the leadedglass panes above stained with years of
     condensation and pollen  vines and trees climb up the sides  beds 
     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick

     nell leans down to look into a water garden with a statue of a man
     bursting from the surface grasping for the air as if he had been
     drowning  a sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse  and a
     cavalcade of water comes out of the statues mouth surprising nell
     she lets out a little yelp and then laughs with marrow

     nell loves the greenhouse  it takes her breath away

                               nell
                   oh its so beautiful

     nell makes her way among the plants  she looks up at a towering
     doublehelix staircase which rises from the floor to a platform 
     which gives access to the roof  below the staircase are planters 
     filled with violets

                               nell contd
                   violets  somebody mustve died 
                   here

     and then out of the corners comes mister dudley

                               mr dudley
                   thats where she hanged herself

                               mr dudley
                   she stepped off the platform
                          he looks up with 
                           a suggestive leer
                   they had long skirts in those 
                   days

                               marrow

     nell looks up and smiles

                               marrow contd
                   youre smiling

     marrow watches her as she moves about takes a heavy ripe bloom in
     hand lifts it to her face  while she talks she walks and marrow
     follows

                               nell
                   i was just thinking how happy i am 
                   right now  all my life ive been 
                   waiting for an adventure  and i 
                   thought oh ill never have that 
                   adventures are for people who 
                   travel long distances thats for 
                   soldiers thats for the women 
                   that the bullfighters fall in love 
                   with  and here i am and 
                   something is happening to me  
                   strange noises in the night  
                   paintings are calling to me  and 
                   all it cost to get there was five 
                   gallons of gas  im getting my 
                   adventure

     for the first time since weve seen nell there is something to her
     which is simply erotic  marrow follows her down one of the
     footpaths  she smiles back at marrow as he trails her  she reaches 
     a transept in the greenhouse and as she turns down it theres the
     slightest sway to her gait  marrow follows her around the corner 
     into the transept  at the far end the wall is completely overgrown

     nell looks up through the ceiling at hill house looming grim 
     outside distorted in the old glass

                               marrow
                   someone is playing with you

                               nell
                   why

                               marrow
                   i dont know

                               nell
                   it doesnt matter  even if 
                   theyre tormenting me someone 
                   wants me  what i do with this is 
                   up to me  i can be a victim or i 
                   can be a volunteer  and i want to 
                   be the volunteer

     nell glances at him and for that split second she is raw 
     passionate woman  she walks away the sway in her gait aching 
     powerful  marrow is surprised by what nell just said and stares at 
     her as she comes to the overgrown end  nell reaches out to the 
     hanging vines pulls them aside

     and a face stares out  gastly  white  nell takes an 
     involuntary step back a little gasp

     the face is marble  blind eyes stare from stained cheeks  it is a
     statue of crain  marrow comes over

     its an enormous stone tableaux of hugh surrounded by cherubim  the
     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence
     from the greenhouse

                   hugh crain  cant seem to get 
                   away from him

     she laughs a little at herself  marrow joins in  he helps her pull 
     the plants back to reveal more of it

     she reaches out touches the marble cheek  then daring grins and
     begins to hum her tune

     marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slowdance with hugh
     crain pirouetting her hips sliding past hypnotizing marrow

                               marrow
                   what is that tune

                               nell
                   i dont know  a lullaby i guess  
                   my mother used to hum it to me  
                   and her mother before that and so 
                   on
                          to the statue
                   hugh crain would you care to 
                   dance

     she hums another two notes and bang  the door behind her slams 
     open in a gust of wind jolting nell  she stops and stares  
     outside the window through the glass she sees mr dudley staring 
     at her hes been watching her dance  the spell is broken  nell 
     embarrassed cant bear to look at him

     a beat and then marrow goes over and shuts the door  when he turns
     back 

      nell is just vanishing around the corner her rapid footsteps
     echoing in the vaulted room

     ext rear lawn  day

     nell hurries away from the house across the rear lawn ashamed at
     herself as much as she is spooked

     in the distance mr dudley is walking toward the house with cans of
     paint cleaner an a ladder  nell stops watching him  he senses 
     her pauses and smiles

     nell reacts  sees the ladder  then mr dudley disappears into the
     house

     nell once again starts to hurry away but looking back over her
     shoulder almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of 

     ext family cemetery  day continuous

      the tiny crain family cemetery  nell catches herself  a small
     swinging gate bars the way  she hesitates

     nine mosscovered headstones show the wear of a long century  eight
     small headstones one large one  a half dozen unmarked stones in 
     the grass stillbirths

     nell is drawn into the graveyard  the large stone is rene crains  
     the smaller ones are her childrens

     nells heart is breaking as she moves among them the various names

     covered by growth  she clears it away  april 6th 1874

     there are three more grave stones and after clearing away the 
     brush they too show that the babies died after a few hours or a 
     day  theres the same symbol on the graves of the children a 
     cherub of death  weve seen this image before  nell backs out of 
     the cemetery afraid

     int mezzanine  day

     nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the 
     red parlor

     int red parlor  day

     she stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of
     books  nell is unsure of what shes looking for  she looks at 
     crains painting and recognizes the same cherubs inside the ornate 
     frame  the background in the painting is the red parlor  then 
     recognizes in the painting an open bookcase behind crain  
     intuitively she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and 
     is able to push it open  inside a small stairwell

     int crains secret study  day

     down the circular stairs nell enters a very small dusty room  
     velvet curtains drawn shut only a sliver of sunlight showing 
     through  as her eyes adjust she makes out the furnishings of a 
     latenineteenth century office crains secret office

     the bookcases filled with business ledgers  the business ledgers 
     are stamped with the cherub of death

     at the end is an enormous desk  behind it a massive carved chair
     covered with a sheet only its lionhead arm rests protruding from
     underneath  nell realizes its

                   crains study

     she moves for the desk  an enormous mirror its silver inner 
     surface flaking with age tarnished reflects the room the desk 
     and for a split second a shadow in the chair  nell steps in front 
     of it blocking our view

     and when she steps past there is only the dim flaking image of the
     chair the natural shadow of the room

     nell goes around the desk stands over it  the chair sits silent
     behind her shrouded

     on the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names  lowell
     haverhill manchester  and years 1884 85 and so on  she flips 
     one open

     the ledger is a payroll account  names upon names of workers 
     rendered in sepia by crains severe cursive  notations in the 
     column beside it indicate man woman or child and the appropriate 
     wage for each class of worker  many of them at least a third are 
     children

     nell reacts  disturbed by it  she shifts closer to that damn chair
     behind her  the sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone 
     could be sitting there under it

     she turns the page  columns indicate pay and so on  but one 
     column at the very center of the book hidden in the binding is 
     unlabeled down the column some names have a line drawn through 
     them and at the end of the line a cross

     nell follows them back eyes searching across the ledger

     she turns the page pushes the book down revealing that concealed
     column more crosses  and more  her eyes flick back and forth  
     the crosses are paired with entries for child  she looks their 
     names

     nell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair 
     for bed  her motions are languid in the light of the single small 
     lamp offbalance with the wine

     her hair brushes out in long even strokes  the brush moves through
     it lifting it and letting it fall

     in the mirror the brush draws through nells hair but as it does 
     the hair divides in its wake like fingers running through it

     nell freezes  shes not sure what she just saw  she runs the brush
     through again and again it is as if something pulls it back from 
     her head

     again  fast  she runs the brush through her hair and this time
     the hair spins up in a knot

     nell flinches dropping the brush knocking the shade of the lamp on
     the vanity awobbling

     shes out of the chair in a flash grabbing her own hair staring at
     the space behind her  nothing there  a beat

     she steadies herself feeling the alcohol  gets control

     the tiffany lamp rocks back and forth crystal beads shimmering  
     the light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall  and 
     something there catches her eye

     nell feels her way across the room not sure of what shes seeing
     over the sound of the wind outside theres something at the very
     highest edge of hearing

     she stops five feet from the mantle  the swaying light catches the
     rich tones of wood  then darkens  illuminates it again  darkens  
     the carvings of the playing children in the wood seem to move

     nell stares in drunken fascination  and as the first fear begins to
     rise in her throat the wind dies down and in its place there is the
     faintest trace of childrens laughter  nells reaction changes 
     to awe

     tentative her hand goes out shaking and touches the mantle

     it is hard and still  no movement whatsoever  silence  but the 
     faces engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her hands
     outstretched for her hopeful

     ext hill house gates  night

     the enormous locked gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky  
     the chain is dangling in the wind

     ext hill house  night

     curtain  it goes out  the window stares from an arrangement of 
     other windows stonework and doors like an eye with a cataract in 
     a face howling in horror

     asleep but restless  her feet hang off the end of the bed

     in the bg the door to the bathroom is shut barely visible in the
     faint light from the window  hold on it

     silently it begins to open  the gap widens yawning pitch dark
     beyond  a long beat  and then a thump  a sliding sound  
     something drags itself across the floor

     bump  slide  our line of sight is blocked by the bed  but the 
     sound is getting louder coming closer

     bump  slide  nell grinds her teeth in her sleep pulls the 
     blankets about her tighter  bump  the sound stops  and her breath 
     begins to fog

     whatever has just come in the room is right there hovering just oc
     we can feel it

     without warning nell bolts upright gasping into consciousness
     reveal nothing  just the dark room  and the bathroom door open

     nell stares at thedoor knows she shut it  now its open  she 
     breaths fast feeling the cold knowing somethings in here with 
     her

     she stops breathing strains her ears  silence  a long moment  
     then she notices her feet hanging out from under the covers

     the wall with the fireplace

     they stare out at us eyes trying to adjust afraid  behind them 
     looms the fireplace and in front of it a metal cagelike fire 
     screen  a beat

     bam  something lunges out of the fireplace but is caught in the
     screen hitting nell and theo in the back

     theos lighter goes flying in that very instant and we never see

     nell manages to whirl embrace the cage and slam it with whatevers 
     inside back into the fireplace  the screen jolts hard enough to 
     lift nell

                   help

     theo still screaming lying on her back before the fireplace rams 
     her feet against it  the screen hammers at nell and theo  they 
     cant run or itll get out

     theos screaming is suddenly drowned out by a horrifying inhuman
     sound from inside the fireplace

     theos scream goes dead in breathstealing horror  nell recovers

                               nell contd
                   no  go away

     the screen punches out at them denting  and then all the air in 
     the room seems to be sucked into the fireplace in one thump  the 
     door to the bathroom slams

     its gone  they sit there in the darkness panting

     int greenhouse  next day

     nell stares at the tableaux of hugh crain  in the morning light it
     seems inert cold just a statue  luke and theo enter  nell 
     doesnt seem to notice them until theyre beside her

                               theo
                   marrow said the same thing as last 
                   night hesays
                          meaning this is
                           on his now
                           doubtful word
                    that he checked with mrs 
                   dudley  and he says that she told 
                   him that all the fireplaces in the 
                   west wing connect to the main 
                   chimney  he says that he thinks 
                   that the flue was open and with 
                   the windstorm he says that what 
                   probably happened was some kind of 
                   freak air current 

                               nell
                    what do you think

     theo considers then looks at her severe

                               luke
                          lowers his voice
                   dont tell the professor hed 
                   probably throw me out  but test 
                   taking is one of the ways ive 
                   been supporting myself  i 
                   volunteer for every paid study 
                   that they offer  of course 
                   straight psych stuff doesnt pay 
                   as much as the pharmaceuticals do 
                   or a good wound study  check it 
                   out

     he rolls up his sleeve revealing large livid scars at intervals too
     regular to be anything natural

                               luke contd
                   a thousand dollars each  am i 
                   sick  yes  do you know why i 
                   only date freshmen  by the time 
                   theyre sophomores theyve 
                   figured me out

                   mister very talky would you 
                   please say what it is about this 
                   study that bothers you

                               luke
                   the whole thing feels like 
                   experimental misdirection  like 
                   he says its about one thing a 
                   psychological profile of 
                   environmental effects on 
                   insomnia and thatd be a 
                   legitimate study but i think that 
                   weve been subjected to an 
                   academic bait and switch hes 
                   really looking at something else

                               nell
                   no  no jims not doing  
                   these things

     but theres a desperate rising edge to nells voice  theos in
     response is quiet sober certain

                               theo
                   then who is  come on nell  deep 
                   down if you really thought it 
                   wasnt jim why wouldnt you be 
                   leaving right this second  why 
                   wouldnt you be afraid  really 
                   afraid

                               nell
                   because i dont want to ruin 
                   things  because home is where the 
                   heart is

     theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to 
     someone out of her mind

     nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
     greenhouse the one where crains wife killed herself

     and for a moment we see crains wife hanging there and then the 
     image is gone

     int dining room  day

     lunch remains are on the table as nell enters test papers in hand

                               nell
                   jim  im done

     but marrow isnt there  shes about to go back out to look for him
     but sees something and stops

     forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room  barely 
     visible  marrows briefcase  nell goes to the briefcase knowing 
     she shouldnt look and unable to help herself  marrows digital 
     recorder glints out at her

     nell takes it out and presses play  she looks up at the door  any
     minute he could come back in here and then marrows voice rings 
     out

                   concluded at three am  nell 
                   continues her alienation of the 
                   other subjects and the 
                   experimenter  it remains unclear 
                   whether she truly believes she did 
                   not deface the painting  
                   interview with the subject in 
                   greenhouse yesterday to ascertain 
                   the extent of her selfdelusion 
                   was inconclusive due to her 
                   efforts to sexualize encounter 
                   with experimenter

     marrows voice continues on in his assessment but nell isnt 
     hearing anything anymore

     she dies inside  her world upside down  she falls into a chair 
     and all we can hear of marrow is the cold analytical tone his 
     garbled jargon

                               marrow oc
                   one minute

     its marrow for real about to enter  nell clicks off the 
     recorder drops it into the briefcase  marrow is startled not 
     expecting nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase

                               marrow contd
                   nell

     she can only stare at him eyes dead  marrow looks from her to the
     briefcase and back

                               marrow contd
                   were you looking for me

     nell cant answer  marrow comes over unsettled

                               marrow contd
                   how are the tests going

     nell rises staring emotionless  betrayal just beginning to find a
     hold  she hands him her papers  marrow looks at nell knows shes 
     been in his briefcase  he picks it up and with a final sorry 
     glance exits

     int ground floor hallway  day

     nell emerges from the study stands there a beat lost  then she
     turns resolute and starts moving  faster

     int great hall  day

     nell blinded by tears runs across the room toward the grand entry
     and the exit and stops

     down the connecting hall out in the grand entry at the front 
     doors are mr and mrs dudley  leaving for the day  they stop  
     look at her

     nell numb gazes from the open door to mrs dudley  mr dudley 
     holds the door open as if in invitation  nell could walk out right 
     now  this is her chance  but

     mrs dudley smiles a knowing smile  an all too knowing smile  and
     seeing nells decision gently shuts the door  the lock clicks  
     final  fatesealing

     nell turns back to the house lost

     int red parlor  day

     nell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters crains 
     secret study

     int crains secret study  day

     nell sits in silence trying to find a feeling any feeling  a long
     beat  and without warning she leaps to her feet in shocking rage

                               nell
                   how can he think im doing this

     she has a floor lamp in her hands and hurls it like a throwing 
     hammer at the nearest shelves  vases knickknacks and a leather 
     album crash to the floor

     she stalks around the room and then slows staring at what shes
     done the rage draining out of her  but if she could do something 
     like that

                               nell contd
                   no  no i couldnt do those 
                   things im not making it up

     she turns in place desperate and sees the old leather album
     precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves  its open  one 
     of the leaves flips over on its own gravity and the weight of its 
     own pages turning it

     nell approaches stepping over broken ceramic  slip  another page
     turns

     nell hovers over it holding her breath so as not to make the book
     flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant

     slip  another page turns  the book is a photo album of the late
     nineteenth century bound with ribbons the aged daguerreotypes in
     pressed vellum frames

     nell peers closer  its open to a faded gray image taken long 
     before it became the convention to smile for a photograph a woman 
     rene crain sitting in a chair

     and standing behind the chair a fearsome presence in a black coat
     his face hollow malevolent  hugh crain

     nell shivers and slip the page turns on its own

     an image of hugh and rene a look of deathly loss on their faces  
     the page flips

     crain hovers dark rage just under the surface but on renes face 
     is the faintest most inappropriate smile  it sends a chill through 
     nell

     the album begins to slide down the shelf and as it does pages 
     flip renes smile grows wider her hair dishevelled her eyes lit 
     with grinning insanity

     nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf

     it is open in her hands to a picture of crain alone in front of 
     the enormous fireplace in the great hall  rene is gone  the photo 
     is monstrous  nell fearful turns the page 

      and reacts to the last thing she expected  a picture of a lovely
     woman filled with grace and power  carolyn crain  posed  on a 
     settee before the fireplace  beautiful beyond words  smiling  
     ahead of her time

                               nell contd
                   his second wife  there was a 
                   second wife  carolyn

     it warms nell

     she turns the page  now crain is there beside carolyn  but there 
     is something different about him  less frightening

     nell flips the page again and now there is an image of crain and
     carolyn  her hair is up in a french twist  nell smiles more

     nell turns the page yet againbut something is wrong  it is another image of carolyn and the
     kinder gentler crain but now it is carolyn who is unsmiling

     another page  another  carolyns face darkening  and in this 
     picture carolyns stomach is slightly distended

                               nell contd
                   she was pregnant

     nell turns pages faster and faster and as she does carolyn swells
     pregnant before our eyes in ragged animation mouth working as if to
     speak voiceless as it is eleanor

     nell fumbles the book onto the floor  it stares up at her open to 
     the last page

     it is an image of carolyn  betrayal  hell  knowledge  her hand 
     seems to be pointing at the gaping maw of the grand fireplace

     nell bolts from the room

     int great hall  day

     nell bursts into the great hall and stops  at the far end of the 
     room broods the vast fireplace its chain curtains hanging like the 
     veil to some hellish sanctuary

     nell stares at it daunted  what is it that carolyn is trying to 
     show her  the fireplace beckons and nell approaches against her 
     will

     she finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace and takes it down
     she uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open  she steps into
     its sootblack mouth

     nell peers up the chimney  a faint sigh of air  she sticks the 
     poker up the flue scratches around  nothing

     she turns her attention to the back of the fireplace thwocks it
     sooty stone chips away but its solid

     the mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye  nell grabs the 
     heavy iron lever  she pulls but can barely budge it  it finally 
     screeches back and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace 
     swings down

     nell looks in  two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash a
     charred timber or two sticking out  sick with fear nell prods the
     ash  just charred wood

     she thrusts the poker down deep  it vanishes in the ash up to her
     hand  clack  she rakes through the ash  clack  and then she 
     feels the poker take purchase  she draws it out and full of dread 
     turns it to the light

     impaled on its hooks are two human skulls

     nell fights back the scream in her throat  one of the skulls is a
     childs skull the other an immense skull with brooding brow 
     forehead crushed

     nell lets the poker drop  it bangs off the door falls in the ash
     drop its handle hitting a spring  nell recoils as the trapdoors 
     snap shut like a pair of jaws

     int ground hallway floor  dusk

     nell stumbles down the hall weeping in fear

                               nell
                   theo  jim  help

     but instead she hears children voices calling out for her

     int confusing series of rooms the maze  night

     nell winds through the pitchdark halls rooms gaping black left and
     right searching for the voices which seems to come from just around
     the next bend leading her around corner after corner

     the hallways peel past nell as she runs slamming through doors 
     ever darker  the houses hellish carvings glare as she passes 
     grinning taunting  she rages on oblivious until she rounds a 
     final corner 

     int hallway outside locked room  night

      into the long dark hall leading to the locked room  the 
     statuary peer down on her  dead faces  blind marble eyes  as she 
     turns the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her

     for a frame or two the eyes are real just a subliminal glimmer  
     for the instant we try to catch the movement the illusion it isnt
     there  it makes nell stop  she regards the terrible doors  she
     considers the labyrinth around her  and begins to understand

                               nell
                   the house its a maze thats 
                   how you designed it didnt you 
                   mister crain  so wherever one of 
                   your little guests went the house 
                   brought them here  its designed 
                   to make you come here  but why

     another cry comes from the far end

     nell eases down the hallway the fear welling back on her like a 
     tide  she hesitates but then the childcry forces her on  she 
     reaches the carved doors with the wooden guard statues

                               nell contd
                   oh no oh no no no 
                   not that oh no ohhhhhhhhh

     gaping cold and stench hit her  she gags

     now the cry comes from under the door  present  real  right 
     there  nell shudders

     the cry grows louder desperate  she shuts her ears to it  the cry
     rises to fearsome rage not sounding like a child anymore  not
     sounding like anything human at all its painful  nell looks at 
     the locked room in horror and takes off running

     int picture gallery  dusk

     nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops  standing there are
     marrow theo and luke stricken silent by her entry  looks of shock 
     on their faces  nell just stands there  a beat  and then it pours 
     out of her hysterical

                   ive given you a powerful 
                   suggestion that youre in a 
                   haunted house  i picked hill 
                   house because it fits the 
                   expectations  it was my it was 
                   my theater my stage

     theo glances at luke hes been right all along  this was never 
     about perception

                               luke
                   modelling smallgroup dynamics in 
                   the formation of narrative 
                   hallucinations  you brought us 
                   here to scare us  insomnia that 
                   was just a decoy issue  youre 
                   disgusting

                   fear affects individual 
                   performance  mass hysteria is 
                   like a story nell  a communal 
                   story  someone starts it  then 
                   we all add a little more to it  
                   and then for some reason  no one 
                   knows how  we start believing 
                   it  this story shapes what we see 
                   and hear  we interpret everything 
                   through it make it fit the story  
                   i started our story when i gave 
                   you the history of hill house  
                   youve added to it  thats what 
                   this experiment has all been

     blanket around her

                               marrow
                   why would we want to do that

     so delusional it makes marrow look so right

                   bones there youll say they got 
                   up and walked away

     nells hysterics have stopped  she stares up at him lost  
     searching inside herself  maybe she is crazy

                               marrow
                   there has to be monster in the 
                   labyrinth  we make them up  
                   thats how we deal with the things 
                   in everyday life that are too 
                   terrible to deal with  like 
                   losing someone  like being alone

     marrow reaches down to nell but she shrinks away  theo blocks 
     marrow out shielding nell  marrow pauses disgusted with himself

     flicker of the candles play in the crystal  eddies of heat mingle 
     up the frostcovered glass of the window behind the candelabra  
     small streaks of frost begin to melt we see eyes forming in the 
     melting frost a face begins to form

     int great hall  night

     marrow steps into the dark vast room his glasses glinting  the 
     faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the 
     darkness

     marrow approaches it  the mesh screen is still open  marrow stands
     there a moment  then looks in

     he squats and tries to open the ashdrop  it doesnt budge its
     jammed by the poker nell dropped in

     marrow considers then shakes his head feels stupid for even coming

     int hallway outside kitchen  night

     luke stops theo carrying a tray of food and tea outside the 
     kitchen door

     some sexual awareness

     int nells room  night

     nell lies in her bed asleep the room dark except for the last
     guttering end of one of the candles  it goes out

     a faint sound  long low like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen
     madmen  nell stirs  her eyes open  she hears the sound

     the wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom 
     from the window  the twisting figures in the plaster the low
     relief the shadows they make seem to come together as an eye  
     black  not human  the woodwork around it like some halfface

     the gibbering begins to rise

     out of the corner of her eye she can see a form beside her in the 
     bed

     nells mouth moves  she manages to form words but its just a
     whisper

                               nell
                   theo

     nell reaches out under the covers

     her hand is suddenly grasped

     the eye on the wall stares  the babbling liquid deep voice 
     mounts and as the shadows move ever so slowly the eye seems to 
     roam over the room

                               nell contd
                   oh god  its looking for me

     and then the babbling stops  nell grimaces in pain  she tries to 
     look at theo but its far too dark right there beside her

                               nell contd
                   theo my hand  youre hurting me

     in the place of the babbling another sound  highpitched drawn
     out  a childs cry  nell reacts

     the cry wails louder coming through the wall  its a wail of 
     agony  a wail not of this earth  nell struggles racked between 
     the pain in her hand and the tortured childs cry

                               nell contd
                   a child  no  no  im right 
                   here

     the eye focusses on her  dead on her  nell stops  and with sudden
     violence shes wrenched out of the bed by whatevers beside her  
     nell hits the floor with a scream  she grabs at the table on this 
     side of the bed pulling a lamp down on her yanking at its chain

     the room flashes into brilliance  nell stands up panting there 
     is nothing in the room  no theo  she looks at her hand

     the eye on the wall is gone

                               nell contd
                   oh god  who was holding my hand

     nell snaps around  there on the window spreading before her eyes 
     the frost on the glass is melting into a horrifying face  the face 
     of crain

     nell recoils in prickling fear  living fear  then her fear turns 
     to rage  in the blink of an eye theres a heavy ashtray in her 
     hand and its flying at the window

                               nell contd
                   i will not let you hurt a child

     the window bashes out into the night the face vanishing with a howl
     of air

     int nells bathroom  night

     neil explodes from her room a flying fury of hate  the childcry
     seems to race ahead of her into 

     int theos room  night continuous

      theos room which is empty  now it seems like its coming from 
     the door to the hall is right there  nell races after it and 

     int 2nd floor hallway north wing  night continuous

      barges out into the hallway  she breaks into a run  the cry 
     sounds from farther off  nell chases after it

     int nells room  night

     theo carrying a pot of tea and some cups enters quietly just in case
     nell is asleep  she stops in surprise  the window is smashed lamp 
     on the floor  nell is gone

                               theo
                   nell

                   luke jim

     int cross hall  night

     halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as nell tries to
     feel out where she is and realizes shes lost  just like theo and 
     she were before  but now its night  and shes alone  shes been 
     tricked

     panting she stops presses herself against the wall  her breath
     catches

     across from her is a mirror  herself reflected in its tarnished
     surface  but there is something wrong with it  nell steps across 
     to it

     her reflected self begins to smile  but shes not smiling  nell
     writhes in horror but cant pull away from the mirror  in it her
     grin widens insanethe bottom half of her face is someone elses

     bang  nell recoils  the sound breaks the spell knocking nell back
     from the mirror

     bang  bang  bang  nell turns and runs

     int hall of pillars  night

     the banging chases nell into the hall of pillars  nell turns to 
     face whatever it is thats coming after her  the banging 
     crescendoes and then recedes still audible but like the thing 
     following her has taken a wrong turn

     another mirror on the wall  nell glimpses herself in it  this timeher eyes are someone elses lit with insanity

     nell backs away through doors into 

     int hall of mirrors  night

      the hall of mirrors  bang bang bang bang

     the octagonal mirrorlined pillars cast and recast her reflection
     throughout the room  nell is everywhere in plain sight but hidden 
     by the very infinity of her images  the banging grows louder

                               nell
                   why do you wantme

     the banging ceases  and then we see the real nell standing there

                               nell contd
                   who am i

     she turns around  her reflections all turn with her  except one  
     for a long moment we see it but nell doesnt

     and then she does

     the reflected nell stands there hands hanging silent

     nell exhales in shuddering fear  the reflected nell mouths 
     compelling the real nell to whisper with it

                               nell contd
                   welcome home eleanor

     with that the reflected nell grins and her stomach swells before our
     eyes pregnant just like carolyn crain

                               nell contd
                   no

     nell runs

     int hall outside greenhouse  night

     nell races down the long hall bare feet flying covering her face
     from mirrors left and right  she stumbles into 

     int greenhouse  night continuous

      the greenhouse where she slips on the marble  she kicks the door
     shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase her horror
     driving her up and up setting the rickety thing swinging  we hear
     what nell hears the voices of children

                               voices of children
                   help us help us

                               nell
                   im here im here im coming 
                   to you im coming to you

     nell climbs higher and higher into the dark reaches above

     as she climbs through the greenhouse windows we see the night sky
     the clouds driven by the wind the moon old vines wrapped aroud the
     skin of the greenhouse and the shapes and shadows of the vines 
     seem to shift as if it was alive

     nell reaches the landing  the stair case rolls back and forth 
     beneath her  a beat  and then bam  the door slams open below

                               marrow oc
                   nell  nell are you in here

     nell can only manage sobbing relief

                               luke oc
                   look the stairs

     nell drags herself to the hand rail  marrow luke and theo rush 
     into view below

     they all react to the sight of nell at the precarious top  with 
     her insanely happy smile  they think shes there to kill herself  
     just like rene crain

     they all freak out in a chorus of nell  no nell

                               marrow
                   nell  dont move

     nell couldnt anyway  she just grins madly tears running down her
     face  marrow grabs for the stairs but they shift under nells
     movement from up above

                               luke
                   its not going to hold your 
                   weight

                               marrow
                   just stay there nell

     marrow mounts the stairs  the metal support rods sing out under his
     weight  and the whole thing pitches rolling around as he goes up
     five feet  ten feet  fifteen feet up  the sway gets wilder as he 
     goes

     at twenty feet with twenty more to go to reach nell he stops  the
     stairs buck sway out dizzily  and then to his dismay he realizes
     hes on the wrong side of the double helix staircase

                               marrow contd
                   damn it

     he straddles the rail to climb over to the other half

                               luke
                   dont

     the sudden shift is too much for the old stairs  the support rods
     crease and then the whole enormous column of steel from where marrow
     is standing to the ground bursts from its supports

     luke shoves theo aside and the bottom half of the stairs spirals 
     out in a massive deafening collapse  marrows cellular phone falls 
     out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor

     the top half of the stairs remains still hanging from the ceiling
     nell grips the railing at the top

     marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below
     he flails out for the other stairway swings himself over to it  it
     takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died  a moment of
     paralysis  this is no longer an experiment  no longer fun and 
     games

                               marrow
                   nell  are you up there

     there she is  marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky
     stairs  luke and theo watch from below tense

     then hes there  nell stands a mere arms length from him on the 
     other side of the railing

                               marrow contd
                   come on nell  you have to climb 
                   over and step back on the stairs

     nell barely seems to hear him  instead she looks at the deforming
     support rods around her  we hear the voices of the children 
     calling to her

                               marrow contd
                   nell  now

     theo on the ground calls up to nell

                               theo
                   nell go with him  just go with 
                   him

     nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing  
     she hangs there  she looks down at the tangled steel below

                               nell
                   the children want me  theyre 
                   calling me  they need me

                               marrow
                   nell  you will come here now

     nell looks up at him hazy

     and then behind marrow the shifting clouds the moon the vines 
     and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark 
     hideous face and in front of it a hand and the hand is rushing 
     forward to push marrow off the steps

     after we scream nell screams

                               nell
                   no

     and as marrow falls forward pushed by the force behind him nell
     grabs him he is caught on the rail as she has reached out to 
     him now she has fallen into thin air and she falls towards marrow 
     and they hold each other  she has a hand then a foot she 
     slips she holds on again and reaches the staircase  she grabs 
     on

     a moments peace and then a new disaster with a metallic pop pop
     pop the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the
     stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic
     shattering of sound

     marrow looks behind him to whatever it was that nell saw over his
     shoulder  he looks back at her  her eyes are closed she wont 
     open them

                               marrow
                   were going down the stairs nell 
                   im taking you down the stairs

     he leads her go down the stairs

     int theos room  night

     marrow and theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching
     luke finish taping a trash bag over nells broken window  nell lies 
     in her bed asleep or unconscious its impossible to say  luke 
     finishes comes over  marrow is hushed grim exhausted

                               theo
                   she needs help

                               marrow
                   ill take her with me to the 
                   university tomorrow  i cant 
                   believe i read the test wrong  i 
                   didnt see anything that looked 
                   like she was suicidal

                               luke
                   you used the wrong test

                               theo
                          indignant
                   will the two of you shut up  god 
                   damn it  maybe the tests were 
                   right marrow  shes sensitive 
                   shes vulnerable but i dont 
                   think shes suicidal and i didnt 
                   have to test her  maybe she 
                   wasnt trying to kill herself  
                   maybe she was really scared  
                   maybe she really heard voices

     marrow looks away doesnt want to say this  theo reads the 
     feelings on his face

                               luke
                   youre not telling us something

                               marrow

                   him again

                   house hell have to stay lost 
                   until tomorrow until the night is 
                   over  what we have to do now is 
                   be together with nell

     and they go  three scared people

     int nells bathroom  night

     luke sits on the closed toilet and watches nell in the adjoining 
     room  light from the bathroom falls across her fetal curled form 
     in the bed

     the door to theos room is open too  luke glances over  theo lies 
     on her bed  marrow is slouched in a chair

     luke settles back against the wall

     the house exhales and the breath of the house is like the poppy 
     field in the wizard of oz it brings on sleep

     int theos room  much later that night

     marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close  theo
     breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream

     this is what the house wanted

     int nells room  night

     nell lies asleep the ornate headboard looming behind her black 
     with its strange plantlike splay of leaves

     nell draws a deep sleeping breath and her eyes open  she lies
     there her breath still in her lungs not moving but sensing
     something  a long beat  when she lets her breath out we can see 
     it in the cold

     int nells bathroom  night

     lukes head rests solidly on the wall  his eyes are closed unaware
     his breath is fogging too

     int nells room  night

     nell lies there afraid to move afraid to make the faintest sound
     from the darkness above wood creaks  at first it seems like someone 
     is walking on the floor above  but it is coming from within the 
     room

     the carvings on the ceiling the impossibly elaborate woodwork are
     moving  incredibly slowly with incredible subtlety turning inside
     out some of the forms lengthening some shortening  carvings 
     changing here changing there  the ceiling coming alive  with 
     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see

     the wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall
     bed posters  it crawls down the posters straining the sinewy 
     baroque curves swelling them

     the creaking begins from the darkness of the wall opposite nell  
     nell inclines her head to see  out of the wall two enormous bulges 
     grow side by side

     from behind nell now  the headboard groans its shapes moving the
     fanlike plant designs thickening and splaying wide

     nell cant move her mind refusing to understand whats going on  
     the bulges in the wall droop to the floor  and then we begin to 
     see they are like a pair of knees

     understanding starts to show in nells eyes  she looks up at the
     ceiling  and now all the movement the design behind the awful
     transformation of the ceiling is clear

     it is a head  a visage of madness of absolute horror eyelids 
     sealing shut its blind face

     silence  nells breath comes ragged  unable to speak but trying 
     to call out

     the eyes open  a scream tears out of nells throat

     int nells bathroom  night

     luke is shocked awake in time to see nells room convulse on her 
     just before the door slams in his face

                               luke
                   oh my god

     int nells room  night

     the entire room rams itself at nell jolting her hard into the
     headboard  thumbs fold out of the woodwork pinning her by the
     shoulders against it  as the room lowers itself toward her she
     screams out of her mind

     int nells bathroom  night

     marrow lunges into the bathroom thrown from sleep as luke stares in
     impotent shock  theo is there behind marrow an instant later

                               marrow
                   what is it

     luke cant make any words come out  marrow shoves him aside grabs 
     the doorknob and thrashes at it

                               marrow contd
                   help me

     he braces luke up and then they lunge together shouldering the 
     door  it splinters out of its frame 

     int nells room  night continuous

      and stumble into nells room  marrows mouth opens  luke stands
     speechless  theyre stricken by the sight nell screaming held by 
     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her the room 
     thrusting at her rhythmically  nell and theo make eye contact

                               theo
                   oh jesus

     marrow recovers reaches out for nell and the face in the ceiling
     turns on him  the gaze stops marrow in his tracks  he looks up 
     into it and knows its real  somehow it is crain

     luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and
     smashes off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra
     nell screams in surprise but theo drags her out of the bed

     the head turns to them  they flee  marrow backs away in awe and 
     fear

     int great hall  night

     luke and theo drag nell down the stairs into the great hall  marrow
     brings up the rear  they retreat for the entry as luke puts his 
     jacket over nells shoulders  marrow stops looks back up the 
     stairs

                               marrow
                   wait a second  wait

     all there is are the sounds of nell luke and theo making for the 
     hall to the entry  the house is silent

                               luke
                   no

     luke goes out  but nell pauses stopping theo with her

     the house is quiet  marrows hand still outstretched  nell looks
     around the room  there are heads everywhere faces animal heads
     humans gods all staring from the woodwork the carpets everything
     all turning to her

     theo looks around but cant see what nell is seeing  nells breath
     comes faster disoriented yet aware

                               nell
                   theyre all in here  all the ones 
                   he killed  theyre just children  
                   we have to help them

                               theo
                          to marrow
                   come on  why are we waiting

     even now marrow cant believe what he just saw but theos voice
     brings him back  he whirls grabs onto nell helps theo drag her 
     out

     ext hill house drivewaygate  night

     four cars sit behind the massive locked gate as far from hill 
     house as possible  marrow paces past the fence staring out the 
     road beyond leading out of this place so close

     luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate  no
     easy way under it  he stands and gazes at the razorsharp spikes
     twenty feet up  theres no way to climb this

                               theo
                   oh my god we need to call someone

     marrow just looks at her and walks back to nells car

     int nells car  night

     nell sits in the passenger seat of her car wrapped in her jacket  
     she stares out at the gate at luke and theo consulting  marrow 
     appears in the window

                               marrow
                   you okay

     nell nods but theres something about her not right

                               nell
                   why did you bring me here

     marrow shakes his head doesnt fully understand

                               nell contd
                   why did you call me and tell me to

                   nell what are you talking about  
                   i never called you

     nell stares dismayed but marrow is dead serious

                               nell
                   but you told me to look in the 
                   paper  you told me id be

                   with you in person was the night

                   then who called me

     hill house looms behind her windows forming eyes the carport a
     gaping mouth

     nells dismay becomes a cold terrifying understanding and she 
     turns and stares back up at the house

     luke comes up with theo on the other side of the car

                               theo
                   nell 

                               luke
                    how much is this car worth

     ext hill house drivewaygate  night

     theo pulls nell away from the drive  marrow stands back from nells
     car where luke belts in behind the wheel

     luke eases the car forward to the gate  he advances until the cars
     bumper makes contact  and then without further ado revs the 
     engine

     the buick grinds into the heavy steel bars  the chain tightens 
     around the two halves of the gate but shows not the slightest 
     strain

     int nells car  night

     luke grimaces shifts into low pours on the gas

     ext main gate  night

     the car fishes back and forth against the gate hurling a shower of
     gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road  marrow nell 
     and theo move back

     one of the buicks headlights breaks  the grill mashes in  for a 
     long moment the car struggles against the gate  no good  luke 
     eases up

     theo looks at marrow  luke puts the car in reverse

                               luke
                   get the hell out of the way

     they back way up  luke vanishes up the drive in the car  and then 
     the buick comes around the corner accelerating slicing down the 
     gravel road

     int nells car  night

     luke sits way back in the seat grits his teeth floors it aiming 
     at the gate

     ext main gate  night

     the car smashes into it and is stopped collapsing twisting in a
     deafening hail of steel and glass

     the massive gate has bent itself around the car holding it in its
     steelgrip

     ext gate  night

     nell understands the house will not let her go  she turns away 
     from the gate faces the house mesmerized by the beauty in this
     monstrosity  the house is calling her back and nell is drawn 
     towards it  she starts walking

     int nells car  night

     luke gasps for the seat belt the wind knocked out of him steering
     column pushed to his chest  marrow and theo run up outside  luke 
     sees him sees hes not getting any closer than ten feet and hes 
     looking back at the gas tank

     luke gets the seatbelt off tries to open the door but its warped
     shut  he struggles to get out from behind the wheel  sparks jump 
     from the battery  gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the 
     shattered window  he knows hes in trouble

                               theo
                   hurry  the gas  luke the gas

     finally luke gets free of the wheel  its agonizing to watch  
     the passenger door is jammed shut too

     he squirms into the back seat  the rear doors are in the same
     condition as the front  but the rear window is blown out  he 
     crawls out onto the trunk

     ext main gate  night

     marrow hurries around the back of the car staying clear of the lake
     of gas spreading about it  luke rolls off  marrow helps him up 
     and gets him away a safe distance

                               luke
                   im okay  okay  just my chest  
                   just my wind knocked out

     marrow looks up at the gate  it is even more impassible than before
     with the gasolinesaturated wreck in it  no way to try another 
     breakout either

                               luke contd
                   sorry about your car nell

     he turns around  the others do too

     no nell  luke and theo look up  mute dread  no nell anywhere

                               marrow
                   oh no

     int grand entry  night

     the massive black door swings silently into the dark vaulted entry
     marrow pauses there looks about and then enters  he holds a tire
     iron

     luke does too  he and theo follow marrow in

                               theo
                   im sure she went back to her 
                   room

     int grand stairway  night

     they stay to the outside of the stairs padding silently up trying 
     to get a glimpse of the floor above  its shrouded in darkness

     they turn at the landing eyes riveted to the top of the stairs  
     they start up

     int 2nd floor hallway north wing  night

     marrow luke and theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down
     both long empty directions of the hallway

     then marrow turns toward nell and theos room  the brass 
     candelabra in front of the open door

     the rooms draw nearer closer  not even the sound of their 
     breathing

     the door is ajar  marrow pushes it open with the tire iron  the 
     room lies in silent disarray  normal disarray  the bed normal  
     the ceiling normal  no nell

     marrow and theo react and enter the room  luke lingers out in the 
     hall a moment  and just as he steps in after them we hold on the 
     long empty hall 

      and a figure glides across  far down at the other end  she
     disappears  it was nell

     int statuary hall  night

     nell walks through the row of dark statues  carved faces watch her
     pass

     int hall outside locked room  night

     nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors once locked
     now inexplicably open  the mythological frieze on the door split in
     half a world cut in two a seal broken  like something has come 
     out of its tomb

     nell steps into the blackness

     int theos room  night

     marrow comes out of the bathroom joining theo by the window next to
     her bed  luke stands in the doorway

                               theo
                   was sure shed be in here

                               luke
                          worried
                   where in the hell can she be

     marrow remembers

                               marrow
                   oh no

     int greenhouse  night

     marrow luke and theo enter the greenhouse the heavy growth
     forbidding in the darkness  they spread out on the parallel 
     walkways

                               theo
                   nell

     they reach the transept turn down it toward the statue of crain at
     the end looming white in the dusk

     dead silence  then marrow screams

     under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes
     from the pond we find watts body as if the hand wants to keep him
     there forever  marrow did find his watts a horrifying sight

                               marrow
                   oh my god its watts

     as at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a 
     river of blood scaring the hell out of them  their clothes 
     splattered with blood marrow quickly leads them out of there

     int locked room  nursery  night

     nell stands there in the darkness sensing the expanse of the room
     turning and kicking something on the floor

     it is a wooden toy train  then she sees a rocking horse by her 
     feet  it is a nursery  turnofthecentury

     and as nells eyes adjust as she tries to see what else is in here 
     in the dark she begins to make out white shrouded shapes

     against the wall  a bed covered in a sheet  a table beside it  a 
     hand bell  a canejust like nells sick room at home  nell realizes it covers her
     mouth

     the furniture is in exactly the same position though the sheets
     covering the pieces are stained far older

     and on the wall something in a frame is covered with a piece of
     sheet

     nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth  for a long
     beat all we see is her face as it goes slack  understanding

     the framed thing is a stitchery  it says a place for everything
     everything in its place

     just like the one at home

     int great hall  night

     marrow theo and luke barge into the great hall

                               theo
                   nell

                               luke
                   we cant stay here looking for 
                   her  she doesnt want to be 
                   found

     marrow and theo look at him  its what theyve been thinking but
     havent had the courage to say  theo stops suddenly  turns around  
     the men notice and pause

     then they hear it  faint  floating down from upstairs somewhere
     nells tune  it doesnt sound right but its hard to tell as its
     coming from so far away

     they look at each other start for the stairs

     int hallway outside locked room  night

     theo marrow and luke stand at the end of the dark hallway  they 
     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end  the tune 
     is coming from within  abruptly it stops

     and instead of nells tune theres a repetitive creak  creak  
     creak

     in rising dread theo starts forward

     it takes marrow and luke a moment to come after her  the creaking 
     gets louder unnerving

     they get to the doors theo first  she pushes them wide

     int locked room  nursery  night

     they stop there staring into the shadows

                               theo
                   nell

     and there hunched over something turning a creaking crank of some
     sort is nell

                               marrow
                   nell

     nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to 
     them  theo steps toward her afraid for her

                               theo
                   whatd you come back for babe

                               nell
                   just had to be sure

                               luke
                   come on jesus  lets go

     marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture stays back himself as 
     theo approaches nell

                               theo
                   lets go hon  dont you want to 
                   go back to your little apartment 
                   where you can hear the buoy out in 
                   the harbor when the wind is just 
                   right

     nell smiles at theo  shes holding something

                               nell
                   oh theo  you know i dont have 
                   an apartment

                               theo
                   then lets go get you one

     nells smile softens even more  her voice is reassuring

                               nell
                   dont worry about me theo  im 
                   wanted  right here  im home

     a chill of fear cuts through theo as nell looks deep into her eyes

                               nell contd
                   after all
                          beat
                   im family

     the thing in nells hand is a needle the thing shes been cranking 
     an ancient phonograph  she lowers the needle to the spinning 
     record  and her tune the one she hums all the time begins to 
     play

     the others are frozen where they stand  marrows mind reels at the
     implications of what hes hearing

                               marrow
                   no

                               nell
                   my mother used to hum this to me  
                   like her mother hummed it to her  
                   and my great grandmother carolyn 
                   hummed it to her

     nell turns back  the others stand there speechless

                               nell contd
                   i have to stay  you better go  i 
                   could explain it but youd never 
                   understand

     and that finally galvanizes the others into action  marrow sweeps
     past theo grabs nell hard and swings her for the door

                               marrow
                   come on

                               nell
                   no 

                               theo
                   please nell just see us out

     luke closes in on nell with marrow and theres nothing she can do 
     but let herself be pulled along

     int grand stairway  night

     down the stairs they come luke out in front now bounding down a 
     half flight ahead  marrow and theo support nell between them

     nell looks up at the hooded painting of crain but is spun around 
     and taken down the next flight

     int great hall  night

     nell marrow and theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause  
     luke is halfway across the room looking back to make sure theyre 
     with him 

      and nell digs her heels in jerking marrow and theo to a stop  
     she stares  the others follow her gaze

     shes looking down the connecting hall out to the entry at the 
     front doors  theyre open

                               nell
                   in the night

     the door bams shut with a concussion that rocks the entire room
     sweeping lukes jacket under it  the handles turn lock down

     stunned  all stunned

     a rush of air  the house exhales  silence  and then creeeeak  
     they cast their eyes back up the stairs

     bump bump  faroff sounds hairraising of infinite variety carry
     down the halls

                               nell contd
                   in the dark

     luke rushes from the room

     int grand entry  night

     luke yells and throws himself at the front doors  marrow runs over 
     to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and pries  
     marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back

     luke joins him and they shoulder block it together  but this door 
     is massive  theres no way

                               luke
                   no you bastard  break

     he roundhouse kicks it hurts himself

     theo afraid watches the great hall behind them  nell puts her 
     hand on her shoulder

                               nell
                   its not safe for you anymore  
                   the children need me and crain is 
                   doing everything he can to keep me 
                   from them

     theo stares appalled  marrow looks around puts his hand up to 
     shush everyone  the house moans the bumping growing searching

                               marrow
                   come on

     he rushes down the hall luke right beside him nell and theo in 
     their wake

     int dining room  night

     lukes first barging into the kitchen  big windows all along the 
     wall  huge windows  marrow follows him in lukes fear turning 
     into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows

     nell and theo are right behind in time to see luke and marrow 
     scooping up a table and chair respectively

                               luke
                   watch out

     the men rush the same window sidebyside and let the heavy pieces
     of furniture fly from ten feet

     the window shatters dozens of panes blown out into the darkness
     beyond  but the metal lattice remains the chairs legs stuck in 
     it

     marrow and luke pause taken back a beat  they hustle over to it  
     theo and nell stand a few feet back

     luke grabs the chair levers it tries to pry open the metal  
     marrow reaches through knocking loose glass trying to find some 
     sort of handle on the other side

                               theo
                   hurry

     theo watches the door behind them  luke pries at the inch of metal
     between him and freedom  it wont break

                               marrow
                   they dont open

     marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice
     lacerating his ring and little finger  with a cry of pain he lands 
     on the floor

                               marrow contd
                   oh jesus my hand

     nell and theo fall to the floor to help him  marrow moans and nell
     grips his injured hand in hers  fast like she was born a trauma
     doctor nell clamps off the blood with her fingers

                               nell
                   give me your shoelace

     marrow tugs at his shoe in shock and looks at nell  shes calm
     terrifyingly calm  and in that moment he realizes shes not out of
     her mind  she just understands things beyond what he could possible
     begin to understand

                               marrow
                   whatll happen to us nell

                               nell
                   nothing if you leave right now  
                   theres a war going on all around 
                   us  dont get in the way please

     nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist

     luke throws down the chair giving up on the window

                               luke
                   shit  all right you 
                   sonofabitch

     as he looks up at another one of crains painting hanging on the 
     wall  nell theo with marrow straggle toward the great hall

     int vestibule towards great hall  night

                               luke
                   maybe thisll get your attention

     luke flicks a lighter out of his pocket

                               marrow
                   luke

     before anyone can stop him he lights a towering tapestry on fire

     he races from one to the next lighting them  theo and nell help
     marrow up back away as luke shoots by

     all the tapestries are on fire blazing up like torches

     at last his rage spent heaving he moves to join the others at the
     center of the room  they stare at him appalled afraid  knowing 
     he has done something wrong

     luke stops  maybe fifteen feet away  he sees their expressions

                               luke
                   what

     nell looks over at the burning tapestries  heat sears the stone
     blackens the carved figures in the woodwork

     the ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room

                               luke contd
                   well get out after this wing 
                   burns down  lets go

     but theres no need  the tapestries are consuming themselves too 
     fast to ignite the walls or ceiling  they all realize it  as the 
     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out there is 
     utter silence

     int great hall  night

     luke looks at them helplessly  an awful impending beat  without
     warning the huge persian carpet hes standing on jerks out from 
     under him  luke falls on his stomach

     stunned luke looks straight into nells eyes  then the carpet 
     slides fast for the fireplace  it whips up to the hearth and sends 
     luke flying through the chain curtains

     the others are speechless  they can do nothing but watch as luke 
     lays there on the ashdrop  a long moment

                               nell
                          to the house to
                           crain
                   no  no  let them go

     she knows what is going to happen is powerless to prevent it  luke
     stands up has time to give her a look

     and then the lions head flue drops open behind him  luke looks 
     back into its iron eyes 

      and with shocking speed the flue snaps shut again taking lukes
     head off his body

     the decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet 
     with its strings cut

     nell marrow and theo stand there  not sure of what just happened
     their minds unable to accept it

     a sound comes up in theos throat  a sob  a horrified whimper  
     marrow and nell stand there speechless  its as if saying the 
     obvious will make it real

                               marrow
                   luke

     bang  the bloodsplattered lions head drops open  lukes head 
     falls out

     theo screams and screams again  nell backs away with marrow almost
     has the presence of mind to drag them away but 

      clang  the ash drop opens  the sudden sound stops them in their
     tracks

     as they watch its as if the house inhales  and boom

     out of the ash drop explodes a hail of bones skulls flying ash

     nell theo and marrow back up toward the grand staircase as tons of
     incinerated human remains vomit from the fireplace blasting across
     the floor knocking over furniture with shocking violence  skulls
     bounce over wood  hundreds of them

     theo and marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone loose
     teeth pelt them  nell is immune

     they run up the grand staircase toward the top and finally it cant
     reach them anymore

     int mezzanine  night

     they look out at the full scope of crains horror

                               theo
                   oh god we cant get out

                               marrow
                   nell what do we do

                               nell
                   he played hide and seek with the 
                   children  thats how he built the 
                   house

     marrow stares at her trembling  he glances around at the winding
     labyrinth of house  impossible

                               marrow
                   we cant hide in here  we wont 
                   make it til morning

     nell looks at him pitying  infinitely sad but guarding them

                               nell
                   i know

     behind them the huge painting of hugh crain in a golden frame with
     sharp metal spikes looks down at them  the room inhales and 
     exhales the bumping sound resumes  a rumble runs through the house 
     and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud 
     of ashes still hangs in the air

     unseen by them this rumble start to shake the painting behind them
     the sound from the great hall makes marrow and theo back up more 
     but nell doesnt move she senses something is about to happen and 
     she will fight it

     she suddenly turns and sees the painting in a flash she reaches 
     out for marrow and theo pull them out of the way as the giant 
     painting with the huge skull falls face down toward them  it 
     misses them by a hair but their clothes are shredded by the spikes

     marrow and theo areshocked as they back up right toward the griffin
     on top of the staircase

     for a split second the brass griffin right behind them comes alive
     opens its fangs and claws and is ready to attack but nell sees 
     the danger grabs a human bone and batters the griffin

                               nell contd
                   no no you leave them alone

     and the griffin turns back into brass  marrow and theo unaware of 
     what happened behind them  they have to get out of there

     int second floor hallway  night

     nell leads marrow and theo down the dark hallway the twisted 
     woodwork along the walls frozen but seeming poised to reach out 
     trip someone grab a sleeve

     it is a nightmare house  doing what it was made for

     the bumping theyve left behind seems to vanish up and into the
     ceiling  it gives chase on the floor above  nell keeps looking 
     back and every time she does the bumping seems to get more firm 
     more like a footstep  calm nell urges them on

                               nell
                   hurry

     the footsteps upstairs come faster whatevers up there moving 
     better more naturally

     theo and marrow turn left through an archway  nell looks back at 
     the ceiling  the things moving fast

     she dodges toward the archway where theo and marrow went and stops
     its a wall  solid wall  theres no archway here  nell backs 
     away  alone

     the house has separated them

     nell tries to open any of the hall doors but they are all locked
     theres no other way then going back

     int mezzanine  day

     nell is back in the mezzanine steps carefully over crains 
     painting  the long white lace curtains in front of a side window 
     start to flutter in the wind but the window is closed

     nell walks up to the top of the stairs her back to the window 
     calls out

                               nell
                   jim  theo

     no answer and as she steps forward listening for a reply the
     curtain billows out behind her and in its movement becomes for a
     split second the image of crain grabbing for her

     nell oblivious steps just out of reach and as the breeze fails 
     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into 
     chaos  nell glances back at it just sees curtain and looks up at 
     the open window

     she turns from it determined and starts out to find her friends 
     and walks down the steps

     int grand staircasegreat hall  night

     close on the brass griffins that guard the staircase

     behind nells back they all turn toward her follow her with their
     eyes as nell enters the great hall  and they cower in fear for what 
     is about to happen  again nell calls out for theo and marrow

     and nell doesnt see the scores of tiny arms of children that fold 
     out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as nell
     carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children 
     that cover the floor

     horrifyingly alive are these tiny hands as reach out for her hair
     after she passes  were screaming as they almost have her and 
     nell steps away

     and then creak creak creak

     the terrified animal heads on the balustrade their eyes flash in
     fear  the lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly

     cherubim afraid clasp hands  gods and men pay unwilling witness 
     to what is now coming down the stairs

     the upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing
     coming down over our heads coming down down and now at the
     landing  the sound stops

     nells breath escapes visible in the cold as she watches rooted to
     the floor in the grand entry

     darkness against darkness  something blocks the glint of the gilded
     frame up on the landing  something huge  a beat

     and then a shadow sweeps across the scene impenetrable darkening 
     the stairs wiping them from sight like something gliding down 
     them

     before our eyes out of the most subtle variation of shadow 
     flickers into existence

     the shape tall eight or nine feet featureless black but in the
     proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed shoulders 
     stooped  and just like that all it is

     is a well of darkness and night once again  we dont even know 
     for sure what we just saw  but it is still there in that bar of 
     shadow

     nell goes rigid not breathing not seeing anything but the awful
     presence  she is spellbound

     bang  a door in the connecting passage opens and theo and marrow 
     come out between nell in the entry and the thing in the great hall 
     beyond

     in a flash the shape is moving at theo and marrow  they dont see 
     it have their backs turned

                               theo
                   nell  there you 

     but nell is looking past them  they see her face and turn around

                               nell
                   nooo not them

     what is coming at them makes the blood stop

     the shape rushes from the great hall vanishing as it crosses the
     pools of moonlight reforming darker as it hits shadow again its 
     wake like a shockwave invisible itself but visible in its effects

     theo screams  marrow stumbles back  and then nells voice rings 
     out

                               nell contd
                   is this where she bashed your 
                   brains in

     the onrushing presence stops  seems to turn its attention to nell
     standing there before the towering front doors

                               nell contd
                   when you came in the door  i bet 
                   that was the last thing you 
                   expected  right  fromcarolyn
                          beat
                   you thought oh carolyn ive 
                   taken it all out of her you 
                   thought oh carolyn shes no 
                   threat  carolyn  great grandma 
                   carolyn  did you know that

     nell shows no fear  theres a ferocious edge to her voice

                               nell contd
                   she found out what you did and 
                   she knew there was only one way to 
                   stop you  and she stopped you so 
                   you couldnt torture anymore of 
                   the living
                          beat
                   but you wouldnt even let go of 
                   the dead would you  well now 
                   im here  they called me  did 
                   you know that  theyve been 
                   crying out for help for a long 
                   time  and i heard them

     she points out at the human remains strewn all over the great hall

                               nell contd
                   and i wont let you hurt them 
                   anymore

     the shape hovers there silent  air and shadow distort around it  
     the carved animal heads on the newell posts and walls loll back and 
     forth alive then notalive  pieces of furniture stamp in fury try 
     to animate themselves but cant find limbs that work

                               nell contd
                   come on hugh crain you know what 
                   to do  weve both been here 
                   before

     the shape howls forward knocking everyone out of their seats  it
     flies across the floor at nell

     marrow and theo are slammed against the walls out of its way

     nell opens wide her arms in an embrace

     its on her but just as it seems to hit it splits like she went
     right through it  the shape and all the debris in its wake impacts
     deep in the enormous doors

     the carved woodwork seems to suck it all in cracking groaning  
     and then all the screams are cut off

     nell stands there with her arms spread  a long moment

     she opens her eyes

     and then the woodwork lashes out grabs her from behind slams her
     back against the doors  the blow has killed her

     we feel her bones break as she crumples is drawn into the woodwork

     and for a few seconds nells body just hangs there and then it
     gently falls down

     theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward nell

                               theo
                   nell

     marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe his life his 
     beliefs changed forever  he walks over to nell and feels her pulse 
     knowing it is a useless gesture as theo softly moans over nell

     and as the camera pans up across the entry door we see a new 
     carving in the sculpted doors  it is a woman and as we move in we 
     can see that she wears the same necklace as nell

     int hill house front doors entry  early morning

     the house inhales  and boom

     the front doors blast wide  every door in the entry slams open

     against the early light of a rising sun the silhouette of hill 
     house every window and every door in the house is open each and 
     every one crying out with a different unintelligible voice like a 
     soul the soul of a child escaping from each one

                   garden where you can just see the 
                   ocean and at night when the wind 
                   comes in just right you can hear 
                   the sound of the harbor  what 
                   about you

                               marrow

                   but the experiment was a failure

     now we could have him say this line

                               marrow
                   was it

     but he should just look at her and say the same thing with his 
     eyes

     we pull back

     are stacks of books  this is the printing press in hell  the noise
