            over black we hear the first few bars of jingle bells the
            music morphs into an ominous score 

            with a thunderous boom comes a title card reading hanukkah
            past

            ext public elementary school  day

            we start on jesus on a crucifix and then violently crane
            down to reveal mordechai 10 a timid little hasidic boy
            standing nervously at the foot of the statue

            behind morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase hanukkah is
            4 homos scrawled across it he clutches his sandy koufax
            lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance hes got
            quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age

            we see a menacing extremely wide angle shot of the school
            superimposed over the picture are the words st peter

            paul and mary public elementary school 

            mordechai takes a deep breath and walks towards the school

            ext schoolyard  moments later

            mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by four
            gentile children

                                gentile boy 1
                      hey mordechai look i dropped a penny

            he drops a penny the other children cackle

            the gentile girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels


                                gentile girl 1
                      hey mordechai want a bagel

            gentile boy 1 feigns choking

            more laughter morty attempts to take it all in stride we
            push into gentile girl 2 a severe looking puritanically 
            dressed child as she turns to face the camera

                                gentile girl 2
                      hey morty my mom says that unless your
                      people wise up and accept jesus christ as
                      your lord and savior youre all going to
                      burn in hell

            dead silence the other children exchange now that went a
            little over the line looks

            the silence is broken by the sound of the schoolbell morty
            gathers himself and walks off

            int classroom  later

            as morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear
            a tinny version of the song dreidel dreidel dreidel 

            he tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a dreidel he
            looks at his gift and then looks offscreen we pan with his
            look to reveal

            a group of christian children congregating around a large
            garishly decorated christmas tree a very vegas merry
            christmas sign flashes as a largerthanlife hifi version of
            the christmas song jingle bells blares the children
            festively slap high fives as they open their presents

            love jesus tshirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow
            affixed to its head in her arms it licks her on the face

            we cut back to mordechai he looks down at his pathetic
            excuse for a present hes on the verge of tears 

            gentile boy 1 calls to mordechai as he drives his atc  


                                gentile boy 1
                      hey everybody look what mordechai got

            to laugh 

            mordechai is crushed mrs highsmith 40s an incredibly
            waspy teacher puts down her copy of modern wasp and
            appears genuinely concerned by the teasing mordechai has
            weathered she walks over to comfort him

                                mrs highsmith

            suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems

                                mrs highsmith contd
                      very good class i hope youve all
                      learned an important lesson today just
                      because mordechais people are different
                      from usjust because they might appear
                      strange to us with their furry hats
                      their beady eyes and their long
                      sideburnsnot to mention their bizarre
                      customs and unnecessarily guttural funny
                      sounding namesjust because they
                      control all of the worlds money yet are
                      too cheap to buy their children anything
                      better than spinning tops for presents
                      does not mean that we cant learn to
                      respect and love them as our equals

            she squeezes his cheek

                                mrs highsmith contd

            ext ghetto street  night

            a sullen mordechai wanders the streets absurd xmas
            decorations horrific in their appearance blanket the street 

            morty glances a grotesque faux reindeer with fangs we hear a
            growling noise as it lights up he walks quickly away in fear
            past 


            a storefront

            we track with morty as he passes a storefront window inside
            the clerk turns a sign outwards reading jews not welcome
            we continue with morty as he passes by a second storefront a
            similar sign reading kykes go home is turned outwards by
            another clerk he continues past yet another building as a
            sign reading monotheists need not apply is displayed by a
            third clerk for mortys benefit

            morty looks across the street

            a sign hangs from a storefront reading jews ok for about 5
            minutes the fourth clerk gives him the thumbs up

            morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and
            pulls out his dreidel 

            he spins it and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats
            as morty stares at in wonderment 

            suddenly a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame
            and smashes the little dreidel mordechai slowly looks up 

            a menacing santa claus gives him the finger and exits frame
            as we hear him sadistically laugh os the words ho ho ho
            at morty

            we start close on mordechai rage fills every inch of his
            face as we slowly crane away the opening credits begin as
            the hebrew hammer theme song kicks into full gear

                                                                 cut to

            title sequence

            through the screen line by line spinning into place to form
            a star of david the title the hebrew hammer slams into

                                hammer
                      happy hanukkah maccabee

            macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift 
            a hebrew hammer action figure he beams

            we cut back to the hammer as he smiles back from oc we
            hear maccabee say

                                maccabee oc
                      thanks hammer

            the hammer smiles back and walks off frame

            another part of the chood

            we begin on the hammers black boots and slowly tilt up as we
            dolly back with him

            the hammer passes a line of three jewish princesses who swoon
            as he passes 

            he stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads 100
            kosher meat we push into his close up as he blows them all
            a kiss

            the pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony

            the hammer winks back

            an old woman calls to the hammer from the window of a second
            story flat 

                                old woman

            we punch in to a close up of a demure miriam as the hammer
            takes stock of the goods she is an atrociously ugly girl
            wearing orthodontic headgear and bespectacled with a pair
            oversized librarians glasses

            the hammer shakes off his wave of nausea

            some teenage gentile boys play keep away with a yarmulke
            belonging to shlomo another young hasidic kid

            teddy the nonspeaking teen gentile throws the yarmulke
            and we follow it as it spins towards another teenage gentile
            the other teenage gentile excitedly extends his hands to
            catch but right before it reaches him another hand comes
            into frame and snatches it he looks up and we cut to his  

            pov as we tilt up to reveal the hammer he looks pretty damn
            big and pissed off from this angle

            the teenage gentile  begins to shake and stammer

            brass hits however the brass hits become incredibly

                      i want to start by thanking all of you
                      for pulling yourselves away from the
                      workshop to make this emergency meeting
                      i know its the busiest time of the year
                      for all of you so ill try and be brief

            as santa speaks we begin on a painting of a meek and
            frightened looking santa claus his eyes look fearfully to
            his right  below the picture frame is a plaque reading st
            nick the nervous 18711941 we continue a slow dolly to the
            right on to the next picture

            we see another santa claus much more treacherous in his
            appearance his eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of
            santa to his left the plaque below his picture read st
            nick the nasty 19411970

            we continue our dolly to the right finally ending on a
            painting of a jolly portly santa below his picture the
            plaque reads st nick the nice 1970christmas present

            we cut to a wide shot of a conference room the same nice
            santa claus from the last picture addresses a handful of
            elves two reindeer flank santa on either side their
            nameplates hang from their necks  blitzen and rudolph

            at the other end of the table from santa sits his son damian
            quite a nasty looking man 

                                santa claus contd
                      my father often referred to as st nick
                      the nasty was a tyrannical man he was
                      obsessed with making christmas the only
                      holiday anyone could celebrate before the
                      new year
                      since his death ive prided myself on
                      ensuring that the christmas season is one
                      of tolerance and understanding between
                      all races and religions its always been
                      my belief that hanukkah and kwanzaa
                      deserve the same respect as christmas 

            damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side and then
            makes the jerking off motion with his hand 

                                santa claus contd
                      lights please

            as rudolphs nose dims so do the lights in the room santa

            projector

                                santa claus contd
                      over the course of my career as santa
                      claus ive made it my mission to ensure
                      that jews christians and african
                      americans could all observe their
                      respective holidays in harmony

            we see a slide of the hebrew hammer an african american man
            mohammed and santa claus arm in arm below a banner in a
            mall reading happy holidays

                                santa claus contd
                      i was responsible for pushing the happy
                      holidays ordinance in which all merry
                      christmas signage was replaced by the
                      transrelgious and inoffensive phrase
                      happy holidays

            we see another slide in which an assembly of schoolchildren
            are singing

                                santa claus contd
                      it was nearly a decade ago in
                      conjunction with our friends in the
                      jewish and african american communities 
                      that i supported a bill that mandated
                      that dreidel dreidel dreidel and im
                      dreaming of a bright kwanzaa be taught
                      and sung in elementary schools along with
                      the christmas standards frosty the
                      snowman and deck the halls 
                      which is why upon examination of my
                      annual naughty and nice list it shocked
                      me to discover that my own son damian

            damian preoccupied with the cigarette hes attempting to
            light looks up in response to his name
            a brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front
            of him we can see santa and the reindeer in silhouette on
            the slide projection screen behind him

                                santa claus contd

                      the heir to the red suit could be so
                      filled with hate 

            santa addresses damian

                                santa claus contd
                      damian when i learned of your ludicrous
                      scheme to wipe out hanukkah my first
                      reaction was one of disgust now im
                      only filled with sadness and
                      disappointment disappointed that i
                      failed to teach you the true meaning of
                      christmas what do you have to say for
                      yourself

            we being a slow push into damian as he ponders the question
            the cigarette dangles from his lips 

            rudolph nods to blitzen blitzen returns the gesture with a
            nod of acknowledgment

            with a slow and measured pace damian says

                                damian
                      ho ho ho

            on the slide projector screen behind damian we see the
            silhouetted images of blitzen and rudolph goring santa
            through the chest with their antlers damian cringes

            blood trickles from santas mouth and with his last breath
            he utters the words

                                santa claus
                      et tu blitzen

            santa falls out of frame with a thud standing behind him
            with bloodied antlers is blitzen 

            damian walks over to the newly deceased santa takes his
            bloodstained santas hat and put it on his own head from
            this point on in the screenplay damian will now be referred
            to as santa

            the elves in the room in various stages of shock stare at
            their new master in horror

                                santa

            in the doorway stands a blonde bombshell in a mink coat

            esther looks down at his desk

            we cut to a shot of the hammers inout box both are
            completely empty and thickly coated with spiderwebs 

            the hammer takes notice of her expression of skepticism

                      your credentials

            the hammer looks directly into the camera and shakes his head
            proudly

                                                                 cut to

            mrs carver forcefully grabs esther into an embrace
            resembling a bear hug and begins to plaster her with sloppy
            kisses esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the
            kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long

            mrs carver places her tongue into esthers ear canal as a
            sign of affection forcing esther to break the embrace mrs
            carver and esther look at one another strangely for an
            awkward few moments

                      oh

            the other brothers put their guns down and go back to their
            prehammer activities and the accountant takes his place
            back at the card table   

            mohammed puts his arm around the hammer

            sits at the table across from santa

            carol a common street thug cmon did you seriously think
            that scrooge would give free handouts to the cratchit family

                      take a look around you jamal do you see
                      any colored midgets in my workshop

            a shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room
            slaving away on the assembly line

                                santa contd
                      your presence would be a disruption to
                      the utopian model of efficiency ive
                      created here

                                jamal
                      thats some cold shit

            the elves appear to be struggling with the speed at which the
            products move down the assembly line the head elf steps out
            from the assembly line and addresses santa

                                head elf
                      utopian model of efficiency my ass ever
                      since you took charge this place has
                      been more like a sweatshop 

            the other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement
            with the head elf 


                                head elf contd
                      we know our rights santa youre in

                      going on strike

            the other elves shout out their approval santa takes it all
            in stride

                                santa
                      you know something youre right

            the head elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of
            compassion on santas part

                                head elf
                      really

                      elves arent willing to do the work i
                      made arrangements to have some taiwanese
                      children shipped over and i might add 
                      theyre more than willing to work for
                      peanuts

            santa performs the two fingered whistle

                                santa contd

                      come on in boys

            a group of five taiwanese boys file past santa towards the
            assembly line

            as each child passes santa he hands them each a bag of
            peanuts 

            at the assembly line the taiwanese boys move like lightning
            as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled nikey kathy lee
            clothing company and starstrucks coffee

            the elves including jamal watch in amazement at their
            agility and efficiency

            defeated they shuffle out of the workshop

            hard core punk music pours out from the inside of the bar
            the hammer walks into frame and looks up at the sign he
            curiously notes the astro turf spread across the pavement
            and then makes his way for the front door

            int dukes bar  afternoon


            we dolly into the hammer as he pushes open the western style
            doors 

            the music comes to a screeching stop we hold on his cu as he
            looks around

            we cut to the other side to get a look at what he sees  a
            bar of about ten skinheads staring back at him dumbfounded
            skinhead paraphernalia adorns the walls  

            the hammer maintains his cool takes a deep breath and then
            walks towards the bar

            we cut to a floor level shot as his star of david spurs
            jangle as he continues his walk to the bar

            he steps up to the counter where a skinhead bartender with a
            mansonlike swastika inked on his forehead studies him
            curiously

            the bartender reaches for a bottle of cherry flavored
            manischewitz wine the hammer interrupts him by clearing his
            throat 

                                hammer
                      actually can i have the black label

            the bartender eyeballs him and then grabs the bottle of
            black label manischewitz he grabs a glass from the rack and
            begins to pour

                      might as well leave the bottle

            the bartender stops pouring and places the bottle on the bar

            he drops a fistful of shekels on the bar 

            a few skinheads slowly begin to approach the bar

            the hammer picks up the bottle and begins to examine it

            with one swift motion the hammer spins the bottle up to grab
            it by the neck and thwacks the bartender on the head with
            it 

            all of the other occupants in the bar jump out of their
            seats encircling the hammer

            we do a quick push into the hammer as he pulls out two sawed
            off shotguns from underneath his coat

            fighting a few seconds of the fighting sounds pass

            suddenly the front doors bust open and a few bloodied
            skinheads fall out onto the ground followed by the hammer
            hes untouched and he carries the bottle of manischewitz in
            one hand and a shotgun in the other 

            he stops in the midground and pours the manischewitz out on
            the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner

            he approaches foreground and pulls out something from his
            jacket pocket

            we see a cu of the same matchbook the elf gave him dukes 
            where skin is in

            he lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder we hear
            the sounds of bursting flames 

            the hammer puts his sunglasses on and walks straight past
            the camera

            we pull back into a spinning overhead to reveal flames in the
            shape of the star of david burning on the lawn

            santa snaps his fingers and bambi and tawni drape themselves
            on either side of the hammer rubbing his arms erotically

                                santa contd

            esther is clearly jealous

            the hammers enjoying the attention he looks down at bambis
            breasts were talking huge obviously augmented boobolas a
            large crucifix chain hangs around her neck nestled in
            between the mounds of silicone we hear the requisite ding as
            it sparkles

            the hammer is released from the sexual spell of the gentile
            seductress

                                hammer

                      conversation with his nice jewish friend
                      the hebrew hammer

            the hammer plays along raising his hand to keep the children
            calm

                                hammer
                      hey everybody hows it hangin

                      personally plans on cancelling christmas
                      this year 

            the hammer and esther look to one another this riles the
            masses trouble


                                santa contd
                      why dont we show him how that makes us
                      feel

                                                                 cut to

            an empty section of the mall  moments later

            we hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked
            portion of the mall 

            suddenly esther and the hammer haul ass around the corner
            running for their lives

            a second or two pass and an angry mob of about twenty
            gentile children round the corner after them theyre
            definitely not in the christmas spirit

            the hammer and esther take another turn from the other
            direction a second mob of children head straight at them 

            the hammer spots another corridor in front of them

                                hammer
                      cmon

            they run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall a dead
            end os we can hear the throng of children nearing in the
            bg


                                throng os
                      whered they go i saw them go down that
                      hallway cmon lets get em

            hammer turns to esther defeated

                                hammer
                      its over were doomed

            the barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the 
            biblical slave song let my people go sounds as if its
            coming from within the walls of the mall 

                                esther
                      shh shh listen do you hear that

            the hammer tries to place the source

                                hammer
                      what is that 

            suddenly a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door
            the other side of the door is dark but it has a cavernous
            feel to it

            an elderly jewish woman harriet tubbelman appears from out
            of the doorway she smokes a corncob pipe


                                harriet tubbelman
                      psst hammer esther this way hurry 

            harriet escorts the two into the passageway and the door
            slides shut behind them

            int cavernous room  moments later

            we appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an
            its a small world after all type water ride 

            harriet leads esther and the hammer into one of the waiting
            cars the cars kind of have a baby moses straw basket theme
            going on the let my people go song piped from unseen
            speakers is now at full strength

            she hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap
            restraints for hammer and esther testing them to make sure
            theyre secure


                                harriet tubbelman contd
                      you should be safe from here on out just
                      follow the river to its conclusion

            she begins to walk away but then catches herself as she
            turns back to face them

                                harriet tubbelman contd
                      oh yeah and keep your arms and legs
                      inside the water craft at all times

                      where are we what is this place

            she smiles with great pride

                                harriet tubbelman
                      welcome to the underground jewish
                      railroad just sit back relax and enjoy
                      the ride

            the brakes on the water craft release and the craft makes it
            way from the loading dock

            wide eyed esther and hammer check out their surroundings

            hasidic animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of
            jewish oppression and persecution in an educational yet
            oddly entertaining way 

            the hammer puts his arm around esther and continues to check
            out the attraction in wonderment 

            esther secretly glances at him affectionately its clear
            shes falling for him 

            we cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down
            the river a funkdafied version of the let my people go
            song fades up and over the gospel version from the ride

            ext alley  day


            we see a nondescript door in the middle of a brick wall two
            turnstiles stand directly in front of the door we can hear
            the muffled sounds of the gospel version of let my people
            go scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase hanukkah
            now

            the door opens and the obnoxiously loud music spills out
            into the street the hammer and esther exit close the door
            and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley 

                                hammer
                      that got annoying fairly quickly

                                esther
                      yeah no kidding

            the two walk past him esther turns to the hammer

                      sure why not

            ext the golden menorah  day

            your typical blaxploitation bar it could easily pass for the
            lenox lounge in harlem with the exception of the large
            menorah shaped sign out front

            int the golden menorah  continuous

            we see a bar packed with orthodox jews a wall separating the
            men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room
            stopping about ten feet from the stage signs clearly
            demarcate these men and women sections

            onstage a klezmer band plays a rendition of a to be
            determined 70s funk classic

            esther and the hammer enter the joint mid song the
            bandleader notices the two walk in


                                bandleader
                      hey the hebrew hammer everybody

            the hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment the entire bar
            cheers and applauds

            hammer escorts esther to a table on the womans side of the
            wall and then walks around to the other side of the divider
            where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her

            the band begins a rousing version of hava nagila a good
            majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and
            begin dancing zealously with one another

            esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din
            of the bar

                                esther
                      so do you come here often

            the hammer struggles to hear he shouts back to her

                                hammer
                      what was that

                                esther

                                esther
                      oh

            a hasidic bar patron approaches the hammer and smiles

                                hasidic bar patron
                      would you like to dance

            we get another shot of the men dancing together arm in arm 
            on the dance floor


                                hammer
                      im okay right now thanks though

            as the patron leaves joshua another hasidic man standing
            directly behind him takes his place at the hammers table

                                joshua
                      hey morty wanna cut a rug

                      somebody

            the hammer motions to the wall joshua looks as if his
            feelings are hurt

                                joshua
                      oh okay maybe next time

                      easy

            as joshua leaves we get a wider shot of the hammers table
            a long line of men leads up to it

            chaim feygele an effeminate slick hasidic man chest hair
            spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt
            neck dripping with gold chains steps up to the hammer hes
            got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face 

                                chaim feygele

            chaim points to the dance floor another shot of men dancing
            with one another arm in arm

            the hammer gets up quickly and leaves

            we cut to esthers side of the wall the hammer walks behind
            her while she checks out the band on stage

                                hammer contd
                      hey there

            she turns around pleasantly surprised

                      i would love to get out of here

            int the hammers pad  night

            a smooth laid back blaxploitation era song pumps from the
            speakers we do a slow pan from the stereo into a tight shot
            of esther and the hammer slow dancing sexy esther grunts
            and moans a bit 

            we begin a slow zoom back from the two eventually pulling
            back far enough to see what esthers moaning about the
            hammer is a seriously terrible dancer stepping on her toes
            forcing her into awkward positions etc 

            we see a cu of the hammer accidentally stepping on her toes
            yet again

                                esther

                      ouch

            esther pulls herself away from the hammer

                      funky chickeoh i get it

            clearly outlined through her blouse now the hammers really
            getting it

                                hammer contd

            mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants
            reach its conclusion 

            a cu on her as she looks down at his jewish manhood a wide
            eyed almost shocked reaction she slowly looks back to him

            as the two embrace we rack focus from the two of them in the
            bg to the hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in
            the fg we blur out of focus

                                                            dissolve to

            the hammer gives her ass a smack and then picks up a
            container filled with some kind of white powder
            he snorts a bit of it off of the star of david chain that
            hangs from his neck and places the container of white powder
            back in its place by the menorah

            esther is mortified

                                santa contd
                      step forward son

            rudolph attempts to move forward but the harness attachments
            prevent him from doing so


                                tiny tim
                      uh he cant sir the harnesses

            you can feel the robert deniroesque intensity boiling inside
            of santa

                                santa
                      you gonna learn to guide this sled right

                      christmas eve im gonna have your hide
                      we clear

            rudolph shakes his head the bells on his harness tinkle

            santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away
            rudolph is clearly broken but continues staring back at
            santa as he makes his way out of frame the expression on
            rudolphs face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily
            follows the os santa

            suddenly santa charges right back into frame and places his
            drawn gun to rudolphs temple

                                santa contd
                      you eyeballin me son

            rudolph quickly looks away santa puts his gun back into his
            belt and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his
            composure

            without warning santa throws a fake punch at rudolphs face
            forcing the reindeer to flinch

                                santa contd
                      i didnt think so

            int jewish atomic clock  moments later


            santa and his gang bust through the front doors taking the
            two guards by surprise 

            santas men quickly tie them up and duct tape their mouths
            shut as if out of gullivers travels the guards are
            dragged away out of frame

            santa steps towards camera and surveys the room

                                santa
                      the jewish atomic clock

            its the kind of place where a giant telescope at an
            observatory would be housed the clock is breathtaking in its
            size on its face in place of the standard numerals are the
            names of jewish holidays for example yom kipur is where
            the twelve should be followed by passover etc in the
            center of the face an odometerlike gauge reveals the year
            5734 at its base the brilliant blue judeum glows
            brightly 

            santa barks out orders

                                santa contd
                      get moving weve got work to do

            one of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the song
            santa claus is coming to town begins to play

            a few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the judeum
            clock base and begin pumping

            ext israeli highway  late afternoon

            the hammer is moments away from the jac compound he spots
            the motorcycle ramp and then guns his engine hes close

            int jewish atomic clock  continuous


            inside santa and his thugs hear the sound of the chopper
            growing in strength the roar of the engines is piercingly
            loud and then nothing

            a beat passes and then the hammers motorcycle busts open
            the front door 

            an insert of the hammers bike skidding to a stop 

            as santa goes for his gun the hammer interrupts him

                                hammer
                      uh can you just give me one second

            santa is confused

            still on the bike the hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the
            motorcycle to the doorway looks of bewilderment from santa
            and his gang

            the hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand a john
            wooish slomo shot as the hammer touches his hand to the
            mezuzah nailed to the doorframe 

            the hammer jumps off the bike and we get the requisite quick
            push in on him as he pulls out two uzis from under his
            jacket

                                hammer contd
                      lets dance the hora

            santa draws a pistol and with a single shot from his uzi
            the hammer blows it out of his hand 

            it lands on the other side of the room santa looks up from
            his empty hand

                                santa
                      get him boys

            santas elf thugs open a chest filled with large submachine
            guns the chest is labeled heavy artillery with great
            difficulty they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of
            the box 

            the hammer mildly amused watches them

            the hammer blasts away and the elves scramble for safety
            the sound of gunfire is deafening and constant

            an elf sneaks quietly towards santas gun

            esther walks in through the front door and spots something
            os that gives her cause for concern

            unbeknownst to the hammer the sneaky elf picks up santas
            gun  he raises it at the hammer ready to fire

                                esther

                      mordechai behind you

            the hammer turns and nails the elf just in time

            esther gun drawn backs up into frame with the hammer and
            the two fire off rounds

                                hammer
                      what are you doing here

                                esther

                      do this alone

                      here

            we do another quick push into the hammer as he turns towards
            tiny tim

            tiny tim standing alone with his crutches tucked under his
            arms looks like a deer caught in headlights

            the hammer grins mischievously

                                tiny tim
                      uh oh

            the hammer begins firing

            in slowmotion tiny tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an
            overturned table gunfire trailing him
            like a pole vaulter with two poles tiny tim plants his
            crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the
            table

            he lands directly on top of santa who cowers underneath the
            table

                                santa
                      get off of me you cripple

                                tiny tim
                      what are we gonna do hes got us on the
                      ropes

            we dolly back with the hammer as he approaches the camera
            firing rounds at the table

            we cut to the duct taped hasidic guards tied to their chairs
            one of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the
            window fear fills both of their eyes

            we see what they see through the window the sun is quickly
            setting behind the mountains

            we cut back to the hammer the speed with which he shoots
            begins to slow

            esther checking the clock for damage calls to him 

                                esther

                      whats the matter

                                hammer
                      i dont know im feeling kind of tired

            we cut back to santa and tiny tim underneath the table we
            hear the shooting continue to slow until finally it ceases
            altogether santa and tiny tim exchange looks

                                santa
                      whats going on whyd he stop

                                tiny tim
                      maybe he ran out of ammo

                                santa
                      take a look

            tiny tim pokes his head over the table to see

            the hammer and esther lie together slumped up against the
            wall they look exhausted

            tiny tim drops back below the table


                                tiny tim
                      well hes kinda just resting in the

                      north pole and celebrate his victory with
                      his new stocking stuffer 

            santa grabs esther and attempts to pull her up the hammer
            holds on tightly to her other hand but isnt strong enough
            to resist santas might esthers hand is pulled from his
            firm grip and santa takes her into his arms

            clock and then tilt up to reveal its face

            the dial slowly spins past yom kippur passover
            hanukkah purim and then finally the macys 50 off

                      inside the building for example if you
                      were to dribble a basketball or eat
                      watermelon or use the word dawgthat

            the sound of the footsteps passes the hammer makes the
            silent military eyes gesture to mo by pointing two fingers
            at his eyes indicating for him to check and see if the coast
            is clear

            mo bends out from the corner to look pennies fall from his

            the hammer kicks open one of the doors and enters as it
            shuts behind him the camera stays in the hallway with mo
            who looks around nervously from inside the room we can hear
            intense gunfire

            the hammer exits the room

                                hammer

            mo shakes his head in understanding and the two run on
            making a hard right out of frame at the corridors end a
            beat passes and then we hear more intense gunfighting

                                                                 cut to

            tiny tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in
            the other direction

            towards the other direction to find

            two elves on multicolored mopeds comin right for him

            the hammer stands motionless as the elves gain ground

            right before they reach him the hammer quickly pulls his
            talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched
            clotheslining the two off of their mopeds 

            the elves are out cold the hammer admires his work

            santa running for his life rounds the corner he stops dead
            in his tracks as he spots the hammer

            the two look at one another for a brief moment and then
            santa points at something behind the hammer

                                santa
                      hey whats that over there is that a

            another corridor

            mo catches up to the hobbling tiny tim and begins to mock
            the manner and speed at which he runs running side by side
            with him circling around him as he attempts to get away
            etc 

            realizing that itd be impossible to outrun him tiny tim
            comes to a stop

            mo trains his pistol on him

            mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs
            off tiny tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down
            against the wall we pull away from tiny tim as he calls to
            mo

            santa enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the
            front door with anything he can find a chair a large
            crucifix a cart of tomatoes feeling confident that the door
            is secure he turns around to find the hammer standing in

                                santa
                      good point

            the hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign
            taped to a door directly behind santa it reads the room

            where the hebrew hammers girlfriend is

            the hammer grins mischievously at santa

                                hammer

            the hammer turns towards the sound

            suddenly santa kicks the hammers gun out of his hand and
            then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at
            him

                                santa
                      looks like the tables have turned once

                      weapon in the jewish arsenal

            the hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if
            in meditation santa looks around nervously

                                santa
                      what are you doing

            the hammer meditates for a bit more suddenly his eyes open
            and he begins
