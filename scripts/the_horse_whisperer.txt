	ext countryside  morning

	its perfectly still we are looking down an empty twolane 
	road covered with fresh snow we see the girls slowly riding 
	out of the woods talking they cross the road and start up 
	into the woods on the other side they are trying to sing a 
	liz phair song chopsticks

				  gracejudith
			singing
		i met him at a party and he told me how 
		he like to drive me home he said he

				  grace
			singing
		 i said it

				  judith
	 		singing
		 and i said that

				  grace
			stops singing
		no wait it just goes he said he 
		liked to do

	suddenly theres the sound of the metal of judiths horse 
	scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow judith 
	notices first

				  judith
		what was 

	the horse staggers judith looks to grace 

				  judith
		grace

	the horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet kicking 
	up sprays of snow and ice shards the horse suddenly falls on 
	the ice and goes down hard on its knees

				  grace
		judith

	the horse stumbles to get back on its feet slipping again 
	frightened it rears and judith caught off balance is 
	thrown her foot catching in the stirrup

				  judith
		graaace

	her horse unable to find its balance starts to slide backward 
	down the incline

				  grace
		pilgrim come on move

	grace directly behind judith tries to turn pilgrim to avoid 
	being hit by the errant horse

	what follows we see from graces perspective the details 
	that form the images and sounds of graces mind are fast 
	disembodies almost surreal as 

	judiths horse bulldozes into pilgrim taking his legs out 
	from under him sending both horses careening down the icy 
	slope grace hangs onto pilgrims neck judith her leg 
	helplessly tangled in the stirrup is dragged her head 
	bouncing on the frozen ground

	they slide all the way back down to the country road pilgrim 
	is the first to find his legs and stand grace manages to sit 
	up in the saddle she sees judiths horse stumbling back onto 
	its feet one of his legs broken at the ankles walking in 
	confused circles dragging judith  her face bleeding her 
	leg hanging from the stirrup

				  grace
			frightened
		jude you okay

				  judith
			softly crying
		im okay im okay

	she tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup

	grace sees it before she hears it a glint off of steel we 
	then hear the rumbling sound of a truck coming around the 
	bend the girls on their horses in the middle of the road 
	the truck an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment comes 
	around the turn grace grabs the bridle trying to get 
	judiths horse out of the road the driver seeing them lays 
	on the air horn the horses bolt at the sound the bridle 
	slipping out of graces hand

				  grace
		juude

	 the horses turn apart the driver starts furiously 
	downshifting trying to brake he seems to get it under 
	control when suddenly the truck skids on some ice it begins 
	to slide out of control the truck bed and the cab jack
	knifing the truck literally plows over the helpless judith 
	and her horse  the horse going down on the pavement judith 
	disappearing under him the trucks cab like a mythic 
	monster heads right for grace and pilgrim grace looks 
	right into the drivers helpless frightened eyes suddenly 
	pilgrim rears up at the truck sending grace flying bouncing 
	her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck

	pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck his 
	hooves caught between the rearview mirrors like some 
	grotesque ornament his head and chest slams into the window 
	shattering through the glass

	and then it is still

	the truck has stopped halfway in the road judiths horse 
	lies in the road motionless pilgrim on the trucks hood 
	his legs splayed stuck his head and chest bleeding he 
	shrieks struggling to get to his feet he manages to free 
	his legs and stepping off the cab onto the road walks off 
	wounded in pain into the sanctuary of the woods

	the driver stumbles out of the cab his head bleeding in 
	shock he sits on the ground all we hear is the sound of the 
	river and the wind in the trees

	grace halfway under the truck frozen stares up at the 
	beautiful morning sky

	we hear the sound of a helicopter

	int maclean farmhousekitchen  later morning

	angle on graces note on the refrigerator as robert enters 
	from the outside with two bags of groceries he places them on 
	the counter near the phone machine he sees one message is

	standing up to his knees in the river his chest is cut open 
	bleeding his face cut contorted and swollen liz hammond 
	the local veterinarian hides a hypodermic needle in her 
	jacket quietly walking into the water

	a policeman is going into the water downstream from pilgrim 
	whose chest is heaving blood drips into the water he 
	watches liz she is almost to him when suddenly he bolts 
	running upstream

	the policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm frightened 
	pilgrim wheels back toward liz who manages to stick the hypo 
	in his neck he rears knocking her down then runs out of 
	the river the hypo still in his neck he runs for the 
	sanctuary of the woods

	take a break and stretch her arms and neck she looks out the 
	window for the first time and sees

	a man his hands in his pockets waiting on the platform she 
	watches as the man holds out his arms to his two young 
	children who are getting off the train he picks them up as 
	his wife enters the scene kissing him and wrapping her arm 
	around his waist the children talk a mile a minute and the 
	father listens to every word

	annie doesnt even realize she is staring as they leave the 
	platform she turns back to her laptop as the train begins 
	to move again annie returns to work

	her cellular phone rings she answers

				  annie

	annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet 
	shock we can tell her mind is racing trying to process the 
	information until finally she asks

				  annie
		which leg

	the doctor and robert are surprised by the question

				  robert
		what difference does it make

	annie stares for a beat then nods apologetically

	robert nods but neither of them moves they stand motionless 
	for a beat then annie begins to break down and eases herself 
	into roberts arms

	robert embraces her kissing her head with an almost fatherly 
	comfort his expression tells us its the moment hes been 
	expecting and wanting now shell be all right in his arms 
	whatever distance between them whatever problems felt 
	insurmountable last night on the phone are now for the moment 
	 for robert  gone

	but annies expression tells us something different her 
	instinct to hold him was honest but the effect isnt the 
	same anymore something doesnt feel right something isnt 
	working anymore about his comforting embrace

				  annie
		i should go get some of her things

	int a smaller apartment kitchen  a night remembered

	a younger annie stands in a bathrobe noticeably pregnant 
	cooking at a stove  reading instructions from a propped up 
	cookbook frank sinatra is blasting as she sings along in 
	full voice without inhibitions

				  annie
		shes loves the theatre but never comes 
		late she never bothers with people she 
		hates thats why the lady is a tramp

	a younger robert wearing a suit arrives home from work seeing 
	her he smiles affectionately he puts down his briefcase and 
	bursts into his own playful sinatra impersonation

				  robert
		she loves the free

	startled annie turns around and smiles

				  robert
			sexily undoing his tie
		 fresh wind in her hair life 
		without care shes broke but 
		its ok

				  robert
			a la sinatra cool
		hows my pregnant chick

	she moves to him and they embrace he wraps his arms around

	grace slowly opens her eyes coming out of sedation she 
	takes a moment to figure out where she is to remember

	she uses her hands to hoist herself up but shes unsteady 
	and knocks into her bedside table  knocking the good luck 
	charm from india off the table it rolls under the bed with 
	a water tumbler grace never sees the charm

	grace looks where her leg once was she feels the blanket 
	the empty space where her leg once was just like her mother 
	did did her father couldnt instead of selfpity shes 
	oddly fascinated

							  dissolve to

	with gifts immediately crosses to grace on the side of her 
	good leg annie takes her position beside the lost leg

	reading

				  annie vo
		it was in america that horses first 
		roamed

	in the books we see pictures lithographs paintings and 
	drawings

				  annie vo
		a million years before the birth of 
		man they grazed the vast empty plains of 
		grass and crossed to other continents 
		over bridges of rocks they first knew 
		man as the hunted knows the hunter for 
		long before man saw horses as a means to 
		killing other beasts man killed them for 
		meat

	annies vo continues over

	int pilgrims stall  night

				  annie vo
		the alliance with man would forever 
		be fragile  for the fear hed struck 
		into their hearts was too deep to be 
		dislodged since that neolithic moment 
		when a horse was first haltered there 
		were those among men who understood 
		this

	grace sits alone in her darkened room staring out the window

	a hot dusty fairgrounds horse arena the worn wooden bleachers 
	crowded lines of cars and pickup trucks

				  annie vo
		for secrets uttered softly into 
		troubled ears these men were known as 
		the whisperers

	one particular pickup truck has its back door opened a 
	mans leg is sticking out putting on a pair of boots

	a moment later the man gets out of the car holding a cowboy 
	hat he has a certain quality a selfrespect that men who 
	know themselves seem to have tom booker

	a weathered redheaded woman named rona  late forties strong 
	wiry horsewomans build  is walking towards him

				  rona
		hey darlin

				  tom
		hey rona sorry im late

				  rona
		i wouldnt know what to do if you were 
		on time

	they walk together towards the fairgrounds

				  tom
		youre looking fit

				  rona
		fit you want to check my teeth
			tom laughs
		good crowd today i think youll have 
		some fun you going to stay for dinner

				  tom
		if its not too much trouble i thought 
		i might

				  rona
			playful
		kind of trouble im in the mood for

				  tom
		ohoh maybe i better get back in the 
		truck

	rona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena

	ext horse arena california  day

	inside the corral a small black thoroughbred is being worked 
	by tom as he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to 
	the crowd we sense this is a man of good humor and great 
	skill   guileless sensible of the earth

				  tom
		 its always kind of interesting to 
		hear the horses side of the story

	the crowd laughs warmly he directs his comments to a woman 
	wearing an expensive ralph lauren western outfit standing 
	outside the corral

				  tom
		now if he was cranky or lazy like you 
		say he is wed be seeing his tail 
		twitching there and his ears back 
		maybe but this isnt a cranky horse 
		its a scared horse you see how braced 
		he is up around the neck back there 
		he just doesnt know which way to turn

	the woman nods tom turns the horse on a dime so that he 
	always stays facing the circling thoroughbred

				  tom
		you see how he keeps pointing his 
		hindquarters in at me well id guess 
		the reason he seems reluctant to move 
		out is because when he does he gets in 
		trouble for it

				  the woman
		hes not good at transitions you know 
		when i want him to move from a trot to a 
		lope say

				  tom
			smiles
		well im sure thats what you think but 
		thats not what im seeing you may think 
		youre asking for a lope but your body 
		may be saying something else altogether 
		you might be putting too many conditions 
		on him for instance you might be saying 
		go but hey dont go too fast he can 
		tell that from the way you feel your 
		body cant lie you ever give him a kick 
		to make him move out

				  the woman
		he wont go unless i do

				  tom
		and then he goes and you feel like hes 
		going too fast so you yank him back
			she nods
		and next thing you know hes bucking
			she nods again
		well if someone told you to go stop 
		go stop  youd buck too

	the people laugh the woman smiles selfconsciously

				  tom
		its a dance see somebody has to lead 
		and somebody has to follow

	tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring dancing he 
	then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the 
	coils slap against the black horses flank making it burst 
	into a lope and again making the animal go from a trot to 
	a lope letting it slow then up to a lope again

				  tom
		i want him to get so he can leave real 
		soft hes getting the idea now hes 
		not all braced up and tense like he was 
		at the start hes finding out its okay

	he throws the rope again and this time the transition to the 
	lope is a smooth one

				  tom
		you see that hes getting better 
		already pretty soon if you work at 
		it youll be able to make all these 
		transitions easy on a loose rein
			sotto voce wry
		yeah and pigsll fly
			to woman
		hes going to be okay  so long as you 
		dont go yanking on him

	she nods but he can see shes upset feeling foolish he 
	walks the horse over to her turns off the microphone and 
	speaks sympathetically

				  tom
		look the truth is its all about self
		preservation these animals
			with great affection
		 well they just have such big hearts 
		you know theres nothing they want more 
		than to do what you want them to do but 
		when the messages get all confused the 
		only thing they know to do is try and 
		save themselves now why dont you go 
		saddle up and see what happens

	feeling better and not a little attracted to his heartfelt 
	mans man the woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb 
	over the rail her horse lets her come right up to him and 
	stroke his neck tom comments

				  tom
		they wont ever hold a thing against 
		you theyre the most forgiving 
		creatures god ever made

	turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd he says

				  tom
		okay whos next

	a young boy leads a mule into the ring tom smiles

				  tom
		now god has another idea entirely with 
		the mule

	ext the fairgrounds  later that day

				  woman
		hi im dale i just wanted to  i cant 
		get over the way he felt under me after

				  robert
		shit

	as he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin annie watches 
	robert clean the spill something about his movements his 
	posture  a sense of weakness of surrendering of not having 
	the inclination to fight of just accepting and smoothing 
	over the rough sports  strikes her hard annie realizes the 
	love she feels for robert isnt fading its gone

	he finishes cleaning and sits

				  robert
		what was i saying

				  annie
		about us going someplace warm 
		someplace gracell have to wear shorts 
		or bathing suits or summer dresses

	walking quickly blindly up past a grove of trees she comes 
	to a cemetery enclosed by a black railing at the crest of 
	the hill theres a stone monument the little bighorn

	in the growing darkness she sees scattered on the hillsides 
	below her white tombstones a place of sorrow a cool breeze 
	ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets 
	frustrated alone at a complete loss as to what to do what 
	action to take  annie for the first time in frozen 
	standing still  and with her comes a rush of emotion

	she sits with her back against the monument and begins to

		okay now okay now

	walking towards him tom raises his hand showing pilgrim a 
	sign of respect of trust he quietly makes his way along 
	pilgrims side along his flank prompting pilgrim to move 
	out from the shadows into the light tom moves to look at 
	him and pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him tom not cowed 
	stands his ground he bends looking at pilgrims withered 
	legs he looks up at his scarred head he looks into the 
	pools of the horses tortured eyes pilgrim stands still  
	allowing tom this brief intimacy

	as grace walks towards the stable she realizes that the door 
	is open and tom must be inside she is amazed

	annie appearing behind her is also impressed

	tom exits the stable and sees them as he closes the doors

				  annie
		well youre closest anyones 
		gotten

	he walks straight towards them  veering more to grace he 
	stops in front of her and they look into each others eyes  
	in a way that reminds us of how tom looked at pilgrim

	except grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy 
	she turns away and walks to the corral to lean on a post  
	as if she doesnt care tom turns to annie

				  tom
		i have to be honest i still feel 
		you made a long trip for nothing

	he looks at annie annie has no more words  just an ever
	present pleading in her face

	tom watches as grace makes a small naked movement  putting 
	her hand on her cheek like a hurt child

	he cant help but see these three being connected by one wound

				  tom
		but before i even think about it i 
		need to know something here and now 
		its a question for grace here

	grace stiffens

				  tom
		when i work with a horse its no good 
		just me doing it it doesnt work that 
		way the owner needs to be involved too

				  annie
		well thatll be a little complicated 

				  tom
		you can make it as complicated or as 
		easy as you like but shes the one 
		whos gonna be riding him am i right 
		so heres the deal im not sure i can 
		do anything but im prepared to give 
		it a go 
			to grace
		 if youll help
			grace gives a bitter laugh
		you have a problem with that

				  grace
		isnt it like obvious

				  tom
		not to me either you want to or you 
		dont

				  annie
		look ill talk to grace and call you 
		later

				  tom
		excuse me with all due respect but 
		this is her decision not yours and i 
		dont want to waste anybodys time  
		mostly mine

	grace reacts anew to toms remark she likes her mother being 
	disempowered annie keenly understands the importance of tom 
	putting it this way to grace grace has all eyes on her  
	just what she wants all waiting for her response she turns 
	away flicks her head and says

				  grace
		well theres nothing else to do around 
		here

	annie smiles in relief but tom isnt satisfied

				  tom
		not good enough i cant help you

	he starts walking away annie doesnt know what to do grace 
	mumbles

				  grace
		what do i have to do

	tom keeps walking out grace says it louder

				  grace
		i said what do i have to do

	tom stops and looks at her annie holds her breath

	int the ranch house double divide  night

	frank tom joe and tom twin boys 6 years old sit at a dining 
	table eating dinner as diane serves we parachute into the 
	middle of the conversation

	them the children are curiously confused

	int annie and graces motel room  night

	camera moves to reveal annie on the phone in front of her 
	computer and fax  plugging in extension cords as she talks

				  annie
		 the phone companys putting in extra 
		lines ill call back with the numbers 
		oh and i want you to get in touch with 
		this lady in town here  they say shes 
		sort of a physical therapist for the 
		rodeo boys but keep the one at the 
		hospital we already contacted on call

	grace sits alone in the living room watching tv but anxious 
	and disturbed about what shes committed herself to

	int double divide kitchen  continuous  night

	diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table as 
	she listens to a book of tape her hand on her forehead her 
	other hand writing tom enters to take his hat off the 
	sideboard he moves to the table and reaches over for a 
	cookie from a plate of cookies without looking up diane 
	slaps his hand tom then pours himself a cup of coffee then 
	swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie diane smiles 
	tom exits

	it is only then that diane looks up after him

	int upper floor of ranch house  night

	camera follows tom towards his bedroom   passing the others 
	perhaps we see frank sprawled out asleep already in his 
	underwear we might see the twins in their bunks one of the 
	twins lower torso is laying outside of the blanket he 
	casually flips the blanket over the kids bare feet and 
	continues to his room

	int toms bedroom  night

	tom enters and closes the door turns on a stereo which plays 
	a cello piece by yoyo ma books fills his room he sits at 
	his desk puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork 
	suddenly he stops looking over the paperwork into space a 
	thought passes by we dont know what

							fade out

	ext the ranch a corral  daybreak

	first light of day pilgrim stands stock still in the middle 
	of the corral tom motionless is crouched on his haunches 
	in the corral  watching him

	toms pov as pilgrim moves he can see that the horse is 
	stove up

	he softly tosses a handful of dirt at pilgrims withered 
	legs pilgrim sensitive to the slightest provocation 
	bucks wheeling away from him then stops tom sits on his 
	haunches again and watches him

	frank appears exiting from the barn perhaps

				  frank
		tom

				  tom
		yeah

	tom leaves pilgrim hooking up with frank  the two brothers 
	go off discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them

							  dissolve to

	head towards the ranch they see in the distance

	pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen tom stands 
	in the pen holding a rope looking at pilgrim

	ext the round pen  day

	tom stands in the pen with pilgrim he looks to see annie and 
	grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement he turns his 
	focus back to pilgrim

	annie and grace appear grace takes a position that is to 
	become her regular spot a distance away from the pen annie 
	moves in closer beside smokey a ranch hand with one leg 
	up on the pen fence

				  smokey
		howdy
			sees grace
		howdy

	he and annie watch as tom stands before pilgrim  turning 
	sideways then standing

				   annie
		whats he doing

				   smokey
		trying to get his eye

				  annie
		hows it going

	smokey doesnt respond  how its going is exactly how it 
	looks tom takes a few steps stops and stands still again we 
	sense the process is long and requires great patience

							  dissolve to

	ext round pen  day

	two hours later grace is in the same spot smokey is gone 
	doing his work annie has taken a different position looking 
	over several pages of faxes on her lap

	tom is still standing in the pen trying to get pilgrims eyes

	joe has joined the proceedings sitting on the pen rail

	tom deftly throws a hoolihan gently lassoing pilgrim around 
	the neck and pilgrim at the touch of the rope crazed 
	resists pulling back striking at the rope the rope 
	cutting into toms hands tom gives him some slack giving 
	his head letting him relax then gently heads him by the 
	rope walking him around the pen getting his feet to moving

	graces eyes never leave tom

							  dissolve to

	ext double divide  day

	tom off in the distance  against a sky that seems to be 
	touching the land  is riding along a creek closer up we 
	see hes rustling the bushes with a stick some stray cows 
	run out of the bushes tom races after them his horse 
	shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside

	at the top of the hill with the ranch spread out endlessly 
	before him tom sees frank on his horse chasing strays tom 
	whistles frank waves back in the near distance a pickup 
	truck is parked on the range

	joe and the twins are throwing food pellets out of the back 
	of the truck cattle come from across the range for the food 
	what begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens then 
	hundreds  the truck virtually disappearing among them

	tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch far off in 
	the distance he sees annies suburban coming along the road 
	to the ranch he watches as annies distant figure gets out 
	of the car with grace annie instinctively turns and looks 
	across the land even though there is such a distance 
	theres a sense tom and annie are looking at each other

	tom senses joe driving franks truck slowly moving off the 
	range  the twins in the back the cattle following tom sits 
	on his horse atop the hill

	ext the double divide  another day

	pilgrim his scarred head above water legs moving in odd 
	sycopation swimming we discover he is in a pond tethered 
	to a pole except for the sound of his legs in the water 
	everything is quiet and focused on pilgrim

	smokey holds the pole walking on the outside of the pond 
	leading pilgrim back and forth as he swims tom crouched by 
	the pond silently concentrating on pilgrim

	grace watches off by herself annie stands beside joe she 
	cant help but be intrigued by the sight she asks joe

				  annie
		i though horses were afraid of 
		water

	joe doesnt answer her grace likes that annie frustrated 
	feels she has the right to simple shout out to tom

				  annie
		is that to get his strength back

	tom pays her no mind  concentrating on pilgrim

	suddenly annies cell phone rings jarring the proceedings 
	tom turns to annie she hides her embarrassment by answering 
	it walking away tom gives her a look grace is loving this 
	tom turns back to pilgrim after a few moments 

	tom taking the rope tether unhooks it from the pole he 
	starts to lead pilgrim out of the water pilgrim fearful 
	fights him he rears splashing tom not wanting to come out 
	of the water grace is worried she looks to joe and sees he 
	is concerned too though he stands quietly

	annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes 
	her call to return to the pond

	tom enters the pond waist deep in water trying to grab 
	pilgrims rope pilgrim rises up rearing at him joe and 
	smokey sensing danger come closer to the pond annie 
	appears beside grace and watches as tom reaches for the rope 
	again pilgrim rears again tom stumbles backwards from his 
	hooves annie gasps grace turns to walk away from the pond 
	she cant watch  it brings back too much but as she does 
	she is stopped by the sight of 

	tom righting himself unphased calmly walks back to pilgrim 
	the horse baffled by this mans lack of fear lets him take 
	the rope and walk him out of the pond

	grace cant help but be impressed joe nods annie is shaken

				annie
		mr booker im not at all comfortable 
		with you taking those kinds of chances

	as tom leads pilgrim out the horse suddenly whirls bolting 
	knocking tom down

				  annie
		oh god

	pilgrim runs off pulling the wet rope behind him joe runs 
	over and grabs for the rope

				  tom
		no let him go

	joe obeys pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill 
	out onto a pasture he keeps on running into the distance 
	running across the pasture not knowing where he is going

	tom arms folded across his chest watches him run a 
	concerned annie approaches

				  annie
		shes running away how are you going 
		to get him back

	tom doesnt respond he walks off down the hill out onto the 
	pasture stops arms folded and watches pilgrim annie turns 
	when she hears smokey who appears behind her

				  smokey
		he dont really want to run dont 
		know where hes going all this open 
		space scares the daylight out of him

	confused pilgrim stops running and walks in no particular 
	direction

				  smokey
		my guess is hes spent his life in a 
		sixbyeight stall hes forgot what 
		its like to be a horse

	smokey ambles off and she turns back to see tom crouching on 
	his haunches sitting in the grass just waiting pilgrim 
	walks back towards the ranch stops a distance from tom 
	looks at him annie needing to know exactly whats going 
	on crosses down the hill to him

				  annie
		so what now should we leave

	tom continues watching pilgrim annie looks at him sitting 
	there motionless and feels like an idiot clearly she doesnt 
	understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the 
	time to explain to her

				  annie
		well were going to go then

	without looking at her tom just nods annie awkwardly 
	walks back up the hill to where grace is

	on the grassy hillside grace is watching the scene by herself 
	as joe appears staring at her leg it makes her uncomfortable 
	she turns to him with a curt impatient tone

				  grace
		what

	their eyes meet joe is so guileless grace is taken off guard 
	when he asks in such a compassionate voice

				  joe
		does that hurt you

	grace tries to think of an answer  and of how to say it

				  grace
		only when i kick somebody

	her gentle delivery makes him smile she smiles then

				  grace
		dont you go to school

				  joe
		twice a month they give you a day off 
		to work on the ranch

	he tips his hat down as he looks out to pilgrim with respect

				  joe
		look at him out in the pasture  yeah 
		he mustve been a big beautiful looking 
		horse how was he to ride

	grace is uncomfortable again she looks away just struggling 
	joe senses shes done talking

				  joe
		excuse me i got chores to look after

	he tips his hat and walks off passing annie as she arrives

				  annie
		you ready to go

	grace hesitates then mother and daughter take one more look 

	pov  pilgrim standing in the pasture with tom crouching in 
	the grass waiting for him

	tom is still sitting in the grass just where we left him  
	waiting patiently pilgrim is still out in the pasture

							  dissolve to

	afternoon shadows cross the ranch tom is in the exact same 
	spot and position pilgrim is somewhat closer  but still at 
	a distance  watching him

	frank rides back from work as he passes tom the two nod as 
	if nothing usually is going on frank rides up to the barn

	int petersons motel 

	grace is flicking the television  repeating the only three 
	channels over and over

	annie works at her computer surrounded by work she notices 
	the time gets a thought and dials the phone

				  annie
		hello mr booker oh hello frank 
		this is annie maclean i was 
		wondering has
			listens
		uhhuh and pilgrim
			listens
		still uhhuh
			politely cheery
		okay then thank you

	she hangs up pauses then speaks to the window out loud enough 
	for grace to hear 

				  annie
		hes still sitting in that damn 
		field

				  grace
			wo looking at her
		i think they call it a pasture

	annie looks at her as if to say the last thing i need to know is 
	a lesson on the local lingo

				  annie
		lets go see whats going on then 
		get something to eat

	ext double divide ranch  dusk

	the sky is changing colors the temperature has dropped tom 
	is still sitting in the grass although someone has brought 
	him a blanket for his shoulders pilgrim is in the pasture 
	but now  he too is motionless looking back at tom

	the sound of a car makes tom turn to see annie driving up 
	she gets out stands by the car with a proprietary air 
	watching tom and pilgrim grace remains in the car theres a 
	sound she turns to see diane coming out of the house

				  diane
		theres coffee inside i was just 
		bringing this to tom

				  annie
		would you mind if i did id like to 
		talk to him

	diane knowing full well tom aint in a talking mood hands 
	her a cup

				  diane
		sure
			seeing grace in car
		does your daughter want to come 
		inside

				  annie
		uh no were going to dinner is 
		this the way to the pasture

				  diane
		pasture oh that stretch of field near 
		the hill yeah

	shes gone annie grimaces then crosses the hillside to 
	where tom is squatting down she appears to his side and 
	without speaking tries to indicates she has his coffee by 
	leaning it toward him tom sees her and accepts it with a 
	grateful nod annie waits nothing happens feeling foolish 
	she begins to walk back

	at some point she turns to see pilgrim moving across the 
	pasture toward tom he stops in front of him just a few feet 
	away tom says something to him annie is intrigued  and she 
	knows enough to stay quiet now she watches pilgrim walk over 
	to him she watches as tom gets up and pats pilgrims scarred 
	head in spite of herself annie is somewhat moved by this act

	only we see grace peering out from the car seeing this act 
	of communion as well only we see her reaction to it

	as tom turns and walks back to the ranch pilgrim follows him 
	as he passes annie all he says is

				  tom
		from now on leave your phone 
		somewhere else

	as he moves past her annie responds

				  annie
		but i have business calls i have 
		to 

	tom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests without turning 
	back

				  tom
		then drop off grace in the morning 
		go on back and do your business 
		come pick her up around dinner

	standing there annie has the impulse to respond to this 
	suggestion but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldnt 
	make much sense since tom is already out of ear shot

	diane appears from the house and calls out

				  diane
		mrs maclean  why dont you and 
		daughter stay for dinner

				  annie
		oh uh thank you no we dont want to 
		impose

				  diane
		no imposition plenty of food gonna 
		get pretty dark soon hard to find a 
		place

	annie looks up to the alien sky and realizes shes right she 
	looks to grace who doesnt seem to oppose the idea

	int ranch housekitchen  night

	everyone sits around the kitchen table joe still wearing 
	his hat eyes annie and grace with acute curiosity

				  diane
		joe take off the hat  im not 
		going to say it again

	joe obeys diane puts the last of the serving plates on the 
	table  pork chops potatoes gravy peas bread and a big 
	bowl of mixed salad the boy cant help eyeing how the 
	vegetarians will act

	annie and grace eye the food annie reaches out for a serving 
	ladle picking up graces plate to serve her as grace reaches 
	for a piece of bread when

				  frank
		dear lord we are humbly thankful 
		for

	annie and grace freeze as frank continues his prayer  they 
	notice everyones head bowed slightly

				  frank
			continues
		these gifts for the blessings on our 
		home our family and our guests bless 
		those that arent as fortunate bless 
		all gods creatures

				  everyone
		amen

	everyone begins eating annie and grace breath a sigh of relief 
	silence utensils hitting plates the only sound

				  frank
		bank out us a couple more men to run 
		the cattle

				  tom
		we should be fine then

	beat annie and grace listen

				  joe
		teacher asked me why we raise black 
		angusherefords stead of pure herefords

		tell her they suit the weather better 
		their udders are black stead of pink

				  tom
		they dont get burned by the sun bouncing 
		off the snow and theyre good mother

				  frank
		our daddy raised pure herefords

	silence eating annie tries her hand at conversation

				  annie
		you know thats interesting i always 
		wondered when i went into a restaurant 
		what was the difference between a regular 
		steak or a black angus steak i couldnt 
		taste any difference although i could 
		swear one was more tender i didnt know 
		there was that big a difference between 
		cows
			silence
		ive never been on a cow farm before i 
		must say the bulls seem to have the 
		best time of it just laying around the 
		fields all day until theyre asked to
			uncomfortable
		do their work

				  frank
		well get born a bull got a ninety 
		percent chance of getting castrated and 
		served up as hamburger on a balance i 
		reckon id choose being a cow
			to grace
		would you mind passing that salad 
		young lady

				  diane
		hows petersons holding up for you

		always hold my breath until i can see 
		the motel

				  frank
			innocently
		you know tom while youre working on 
		that horse of theirs annie and grace 
		should move into the old creek house

	diane and tom react accordingly diane hiding her annoyance 
	tom hiding his surprise and pleasure

				  frank
		nobodys using it silly for her to be 
		driving back and forth when she dont 
		know her way around that well

				  annie
		oh i dont know

	grace looks at her disapprovingly as she passes to go to the 
	bathroom annie registers this

	int ranch house  late day

	diane is washing windows while listening to an audio book on 
	her tape player through the windows she sees

	joe and the twins helping annie and grace move into the creek 
	house

	diane has conflicting feelings about this she continues her 
	work

	int creek house  late day

	various shots of annie connecting herself back to the rest of 
	the world by plugging in her computer fax etc

	grace is in the other room as she was in the motel alone 
	with no television she is just listening to her music laying 
	on the couch the two women remain separate no matter where 
	they are

	but we see a small difference grace rises and walks to the 
	window she looks out

	pov she sees people working about the ranch maybe joe is 
	among them  riding his horse as he works or maybe its 
	just a vision of people with tasks to complete  who do so 
	with pride discipline and clarity

	grace looks out the window longingly

	ext the ranch  another day

	a cloud of dust a dozen or so horses are running in an arena 
	by the stables tom is riding among them holding a long stick 
	with an orange flag at the end of it waving it at the young 
	horses making them run away from him the colts stay close 
	together one of the horses pilgrim stays at a distance off 
	to himself

	grace watches from along the railing she alternates her 
	attention from the horses to tom

				  tom
		 what were doing here grace is 
		 trying to get him to learn how to 
		 be a horse again

	he cracks the flag the horses move together

		  	 	  tom
		the others already know see thats 
		how they are in the wild  herd 
		animals
			cracks the flag
		when theyve got a problem like 
		they have now with me and this flag 
		they look to each other but old 
		pilgrim there has forgotten im the 
		rock and theyre the hard place he 
		thinks he hasnt got a friend in the 
		whole wild world

	cu on grace who clearly feels the same way but wants 
	desperately not to she watches him ride off towards pilgrim 
	who has stopped like all the others at the far end of the 
	ring he stands by himself tossing his head snorting not 
	wanting to be around other horses tom cracks the flag 
	keeping them moving pilgrim does his own private dance

	tom rides by grace and hands her the stick

				  tom
		hold this for a minute

	grace stiffens she doesnt want to but shes afraid to say 
	no to tom he just insists by tossing it to her

				  tom
		hold onto it go on

	shes forced to catch it he turns and rides away chasing 
	down pilgrim trying to edge him toward the herd for a 
	moment he has him breaking to the left with the horses but 
	as soon as hes clear of tom he separates himself and comes 
	to stop on his own

	tom rides back to grace taking back the flag

				  tom
		well get there grace

	as he says this he flashes a small reassuring smile and a 
	little wink grace melts just a little as he rides away

	annie appears having come from the creek house she calls

				  annie
		grace the clinic just called 
		they had to change your physical 
		therapy appointment we have to 
		leave now

	grace frowns a little  her mothers perfect timing annie 
	approaches the arena watching tom riding as he passes her

				  tom
		hello annie

	annie notices how he says her name

				  annie
		mr booker

	he flashes a smile in her direction and annies expression 
	comically matches her daughters reaction she quickly covers 
	it however her eyes follow him as he glides around the 
	arena its like watching a great ballet  his control of the 
	horses his effortlessness his grace his strength she 
	smiles to herself in appreciation then catches herself

				  annie
			to grace
		you got everything you need

				  grace
		if i had everything i need i wouldnt 
		be going to physical therapy

	tom approaches as he overhears grace respond

				  annie
			  trying to cheer her

		way

				  tom
		as long as you dont get in the way of 
		the branding iron it doesnt matter too 
		much

	annie smiles she turns to grace questioningly grace says 
	matteroffactly to prove her point

				  grace
		i watched margo neuberger get a 
		tattoo

	tom squints annie shrugs and nods

				  annie
		okay

	as grace and annie walk to the car tom says

				  tom
		hey grace  maybe we can get your 
		mom to put me and you branding on the 
		cover of her magazine start a whole 
		new fashion craze

	they continue walking as grace smiles enjoying being singled 
	out for his joke annie responds almost flirtatiously

				  annie
		try not to fall off your high horse 
		mr booker

	tom tips his hat and rides away annie smiles and nods 
	grace doesnt like their sudden familiarity or her mothers 
	coy manner as they enter the suburban grace asks point blank

				  grace
		did you call dad today

	annie is caught off guard

	tom riding in the arena catches himself looking after them 
	then goes riding after pilgrim

	ext double divide  day

	the air smells of scorched flesh there is nothing but noise 
	calves separated from their mothers cry they are moved 
	out through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute 
	and then one by one into a holding pen theyre clamped and 
	lowered sideways onto a table and given a shot a yellow 
	insect tag in one ear branded then sent back to their 
	mothers the bulls in a pen by themselves stand haughty 
	paying no attention frank helps doctor the calves joe 
	brands

	annie and grace are standing by the railing watching with a 
	mixture of fascination and disgust

	tom moves in the feeder pen waist deep in calves moving them 
	through the chute he looks to annie

				  tom
		hey over there you want to make 
		yourself useful

	it isnt a question

				  tom
		hank i got you a volunteer

	annie and grace realize they have no choice

	 what follows is a sequence of scenes showing annie and 
	grace participating in the branding and how they gradually 
	come to lose themselves in the experience

	sequences will include

	 hank a ranch head helping annie into the chute annie 
	getting kicked by a calf

	 grace being shown how to hold the branding iron

	 hank teaching annie how to say hyah

	 tom in the holding pen with his arms around grace showing 
	her how to apply the brand grace a little frightened of the 
	brand is in heaven in toms arms

	 annie is still trying to say hyah with the proper force 
	she claps her hands pushing the calves along knee deep in 
	cow shit

	 grace closes her eyes and the iron touches the calfs hide

				  tom
		thats good firm but gentle
			grace opens her eyes
		it hurts but hell get over it

	grace smiles proudly

				  tom
		you handled that pretty well think 
		its time you earn your keep around 
		here so when were not working 
		and when you dont have your therapy 
		id like you to help out with the 
		horses rubbing them cleaning up 
		the stalls you think you can 
		handle that

	grace knows him well enough to know

				  grace
		thats not a question is it

				  tom
		youre catching on

	grace smiles

	 annie turns and not looking where shes doing trips over 
	a calf falling down and calves coming down the chute 
	start to run towards her suddenly tom grabs her by the leg 
	and pulls her to safety he helps her up and dusts her off

				  tom
			not wanting to smile 
			 but
		you okay

				  annie
		it is cocktail hour yet

	tom laughs she takes a big breath

	ext the ranch  late afternoon

	the ranch is colored in amber light

	near the house two long tables pushed together to make one 
	long one a gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth everyone 
	is seated for a meal we hear laughter and conversation we 
	parachute into the middle of the moments

	 hank helping with his wife get to their three children to 
	sit still for dinner

	 diane organizing the women and their various plates of side 
	dishes

	 the ranch hand piling up their plates and kidding each 
	other

	 joe is instructing grace on the various sauces for the 
	ribs the twins are making fun of him behind his back

	 tom and smokey are barbecuing the last one to sit

	 frank assists his frail mother ellen booker at the table 
	filling her plate with all the things she cant reach for

							  dissolve to

	the faces are beautiful laughing eating everyone is tanned 
	and exhausted after a long day but filled with life and 
	eager to live it the tables are covered with heavy food 
	the communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual 
	as the branding itself

	annie and grace look different to us tanned from the sun 
	their bodies sore  they feel softened yet more vital as if 
	the artifice had been worn off the armor of urban life as 
	the table thrives with conversations we focus on

	annie and ellen booker annie looks calmer than weve seen 
	her  and more naturally beautiful she is seated beside 
	ellen booker we sense they have been talking for a while 
	annie is so sincerely interested in listening to her shes 
	hardly touched her own plate

				  ellen booker
		 he was a blacksmith by trade my 
		father my grandson joe was named 
		for him but he always dreamed of 
		having his own place and raising 
		horses

	we see tom a few places down and across from annie and his 
	mother  but fully aware of their conversation

				  ellen booker
		hed heard of some land whats 
		stockett now rode out there got off 
		his horse and walked about as far as 
		he could in one way then he walked as 
		far as he could another way and 
		another until he got back to where he 
		started and thats where he put his 
		roots down thats where my husband 
		and i ranched and raised frank and 
		tommy

	she motions proudly to tom who looks up annie smiles to him 
	he looks to her with gratitude for the respect shes showing 
	his mother

				  ellen booker
		quite a different life from what you 
		know i expect which place to you 
		call home

				  annie
		well i was born in london but my 
		father was an ambassador and we 
		moved constantly ive lived in a lot 
		of places but i dont really know what 
		id call home

	tom listens to this

				  ellen booker
		an ambassador my thats very 
		important

				  annie
		he was a wonderful man

	she looks to tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her 
	eyes

				  diane
			to grace
		i sure hope youre gonna eat more 
		than that young lady youre a 
		growing girl

				  grace
		ive never eaten this much in my 
		life

				  diane
		probably never worked so hard 
		neither those arms of yours are 
		gonna be pretty sore tomorrow ill 
		give you a little bit of ointment i 
		make its a magic recipe my mama 
		gave me

				  frank
		we used to call dianes mother 
		medicine woman none of us never went 
		to the doctor when she was alive

	annie and grace listen in

				  hank
		too bad she wasnt here for old 
		henry vanoker

				  frank
		not much would have helped him

				  diane
		i never got that whole story what 
		happened

				  hank
		old henry was changing a flat tire on 
		his truck over on 118 when that
			laughs
		 twohundredyearold jack he has 
		gives way and the side of that truck 
		come slamming down on that rock he 
		calls head

	theres laughter  everyone knows old henry except

				  annie
		what happened

				  hank
		knocked him out for a while he woke 
		up finished putting on the tire and 
		drove himself to the hospital

				  diane
		old fool darling pass down those peas 
		for me thank you

	annie and grace dont know how to respond but everyone else 
	takes it their stride as they continue eating

	grace notices joe is whispering something to frank who nods 
	his head and speaks to the table

				  frank
		huh joe here has something to say

	joe stands somewhat formally with his hat on

				  joe
		i wrote this for you grandma

	mrs booker and diane beam annie and grace dont know what 
	to expect joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem 
	from memory

	at first annie and grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy 
	but soon they cant help but be won over by his guilessness 
	he finishes and everyone applauds hanks wife asks

				  hanks wife
		that was lovely who wrote that 
		joe

				  joe
		i wrote it myself maam

				  frank
		now son you tell em when it came 
		from

				  joe
		be honest i cant say i did it all 
		myself my grandma helped me get the 
		words right

	oooos and aahs and smiles and conversations erupting over 
	each other

	only we see grace looking over to joe who gives her kickass 
	shy grin

				  tom
			raising his beer
		well id like to welcome annie and 
		grace to their first branding

				  frank
		and next time miss annie you can run 
		down the calves

				  annie
		ill drink to that

	everyone toasts and drinks annie and tom exchange a look 
	she smiles but not in a alluring way  rather in a grateful 
	way grateful for this brief moment of community and good 
	feeling and somehow tom knows what shes feeling

	no one notices this silent exchange  except for diane who 
	sees everything thats going on

	int ranch house dining room  nightfall

	the women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the 
	tables through the house and into the kitchen annie is among 
	them feeling apart of the group she enters carrying a large 
	bowl that held the corn

	diane is replacing newlycleaned forks and knives in her 
	dining room drawers above which are several family pictures

				  annie
			referring to clean bowl
		where does this go diane

				  diane
		oh you can just set up on the dining 
		table i have to rearrange my shelves 
		tomorrow

	annie complies she notices the framed pictures on the wall in 
	the dining room

				  annie
		is this mr booker toms 
		grandfather

	diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800s

				  diane
		mmmm i never knew him he died 
		before frank and i met this heres
			another photo
		frank and toms mother and father 
		theres little frank and tom

				  annie
		she calls him tommy

				  diane
		always did i think she favored him a 
		little you tend to when you have more 
		than one even though you love em all 
		the same

	she studies the old faces of toms parents  although 20th 
	century people there is still a pioneering strength in their 
	visage a stoicism and power

				  diane
			putting away forks
		ha she loves telling this story about 
		how when he was two years old he ran off 
		they found him in the barn sleeping 
		between two giant hooves of a percheron 
		stallion she said that horse was 
		protecting him and nobody could convince 
		her otherwise

				  annie
		i got a little confused though the ranch 
		ellen was talking about  thats not this 
		one

	diane is sorting silverware throughout the following

				  diane
		no see frank and tom were raised near 
		the clarks fork river right between the 
		pryor and beartooth mountains beautiful 
		piece of land but they had this uncle 
		ned  useless man never interested in 
		ranching and when the grandparents died 
		he left for the city and sent word 
		through lawyers he wanted his claim to 
		the land so he could sell it three years 
		of legation broke their father frank took 
		it all in stride but tom tom loved that 
		land i dont think he ever got over it  
		his home being sold out from under him 
		seeing his father like that once he and 
		frank got their folks set up in a new 
		place tom left went off we didnt see 
		him for years

	annie is intrigued by what shes learning about tom 
	something outside the window catches her eyes she watches

	pov
	
	tom and frank on either side to ellen are escorting her to 
	a car that will drive her home

	ext ranch house  night

	annie wanders out passing grace and joe on her way out the two 
	are sitting in a glider as annie exits oc we hear them

				  grace
		why do you always wear that hat

				  joe
		because it fits my head you want to 
		try it on

	grace doesnt know if she should

	annie continues towards tom whos sitting in a rocker playing 
	with the twins

				  twins
		show us again come on one more time 
		its my turn now

				  tom
		all right al right hold out your 
		finger

	annie takes a seat nearby and watches as tom holds out the 
	first finger of his right hand the twins holds out his tom 
	splits his focus between annie and the twins as he takes a 
	small piece of rope out of his back pocket he ties the ends 
	together making a loop he puts the loop over the twins 
	finger and holding the other end of the loop taut with his 
	left hand he draws one side of the cord over the other with 
	the middle finger of his right hand then he rolls his hand 
	over so its under the loop and back over it again so that 
	his finger is tip to tip with the twins the loop seemingly 
	knotted around their touching fingertips and can only be 
	removed if their touch is broken

				  tom
		the loops knotted right
			twins nod
		looks like the only way to take it 
		off is if we break our touch
			they nod
		watch now

	annie and the twins look down at the touching fingers as tom 
	gently pulls the rope away revealing they are still knotted 
	and without even breaking their touch

				  twins
		again again one more time

				  tom
		oh no no no i only fall for that 
		once go inside now before your mother 
		starts hunting you down go on

	the twins exit annie and tom make eye contact

				  tom
			smiles relaxes back
		so how was your first and last day of 
		branding

				  annie
		dont be so sure its my last there 
		are a few people back home id like 
		to put under a red hot iron

	tom looks at her with a sly expression and notices shes 
	shivering

				  tom
		you got too much sun today 
		here

	he takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders

				  annie
		thank you

	he sits back down annie crosses her arms over her chest 
	looks around unconsciously swinging her foot tom watches 
	her leg annie notices him watching

				  annie
		what

				  tom
		you ever just stand still for a 
		minute

				  annie
		you stand still too long in new york 
		you get hit by a bicycle messenger
			smiles wryly
		you know sometimes i get the feeling 
		mr booker that youre laughing at me 
		why is that

	tom shrugs annie waits a beat then

				  annie
		thats your cue to say youre not 
		laughing at me

				  tom
		oh i see you write both sides of the 
		conversation

				  annie
		its a mans world mr booker most 
		women have to

				  tom
		well maybe i am laughing a bit i 
		just thought as long as youre here 
		it would be nice for you to relax into 
		the place a little

				  annie
			understanding
		well its beautiful country ill give 
		you that and i could see having some 
		kind of vacation place retreat but i 
		dont know how you do it full time dont 
		you miss the rest of the world

				  tom
		whats that to miss

				  annie
		ha if youve never lived in a city 
		with museums theater music restaurants 
		uh god a million things then its 
		something i cant explain

				  tom
			thinks teasing a bit
		does chicago count

				  annie
			surprised
		you lived in chicago

				  tom
		when i was first married

				  annie
			stunned
		you were married to a woman in 
		chicago

	tom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable 
	cowboy he smiles

				  tom
		i once heard itzhak perlman guest star 
		with the chicago symphony orchestra 
		he played rachmaninovs vocalize opus 34 
		no 14 it was one of the most beautiful 
		pieces of music i ever heard i actually 
		forgot where i was for a time
			annie is floored
		you seem surprised

				  annie
			not wanting to insult
		well i uh you didnt

				  tom
		just whos been laughing at who here

	tom says this with a wry smile annie returns with a smile  
	as an understanding is reached between them theyve both 
	stereotyped the other they are both pleased  and attracted  
	by what they dont know

	int creek house  night

	grace is fast asleep exhausted she does not stir when the 
	phone rings

	annie picks up from her own bed awakened still dressed in 
	her branding clothes having just passed out on the bed

				  annie
		hello

	int central park went apartment  night

	intercut robert alone in the vast apartment

				  robert
		i thought you guys were going to call 
		me

				  annie
		oh robert im sorry we were so tired 
		from the branding grace barely made it 
		to her bed and i didnt have the energy 
		to take my clothes off

				  robert
		oh well branding will do that to you

				  annie
		everything all right

				  robert
		huhhuh you

				  annie
		fine actually today was a good day 
		you should have seen her

				  robert
		i wish i did

	the sound of selfpity was so obvious for both of them so 
	robert quickly regroups resorting to something he knows is 
	important to her

				  robert
		well uh the real reason i called 
		actually was to tell you i saw lucy 
		at jojos tonight and she seems very 
		worried

				  annie
		about what

				  robert
		apparently gottschalks been seen around 
		town lunching with some very prominent 
		magazine editors lucy said she tried to 
		call you but no one answered so she faxed 
		you the list of names she said one of 
		them have contracts up fairly soon

				  annie
		oh i didnt look at my faxes today we 
		left before sunrise

				  robert
		honey i hope youre not endangering 
		your position listen if you need to 
		come back and you want me to come take 
		over for a while ill work it out i 
		mean the firms got other lawyers but 
		the magazines got only one of you

	after a day of hard work and simple pleasures annie begins to 
	succumb to old anxieties and pressures

	int creek house  night

	annie is awake reading the faxes lucy sent one after other 
	as she flips through them one falls to the floor near the bed

	she gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something 
	under the bed an old battered cello case she pulls it out 
	to find the initials rb carved on the top she opens it to 
	find papers receipts bills  all from toms married life

	ext the double divide  early morning

	tom rides a young colt along the creek he hears footsteps 
	he turns and sees annie running along the creek on the other 
	side he stops to watch when his horse snorts annie looks 
	up to see him she stops he tips his hat to her

				  annie
		ive decided its impossible to 
		properly say hello in this place 
		without a hat

				  tom
		a jogger huh

				  annie
		i dont jog mr booker i run

				  tom
		lucky for you the grizzlies around 
		here only go for joggers

				  annie
		if i can survive rush hour i figure i 
		can handle grizzlies

				  tom
			smiles
		you sleeping all right in that house

				  annie
		i dont sleep all right anywhere but 
		the house is fine

	tom walks his horse across the creek to her comfortable in 
	the silence annie moves about uncomfortable in the waiting

				  annie
		whos rb

	tom is finding annies blunt curiosity more endearing

				  annie
		i found this old cello case filled with 
		bills and receipts

				  tom
		sorry about that i thought everything 
		got cleared out rb is my wife 
		exwife rachel we used to live in 
		that house 
		together

				  annie
		i thought you lived in chicago

				  tom
		i thought you were an editor not a 
		reporter

	annie smiles and nods realizing shes asking too many questions 
	she tries to casually reach out to touch the horses head but 
	its too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away taking a 
	couple of steps back annie is embarrassed

				  annie
		i have a way with animals

				  tom
		its all right hes young just hold 
		out your hand a little lower so he can 
		get the smell of you

				  annie
		oh yes i forgot

	she does and the horse sniffs at her hand

				  annie
		hes beautiful

				  tom
		why dont you ride anymore grace told 
		me you used to ride when she was 
		younger

				  annie
		she did

	annie is somewhat moved by her daughter telling him that

				  annie
		i dont know really no time mostly

	a cold wind blows she folds her arms across her breasts

				  annie
		i thought it was supposed to be spring

	tom cant help but notice her nipples are hard from the cold 
	he looks away she laughs

				  annie
		are you shy mr booker

				  tom
		just polite well maybe youd like 
		to try riding again some time before 
		you go home

	annie is struck by the words before you go home tom ambles 
	off on his horse

				  tom
		enjoy the day

				  annie
		you too

	annie steps across the rocks at the ford crossing the creek 
	her foot slips one of her shoes goes into the water

				  annie
		shit

				  tom
		need a lift

				  annie
		i can handle it

	she crosses the creek she turns giving him a small wave he 
	touches his hat she runs off tom watches her go head down 
	concentrating

	int creek house  day

	a tense annie is having a difficult phone with david gottschalk

				  annie
		 david weve been behind a day or 
		two before but lucy just fedexed me all 
		the material and itll be approved by 
		the end of the day

		go down if the phone lines are opened

		streets by the skin of its ass annie

	during davids lines diane has entered carrying fresh towels 
	 she crosses into the bathroom

				  annie
		oh come on this is such bullshit the 
		work is getting done david lucky keeps 
		me on top of everything

				  david gottschalk vo
		lucy isnt you were losing something 
		without you being here now i know this 
		is a rough time for you but i think we 
		should make another arrangement

	without annies awareness diane reenters and takes her time 
	leaving so she can take in all of annies things her 
	business office books etc

				  annie
		what the hell does that mean how much 
		more do i have to do to prove how 
		important this magazine is to me

				  david gottschalk vo
		if this magazine is so important to you 
		annie why are you in montana

	diane cant help but notice a slight vulnerability in annie

				  david gottschalk vo
		look this is what were going to do 
		finish up this issue ill set up a 
		conference call in a few weeks just 
		you me and your lawyer and well 
		just work this out so that everyone

	cool its not the moment

				  annie

	he hangs up annie forces a smile to diane

		oh you know david mr strong arm

	diane feels out of place and exits annie doesnt notice 
	until she hears the door close she pushes back her hair and 
	takes a deep breath she looks out through the side window 
	and sees

	grace and joe doing chores grace looks involved and not at 
	all selfconscious a moment of gratitude and calm for annie

	ext the double divide  day

	pilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena he 
	runs to the far end and abruptly stops tom is holding the 
	orange flagstick and coiled rope coming through a gate 
	into the arena crossing to the middle of the ring something 
	in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over

	pilgrim and tom stand there motionless eyeing each other 
	pilgrim snorts and takes a few small steps backward tom 
	takes a beat then starts slowly towards pilgrim lifting the 
	flag and cracking it at the sound pilgrim whirls away from 
	him and runs around the arena he starts to slow looking at 
	tom again tom cracks the flag and pilgrim runs round and 
	round the arena like a ringmaster tom keeps pilgrim 
	moving cracking the flag

	something about toms demeanor tells us it isnt going well

	ext the ranch  day

	tom carrying a saddle comes around the side of the barn 
	through the slats he sees grace working in the barn 
	watering a horse she has stopped and is looking through the 
	cracks of pilgrims stall at him she turns and sees tom 
	through the slats she goes back to work as tom comes to the 
	barn door

		little while just keep going till 
		you run out of road

				  grace
			afraid
		i dont know if i can

				  tom
		not a question of if you can  you 
		are just keep your eyes on the road 
		and your foot on the pedal and the 
		rest will take care of yourself

	folding his arms over his chest shutting his eyes tom 
	relaxes back grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and 
	her eyes straight ahead

	ext double divide  day

	the truck is parked at the foot of a mountain grace very 
	pleased with herself sits beside tom on the cabs roof 
	looking around them at the great montana after a beat

				  tom
		where did you get pilgrim from

				  grace
		we bought him in kentucky my mother 
		and i took a trip down there to see 
		him

				  tom
		that must have been pretty special

	grace nods it is a pleasant memory he motions for her to be 
	quiet an old elk with a prodigious rack of antlers has come 
	down out of the mountains seeing them he stops in his 
	tracks dead still they watch each other then the elk turns 
	and runs back up into the mountains tom smiles at grace who 
	smiles back  partly because of the elk partly because shes 
	alone with tom

				  grace
		are you afraid of anything

				  tom
			thinks
		getting old not being of much use 
		i guess
			beat
		what went on out there grace with 
		pilgrim

	grace doesnt say anything tom nods then

				  tom
		you see grace ive got a problem 
		when im working with a horse i like 
		to know its history now most times 
		the horse can tell you pretty much the 
		whole story but sometimes he can be 
		so messed up in his head that you need 
		more to go on you need to know exactly 
		what went wrong often times its the 
		obvious thing but something that went 
		wrong just before that maybe even some 
		little thing

	grace is quiet she doesnt want to think about that

				  tom
		its like if im driving and run into 
		a tree when somebody asks me well 
		what happened i dont say well 
		i plowed into a tree id say the 
		sun was in my eyes or i skidded or 
		i took my mind off the road for a 
		second see what i mean
			grace nods
		i dont know how you feel about talking 
		about it and i can understand you might 
		not want to but if im going to figure 
		out whats going on in his head itd 
		sure help if i knew exactly what 
		happened that day

	grace looks away tom smiles and gently puts his arm around 
	her shoulders which has a soothing effect on grace  making 
	her feel safe

				  tom
		not today  whenever you feel like it 
		i leave it up to you

	grace looks into toms eyes wanting so much to unburden herself 
	to him and have him make everything all right she nods

	ext ranch house  late at night

	tom is making his way to the house at the end of the day when 
	he stops and looks over to the creek house 

	pov  the lights are on and he can see annie exhausted 
	approving pages talking on the phone and faxing all 
	simultaneously

	he gets an idea

	ext creek house  morning

	annie sits on the porch of the creek house with a guilt over 
	herself sipping coffee and deep in thought she looks up to 
	see

	tom riding towards the house on his horse leading another 
	horse behind him he looks to her and smiles

				  annie
			murmurs
		ohoh

	tom reaches the house as annie rises

				  tom

		in a bucket

				  annie
		yeah its been a while but i i 
		remember the basic ideas

	remember she just went into automatic i dont have to be 
	told anything mode

				  annie

	tom urges his horse into a center annie canters alongside

				  tom
		watch your reins hell go with you 
		give him some room let him do the 
		work relax dont grab him with 
		your thighs just so long as he can 
		feel your body

	annie responds to every suggestion without resistance and 
	she experiences this sense of pleasure  this great animal 
	beneath her the physicality and the surrender of letting 
	someone else lead

				  tom
		you want to let it go some more

	she begins to let herself go losing herself in the experience 
	she just nods tom breaks into a full gallop annie follows 
	suit she lets everything go  her job her marriage 
	motherhood guilt anxiety all of it her only focus is the 
	horse beneath her and the man on the horse leading her

	they come to the rim of a high bluff they stop they look 
	out at the twin valleys that gave the ranch its name and 
	they can just see the old creek house hidden in the shade of 
	some trees along the creek

	tom looks over at annie who is looking out over this 
	beautiful vista

				  annie
		its a whole other world you have 
		going on here it just goes along 
		doing what it has to and youre a 
		part of it you just wake up and 
		and there you are and everything 
		that seems like life or death some

	needs fixing and gets off his horse

	annie complies once she realizes what hes doing

		the cello i hadnt heard cello music 
		growing up she had the reddest hair 
		the bluest eyes when she played it 
		was

	tom cant find a beautiful enough word but annie understands

				  tom
		she was the most beautiful thing id 
		ever seen

	annie sees tom as if with new eyes  his love for this woman 
	he lost

				  annie
		why didnt it work out

				  tom
		she was never really happy here she did 
		the best she could

	annie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship  
	an understanding they both have of being torn between two 
	worlds a desire for home

				  tom
		grace told me you have a country house 
		in connecticut sounds like a beautiful 
		place

				  annie
		it is its lovely

				  tom
		ever think of moving there full time

				  annie
		we did at one point when we thought 
		wed have more children and we after 
		tried we tried everything but 
		wasnt meant to be

	there is an awkward silent beat for a moment annie is 
	momentarily selfconscious tom helps by speaking of himself

				  tom
		i hear that see i knew she was never 
		going to be a ranchest but i wanted 
		to try  i thought maybe shed give 
		music lessons to the kids in town or at 
		the school maybe even recitals my son 
		would grow up here maybe have one or 
		two more id teach em what i could 
		theyd play with my brothers kids all 
		grow up together and even if they all 
		decided to go out into the world theyd 
		always know where home was  cause wed 
		keep it for em

				  annie
		thats very important to you isnt it 
		home

				  tom
		yeah i think it is and i dont mean 
		everybodys got to be married have kids
		 its more like knowing where youre 
		from where you belong what feeds you 
		where you can go no matter what happens 
		knowing what youre supposed to be doing 
		while youre here

				  annie
		how did you find out all that

	tom looks right into her eyes and confesses without a shred 
	of selfconsciousness

				  tom
		i got lost

	they smiles

	tom gets back on his colt he takes rimrocks reins and leads 
	him off annie stops for a moment watching him ride away

	she watches her mother walk towards the house

	then puts her hand on the saddle horn she puts her 
	prosthetic leg into a stirrup frightened she starts to 
	shake

				  joe

	angry determined grace tries to swing her leg onto the 
	horse she cant do it tears of frustration on her face she 
	tries again she manages to pull herself halfway on her 
	prosthetic leg buckles and she falls frightened joe runs to 
	her

				  joe
		you okay

	she gasps to catch her breath he reaches to help her up she 
	pulls her hand away embarrassed she runs off joe remains 
	still he hears a little voices he turns and sees the twins 
	having been watching the whole thing from a small hill as 
	they run off he yells threateningly

				  joe
		you better not say anything

	dress annie hears her enter before she sees her asking

				  annie
		honey would you see if anybody

	grace nods and exits to the living room

	the room is silent because every booker is reading a 
	different copy of annies magazine frank covertly glimpses 
	at the scantilyclad models the twins sharing a magazine 
	doing the same thing as their father but keeping an eye out 
	for mom diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind 
	of lives she only hears about on audio tapes

	tom sits off to the side amused by the sight

	grace enters as joe enters they nod across the room to each 
	other with a little smile

				  grace
		would anyone like something to drink

	we hear a crash in the kitchen then

				  annie os

	never leave her its the first time hes seen her in her 
	dress sans apron as she lifts the bowl to hand to him she 
	realizes hes been looking at her theres a silent moment 
	then

				  annie

	she looks for it tom crosses to her and buttons it then 
	takes the bowl

				  annie

	grace enters  she clearly doesnt like the two of them being 
	alone annie quickly covers

				  annie
		oh good grace would you bring in 
		the bread ill get the salad and 
		then were all set

	tom has already exited by the time annie finishes and grace 
	grabs the bread basket

	int creek house  later that night

	we parachute into the middle of the meal the spaghetti is a 
	hit we cut to different conversations and reactions around 
	the table

	frank is in the middle of saying

				  frank
		itd be a whole lot easier to pay 
		the feed end of the month

				  tom
		i dont think warren would go for that

	grace is talking to joe and the twins

				  grace
		 like for instance you can go on 
		the internet and access this thing 
		called the visible man  who was this 
		murderer they caught in texas that was 
		executed and donated his body to 
		science and you can call him up on the 
		screen and dissect him like in threed

	grace eats as she talks joe and the twins are fascinated

	annie asks tom frank and diane

				  annie
		well did you ever think about hiring 
		a business manager

				  frank
		we have a business manager the best 
		around

				  diane
		ha

				  tom
		diane takes care of the books i dont 
		know how but at the end of every 
		month everything adds up to the penny

				  diane
		aint brain surgery

				  annie
		its pretty impressive where i come 
		from youd be a gold mine

	diane doesnt know how to accept that but inside shes 
	bursting with pride she focuses on the twins who fight

				  twins

		idiot

				  diane
		hey you stop that kind of talk at the

			jovial
		no reason you should no reason you

	they exit into the kitchen frank continues eating

	tom looks around  grace showing the boys the computer annie 
	and diane in the kitchen for a second we see tom realize an 
	image of the life he once thought he could

	int kitchen  night

	as diane and annie prepare coffee and dessert

				  diane
		i was looking in one of your magazines 
		and saw that picture of the couple 
		getting married at the pyramids were 
		you ever in egypt

				  annie
		i was there for that shot actually

				  diane
		what was it like

				  annie
		oh god  i think it was the fourth 
		or fifth time id been there so all 
		i remember was the heat and how 
		incompetent the photographer was

	she laughs as she directs this last line to diane who just 
	smiles and annie realizes thats not what she meant at all 
	this woman is starving for glimpses into this other life

				  annie
		but uh egypt is well its like 
		nothing else its like going back in 
		time
			diane listens
		i remember as a kid trying to imagine 
		what a kid my age centuries ago 
		walking over that same ground was 
		wondering about or if they had the 
		same problems as me and i felt 
		connected to to time itself almost 
		ha i never realized how hard it was 
		to describe

				  diane
		id love to go there one time

				  annie
		you and frank ever take a vacation

				  diane
		soon were going to branson missouri 
		to see my cousin emma married frank 
		loves in there

	annie can sense the disappointment in her voice and at the 
	same time the comfortable resignation

	suddenly from inside they hear loud overlapping voices as 
	the children fight

				  twin scott
		it was my turn

				  joe
		ya just had a turn it was not

				  twin scott
		was so

		tired well have dessert another time 
		frank get them out of here
			to other twin

	voices everywhere yelling thank yous during which 
	grace quickly turns and exits annie eyes follow her out of 
	the room but with her guests and the chaos she doesnt know 
	whether or not to leave

				  frank

	ever the gentlemen joe exits annie looks to tom hes about 
	to leave when he stops and says

				  tom
		dont let her turn you away

	tom exits

	annie stands and faces graces closed door slowly she 
	lowers herself to her knees and sits on them thinking 
	reminiscent of tom waiting for his moment with pilgrim in 
	the field

	int creek house graces room  later that night

	we dont know how long annie waited but she knocks gently 
	then enters to find grace in her nightgown on her bed with 
	the night stand light on her prosthesis is against the wall

	annie sits by the bed grace moves away a little

				  annie

				  annie
			angry
		what how can you 
			at a loss
		im sorry if my friendship with tom 
		bothers you so much but i happen to 
		value having someone to talk to 
		especially when my own daughter 
		ignores me night and day because no

		matter what i do its wrong im 
		sorry im such a disappointment to 
		you

				  grace
		well now you know what it feels like

	beat

				  annie
		i dont deserve that i have never 
		looked at you as a disappointment if 
		im on your back to do better if i 
		push you to try harder its because 
		i want you to be the best you can be

				  grace
		for you because im your daughter 
		which means youre the best mother 
		isnt that what youre always talking 
		about in interviews  having it all 
		the great career the great family 
		proving everybody wrong wanting 
		everybody to think youre this perfect 
		woman

	beat theyre both exhausted

				  annie

		your child  that you can look at 
		them and see something youve 
		accomplished as well if thats wrong 
		then im sorry

		but it wasnt my intention i dont push 
		for me i do it for you so you dont 
		waste half your life feeling like you 
		dont know where you belong

				  grace
		yeah well youve done a great job

	beat annie feels deeply hurt

				  annie
		well then i do apologize but what 
		im most sorry for is turning you 
		into a spoiled brat who can only 
		think about what shes feeling who 
		cant admit when shes wrong and who 
		cant forgive when shes not

				  grace
		leave me alone

	annie stops to exit as grace says something under her breath 
	annie stops

				  annie
		what did you say

				  grace
		i said i started

	grace starts to sob annie doesnt understand

				  annie
		started what

				  grace
		my period

				  annie
			softer
		when tonight

				  grace
			nods
		i felt it happen downstairs and when 
		i went into the bathroom

	annie reaches down to touch graces shoulder grace turns  
	there is no anger in her face annie sits and takes her in 
	her arms grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl 
	annie sees tears run  gratefully lovingly

				  grace
		whos going to want me now

				  annie
		what oh baby

				  grace
		whos ever going to want me nobody 
		will

				  annie
		thats not true

				  grace
		why should they

				  annie
		because you are one of the most 
		incredible bravest most beautiful 
		woman i have ever met the efforts 
		you make your courage and your 
		dignity
			laughs thru tears
		i dont know where you got it i 
		honestly dont know how i would have 
		handled all this if i were you

	grace is so grateful they cling to each other even harder 
	as the tears subside grace manages to admit

				  grace
		im sorry about what i said its 
		just that  all those times you 
		and daddy were trying for another 
		kid i i used to pray at night that 
		it would work and not because of 
		you guys or that i wanted a brother 
		or sister but just so i wouldnt 
		have to be

				  annie
		what

				  grace
		so special because i was the only 
		one you both wanted me to be so 
		good at everything so perfect and 
		i wasnt i was just me and now ive 
		completely ruined everything 
		anyway

	they both start crying again as annie rocks her gently

				  annie
		sshhh ssshhhh

	they hold each other as if for dear life

	later  camera pans to discover mother and daughter fast 
	asleep in each others arms

	int toms room ranch house  night

	tom sits alone writing at his desk his music is playing 
	he stops to look out the window overlooking the creek house

	annie and grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the 
	living room

	tom is thinking of grace and annie  wondering what happened 
	after he left conflicted by what he feels for annie and 
	remembering why theyre here in the first place

	at the touch tom quickly cinches it taking up the reins he 
	walks pilgrim around the ring again he starts to jog 
	pilgrim jogs with him and in the middle of the jog tom 
	grabs onto the saddle horn and without breaking his stride 
	pulls himself back up onto his back he lays across the 
	saddle letting pilgrim feel his weight he sits up and 
	without letting him break his stride he urges pilgrim with 
	his thighs keeping him in the jog riding around the ring

	she stops herself and remains still

	slowly she reaches out to touch pilgrims head and he

		what it is when you first came here 
		i didnt like you and i was worried tom 
		means a lot to me and this family dont 
		go looking here for whatever you looking 
		for dont make that man go through 
		something it took him a long time to see 
		his way clear out of the first time

				  annie
		i dont think anybody can make tom do 
		anything he didnt want

				  diane
		hes a good man tom is hes got a 
		gift come from heaven above i swear 
		but hes still a man and a woman can 
		lead a man into the middle of a mountain 
		lake  and still make him think hes on

	out of the clouds she looks over to sleeping grace then 
	looks to where tom is  and sees his sleeping bag is empty 
	quietly she rises and looks for him

	she starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his 
	haunches wearing a slicker sitting in the grass by the 
	stream drinking some water she watches him

	tom senses something and turns for a moment they just look 
	at each other  half disbelieving the inevitable is so close 
	at hand annie approaches as tom rises

	they meet they kiss tentative at first but more just to 
	make that very precious first moment of discovery last as 
	long as it can the kiss grows more passionate they begin to 
	lose themselves in each other

	until suddenly aware of their surroundings they part no

	in the grass by the stream the moving water the nights

	briefly to tom pilgrim sensing something turns and runs to 
	the far side of the ring tom his arms spread walks over 
	to him keeping him by the fence tom takes him by the 
	bridle smokey comes beside him tom unhitches the bridle and 
	in its place slips a rope halter smokey passes to him 
	smokey then hands him two long ropes one at a time tom 
	fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle 
	horn tom asks smokey

				  tom
		you got that soft rope

	smokey hands it to him tom quietly talks to pilgrim runs 
	his hand down pilgrims left foreleg and lifts his hoof 
	pilgrim slightly shifts and when hes still tom slips the 
	loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure 
	its snug and taking the other end of the rope he hoists the 
	weight of pilgrims raised hoof and ties the rope to the 
	saddle horn pilgrim stands on three legs  an explosion 
	waiting to happen tom moves away from pilgrim taking the 
	halter line from smokey pilgrim trying to move finds hes 
	crippled scared he lurches hopping on his right foreleg 
	seeing he cant walk panicked he tries to run tom and 
	smokey brace themselves lean back on their ropes and force 
	him around them in a tight circle he goes around and around 
	like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg tom looks over 
	and sees annie has left robert outside the ring to stand by 
	an anguished grace  her hands on her shoulders gripping 
	her robert watches feeling too much a foreigner

				  grace
		what is he doing this

				  frank
		itll be ok grace

	but even frank isnt so sure pilgrim covered in sweat 
	still circles as he runs his hobbled foot jabs at the air 
	trying to find peace he runs and runs as tom and smokey lean 
	on the ropes  until he cant run any more and stops tom and 
	smokey let the lines go slack pilgrim stands there his wet 
	sides heaving panting like an asthmatic making loud rasping 
	sounds tom and smokey speak smokey hands him his rope 
	turning he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand he swings 
	the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over pilgrims 
	saddle horn he pulls it tight and he takes the other end of 
	the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick 
	release knot to the bottom rung coming back he takes the 
	other two lines from tom tom crosses to the rail he starts 
	putting pressure on the rope pilgrim feeing it braces 
	himself the pressure tilts the saddle hold downward

				  frank
			to grace and annie
		hes trying to get him to go down 
		on his knees

	pilgrim fights tom pulls on the rope pilgrim slowly 
	begrudgingly gives ground tom brings him to his knees 
	but it is short lived pilgrim is muscling his way back to 
	his feet tom pulls him down to his knees again pilgrim 
	fighting with every bit of strength slowly gets to his feet 
	again but the pressure tom is putting on the saddle is too 
	strong and relentless and finally pilgrim goes down on his 
	knees and stays down yet tom keeps the pressure on tom 
	shouts to smokey

				  tom
		drop the lines and come help me

	smokey dropping the line runs over they both pull on 
	the saddle rope

				  grace
		thats enough stop it

	pilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth fighting but 
	slowly like a wounded bird she starts giving in he 
	rolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and 
	is still it seems like a total humiliating surrender 
	grace starts to sob burying her face in annies chest 
	robert feels impotent to help

				  tom
		grace

	tom and smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big 
	game hunters at the carcass of a kill

				  tom
		grace will you come here please

	grace shakes her head no frank motions to annie for 
	her to let grace go to let stand alone we see 
	that its not easy for annie to trust this but she does 
	and she steps back to where robert stands

	tom his face set walks toward grace

				  tom
		grace i need you to come with me

	grace violently shakes her head no robert gets up the 
	courage to say aloud

				  robert
		well maybe she shouldnt be here

	annie quickly turns to him and says with quick intensity

				  annie
		robert let him handle it please

	robert cant watch this he turns and takes a few steps 
	just stops standing behind and apart from annie to 
	just watch slowly becoming transfixed like someone 
	who cant stop staring at an accident

	tom reaches grace and puts his hand tenderly on her shoulder

				  tom
		grace i need you to come with me

				  grace
		no youre only going to hurt him 
		some more

				  tom
		hes not hurt hes okay look at him

				  grace
		  	turned away

	grace looks into his eyes and is reminded of all this man 
	has done for her and she remembers her trust

				  grace
		do what

	tom prouder of her now than ever before

				  tom
		ill show you

	tom leads her across the ring with his arm around her 
	shoulder annie tries to maintain her composure robert 
	remains still and focused

	tom and grace come to pilgrim lying in the dirt his 
	breathing plaintive tom speaks gently

				  tom
		i want you to lay down with him i 
		want you to stroke him i want to 
		start with his hindquarters and rub 
		him feel him all over

	grace is shaking her head no he speaks more firmly

				  tom
		grace youve got to do what i say

	grace knows theres no way out she takes a breath and slowly 
	kneels in the dirt beside him with toms help she lays on 
	him rubbing him his hindquarters his legs his side 
	softly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head

				  tom
		now listen i want you to stand on 
		him

				  annie
		what

	tom responds to their voice without looking at them

				  tom
		please
			they stop
		grace do what im telling you stand 
		on him now

	grace obeys him through her tears she lets tom take her hand 
	and guide her up onto the curve of pilgrims belly then he 
	lets go grace stands there with teas steaming down her 
	face  standing on the animal she loved most in the world

				  annie
		its so cruel

				  frank
		no he had the choice

				  annie
		what choice

				  frank
		either fight the way things are or 
		accept it

	robert however is hypnotized by the event he is having a 
	private epiphany of sorts

	grace sits in the dirt by pilgrim and strokes him quietly  
	she begins talking to him the way tom does tom watches as 
	he cautiously steps further away pilgrim looks up at grace 
	out of the dark pool of his one sad eye they look at each 
	other and we understand theres a connection once more a 
	moment of understanding and forgiveness

	grace starts to untie his ropes smokey is about to stop her 
	but tom shakes no

	pilgrim like an infant coming out of the water breathing 
	life for the first time gets to his feet grace and him look 
	to each other and all is still

	grace grabs the saddle horn pilgrim shuffles as if hes 
	going to bolt grace quietly reassures him she then 
	carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup pilgrim 
	shifts slightly annie covers her mouth so as not to scream 
	out her fear robert breaths heavily they watch as grace 
	swings her leg determined and pulls herself into the 
	saddle sitting on his back pilgrim tosses his head and 
	looks as hes going to run off but grace puts her arms 
	around his neck and once again quietly reassures him

	she starts to ride him slowly her arms around his neck 
	talking all the while around the ring

	annie laughs as she cries  emotion overwhelming her robert 
	feels almost numb with fascination gratitude confusion

	the slow ride turns into a trot then a lope then a 
	canter round and round the ring frank and diane smile 
	diane looks to tom and knows what hes feeling

	tom watches as any father would  his heart pounding with 
	pride for the miracle of his child but he doesnt let on for 
	a second

	grace brings pilgrim to a stop lifts her arms to the 
	heavens victorious everyone cheers smokey helps her off 
	the horse she stops to look at tom who busies himself with 
	picking up the ropes so she refocuses on her parents they 
	run to each other and embrace first she and annie then 
	she and her father

	but as robert and grace hold each other and begins to exit 
	annie manages to make eye contact with tom and tell him 
	with one look how grateful she is and how much she loves 
	him and he receives it

	strength she smiles and walks to meet them

				  annie
		oh i miss you you look beautiful

				  grace
		so do you

				  annie
		hows everything

				  grace

				  annie
			to robert

			to grace
		pilgrims in the back i found a new 
		stable but they cant take him until 
		tomorrow

				  grace

				  annie

	grace exits excitedly oc annie and robert face each other 
	robert doesnt know what to expect but he softens when annie 
	smiles

				  annie
		i have so much to tell you

				  robert
		you want to take a walk with me

				  annie
			a little nervous
		where to

				  robert
			smiles
		i dont know lets just go and 
		well see

	annie nods he reaches for her hand and annie gives it 
	willingly they begin to walk away from camera together

	annie begins to speak telling him what we already know how 
	he will react or what will happen is unknown but these two 
	people will no longer avoid their life together somehow 
	they will make the effort to face it together

	as camera widens we see included in the frame grace and 
	pilgrim as she strokes him and whispers in his ear and 
	leads him for a walk
