               black

               int a jeep lebanon  day

               and were in a speeding soviet jeep two men in front 
               shouldering assault rifles hezbollah soldiers and there 
               are three men in the back a middleaged man wearing a tired 
               suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on and on either 
               side of him two men blindfolded the man on one side is in 
               his forties hands pressed in the pockets of a welltravelled 
               blackleather jacket a stocky man with the edge of a 
               jd salinger character hes seen everything at least once 
               but even he has lost some of his selfconfidence here 
               turning his head sensing the wind a blast of arabic music 
               that disappears behind him hes lowell bergman on the 
               other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky man with 
               a voltmeter around his neck norman

               ext the beqaa valley baalbek lebanon  day

               the jeep races up narrow winding streets of a lebanese 
               village its shadowed by a jeep in front and in back each 
               carrying personnel armed with aks and a few rpgs and in 
               the third jeep are two blindfolded not very threatening 
               lebanese soldiers and as the speeding convoy passes a 
               captured israeli armored personnel carrier covered with arabic 
               graffiti looking down on them from huge murals are the stern 
               visages of the ayatollah khomeini and a hezbollah religious 
               leader the sheikh fadlallah and suddenly the convoy 
               skids to a stop and blindfolded lowell and norman are 
               roughly taken out and pushed stumbling through the cloud 
               of dust without sight the lanky cameraman is stopped 
               told to wait while lowell is pushed past armed men guarding 
               a small stone house and inside

               int a house in lebanon  day

               a roundfaced man in his midforties with largeframed 
               glasses black hair and a greyblack beard wearing a 
               dullbend a turban sits informally at a kitchen table 
               its the sheikh fadlallah whose face stares out at us from 
               walls a gunman cradling an ak47 sits in an incongruous 
               purple armchair in a corner a torn poster of the seychelles 
               is on one wall another gunman stands by a window lowell is 
               sat down in a chair at the kitchen table

                                     the sheikh
                         coffee

                                     lowell
                         yeah thank you

                                     the sheikh
                         how have you liked your stay

                                     lowell
                              droll
                         what ive seen ive liked

               the sheikh smiles and the smile passes as quickly as it 
               came a steaming cup of coffee in a small arabic demitasse 
               is put down

                                     the sheikh
                         please to explain why i should agree 
                         to interview with prozionist 
                         american media

                                     lowell
                         because i think hezbollah is trying 
                         to broaden into a political party 
                         right now so you care about what 
                         youre thought of in america and in 
                         america at this moment in time 
                         hezbollah does not have a face
                              confident
                         thats why

               and weve first realized this man is not a hostage hes 
               come here voluntarily

                                     the sheikh
                         perhaps you prove journalism 
                         objectivity and i see the questions 
                         first then i decide if i grant the 
                         interview

                                     lowell
                              blunt
                         no we dont do that
                              beat

                         wallace so you know our reputation 
                         for integrity and objectivity you

                         mostrespected tvmagazine news 
                         show in america

               the sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him studying 
               him and lowell closes

                                     lowell
                         so mr wallace should he get on a 
                         plane or not

               the sheikh thinks it over and then

                                     the sheikh
                         tell him i will see him day after 
                         tomorrow

                                     lowell
                         thats good that works
                              after a beat
                         uh you know i want to ask you 
                         something i know it sounds odd 
                         but

               its quiet too quiet

                                     lowell

                              no answer
                         hello sheikh

               silence he hesitates starts to lift his blindfold he 
               lifts it and he sees the sheikh and his gunmen are gone

               the house empty only his cameraman the lanky man left 
               there standing by the door still in his blindfold

                                     lowell
                         norman

                                     norman
                         what what

                                     lowell
                         take your blindfold off

               the lanky man does and we see the cameraman is asianamerican

                                     lowell
                              sarcastic
                         welcome to the world

               norman gives lowell an ironic look and tests the local current 
               at an electrical outlet

                                     norman
                         fluctuating all over the place 
                         anywhere we shoot here its gonna 
                         be portable gennies and well run 
                         cable

               lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding 
               height baalbek and the beqaa valley below golddomed 
               mosques a moment of triumph he dials his cell phone

                                     mike wallaces voice
                              over

               int a laboratory brown  williamson louisville kentucky  
               day

               were in a science laboratory out of focus lab technicians 
               in white lab coats celebrating a heavyset black womans 
               birthday half her presents are opened balloons 
               incongruous floating above the lab and theres a sense 
               that somebody is watching and from the waist up a 
               disembodied figure comes into focus behind a glass partition 
               as if quarantined isolated an expressionless man in his 
               late forties watching them

               int jeffrey wigands office  day

               the office soundproofed he watches the people laughing 
               their lips moving his hair not yet settled on grey his 
               face is changing always interesting born in the bronx 
               educated in upstate new york he retains little of the accent 
               and much of the directness hes jeffrey wigand he turns to 
               resume gathering things from his desk some technical books 
               a medical text on asthma putting them in his briefcase 
               and as he leaves the office the silent party like a bizarre 
               mime behind him

               int lobby brown  williamson building  day

               briefcase in hand jeffrey appears from the elevator from 
               above from wide and in front his eyes frozen pools  
               and like a bad dream a broadshouldered man leaning against 
               the wall near the reception island in a suit hes not 
               comfortable in wearing an earphone saying something into a 
               lapel microphone after jeffreys passed

               int wigands car lousiville  day

               light mottled through trees reflects off the car window 
               jeffreys face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and 
               shadow down this tasteful suburban louisville street of 
               neat houses and manicured lawns he pulls into driveway 
               behind a 3 series bmw its a grey french provincial 
               replica

               int the wigands house foyer  day

               and celebrity theres a kinetic quality about him

               wallace sits across from the sheikh on a dais of patterned 
               linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural 
               of a french formal garden a sound technician wires the sheikh 
               and mike with microphones norman says something to lowell

               the interpreter says something back in arabic the sheikh 
               absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview ignores

               as mike leaps forward moving inches from the bodyguards

                         just give me an example

                                     wigand
                         for example james burke the ceo of 
                         johnson  johnson when he found 
                         out that some lunatic had put poison 
                         in tylenol bottles he didnt argue 
                         with the fda he didnt even wait 
                         for the fda to tell him he just 
                         pulled tylenol off every shelf of 
                         every store right across america 
                         instantly and then he developed the 
                         safety cap because look as a 
                         ceo sure hes gotta be a great 
                         businessman right but hes also a 
                         man of science hes not going to 
                         allow his company to put on the 
                         shelf a product that might hurt

                         time trying to restrain his speech 
                         then wouldnt they

                         afraid of risking years of litigation 
                         and millions of dollars of their own

                         at brown  williamson a former 
                         corporate officer there

                                     lowell
                         well he may tape an interview with 
                         us and we believe if his testimony 
                         showed up in a court record first 
                         it would free him up from his 
                         confidentiality agreement and give 
                         him some protection

                                     motley
                         it could work if its public record 
                         its public record

                                     lowell
                         yeah and hes going to need legal 
                         representation

                                     motley
                         he sure as hell will

                                     richard scruggs
                              a beat
                         has he decided to go public because 
                         let me tell you weve been doing 
                         this for three years now and weve 
                         worked with a lot of corporate cases 
                         involving whistleblowers so we 
                         know big tobacco will do everything 
                         in their power to stop him so is 
                         your man truly committed

               but she suddenly gets up and leaves hurrying out of the

                              after a beat

                         what did she think she was coming to

                         it but i really  i didnt know 
                         how to do that

               jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby bar

                                     lowell
                         oh man

                         expect grace and consistency

               and lowell leaves the table and as mike wallace sits at the 
               table looking around wondering what the fuck hes doing 
               there

               int the bathroom new york hotel  night

               liane folds her arms protectively across her chest

               int a studio cbs  morning

               and we see a small taping studio separated by flats and black 
               curtains from other cbs news sets cameras are set up

               int the studio cbs  day

               and we enter midscene on jeffrey in a more formal demeanor 
               sitting in a chair mike wallace sitting across from him 
               under the lights taping an interview lowell off camera

                                     mike wallace
                         you heard mr sandefur say before 
                         congress that he believed nicotine 
                         was not addictive

                                     wigand
                              nods
                         i believe mr sandefur perjured 
                         himself because i watched those 
                         testimonies very carefully

               lowells reaction jeffreys statements are stunning and 
               powerful revelations and dangerous ones to make

                                     mike wallace
                         all of us did there was this whole 
                         line of people whole line of ceos 
                         up there all swearing

                                     wigand
                         part of the reason im here is i 
                         felt that their representation clearly 
                         misstated at least within brown  
                         williamsons representation clearly 
                         misstated what is common language 
                         within the company we are in the 
                         nicotine delivery business

                                     mike wallace
                         and thats what cigarettes are for

                                     wigand
                         a delivery device for nicotine

                                     mike wallace
                         a delivery device for nicotine put 
                         it in your mouth light it up and 
                         youre gonna get your fix

                                     wigand
                         youre gonna get your fix

                                     mike wallace
                         youre saying that brown  williamson 
                         manipulates and adjusts the nicotine 
                         fix not by artificially adding 
                         nicotine but by enhancing the effect 
                         of nicotine through the use of 
                         chemical elements such as ammonia

                                     wigand
                              nods
                         the process is known as impact 
                         boosting while not spiking 
                         nicotine they clearly manipulate 
                         it theres extensive use of this 
                         technology know as ammonia 
                         chemistry it allows for the nicotine 
                         to be more rapidly absorbed in the 
                         lung and therefore affect the brain 
                         and central nervous system

               int the studio cbs  later

                                     wigand
                         the straw that broke the camels 
                         back for me and really put me in 
                         trouble with sandefur was a compound 
                         called coumarin when i came on 
                         board at bw they had tried to 
                         transition from coumarin to a similar 
                         flavor that would give the same taste 
                         and had been unsuccessful i wanted 
                         it out immediately i was told that 
                         it would affect sales so i should 
                         mind my own business i constructed 
                         a memo to mr sandefur indicating i 
                         could not in conscience continue 
                         with coumarin in a product that we 
                         now knew we had documentation was 
                         similar to coumadin a lungspecific 
                         carcinogen

                                     mike wallace
                         and you sent the document forward to 
                         sandefur

                                     wigand
                         i sent the document forward to 
                         sandefur i was told that we would 
                         continue to work on a substitute we 
                         werent going to remove it as it 
                         would impact sales and that that 
                         was his decision

                                     mike wallace
                         in other words you were charging 
                         sandefur and brown  williamson with 
                         ignoring health considerations 
                         consciously

                                     wigand
                         most certainly

                                     mike wallace
                         and on march 24 thomas sandefur 
                         ceo of brown  williamson had you 
                         fired and the reason he gave you

                                     wigand
                         poor communication skills

                                     mike wallace

                         forward you wish you hadnt blown

                         done it there are times i feel

                         worth it yeah i think its worth

               but he ignores her washing his hands and she turns the 
               water off he turns it back on he thinks then turns it 
               off then she turns it on

                                     liane
                         leave it on just leave it on okay

               and she turns and leaves the room coldly all her anger 
               repressed for jeffrey everything else and now this the 
               running faucet

               ext the wigands house louisville  late night

               the house on the quiet suburban street a security guard 
               incongruous a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster 
               is sitting watch under the porch light on the small front 
               porch in a metal porch chair

               int the basement the wigands house  late night

               and we see jeffrey unable to sleep sitting at his desk 
               alone in the basement listening to classical music he 
               instinctively turns and he sees liane in her bathrobe has 
               come down to sit on the basement stairs he looks over at 
               her and he thinks shes come down to make up and all she 
               really wants him to do is say i need you but he cant 
               and like ships that pass in the night nothings said its 
               quiet she puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets  
               and she starts to cry

                                     liane

               she goes back up the stairs and as jeffrey sits in the 
               basement and the music plays

               int the louisville airport  day

               we see jeffrey and his security man he passes a small 
               filipino woman in a nurses uniform and a man in clerical 
               garb who hands him a small american flag asking for 
               donations and now he passes through the metal detector

               he nods thanks and walks towards us relaxing looking behind 
               every so often to see if anybody is following him as he 
               passes gate 3 he hears over his shoulder

                                     the man
                              friendly
                         jeff

               jeffrey turns and the man throws a sheaf of subpoenas at his 
               chest

                                     the man
                              nasty
                         youve been served

               and he turns and walks off and as jeffrey looks down at the 
               subpoenas

               int richard scruggs kitchen  700 am

               jeffrey is sitting with scruggs and motley in scruggs kitchen 
               around a semicircular counter coffee and sweet rolls its 
               casual no ones dressed for court scruggs has been looking 
               through the sheaf of subpoenas about motley we sense power 
               held in reserve

                                     richard scruggs
                         now what this one is is a temporary 
                         restraining order a gag order issued 
                         by a kentucky court

               meanwhile a moviestar handsome man in shirtsleeves and a 
               tie a coffee cup in his hand enters and sits casually on 
               the arm of a chair

                                     richard scruggs
                              introducing

                                     richard scruggs

                         i was just explaining to jeff they 
                         got a kentucky court to issue a gag 
                         order to stop his deposition today

                                     michael moore
                         right

                                     richard scruggs
                         now they tried to get the mississippi 
                         court to honor it but the judge 
                         threw it out
                              to jeffrey
                         however for you there is a more 
                         perilous effect to the kentucky gag 
                         order

                                     michael moore

                         kentucky order when you step foot 
                         back in kentucky they can find you 
                         in contempt and they can incarcerate 
                         you and you ought to know that

               and jeffrey fairly turns white its never occurred to him 
               he might go to jail

                                     wigand

               he leaves and jeffreys quiet frightened having shaken 
               the departing moores hand he now turns away from scruggs 
               and motley thinking about consequences

                                     richard scruggs

               gables a large front lawn with weeping willows and we 
               see lowell hands in his pockets not an insider or an 
               outsider waiting alone on the expansive lawn the front 
               door opens

               a mississippi state trooper putting on his round brimmed 
               hat comes out and crosses the driveway then jeffrey coming 
               out with motley motley talks to him on the veranda for a 
               moment and then heads towards his car meanwhile jeffrey 
               comes down over to lowell on the lawn

               and jeffrey looks off across the street from the house at 
               the gulf and we see the street is blockaded by mississippi

               a slight sound he turns and jeffreys come outside he 
               stands leaning on the porch railing looking out at the rain 
               and windswept trees theyre quiet they share a look

               they nod to each other the smallest nod of accomplishment

               and theyre there on the porch alone outside the house in 
               pascagoula mississippi

               int cbs editing room new york  afternoon

               we see lowell unusually buoyant in the same clothes as 
               yesterday hes working with tony baldo on a cut of the show 
               the net result of his architecture of events his combination

                              on monitor
                         part of the reason im here is i 
                         felt that their representation 
                         clearly at least within

                                     lowell

                         not addictive run that oncamera  
                         then cut right to wigand with i 
                         believe they perjured then go 
                         wide to the ceos all taking the oath 
                         back on jeff and play the pause after 
                         the word felt on the bside

               widen to include debbie deluca the intern two other editors

               this is a hot show and its generated excitement among

                         reveal the secret formula of kools 
                         to the world
                              seriously
                         sealed doesnt hurt scruggs 
                         litigation and since were the only 
                         ones with the story i believe were 
                         sitting on an exclusive

                         here we go

               baldo now runs lowells edit of the above sequence and we 
               see the immediate impact

               sandefur in closeup states i believe that nicotine is not 
               addictive wigand in matching closeup states i believe he 
               perjured himself then all seven ceos of big tobacco stand 
               up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of congress 
               to tell the truth while wallace says the whole line of 
               people the whole line of ceos up there all swearing that 
               and wigand says offscreen with great emphasis part of the 
               reason im here is i felt and it cuts to wigand for a 
               pause that makes the word felt resound and then he goes 
               on to say oncamera that their representation clearly 
               misstated what they commonly knew were a nicotine delivery 
               business we see the combination of art and truth woven 
               into impact that has an audacity thats stirring and 
               beautiful

               ext louisville  dusk

               its jeffrey in the front seat driven by one of his security 
               men hes coming home under the cover of darkness they pass

               at it they turn off onto city streets and stop at a light 
               jeffreys nervous jeffrey instinctively turns a police car 
               stops alongside the policeman looks at him

               up the walk and the second security guard quickly crosses 
               the lawn to intercept him

               and jeff opens the door going inside anxious to be home

               int wigands house  night

               the house is quiet dark too quiet too dark something 
               isnt right he crosses to one of the childrens rooms 
               the master bedroom the lights are on both rooms are empty 
               he goes into the kitchen and sees a note thats been left 
               for him he opens it he sits heavily in a chair reading 
               the note the security guard peers and as jeffrey sits in 
               the silent house the hero come home

                         alright i thought wed get together 
                         because theres a legal concept that 
                         has been getting some new attention 
                         recently tortious interference
                              beat
                         if two people have an agreement 
                         like a confidentiality agreement 
                         and one of them breaks it because 
                         they are induced to do so by a 3rd 
                         party the 3rd party can be sued for 
                         damages for interfering hence 
                         tortious interference

                                     don hewitt
                         interfering thats what we do

                                     lowell
                         i think what were trying to tell 
                         you is that it happens all the time 
                         this is a news organization people 
                         are always telling us things they 
                         shouldnt we have to verify if its 
                         true and in the public interest 
                         and if it is we air it

                                     mike wallace
                         after we corroborate it thats why 
                         weve never lost a lawsuit and run a 
                         classy show
                              impatient now
                         anything else

                                     helen caperelli
                         and 60 minutes verification is 
                         exact and precise and i dont think 
                         it would hurt to make sure youre 
                         right on this one

                                     don hewitt
                         why you think we have liability 
                         whats the cbs news position eric

                                     eric kluster
                         theres a possibility its rather 
                         remote

                                     helen caperelli
                         but one we have to check on mike 
                         ive retained outside counsel to do 
                         exactly that on a segment i might 
                         add thats already rife with 
                         problems

                                     lowell
                         what does that mean rife with  
                         

                                     helen caperelli

                                     lowell
                         no only that we would hold the story 
                         until it was safe for him

                         and im told there are questions as 
                         to our star witness veracity

                                     lowell

                              his anger
                         his veracity was good enough for 
                         the state of mississippi

                                     helen caperelli
                              historic

                         they own the information hes 
                         disclosing the truer it is the 
                         greater the damage to them if he 
                         lied he didnt disclose their 
                         information and the damages are 
                         smaller

                              familiar seductive
                         if this holds up and it very well 
                         may not mike but if it did and 
                         we aired this segment and cbs was 
                         sued by brown  williamson i think 
                         we could be at grave risk

                                     mike wallace
                              a beat

                         well at the end of the day because 
                         of your segment the brown  
                         williamson tobacco company could 
                         own cbs

               as if on cue the alarm on helen caperellis watch beeps

               she glances at it

                         there has been so much soul searching 
                         about this wigand ive decided we 
                         should cut an alternate version of 
                         the show without his interview

                                     lowell
                         so what happened to ms caperellis 
                         checking with outside counsel first 
                         all that crap

                                     eric kluster
                         thats happening and hopefully we 
                         wont have to use the alternate but 
                         we should have it in the can

                                     lowell

                         were doing this with or without 
                         you lowell if you like i can assign 
                         another producer to edit your show

               lowells stunned he looks like hes been hit with a hammer

                                     lowell
                         since when has the paragon of 
                         investigative journalism allowed 
                         lawyers to determine the news content 
                         on 60 minutes

                                     don hewitt
                         its an alternate version so what 
                         if we have an alternate version and 
                         i dont think her being cautious is 
                         so damned unreasonable

                         of dr wigands former boss brown  
                         williamsons chief executive officer

                         i believe mr sandefur perjured 
                         himself because i watched those 
                         testimonies very carefully

               then it cuts to all seven ceos of big tobacco raising their 
               hands and taking the oath in front of congress to tell the 
               truth while

                         of ceos up there all swearing that

                         part of the reason im here is i 
                         felt

               and the pause after the word makes felt resound and as it 
               cuts to jeffrey on camera saying

               and lowell freezes after the image he gets up looking 
               out the window through the curtain with the spill from the 
               neon motel sign outside are horse trailers he goes back to 
               watching the show standing there in touch with his own 
               creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this 
               decisionmaking process that we feel is critical to him
