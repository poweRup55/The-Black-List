                                based on a screenplay by

                                       marc rocco



                                                             april 15 2003




               a pure white screen idyllic stillness all of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to

               after some seconds of calm water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a mans pov then suddenly the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man

                                     william starks vo
                           i was 25 years old the first time i
                           died

               int hospital kuwait day

               one more tug on the sheet and we see and suddenly hear from
               william starks pov the chaos of the hospital around him
               as doctors and nurses tend as best as they can to the injured
               soldiers

               our glimpse of starks reveals a red stretcher  soaked in blood 
               and the severe head wound where a bullets minced his skull

               then slowly steadily a heartbeat is heard over the muffled
               sounds of the hospital and as his pulse quickens so does
               the pace of the world around him

                           i remember there was so much white
                           everywhere and i felt peaceeven
                           though there was war around me and i
                           felt alive even though i knew i was
                           dead

               an intern clipboard in hand stands above starks unmoving
               body with another intern 2 beside him intern 1 pulls
               the rest of the sheet off of starks as the other searches for
               his dog tags and gently closes his eyes with her hand

                                     intern 2 reading from the tags

                           do with him

               as the intern puts the tags back down she meets starks wide
               open eyes  now filled with surfacing tears sadness and life
               she stares at them curiously and after some seconds starks
               blinks and a tear runs down his cheek  jarring her

                                     intern 2 calling out
                           oh my god this soldier is alive

                           need a doctor get a doctor over here
                           now

               as the medical staff rush over to starks preparing needles
               and oxygen masks starks merely closes his eyes and we follow
               the now bloodied white sheet as it falls to the ground

               in a flash shaving the skin around it right off

               starks convalesces in a navy hospital bed  his head heavily
               bandaged and his arms suited with ivs and dressings  as a
               major a lieutenant and a doctor stand above him

               starks face  now cleaned of the blood that masked it before 
               is alert and striking even with the bandages he remains
               wellbuilt and strong like a shot straight to the head would
               have been the only way for an enemy to take him down

                           sergeant starks was very lucky a
                           little more to the right and it
                           wouldnt have wanted to come out

                           but hes never gonna be able to

                           its hard to say sergeant starks
                           could have retrograde amnesia
                           or lowering his voice any form of
                           psychological suppression its very
                           common with traumas like this

                           going home

               when he speaks starks maintains the sharp steady gaze of a
               man assured of himself even if he is lost among his
               surroundings

                                     lieutenant

                           for the purple heart sergeant

               starks lets the tribute roll right off him he spots the

               their voices start to fade as starks smokes his cigarette
               blowing the smoke upwards and following it with his eyes
               hes finished with these men and everything they stand for

                                                         fade to

               int hallway alpine grove day

               from starks pov we follow him walk down the hospital
               halls even hazier from the medication than before forms
               blur into one another and on either side of him is a crazy
               world with crazy patients whove lost their way in it

               starks reaches for the wall and runs his hand over it trying
               to keep his balance hes walking towards becker who stands
               at the end of the hall talking to other patients

                                     starks softly
                           i dont belong here i dont

               starks falters but stays up he turns to see a shell of an
               old man looking right through him with wooden eyes starks
               eyes stay so completely fixed on the old mans haunting sight
               that he doesnt see whats ahead of him

               he bumps right into a hysterical patient whose sudden
               earsplitting screams peal interminably through the air

                                     starks mumbling
                           im sorry i didnt mean im
                           sorry i didnt mean it

               starks fumbled efforts to help the patient only feed his
               hysteria more the screaming is intolerable

                                     starks forced to yell
                           will you listen to me im not going
                           to hurt you please i didnt mean
                           to bumpim sorry

               orderlies and nurses followed by dr becker surround them
               now violently pulling starks off the patient becker
               familiar with the patient harold tries to calm him

                                     becker
                           its ok harold its ok

               starks searches their blurred faces and stops on beckers as
               they restrain him and give him more drugs

                                     starks to becker
                           i dont belong here

                                     becker angrily to the orderlies
                           get him to his room

                                                          fade to black

               int starks room alpine grove late night

               starks is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears
               disquieting footsteps in the hall coming closer and
               closer

               what follows happens too quickly for starks to react

               dr gries nurse harding and damon  enter starks room
               they close the door and deftly administer a tranquilizer and
               a gag

               starks has no idea whats happening to him as they drag him
               out and his stifled cries ensure no one else does either

                                      nurse harding
                            come on army boy time for some
                            therapy

               int morgue basement alpine grove late night

               the first face starks sees as the world comes into focus is
               nurse hardings around it loom those of dr becker dr
               gries and damon

               a shot of the room shows a constraintridden apparatus
               hanging sternly on the wall it is the jacket an apparatus
               designed to encase a mans body made of coarse sickly
               stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would
               first chafe then forever burn the skin theyre wrapped
               around the jacket looks medieval its appearance suggests
               its purpose to slowly strangle the life out of a man

               starks has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying
               nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement
               even under the tranquilizers starks formidably resists them
               as the orderlies wrestle to strap him in then starks
               sensing as anyone would that something bad is being done to
               him wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them

                                     starks
                           wait wait a minute please

               becker motions for them to stop with his hand starks blinks
               trying to bring the faces above him into focus

                                     starks
                           i i dont belong here

               becker looks into starks eyes sanity stares back

                                     becker
                           no i dont think you do either
                           beat but neither of us can do
                           anything about that
               becker barely nods and starks is trussed in the jacket with
               metal clamps becker writes some details down presumably
               about starks treatment

               a cadaver drawer  just barely deep enough for a body or tall
               enough for the height of a nose  is slid open and starks
               already dreadfully sheathed in the jacket is crammed inside

               the orderlies slam the cadaver drawer into the wall

               int cadaver drawer

               starks is literally entombed alive silence stolen breath
               they bolt the drawer and the clang echoes through his body
               the blackness and closeness of the space choke him as his
               heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle

               we see only the whites of a pair of petrified eyes on a man
               whos losing it  hyperventilating suffocating for all
               intents and purposes dying the worst kind of a death

               combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of whats
               happening to him starks sees a single white dot  almost
               like a fleck of dust  flitting between undecided shapes in
               the blackness until slowly it grows bigger and bigger

               int jackettunnel passage

               its now a pattern of white dots that changes the more starks
               stares at it beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with
               formless shapes and figures that starks tries to discern
               before they change into something else only after starks
               blinks does he start to see the white of the dots is snow
               from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in
               the following glimpses each hardly longer than the time
               between blinks

                1 a little river of red marring the snow around it
                spilling from

                2 officer harrisons mouth just seconds before his last
                breath his eyes close and starks sees and hears a flash

                 3 from the barrel of a gun fired near him

               blood sprays starks hands as he looks down at them and
               realizes hes in the scene and not just watching it he looks
               up from his hands and sees in similar flashes

                1 the snow beneath the blood changing to dirt as starks
                stares at it this time the little river of red comes
                from

                 2 the bodies of iraqi villagers all still except one

                3 that of a iraqi woman she unflinchingly lays her
                hand in the entrails of a corpse and smears its
                blood on her face just before she lies back down among
                the dead content to be one of them

               the only sounds during these dreadful images have been a
               trapped mans anxious breaths and the beats of a heart
               pumping so fast it could be a drum

               the screen goes black and quivers as starks clenches his eyes
               shut

               int cadaver drawer

               just then as the muscle beneath his eyes starts to vibrate
               something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the
               drawer ping right on his eye the drop of water is enough
               to send this man right over the edge

               starks eyes roll back into his head and start to flutter
               shaking the screen right along them until

               int morgue basement alpine grove

               starks stands outside his body looking at the wall of
               drawers he is in he bends down to look more closely at a
               stain on the floor  dried blood  and as he runs his hand over
               it and stands back up he is back in the

               int jackettunnel passage

               images race past him too fast for him to catch anything but
               fleeting clips of them the images are his memory and no
               matter how badly he wants to slow them down he cant

                                                        fade to black

               int diner small town vermont

               starks sees jackie 8 sitting by a window in the diner she
               turns her head towards the entrance and as she looks there
               so does starks that is when he first lays eyes on a woman a
               waitress  worn but still lovely  leaving the diner he is
               taken with her and for the first time since hes been in the
               jacket seems calm just then however the reverie is
               shattered

                                                        smash cut to

               int morgue basement alpine grove late night

               the drawer is yanked open to reveal starks still drenched
               face becker gries and the orderlies stand above him

                                     becker
                           take him out of it

               the orderlies unstrap the jacket from his body blood from
               his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab starks eyes
               remain closed

                                     becker
                           william william can you hear me

               we hear beckers voice as it sounds to starksmuted
               starks eyes open only enough for him to see the peoples
               faces morph chillingly into one anothers

                                     dr gries less muffled
                           pulse is 16 temp just a hair under

                           thats not enough is it

               becker looks at starks battered body

                                     becker wearily indifferently
                           its enough for now take him to the
                           infirmary and let him recover there

               int ward alpine grove next morning

               starks sits totally disoriented in the ward with the other
               more vocally insane patients he runs his hand uncertainly
               over the scars on his arm from the jacket and looks around 
               not knowing where his paranoia ends and reality begins

               the old man from the previous day is moving slowly with the
               aid of his walker he is far less threatening to starks
               todayjust a senile man about to walk into a wall

                                     starks getting up to help him

                                      starks looking away
                            im not really in the mood to talk

                                     mackenzie

                           im ready to throw the ball come on

               starks looks at mackenzie and sees that the constant flow of
               words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his
               eyes a dead arm hangs limply by his side like a weight

                                     starks relenting
                           what are you in here for

                                     mackenzie

                                     starks
                           dont you go to jail for that

                                     mackenzie
                           i tried something like 30 times
               there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to
               that

                                     mackenzie
                           shes bigger than me and shes
                           stronger than me and i never planned
                           on doing it it was always in the
                           heat of the moment i didnt beat her
                           or anything hell she beat me but
                           when wed start fighting id go for
                           the knife then she kept threatening
                           to have me put away and looking
                           around she finally did

               as he talks mackenzie notes the scars on starks arms dr
               lorenson observes starks and mackenzie talking and starts
               walking towards them

                                     starks
                           yeah well 30 times probably would

                           finally turns to face her grimly
                           the world around me its shrinking
                           theres not even room for light to

               lorenson reprimands mackenzie by turning to starks

                                     mackenzie
                           what its better than fine

                                     dr lorenson

                           playing

               just before he walks away mackenzie turns around nervously
               and uncharacteristically looks starks right in the eye

                                     mackenzie
                           heywhen they talk you out to the

                           eat you when theres music playing

               starks looks at mackenzie briskly wondering if his words
               were directed or just the meandering of a nut but mackenzie
               just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away 
               dead arm in tow

                                     dr lorenson
                           so youre ok

                                     starks still distracted
                           what

                                     dr lorenson

                                     starks suspiciously

                           think theres anything wrong with me

                                     dr lorenson
                           i dont know youre not my patient

               starks looks away lorenson gives him a once over

                                     dr lorenson
                           you look like youve lost some
                           weight are you eating

                                     starks
                           i am one of the few things i
                           remember doing is eating so i guess
                           i must be exercising it off in my
                           dreams

               starks looks at lorenson seeing if hell respond lorenson
               looks back curiously at starks pointed stare

                                     starks
                           you done with your small talk

                                     dr lorenson
                           sure

                                     starks
                           good

               starks walks away slowly and weakly  a fact that doesnt
               escape lorensons observation

               int mens room alpine grove hospital day

               starks walks into the bathroom keenly eyeing the thin slit
               of windows at the top of the wall he walks closer to them
               when he suddenly hears some strained breathing from inside
               one of the stalls he checks the first stall pushing it
               open it swings both ways since it doesnt have a lock

               the sound continues starks walks slowly past the second
               stall to the third and then whack the door swings all the
               way towards starks brutally he falls backwards  his head
               just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink

               damon the orderly walks out

                                     damon
                           im sorry starks must have not seen
                           you coming there

               starks writhes in pain  straining for his own breath now

                                     damon leaning down close to him
                           were you worried about me smiling
                           thats so sweet thanks

               with that damon walks out leaving starks on the floor

               int starks room alpine grove night christmas eve

               starks sits in his room listening to the silence of the
               night interrupted by first faint then approaching
               footsteps closer and closerthen harmfully near until
               damon and harding enter his room

               they pause  awaiting a reaction starks doesnt give them
               one

                                     nurse harding
                           you gonna get the fuck up

               int hallway alpine grove night christmas eve

               starks walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own
               torture  flanked by harding and damon on either side

               int morgue basement alpine grove christmas eve

               theyre all in the room starks seems pretty calm only in a
               cu do we see his eyes register the jacket

                                     becker
                           im glad to see youre cooperating
                           this time mr starks

               starks looks at the wide sturdy restraints on it they would
               really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with
               them they might even knock someone out

               damon and harding move to undress him when starks makes a
               move to do it himself they look to dr becker who nods that
               its all right

               damon begrudgingly lets go of starks but not before he steps
               on one of starks bare feet

               starks doesnt flinch he merely turns away from them and
               bends down to take off his pants on his way up he grabs the
               jacket off its hook and using it like a weapon aims to
               smack it across damons face damon deftly ducks and the
               jacket hits becker instead the force of the blow sends
               becker down and as he falls against the wall damon and
               harding leap to restrain starks

               becker   opens and closes his eyes trying to get them into
               focus   his right cheek is cut pretty bad dr gries helps
               becker   to his feet and picks his broken glasses up off the
               floor   becker puts them on

                                       dr gries
                             hold him while i get the
                             tranquilizer

                                       damon
                             fuck the tranquilizer i got a foot

               damon kicks starks hard in the back nearly sending him down

                                       becker
                             no thats not necessary

               becker looks down and sees his own blood fall on the floor
               he looks up at starks who even in his pain looks shocked at
               the force he just used

                                       becker
                             let him go more firmly i said let
                             him go

               as soon as they let him go starks lunges for becker 
               pushing him up against the wall starks stops presumably
               about to harm becker but unsure even to himself of what
               hes capable of doing

               becker looks fearlessly into starks eyes

                                      becker an inch away from his face
                            what starks what are you going to
                            do end me just because im an
                            inconvenience to you beat just
                            like you did with officer harrison

               starks face registers the meaning in beckers words and a
               look of selfdoubt crosses his face

                                     becker
                           the only thing your mind is missing
                           is a conscience

               starks lets go of him and as soon as he does damon and
               harding restrain him becker calmly wipes the blood from his
               face looks at his hand shakes his head and walks out

                                     dr gries
                           waitdr becker how long do you
                           want us to leave him in for

               becker doesnt answer he doesnt even turn around dr gries
               goes after him

                                     dr gries
                           just strap him in for now

               and damon and harding start to

               int beckers office alpine grove christmas eve some time

               later

               becker turns around from the window and we see that his cheek
               is bandaged he opens a drawer takes out some scotch and
               pours himself a shot he swallows some pills with it

               after he drinks it he looks up to see gries standing
               opposite him watching

                                       dr gries

               someone in the wall

               int cadaver drawer

               starks finds himself in the physically wrenching place once
               more but nothing happens for some seconds he breathes
               anxiously not knowing what to expect his heart beats
               steadily thumpthump until finally with each beat a
               small white fleck becomes two flecksthen two
               dotsthen two circlesthen the whites of a pair of
               eyes with a terrific meanness in them

               the eyes blink then disappear like they were never there

               the pace of starks heart quickens and the inexplicable
               madness surrounds him once more

               ext murder scene highway vermont dusk

               the sounds of bombs rage around him but hes in the middle of
               the murder scene watching officer harrison lie on the floor
               he turns to look over his shoulder and sees

               ext iraqi village night

               through a phosphorescent green nightvision camera we see fire
               flesh and ruin littering the sand slowly the
               terrifying images shift to a naturalistic realtime
               documentation of the action  the ruin  as its occurring

               as starks blinks tears fall and he hears over it all a
               counseling voice

               the terrible sounds become less terrible as they fade away

                           they dont eat you when theres music
                           playing

               the scene morphs slowly and the following images appear
               vaguely  forming the walls of the tunnel around him

                 1 cu a womans neck and a small childs hand

                 2 int stairway old house starks childhood home

               starks walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the images
               they move like theyre liquid and when they settle the
               whole wall is replaced with one large image of a beautiful
               woman  a waitress  standing at the counter of a coffee
               shop moving a strand of hair out of her face with her hand

               starks blinks slowly  struck by this dream of her he reaches
               out and closes his palm around her like he might catch hold
               of the moment with this simple gesture

               the whole wall of images twinkles marvelously as we

                                                        cut to

               ext diner small town vermont christmas eve

               the waitress early 20s  tired with kind eyes soft skin
               and a beautiful mouth that hasnt smiled in a long time 
               emerges from the diner even with no effort she is
               remarkably pretty

               from her uniform we know that her day was spent there
               starks simply stares at this woman who seems markedly removed
               from the world around her the only fact she wears on her is
               that shes tired

               she spots starks and cant help but do a doubletake both
               are momentarily taken with each other though she tries to
               hide any indication that she is

               int waitress car

               she gets in her old car and starts it as it warms up she
               looks for starks in her rearview mirror and sees hes still
               there

               he starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car

               ext parking lot diner vermont christmas eve

               the waitress treads angrily towards starks

                                     waitress
                           where do you think youre going

               starks looks at her he doesnt know anymore than she does

                                     waitress
                           you gonna answer me

               starks just stares

                                     waitress

               she turns and gets back in her car slamming the door shut
               she starts to drive and starks stares after her

               after a few hundred yards she slams on the brakes and turns
               the car round coming back then she jumps out of the car and
               heads back in the diner without looking over at starks

               ext diner small town vermont some seconds later

               she comes out  this time purse in hand  and sighs at
               starks

                                     waitress
                           as if she owes him an explanation i
                           forgot my purse

               starks nods slowly the waitress gets in her car and looks
               again at starks in her rearview mirror he has hardly any
               winter gear on him  no gloves no hat no coat  just jeans
               and a flannel he looks lost among his surroundings as much
               because he doesnt know where he is as because he doesnt
               look like he belongs there

               she reverses towards him

                                     waitress

               she looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel

                                     waitress
                           all right beat you got somewhere

               being cold and freezing are his options

                                     waitress

                           so where do you want me to drop you

               starks rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it
               over she watches him curiously

                                     starks
                           im not sure

                                     waitress
                           you dont have anywhere to stay

                                     starks
                           i dont think so

               the waitress takes out a flask and a sizable swig from it
               she swallows it smoothly like someone used to doing so

                                     waitress
                           well where are you from

                                     starks
                           im not sure beat i dont really
                           know

                                     waitress
                           because in my life it wouldnt make
                           sense for me to pick up some normal
                           guy with a place where hes from and
                           a place where hes going to itd be
                           too simple i probably wouldnt know
                           how to handle a situation like that

                                     starks
                           well you definitely didnt pick
                           normal or simple this time either

               she looks over at him  momentarily suspicious he looks back
               innocuously theres something innately safe about him

                                     waitress
                           at least youre honest thats some
                           kind of start

               starks sees her take another drink from the flask she pulls
               out a cigarette and starks lights it for her with some

               matches

                                     waitress
                           thats great youre not sure where
                           youre from or where youre going
                           but at least youve got manners

               she laughs noticeably more relaxed now after the drink

                                     waitress
                           well you got a coat or something

                                      starks looking down at his clothes
                            no doesnt look like it

                                     waitress

                                     starks

                                     waitress

                           no

                           no beat not around here

               she casts a long sideward glance at starks taking him and
               her circumstances in for herself he looks back gently

                                      waitress

               as he wonders whether hes being taken out of the jacket

               as she presumably cleans it up we stay on starks who slowly
               gains hold of himself she comes back drink in hand and
               pushes the strand of hair in her face back the same way she
               did when he saw her in the tunnel even through her
               weariness she looks radiant under the christmas lights she
               takes a long sip

               starks looks in her fridge theres not much to work with 
               just some jars and plenty of vodka

               int living room waitress apartment some time later

               starks has lit a fire and set out a feeble dinner for them
               when the waitress comes out of the bedroom in sweats

                                     waitress

                           your fridge

               she looks and sees a sandwich on a bun in one plate and a
               sandwich on two different colors of toast on the other

               then she looks over at the fire its obvious from the way
               she looks at it that its been years if ever since
               someones done something like this for her

                                     starks
                           i only lit it because it was so cold

               she turns and goes in the kitchen calling out to him

                                     waitress
                           you want a drink

               int kitchen waitress apartment night

               as she makes their drinks a curious look crosses her face
               just for a second

               int living room waitress apartment a little while later

               theyve sat down to eat under the blinking christmas lights

                                     waitress

                           thanks

               they eat quietly for a second starks looks at her then down
               at his food still subtly stunned by it all

                                     starks

                           its

                                     starks
                           that i dont really know whats real

               she stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on
               her lips

                                     waitress
                           well good for you

               starks smiles back uncertainly

                                     starks
                           you dont think thats crazy

                                     waitress

               she holds up her glass somewhat sadly

                                     waitress
                           sometimes i dont know the difference
                           myself and you know something i
                           think i like it better that way
                           finishes her drink you want another
                           one

               she goes to the kitchen and starks clears their plates

               int living room waitress apartment

               starks goes in the kitchen as she comes out with their
               drinks he hears her turn on the radio she lands on an
               oldies station thats playing girl of north country by bob
               dylan

               int kitchen waitress apartment night

               starks smiles a little then realizes he remembers and
               likes the song its the first familiar thing for him in
               days

               he walks out slowly to the living room where the waitress
               sits on the couch drinking starks moves closer to the
               radio leaning into it listening and forgetting for a short
               while  only as long as a piece of song  everything else

                                     bob dylan
                           if you go when the snow flakes storm
                           when the rivers freeze and summer
                           ends
                           please see she has a coat so warm
                           to keep her from the howlin winds

               starks listens close  smiling a small sad smile over the
               harmonica we pull back and see two very lonely people
               passing time together the way people sometimes need to be
               able to

                                     starks
                           this is a great song

                                     waitress
                           you remember it

                                      starks nodding slowly
                            its like i feel likei know who i
                            am i just cant remember anything
                            that made me this person

               when starks looks at her then hes so close to a meltdown
               that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it

                                     starks
                           but hey who can forget those words
                           the man just wants simple and good
                           things for his woman  that she be
                           warm and happy how hard can that be
                           to remember

                                     waitress
                           may be easy to remember but not easy
                           to get being warm maybe  but

               the christmas lights flash drowsily to their own tempo

                            why dont i try to get them to stop
                            blinking

               int living room waitress apartment an hour or so later

               she is visibly drained after the day and the drinks

                                     starks
                           they told me i joined the army when i

                           she fucked herself up day after day
                           and then one day she fell asleep
                           with a burning cigarette beat i
                           came home from work and she was gone

               the tears still run after all these years

                                     starks
                           im sorry

                                     waitress

                           the last ten years

                                     starks
                           that when you stopped being a nurse

               she is surprised that he gleaned the connection  and that hed
               been listening so closely

                                     waitress exhausted
                           yeah thats when i stopped being a
                           nurse i never thought i could stop
                           being one i wanted it for so long
                           but you just cant do it anymore
                           when you lose someone like that you
                           cant take care of other people

               she closes her eyes and finally passes out starks watches
               her face lit serenely by the fire and the christmas lights
               it bears her grief even in sleep

               he covers her with a blanket then looks around and spots the
               only personal effects in the room on her mantle he walks
               towards them tripping slightly on a cord from the lights he
               stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall

               as he pulls himself up he spots what is only inches away
               from where his hand landed on the wall his own dog tags
               given to jackie only a couple weeks ago hanging from a
               single nail tacked into the wall

               stunned he stares at his name and birth date scored on the
               metal he looks back at the waitress and then to the few
               pictures on the mantle they are of jackie and her mother
               jean starks runs his hand through his hair trying to
               swallow the improbability and inexplicability of the
               situation
               starks eyes search the room for anything that could help him
               figure out whats happening on the console is an old paper
               and some mail totally disoriented starks nearly stumbles on
               his way to the pile

               the label on the first bill reads jackie price on the
               second the same and the thirduntil at the bottom of the
               pile starks spots an old newspaper with the answer on its
               date december 3 2004

               starks is absolutely stunned
               starks looks over at jackie and just then the harsh sound
               of the drawer being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and
               the image of her starts to dissolve at this worst moment he
               is being taken out of the jacket

               int morgue basement alpine grove late night

               its dr gries racked with guilt who pulls starks out

               he winces at the sight of the blood and sweat streaked across
               starks face dr gries checks his pulse and cleans his face
               as best as he can with a wet towel

                                      dr gries
                            william can you hear me

               his voice echoes in the morgue sounding to starks as it
               does to us faint and distant dr gries drips some water in
               starks mouth as some of it trickles out it runs into the
               jacket burning starks chafed skin

               starks eyes flutter and dr gries pushes the drawer back in
               afraid of what theyve done to this man

               int cadaver drawer

               starks clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes five
               seconds of total blackness and silence and hes back in

               int living room waitress jackies apartment night

               only now hes kneeling beside her sleeping face just
               looking at it starks doesnt know whats going on but her
               serene sleeping face steadies him he can only call out the
               name he thinks she might respond to

                                     starks
                           jackie jackie

               sure enough she answers with a stir in her sleep

                                     jackie
                           hm

               we see in starks eyes the unbelievable connection she is
               the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992

                                     starks swallowing softly
                           jackie beat what year is it

                                     jackie in a drunken slumber
                           what

                                     starks
                           what year is it

                                     jackie barely opening her eyes
                           2004

               starks looks around as jackie moves in her sleep almost
               falling off the couch starks picks her up and in her sleep
               she wraps her arms around his neck

               int bedroom jackies apartment night

               starks tenderly lays her down on the bed

               int living room jackies apartment night

               starks picks up his dog tags from the console looks around
               spots the television and fumbles a bit as he figures out how
               to turn it on starks sits down throws back the rest of
               jackies drink and another shot and looks around nervously
               unable to explain whats happening to him

                                                         fade to

               int bedroom jackies apartment christmas morning

               jackie sits in her sleep as she wakes up clearly hung over

               int bathroom jackies apartment christmas morning

               as jackie closes the medicine cabinet she sees her hungover
               reflection in it

               she puts her face under the water and lets it restore some
               color and life in her as she comes up thats when she
               remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in
               her sleep

                                     starks os echoing distantly
                           jackie beat what year is it
               she shoots up from the sink staring at her reflection

               int living room jackies apartment seconds later

               jackie spots starks asleep on the couch  newspaper strewn
               all around him and the tv still on hes holding the tags

               she kneels down close to his face and stares at him for
               awhile before starks is jarred he defensively grabs her
               wrist as his eyes burst open startling her

                                     jackie desperately
                           who are you

               starks lets his grip loosen

                                     starks
                           beat im william starks

               jackie grabs the nearest object  the iron fork from the
               fireplace set  and holds it shaking against starks starks
               stays calm he hardly expected a different reaction

                                     jackie

                           how

               then he remembers  understanding with a chill that what she
               is saying could entirely be true

                                     starks

               starks falters under the news jackie looks around through
               her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the
               apartment she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table
               lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then
               laughs nervously as she looks up

                                     jackie

               starks looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave
               jackie a little calmer looks at the door like hes still on
               the other side of it and calls out softly and sadly

                                     jackie
                           happy birthday

               int jackettunnel passage

               starks looks around him and we see from bottom up the
               exterior around jackies house melt away as starks suddenly
               faces the massacred village in iraq shocked at whats
               happening to his body he looks up petrified his body is
               wound as tightly as a knot

               ext iraqi village night 1991

               again were glimpsing the scene through phosphorescent green
               night vision intermittently negotiated with realtime images

               opposite starks stands a crazed iraqi soldier  seething in
               anger and pointing his gun at a little boy presumably
               belonging to the man not five feet away next to starks is an
               angry captain medley ordering starks to follow him starks
               is watching himself in the scene

                                     medley
                           you walk on they pick up their guns
                           and fire at you you stay they pick
                           up and fire at each other and you
                           walk on

                                     starks
                           hes got his gun pointed at a kid

                                     medley
                           that is not our problem

                                     starks
                           yeah well none of this is our
                           fuckin problem

               starks turns and aims his gun at a crazed iraqi soldier
               threatening to shoot a child we hear him yelling in arabic

               what starks doesnt see is another iraqi soldier 2 aiming
               his gun at starks

                                     medley
                           we are leaving this site right now

               starks doesnt hear him hes busy perfecting his aim

                                      starks to the first iraqi soldier
                            hey

               at the force of the word the soldier lowers his gun and the
               little boy flees

               starks who is now in the scene himself lowers his gun
               slightly as he approaches the soldier neither speaks the
               others language but theyre both saying everything with
               their eyes neither moves his off the other

               just then though we see the second iraqi soldier get a
               clear aim at starks

               he takes his shot before anyone else does starks goes down
               as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off

               he falls to the ground as the rest of the picture fades to
               black all that is left is previously mysterious still
               haunting pair of eyes that we now see belonged to the

               crazed iraqi soldier

               and over it all is the now more distant clank of metal as the
               drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended

                                                          fade to black

               int morgue alpine grove christmas day

                           is he impatiently is he dead

               becker feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one

               int another hallway alpine grove day

               dr lorenson spots becker walking out the doors of the

                           dr becker dr beckertom wait

               dr becker stops walking and waits a moment registering the
               voice before he turns around to face dr lorenson

                                     lorenson out of breath
                           wheres william starks

                                     becker
                           hes recovering on the third floor

                                     starks

                           his behaviors hardly suggested he
                           needed neuroleptics

                                     becker

                                     lorenson firmly
                           he didnt need antipsychotics if
                           thats even all youre giving him

               becker ignores lorensons insinuation and merely turns his
               cheek all the way round towards lorenson so he can see the
               bandage from the cut starks gave him

                                      becker steadily
                            after he slashed me with a hospital
                            instrument i determined in my
                            professional opinion that mr

               lorenson looks back starting to grasp beckers misshapen
               beliefs

                                      becker

                   alpine grove investigation into the mysterious death of
                   william starks

                   the body of william starks the former war hero who was

                   starks was believed to have died from a wound to the
                   head

               int starks hospital room december 26th

               a nurse is checking on starks as he slowly wakes up

                                      starks
                            what the hell kind of drugs are you
                            people giving me

               starks is asking the nurse but its beckers voice that
               answers though starks cant see him

                                      becker os
                            just something to help you sleep

               starks panics when he hears the voice he looks around
               nervously but the bright sunlight pouring into the room is
               blinding he swallows as he looks at the nurses face as she
               continues adjusting his pillows

                                      starks swallowing nervously
                            did you say something

               the nurse shakes her head lightly and just then becker steps
               out of the light

                                      becker
                            i said the drugs were to help you
                            sleep beat did you sleep well

               becker is remarkably calm further confusing starks sense of
               reality

                                      starks doubtfully
                            but i wasnt asleep was i

                                      becker
                            yes you were you were asleep for
                            nearly a whole day its december
                            26th william

               starks sits up groggily remembering what happened to him and
               wondering how much if any of it was real

                                     starks
                           its december 26th

               starks examines himself  looking at his arms spotting the
               bruises on them

                                      becker
                            thats right william

                                      starks slowly figuring it out
                            1992

               becker nods starks sits up  his predicament and the room
               slowly coming into focus

                                     becker
                           yes caustically and thats the sun
                           and youre on earth beat and i
                           know you know better

               starks begins to piece if together becker as we begin to
               see is right it is 1992 in alpine grove

                                     starks
                           i dont know better all i know is
                           that you left me in there

                                       becker
                           in where

                                     starks
                           uncertainly in that thingthe
                           jacket

               the nurse gives becker a knowing look  suggesting starks
               really is delusional becker doesnt even flinch as starks
               tries to get a better look at beckers face

                                     becker
                           we were forced to use restrains if
                           thats what youre referring to

                                     starks
                           that wasnt a fucking restraint

                                     becker
                           actually thats exactly what our
                           equipment is

               starks eyes widen with alarm as becker reaches for the iv
               in his arm lingering on it long enough that starks braces
               himself for an attack of some sort but becker just looks
               back innocently as he adjusts it

                                       becker
                           relax

                                     starks
                           dont act like i dont know whats
                           real beat im not the one thats
                           crazy here

                                     becker
                           pointedly of course youre not

               then he clarifies wryly enough for starks to catch it

                                     becker
                           youre just suffering from delusions
                           that are unfortunately part of your
                           condition

                                     starks
                           dont give me that i know whats
                           real goddamnit you strapped me in
                           something and stuck me in a drawer

               becker nods diagnostically the nurses nonchalance about it
               as she leaves the room further disquiets starks

                                     starks
                           i didnt dream it i may have been
                           asleep but it wasnt a dream
               becker sits down in a chair halfshrouded in the light

                                     becker
                           i had a patient a few years ago his
                           name was ted casey

                                     starks
                           i dont give a shit about your
                           patient

                                     becker
                           i wasnt pausing to see if you did
                           beat but incidentally you should
                           because youre birds of a feather

               starks squints as he searches out beckers face

                                     becker
                           ted raped and sodomized a sevenyear
                           old girl beat his lawyers asked me
                           to have a look at him because after
                           his deeds were done he climbed
                           into the trees of the forest where he
                           killed her and woofed like a dog he
                           couldnt even remember his name when
                           i spoke to him but curiously
                           enough he could speak back beat
                           ted never went to prison because
                           everyone  including me  was
                           convinced he was sick so he came
                           here

               becker leans into starks view to make sure hes listening
               starks is

                                     becker
                           then one day a little girl came with
                           her mother to visit a relative and i
                           caught ted stealing looks at her 
                           the kind you really have to steal if
                           you know what i mean beat i asked
                           ted then if he could remember what
                           the little girl who he had slain

                           look ill never forget and when he
                           answered it wasnt with a color or
                           any sort of physical description id
                           expect oh yes he said i remember
                           it i remember it well beat those
                           were actually his last words i think

               beckers expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and
               remorse as he recounts teds tale

                                     starks
                           we are not birds of a feather

                                     becker
                           maybe not beat but i do think
                           youre in a tree woofing like a
                           dog and im just trying to help you
                           the only way i can think of

               becker gets up and as he moves out of the light starks sees
               his bandaged cheek reinforcing his memory of what
               happened

                                     starks provokingly
                           what happened to your cheek dr
                           becker

               int starks room recovery ward alpine grove day 1992

               starks looks out on the snowcovered grounds from his room on
               the third floor he seems pacified for the moment

               int hallway recovery ward alpine grove day

               everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad
               mechanics of managing madness catatonic patients and dated
               equipment litter the hall and as we follow a nurse who walks
               among them we spot starks  arms suspended in air and glazed
               eyes fixed on the ceiling  pretending to be one of them

               his arms fall and he wipes his dried mouth as soon as she
               passes starks has successfully made it out of his room she
               turns one corner as starks hustles to turn another

               int day room alpine grove

               starks is almost   there as random orderlies pass him starks
               lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head
               down so low they   cant see his face they pass and starks
               starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside

               as soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold  with
               only his blue patient uniform  starks walks normally like
               he no longer remembers the risks instead he remembers what
               jackie told him

                                     jackie os
                           they found william starks body dead
                           in the snow

                                     starks os
                           howd he die

                                     jackie os
                           i dont know but he did die

               ext grounds alpine grove

               starks leans down  seemingly oblivious to the cold  and
               lifts some snow to his mouth tasting it like a man who needs
               to affirm he is still alive hes so rapt that lorensons
               voice takes him by surprise

                                     lorenson
                           hey youre not supposed to be out
                           here
               starks stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where
               his body was found the terrible question asks itself on his
               face is this when starks is killed

                                     starks turning around sharply
                           what are you going to do to me

                                       lorenson
                           well

               as lorenson reaches into his pocket for something starks
               anxiously holds his breath its black when it comes out and
               a ski hat when it opens up starks lets out his breath
               relieved

                                     lorenson nonchalantly
                           i thought id just ask you to come
                           back inside with me

                                     starks
                           and if i didnt want to come

                                     lorenson
                           i guess id ask you why

                                     starks
                           because i dont think im crazy

                                     lorenson
                           youre not crazy

               starks is surprised by lorensons agreement

                                     lorenson
                           you suffer from delusional disorder
                           that doesnt mean youre crazy it
                           just means youre confused and
                           youre here instead of in jail
                           because that was determined to have
                           played a role in your killing of a
                           police officer

                                     starks correcting him
                           alleged killing of a police officer

                                     lorenson
                           you were convicted of the crime

                                     starks
                           that conviction doesnt convince me
                           of anything until i know that i did
                           it im not going to accept that i
                           did

                                     lorenson
                           you may never remember at all beat
                           your minds grasp of reality and the
                           real events that have happened to you
                           has been damaged

                                     starks
                           no the real events that have
                           happened to me have been fucked up
                           not my mind

               lorenson seems to realize  at least for an instant  that he
               is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively and
               cogently staring back at him

                                     starks
                           beat william id like to ask you
                           something if i can

                                     starks
                           since when do people around here have
                           to ask permission to do anything

                                     lorenson suspiciously
                           hows your treatment progressing with
                           dr becker

               starks still doesnt know how much lorenson knows and if he
               should trust him

                                     starks
                           fine beat why made you ask

               lorenson answers first with his eyes looking over starks
               body starks merely stares back tersely

                                      lorenson carefully
                            i just hope youd let me know if that
                            wasnt the case

                                     starks
                           why what would you do

                                     starks
                           i could try tomake it stop

                                     starks
                           no i dont want it to

                                     lorenson
                           so its helping

                                     starks choosing his words carefully
                           beat its making me feel like a
                           different person

               lorenson  sensing shes not going to get any more from
               starks  turns around to go back inside its only as she
               turns her face away from starks that we see how nervous she
               is but youd never guess it from her tone

                                      lorenson casually
                            you comin

               starks looks towards the fences locking him in from every
               direction lorenson waits until she hears starks footsteps
               following her she waits until starks has reached her

                                      lorenson
                            you should be careful you could be
                            killed if they found you out here

                                      starks
                            believe me i know

               int patient cafeteria ward alpine grove 1992

               starks and mackenzie are eating opposite each other

                                      starks
                            what were you talking about the other
                            day

                                      mackenzie
                            i wasnt talking about anything

                                      starks

                            them taking me out to the woods

               mackenzie clams up slightly at the mention of it

                                      starks
                            what do you know about the jacket

               mackenzies eyes start to twitch nervously

                                      mackenzie
                            i know you need one when its really

                                      mackenzie
                            mortalitys actually a great thing to
                            be familiar with it means youre
                            sane on some level

                                      starks

                                      starks
                            the jacket

               mackenzie grows visibly more nervous at this second mention
               of it

                                     mackenzie
                           oh no youre pretty young your
                           bodyll be able to handle a lot more

                                     starks
                           no beat i mean i found out while i

                           found in four days

               just then nurse harding is upon them she carries a rod in
               her hand which she taps menacingly on the floor as she walks
               towards them

                                     harding
                           what are you two yappin about

               starks tenses up as he sees only the rod which could inflict
               a gash if hit across a mans head the right way nearly every
               object could be a threat to his life as this point

                                     mackenzie spoken like a nut
                           beat were talking about our
                           ability to go forward in time to go
                           into the future to starks that is
                           what were talking about here right

               starks is startled mackenzie gets it

                                     starks

                                     starks smiling

                           think were doing in this place

               mackenzie tries not to laugh but a chuckle slips out

                                     harding

                           i want the two of you to shut the
                           fuck up and eat your food

               harding walks away with a final stare that starks returns

                                     starks under his breath
                           i gotta get back in it mackenzie

                                     mackenzie

                           why

               mackenzies body betrays his discomfort talking about it in

               int hallway alpine grove 1992 day

               dr lorenson and dr gries are walking briskly to a meeting

                                     dr gries
                           were late

                                     lorenson
                           i wish theyd skip the formality of
                           this annual review and just cut our
                           budget our silence on the matter
                           should be enough to appease the civic
                           conscience without wasting an hour we
                           dont have

                                     dr gries
                           maybe its not such a waste

               lorenson looks at gries askance before she sets the record
               straight

                                     lorenson
                           its the ticking of a box on a sheet
                           of paper no one cares about

                                     dr gries
                           they dont care about all the things
                           we do right beat but they might
                           they might care about what were
                           doing wrong beat thats what they
                           should come here to look for

               lorenson can see gries is trying to tell her something

                                     lorenson
                           what should they be looking for

                                     dr gries
                           they should just be looking harder

               lorenson grabs gries arm sensing the import of her words

                                     lorenson
                           where beat its becker isnt it

                           we got a session to catch now

               int ward 3 alpine grove 1992 day

               starks is in a different ward with patients who appear more
               threatening and disturbed as he is anxiously looking around 
               presumably for a way out  starks hears one of the patients
               humming an eerily discordant melody looking to see who it
               comes from starks happens to spot one patient  a young
               fiercelooking guy  eyeing a young nurse sally
               administering medication from a dated cart

               starks looks around the room and notes there are no doctors
               or orderlies around the young nurse meanwhile is focused
               on the medicine  oblivious to the brute eyeing her

               the brutes not that far away when he starts walking towards
               the young nurse starks starts in their direction picking up
               speed  maneuvering through various incoherent patients  as
               the brute reaches the nurse

               he throws her tray down and pushes her against the wall she
               starts screaming as he pushes up against her starks picks up
               the tray and strikes the brute across the head with it

               the brute holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his
               balance its clear hes impaired but its also clear he
               understands pain

                                      starks to sally
                            you ok

               as she nods her eyes dart above to the hand about to strike
               him off her look he ducks and turns around punching the
               brute in the stomach  hard  but not before the piece of glass
               he held from one of the broken medicine bottles comes
               perilously close to starks head

               the brute bowls over and starks looks at the glass terrified
               is this when he dies

               the brute  incensed more than ever  lunges at him a final time
               starks gets him by the neck expertly applying pressure
               points and after only a few seconds subdues him starks
               himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them he lets
               out a suspended breath instinctively touching his forehead
               to make sure hes not cut he looks back at sally

                                     sally
                           are you ok

                                     starks
                           yeah why are you in this ward alone
                           where is everyone

                                     sally defensively
                           theres a state rep visiting so
                           theyve moved everyone around but
                           ive been alone before

                                     starks
                           where are the other orderlies

                                     sally
                           in the therapy session downstairs
                           thats what the reps sitting in
                           on

                                     starks
                           ok listen i want you to get out of
                           here and lock the door behind you
                           ill go get some doctors

               sally looks at starks wondering whether she can trust him
               her eyes shift to the brute on the floor and she remembers
               that she can

               int main room ward alpine grove day 1992

               the state rep  40s disgruntled even drowsy  is
               recognizable among a group that includes the chief of staff
               dr williams becker lorenson and gries they are
               presiding over a group therapy session when starks enters

                                      starks calling out
                            sorry im late dr becker

               becker is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response

                                      becker
                            mr starks this session is for our

                            mr starks back to his ward
               starks cuts him off and threatens with his gaze

                                      starks derisively
                            no please dr becker you can strap
                            me in a jacket or even gag me but

                            most progress

               becker relents seeing starks has the upper hand  an
               audience deranged but eager no less

                                      becker
                            fine mr starks you can pull up a
                            chair for yourself

               as starks walks across the room its obvious to everyone  as
               they turn their heads to watch him  that he is a physically
               ailing man using all his strength he walks up slowly to the
               group dragging a chair behind him because he doesnt have
               the strength to lift it starks sits down

                                      becker
                            mr jensen please continue

               jensen  a twitchy schizophrenic  surveys the group
               seriously determining whether its safe to say what hes
               about to

                                      jensen

                                     becker calm as ever

                           for the organized

               the other patients look at him in wonder as the state rep
               listens limply

                                     becker
                           the organizationfor the organized

                                      becker wearily
                            what do the rest of you think

               the group stares at one another silently

                                      starks loud and emphatic
                            well beat i know they exist

                                     becker
                           and how is that

               starks looks at jensen who looks back avidly mackenzie eyes
               starks nervously like he senses what he is about to do

                                     starks
                           when i was in the gulf the
                           organization was recruiting the

                                     becker incensed

                           if its not it doesnt help mr

                                      starks looking right at jensen
                            it is a fact bona fide and
                            classified

               lorenson and mackenzie watch starks curiously

                                     jensen
                           i knew it i knew it those little
                           fuckers are everywhere

                                     starks
                           they recruit only the best mr
                           jensen beat i didnt want to have
                           to say this

               not even the doctors dare disrupt the silence

                                     starks
                           but these people pointing to the
                           doctors know about it in fact when
                           presidents of this country and heads
                           of state leave office they come

                           picked you

               jensen looks on nobly

                                     starks
                           theyre always ordering us to stay
                           calm but how can we be calm

               starks suddenly turns right at becker wrapping his message
               to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut

                                     starks
                           looking suddenly directly at becker
                           all they do is give orders thats
                           all they have to do and no one will
                           ever know all it comes down to is an
                           order beat theyve got hands
                           everywhere

               starks stands up ready to salute mr jensen the observers
               look to becker for order

                                     starks
                           long live the organization for the
                           organized

                           starks

               but at that jensens completely lost it his excitement
               erupts in the form of him jumping out of his chair and
               eagerly and elatedly hitting himself in the head

                                     becker
                           sit down mr jensen

               too late other patients are on their feet hands jubilantly
               up in the air and in the midst of the havoc the speechless
               order is soundly delivered in beckers nod to damon

                                     random patients
                           dr thatcher dr becker

               damon and harding grab starks while the other members of the
               staff slowly calm the other patients lorenson is too busy to
               notice them taking starks out starks winks at mackenzie who
               smiles somewhat sadly back

                                                        cut to

               int morgue basement alpine grove late night 1992

               harding and damon stand above starks who lies on the brutal

               damon slams him in the drawer

               int jackettunnel passage

               starks eyes dart about him it sounds like something is in
               there with him the sound stops momentarily and then out of
               nowhere a drop falls on his eye ping starks winces he
               clenches his face not knowing when the next drop will fall
               his heart starts to beat more and more madly punctuated by
               the drips  making a score fit only for hell he closes his
               eyes and begins to die

               ext crime scene highway vermont dusk 1992

               starks and tenny  30s shifty a total stranger  sit in
               silence in tennys car we recognize the murder scene red
               police lights flash in the rearview mirror though starks
               doesnt see them yet

               starks and tenny are talking to one another tennys voice
               takes a dangerous tone

                                     tenny
                           you ever been to jail

                                     starks
                           no

               tenny nods distracting starks long enough to slip a hand
               down his leg to the gun hes hidden there

                                     tenny
                           its worse than war its worse than
                           anywhere youve ever been

                                     starks

                           prisons so bad you dont want to
                           remember it

               tenny carefully pulls over to the side of the road assured
               and cautious with each word each move

                                     tenny
                           well ive never been to war but im
                           sure as hell not going back to
                           prison

                                      starks finally spotting harrison
                            whats he pulling us over for

                                     tenny still preparing himself
                           recreation

               officer harrison walks up to their car

                                     officer harrison
                           gentlemen im gonna need you to step
                           out of the car with your hands at
                           your side please

                                     starks
                           why

                                     officer harrison sternly
                           step out of the car

                                     starks
                           ok sir i was just asking what for

                                     officer harrison
                           this is a stolen vehicle youre
                           driving now put your hands in the
                           air out where i can see em

               thats the second when officer harrison sees where tennys
               hand is as he reaches for his own gun the situation
               explodes as two flashes eclipse all else officer harrison
               goes down still holding his own gun and starks jumps out of
               the car to check on him

                                     starks
                           jesus christ whatd you do that for

               tenny looks around still holding the gun starks swallows
               assessing whether to back away or not tenny waves his gun as
               he half points it in harrisons direction then gun still in
               hand he smirks nervously and looks at starks

                                     tenny
                           man if youre so deaf and dumb you
                           aint even worth a fucking bullet

               tenny raises the gun then aims it away from starks and
               shoots officer harrison once more from the ground officer
               harrison fires back and starks now lunging at tenny takes

               the hit

               starks falls clearly unable to get up let alone pursue
               anyone tenny smiles sardonically and slowly puts the gun in
               his back pocket as he turns to leave this smile was one of
               the eerie flashes that haunted starks in the jacket

               starks struggles but cant move thats when he passes out
               looking at officer harrison from the ground as he did in the
               scene before

               int jackettunnel passage

               starks stands in the lighted tunnel which only gets brighter
               as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that hes
               back in there then he sees an image of a womans forehead
               that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the light
               gradually dims

                                                        fade to black

               int diner small town vermont 2004

               starks enters the diner calming down even more as he spots
               jackie she looks up holding plates in her hand shes
               understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she
               sees him she greets him with a small smile

               she drops off her orders and then walks up to him

                                     jackie
                           ill be off in 15 minutes can you

               ext ravine vermont day 2004

               starks and jackie smoke in the cold standing next to the
               hood of her car

                                     jackie

                           it was banned you know and it led
                           to an investigation of dr beckers
                           mistreatment of some of his patients
                           thats when they found out how badly
                           he was drugging his patients

                                      starks starting to make sense
                            so he was giving me all kinds of
                            drugs

                                     jackie nodding
                           apparently he was taking a lot of
                           them too it said he was trying out
                           behavior modification treatments that
                           were banned back in the 70s  womb
                           treatment is the name he gave to
                           what he did to you

                                      starks cutting in

               jackie looks around her coupled with the cold her sobriety
               is obvious starks takes hold of her and holds her face close
               to his so that their foreheads touch

                                        jackie

                           drunk woman and her little girl on
                           the side of the road not without
                           hurting them

               int administrative office alpine grove 2004

               starks and jackie sit opposite dr morgan the current young
               face of the hospital morgan has a boyish face and a matching
               gullibility

                           own medical examiners determined only
                           that he died from a blunt trauma to
                           the head but that was right around
                           the time the alpine groves staff
                           changed and im afraid we didnt have
                           the best record system before then

                                     starks

                           1993 but do you know if that was
                           long after he had died

                                     dr morgan

                           doubt the hospital would have that

               starks doesnt waver when he answers

                                     starks
                           he was the only family i remember

                                     dr morgan nodding
                           ill see what i can find out about
                           dr becker and maybe dr lorenson
                           will know something

               int ward alpine grove day 2004

               dr morgan leads jackie and starks through a ward starks
               looks around in disbelief its more like a hospital now than
               it ever was in 1993

               int reception area lorensons office alpine grove 2004

               as they arrive outside lorensons office morgan turns to
               them

                                     dr morgan

                           let me just tell her were here

               dr morgan goes inside and jackie takes starks hand as they
               wait its hardly more than a couple seconds when lorenson
               appears in the doorway she looks at starks curiously and the
               two share a very lengthy intense stare

               dr lorenson  now in her 50s  walks closer to starks
               suspiciously for his part starks doesnt look as unfamiliar
               with lorenson as he should this doesnt escape lorenson

                                     lorenson
                           hello im beth lorenson

               she puts out a hand that is trembling slightly

                                     lorenson
                           its nice to meet you mr starks

               starks hesitates before he takes lorensons hand there is
               something very eerie about the exchange starks quickly lets
               go and lorenson turns to jackie

                                     lorenson
                           and you are

               jackie looks back uncomfortably

                                     jackie
                           im just williams friend

               lorenson looks over both of them acutely and then calmly
               turns to dr morgan

                                     lorenson
                           i think well be fine from here
                           thanks stanley

               int lorensons office alpine grove 2004

               lorenson leans against her desk while starks and jackie sit
               in the chairs as they talk each seems cautious in his
               exchange  not knowing what the other one does or doesnt
               know

                                     lorenson
                           my god you look exactly like him

                                     starks
                           i never knew my father did you

                                     lorenson
                           yeah i did beat he was my most
                           memorable patient

                                     starks
                           why

               lorenson considers her answer

                                     lorenson
                           at the end he made me change my mind
                           about a lot of things

                                     starks
                           you thought my father was crazy

                                     starks
                           no i dont think he was crazy he
                           needed helpbut he wasnt crazy
                           beat your father actually helped me
                           with a case of mine

               lorenson waits to see if starks knows what she is talking
               about

                                     starks
                           what case

                                     lorenson
                           i was working with a boy named
                           eugene

               starks shows no recognition but jackie does

                                     jackie
                           who was eugene

                                     lorenson peaked
                           he was a friends son beat are you
                           familiar with the case

                                     jackie
                           just a little when we were looking
                           up information about williams
                           father how did he help

                                     lorenson
                           its complicated but looking at
                           starks in a way your father let me
                           know how id get through to him

                                     jackie
                           how

                                     lorenson
                           he just saidthat id shock eugene
                           and then things would change for him

                                     jackie
                           i dont understand

                                     lorenson
                           i still dont either even after all
                           these years

                                     starks
                           do you know how my father died

                                     lorenson unconvincingly
                           i dont know how much i remember but
                           i seem to think it was from a cut or
                           blow of some sort or another

                                     starks
                           howd he get it

                                     starks
                           beat i dont know

                                     starks
                           but dr morgan said you were around
                           when my father was

                                     lorenson
                           i was but i saw a lot of cuts and a
                           lot of blows im sorry i dont know
                           more about your fathers sincerely
                           i didnt know about everything that
                           went on here

               lorenson says it like shes hiding something

                                     starks
                           well do you think dr becker would
                           have any idea

                                     lorenson
                           how do you know about dr becker

                                     starks
                           my dad wrote some things down before
                           he died

               lorenson looks like shes suddenly remembering something

                                     lorenson
                           thats right he did

               starks looks at lorenson curiously he doesnt know what
               lorenson is talking about

                                     lorenson
                           so maybe dr becker would know
                           beat but as im sure you know the
                           statute of limitations has run out
                           for charging the hospital with any
                           liabilities

                                     starks
                           why would we do that

               starks just stares at lorenson not knowing if he died by
               this mans hands or not not knowing who he can trust

                                     jackie
                           because becker resigned after the
                           charges brought against him by state
                           patient advocacy groups

                                     lorenson
                           i see youve done your homework
                           beat alpine groves undergone a lot
                           of changes since then at the time
                           we didnt have theresources to
                           help our patients the way we needed
                           to beat now we do and things are
                           different

                                     starks
                           i wouldnt be so sure like you said
                           about back then you might not know
                           everything going on around here

               dr lorenson looks right at starks

                                     lorenson
                           its important for you to know who
                           your father was isnt it

                                     starks
                           beat yeah it is

                                     lorenson eerily
                           its almost as if your life depended
                           on it isnt it

                                      starks
                           exactly

                                     lorenson
                           well beat let me know how your
                           search turns out

                                     starks
                           beat we will

               int hallway alpine grove day

               starks and jackie walk briskly down it away from lorensons
               office

                                     starks
                           i dont believe a thing she just
                           said

                                     jackie
                           me neither who was the boy she was
                           talking about eugene

                                     starks
                           i have no idea

                                     jackie
                           you think lorenson kills you

                                     starks
                           maybe i dont know seems more
                           likely becker does but at the very
                           least she knows how i died

                                     jackie
                           lets see if they have an address for
                           becker i also want to figure out
                           more about the kid you helped her
                           with

                                      starks
                           why

                                        jackie
                              because thats the part i believe is
                              true you probably did help her
                              somehow with the boy and eugenes
                              name did come up over and over again
                              on the abstracts i pulled

               starks nods

                                        starks
                              beat theres one more thing i want
                              to see

               int corridor leading to basement alpine grove 2004

               starks determined now leads jackie as they reach the end
               of the hall we see damon  now in his 50s  look after them
               curiously before he goes back to his work with a patient

               int basement alpine grove 2004

               jackie watches starks ignore the authorized personnel only
               sign as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause

               int morgue basement alpine grove 2004

               the morgue looks exactly as before

               starks is momentarily jarred in the room he looks to the
               wall on which the jacket hung and sees only the bare hooks
               that used to hold it up

                                        starks
                              this was the room they used to hang
                              the jacket there turning to jackie
                              this is where it happened this is
                              the room im actually in right now

               jackie isnt doubtful but its also hard to be
               convinced

                                        starks
                              i can show you its probably in
                              there

               starks walks to the cadaver drawers and rests his hands on
               the one they put him in then with great difficulty 
               physical and emotional  he opens it to see if there is
               anything left

               he pulls it out and theres nothing in there

                                     jackie
                           maybe this wasnt such a good idea

               starks leans closer locating all the proof he needs the
               stained metal  still reddened and browned with dried blood 
               and the part of the morgue slab he clawed his nails into when
               he was in it jackie looks at it in disbelief

                                     starks
                           yes it was softly my fingers were
                           the only things i could move beat
                           dead bodies dont bleed and they

               starks and jackie are leaving the morgue when starks spots
               damon now hardly a hair of the bully he was before damon
               stares at him curiously starks glares back furiously

                                     damon

                           we were just leaving

               damon doesnt take his eyes off starks

                                     damon

                           starks

               damon smiles remembering

                                     damon

                                     damon with a dirty laugh

                           right

               starks looms strangely over damon in this exchange

                                     starks
                           you wouldnt happen to know how he
                           died would you

                                     damon slightly apprehensive
                           no i dont i just remember them
                           finding his body

                           you dont know any more damon

                                     damon shocked
                           howd you know my name

                                     starks
                           my father used to talk about you

                                     damon
                           oh yeah whatd he say

               damons eyes betray his unease

                                     starks
                           he said you were a sadistic fuck that
                           belonged in jail

               damon is shocked and cowed so much that he shakes as he
               looks for his bearings

                                     damon
                           look here i dont like you getting
                           in my face and saying this bullshit

                                     starks
                           thats too bad

                                     damon
                           i thought you said you never knew
                           your father

                                     starks
                           i didnt beat did you have
                           anything to do with his death

                                     damon

                           dont know how come youre doing it

               starks starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and
               distraught before him

                                     starks
                           he died because he bled to death from
                           a blow to his head someone had to
                           have given him it

                                     damon
                           i never touched your father i swear

               damons eyes are filled with dishonesty tears and a craven
               fear starks leans in closer to damon as he remembers

                                     starks
                           you know something damon youre
                           like a mule youre real stubborn

                           heres your stick live with it

               starks looks like he could easily bash damons head against
               the wall but instead he lets it go and walks away

               ext cemetery alpine grove grounds 2004 day

               awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep she reaches
               across the bed but starks is no longer there she runs her
               hands over the bed like hes alive in the sheets

               being wheeled down the hall she finishes with the patient
               and runs to the end of the hall in search of it

               int starks room icu alpine grove late night 1992

               starks lies recovering under a small light above his hospital
               bed his body bears marks of the brutalization as we pull
               back we see dr lorenson standing guard over him at the foot
               of his bed

               ext ward icu alpine grove next morning

               starks sits by a window  ivs in his arm  smoking feebly
               still severely weak from the jacket while dr lorenson
               observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside

                                     lorenson

                                     starks
                           2004

               lorenson nods trying to mask his dismay but failing

                                     starks
                           you dont believe me

                                     lorenson testing him
                           well what year do you think it is
                           now
                                     starks exasperated
                           im not delusional i know its 1992
                           same as every sane person

                                     lorenson
                           ok fine tell me about it tell me

                                     starks
                           it doesnt look all that different

                                     lorenson
                           the future doesnt look different

                                     starks
                           no not for people like me beat
                           not in the places i come from

                                        lorenson
                              what about the world

                                        starks
                              i didnt see that much of it  same
                              as now i only saw it as part of my
                              own life

               lorenson looks at starks unintentionally patronizing

                                        lorenson
                              do you think youre traveling in
                              time is that it

               starks shakes his head and momentarily challenges lorenson
               simply with his air of calm resolve

                                        starks
                              not everyone in here is crazy doc

               lorenson searches for another approach

                                        lorenson
                              beat like who like mackenzie
                              maybe

                                       starks
                              maybe

                                        lorenson matteroffactly
                              did he tell you he tried to kill his
                              wife

               starks nods

                                        lorenson
                              mackenzie locked himself up in his
                              house for two months and nearly
                              starved himself to death before he
                              was brought here all because his
                              wife left him for another man

               starks moves to put his cigarette out and his iv almost
               falls out of his arm lorenson makes a move to adjust it and
               starks flinches perceptibly startling lorenson

                                      starks adjusting it himself
                            maybe that just makes him weak not
                            crazy or maybe he is crazy beat
                            still doesnt make me think i am

                                      more

                                     starks adjusting it himself
                           and judging by the fact that you
                           just told me about another patient
                           it doesnt even make you think i am
                           so what dont you work on persuading
                           yourself first

                                     lorenson
                           why dont you help me

                                     starks
                           because i dont have time

                                      lorenson
                           why not

                                     starks
                           im about to die unless i do
                           something to stop it

                                     lorenson
                           and how do you know that

                                     starks
                           because of the future i know whats
                           going to happen

                                     lorenson
                           william that is just another facet
                           of my delusions

               then starks remembers the only thing that might help him he
               pauses trying to recall as much of it as he can

                                     starks
                           and what about your work with eugene 
                           the kid is that another facet of my
                           delusions

               lorenson  having prepared to continue  is bowled over at
               the mention of her patient she loses all color and calm in
               her features

                                     lorenson
                           how do you know about eugene

                                     starks
                           you told me about him i saw you and
                           i think you thought i knew something
                           about him so you told me

               lorenson doesnt know what to say

                                     lorenson somewhat angrily
                           how do you know about eugene

                                     starks shaking his head in disbelief
                           you told me its like two parts of
                           you talking through me look judging
                           from your reaction theres no other
                           way i could know about him

                                     lorenson
                           there obviously is so what dont you
                           just tell me how you found out about
                           him

               starks looks at her convincingly

                                     starks
                           some part of you suspects  even if
                           you dont know for sure  that what
                           im saying is true

                                     lorenson
                           i dont know how you know about
                           eugene but these ideas are part of
                           your delusions

                                     starks
                           no theyre not my delusions look
                           just leave my business with becker to
                           me

                                     lorenso
                           one things got nothing to do with
                           the other

                                     starks
                           ones got everything to do with the
                           other so unless you want my blood on
                           your handsleave whats between me
                           and becker between me and becker

               lorenson backs off jarred by starks assertions and fearful
               of his debilitating vehemence

               int hallway alpine grove day 1992

               mackenzie sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the
               hallway is clear of the staff then he scuttles quickly  all
               the time close to the wall  to starks room

               int starks room alpine grove day 1992

               mackenzie gets inside ducks as a nurse passes and then taps
               lightly on the wall announcing himself gladly

                                     mackenzie
                           hey i brought you some smokes

               starks doesnt waste any time

                                     starks
                           lorenson said your wife left you for
                           another man and thats when you lost
                           it

               mackenzie almost imperceptibly winces  confirming the truth
               for starks  before he has to sit down

                                     mackenzie
                           geez hows that for a fucking thank
                           you

                                     starks
                           is it true

               mackenzie tosses him the cigarettes and lights himself one

                                     mackenzie
                           she left me i tried to kill her i
                           tried to kill myself she was mean i
                           was weak i was cruel so she left i
                           didnt plan it didnt see itfine

               mackenzie suddenly stops distraught when he resumes its
               in an oddly more normal tone than hes ever used before

                                     mackenzie softly
                           i didnt want to see it im in here
                           because they say i have a nervous
                           condition beat well heres my
                           question who wouldnt be nervous if
                           they really looked at their life
                           beat whose life is that good

               starks doesnt have an answer

                                     mackenzie
                           not this luckless little mammals
                           what difference is it to them beat
                           slows down you believe what you want
                           to believe one version is easier
                           than another so you make it your own

               as mackenzie runs his hand over his forehead he looks hurt
               and sad but strangely not a bit crazy

                                      mackenzie
                            ill tell you this though however
                            nuts i am i wasnt nuts enough not
                            to know how wrong it was to put a
                            human being in something like that

               mackenzies twitching continues as he recollects it

                                      starks
                            mackenzie beat what if we are
                            crazy

                                      mackenzie
                            shrugging what if we are therere
                            crazier things than thinking up
                            fictions for yourself beat
                            everyone does it dont they even
                            becker that roller coaster car pops
                            more pills than all of ward 3

                                     starks
                           becker does are you sure

                                     mackenzie
                           ive been here for 11 years its my
                           neighborhood course im sure hes
                           as drugged up as the rest of usi
                           guess he has to be to put up with all
                           this

               starks nods and mackenzie puts his head down suddenly
               vulnerable and embarrassed starks lights two cigarettes

                                      starks
                            thanks for the cigarettes you
                            still got a lot of problems
                            mackenzie but youre ok

               mackenzie and starks smoke together quietly

               int starks room alpine grove december 29th 1992

               starks is trying to see if the windows open through the bars
               covering them its especially hard with the iv still
               connected to one of his arms

                                      becker
                            at least its some kind of bars weve
                            got you behind

               starks turns startled

                                     becker
                           hello william i understand youve
                           been asking for me almost every hour
                           i wouldve been here sooner but you
                           gave our little state visitor quite a
                           bit to talk to me about

                                     starks
                           thats too bad

                                     becker
                           it is but when it comes down to it
                           you just have to patient with them
                           theyd rather have their vacation
                           too so they just push dealing with
                           our practices off to the new year

                                     starks

               starks lights a cigarette and with that gesture adopts the
               unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears
               little resemblance to his usual demeanor

                           you killed him

               starks simply delivers one slow nod

                           and wound up in a better cage beat
                           but i still want to make a deal

               becker looks understandably disgusted and starks proceeds
               with the calculation of someone who is guilty

                           down when i say it dont you think

               it takes becker some seconds to swallow this

                           i thinki have to think about it

               becker cocks his head to one side as he does then he slowly
               makes his way over to starks and leans in closer to him
               starks instinctively raises his hand to his head  prepared
               to be defensive if he has to be if this is the moment when
               hes killed

               but becker only yanks the iv angrily out of starks arm
               tearing his skin with it

                                     becker

                           fleshing out before its ready to go

               becker turns to leave as starks bleeds onto the floor

                           means we believe in doing his work
                           and fear what the world would be like
                           if we didnt at least try to

               starks smirks at the hypocrisy he sees

               becker leaves without looking back and starks closes his

               lorenson dressed to leave stops to talk to nina one of the

               int lorensons home vermont 1992

               lorenson comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a
               thin young mother talia yazdi and her eleven yearold
               mute and seemingly retarded son eugene waiting for her
               outside her door

                                     starks
                           hi beat sorry im late

               eugene returns her greeting with a blank stare

               int lorensons home vermont some time later

               lorenson sets her things down on the kitchen table as talia
               starts to tidy things around the apartment

                                     lorenson
                           talia i need to ask you something

               talia looks at lorenson

                                     talia
                           what is it

                                     lorenson

                                     talia with an accent
                           of course not off lorensons still
                           doubtful look i swear i havent i

                           no i would have told you

               lorenson nods she believes her

               starks spots damon standing cautiously in the hall

               int nurse station alpine grove night 1992

               we see but dont hear harding speak to nina as damon slips
               into starks room nina seems sufficiently distracted

               int starks room seconds later

               damon flashes a knife at starks

                                     damon
                           no funny business or we can make this
                           a lot fucking harder for you

               one look at the knife and the same question burns once more

                                     starks
                           weakly no funny business

               int hallway alpine grove night 1992

               damon hustles starks down the hall as fast as they can before
               the nurse or any other staff member spots them

               int officelibrary lorensons home night

               eugene sits opposite lorenson who quietly observes him
               jotting some notes down on her pad she is intermittently
               holding up pictures for eugene asking him to repeat their
               names as if she were teaching him to read

                                     lorenson
                           eugene this is a train

               eugene starts to pronounce the word when abruptly and
               without any warning he looks like hes unconscious only
               with a blank stare lorenson quickly moves beside eugene and
               watches him from up close apparently not altogether
               surprised at whats happening

               eugene doesnt even blink the only sounds we hear from him
               are a couple barely audible guttural noises lorenson 
               exhausted  takes off her glasses wearily and gently
               addresses the boy

                                     lorenson
                           come on back down here wherever you
                           aretry to come on back youll
                           like it i promise

               just then talia walks in with tea juice and cookies for
               eugene and lorenson she spots her son in his absent staring
               state and forces her face into a small sad smile to avoid
               tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them

               talia gently touches lorensons hand lorenson looks at her
               warmly talia knows how hard shes trying

               int morgue basement alpine grove night 1992

               becker soundlessly watches as harding and damon finish
               strapping starks in the jacket

               damon slams the drawer shut sending starks back in

               station he looks around trying to make sure it really is
               her car he looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and
               an empty bottle of vodka

               he looks outside and sees a few people walking into the food
               mart of the gas station he trembles with cold as he looks
               down at his plaid shirt
               then jackie unexpectedly appears outside the drivers window
               opening the car door and nearly spilling her coffee when she
               spots starks next to her

               seeing its him though she smiles warmly

                                     jackie
                           you just scared me thats all

               starks runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in

               starks opens his eyes she sighs in relief

                           maybe hes gone somewhere hell have
                           to come back

               starks starts to shake his head in disbelief when suddenly
               he realizes

                                     starks
                           of course he will beat what day of

               ext streets shelbourne

               jackie and starks head back to the only main street in the
               town as they approach the town church they start to see a
               row of cars parallelparked on the street

               jackie pulls up to the entrance of the church

               int jackies car 2004 day

               starks watches jackie get out of the car and walk up to the
               doors of the church

               ext church shelbourne 2004

               jackie boldly opens the church door

               int church shelbourne 2004

               jackie sees the town seated in the church the priest looks
               up at her briefly and some people turn around but she closes
               the door before she causes a major interruption

               int church shelbourne 2004

               we move to the third or fourth row where from behind we
               see a head of grey hair he slowly turns around casting a
               look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face
               though its aged slightly it hasnt softened

               ext church shelbourne 2004

               jackie and starks watch as the people file out of church
               they are leaning against her car when starks spots him

               dr becker walks beside a small child  presumably his
               grandson jackie registers his formidableness with some
               surprise beckers maintained a strong physique and is hardly
               a shade less intimidating than he was before only his hand
               has a permanent shake now

               starks doesnt waste any time he heads straight for him
               almost sensing him becker looks in his direction the casual
               look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of disbelief

                                     starks
                           you still go to church hows that

               becker stops walking and looks at starks his grandson looks
               at him

                                      beckers grandson
                           grandpa

                                      becker still looking at starks
                            sean why dont you wait for me by

               thats enough to confirm for becker who starks is

               all around them people leaving church socialize routinely 
               unaware of the haunted history being made between them

                                     becker
                           who are you

               starks looks at becker  each a terrifying reminder of the
               others past

                                     becker

                                     starks

               becker looks at him nearly too stunned to speak

                                     becker
                           i dont know how you died the last

                           killing that police officer

                                     starks

                           said something you couldnt have
                           possibly have known you came back
                           and repeated three names

               becker falters as he recalls his offenses

                                     becker
                           of people like you people i was just
                           trying to help they couldnt get
                           worse so i thought with medication
                           they might get

                                     starks
                           medication what kind of meds do you
                           chase with nights in a cadaver
                           drawer

                                     becker
                           it was part of the treatment i
                           intendedi didnt know what the
                           effects would be

                                     starks
                           so what you guinea pig sick people
                           to find out

                           patients you were criminals that

                                     starks
                           no we were patients

               becker concedes after all this time

                                     becker
                           you and the others didnt seem that
                           way then

               starks is quiet as he comes to understand how its about to
               work out if becker tells him those names now he essentially
               indicts himself

                                     starks
                           who were the others

               becker remembers with a hint of remorse

                                     becker racked with remorse
                           nathan piechowski jackson
                           macgregor and ted casey beat i

               starks looks at becker in astonishment

                                     becker
                           what is it

               starks just stares at becker waiting for the realization to
               hit him too

                                     becker
                           how did you come to know their
                           names

                                     starks

                            i was sorry when i heard you died

                           without my ever telling you beat
                           and that still doesnt excuse what
                           you did just because you had keys
                           to a cage didnt mean you had

                           earned your guilt becker

               starks shares a last look with becker before he walks away
               towards the car

               int jackies car day 2004

               jackie and starks sit inside the parked car as starks touches
               his head

                                     jackie
                           thats all you got from him that
                           bastard helped take your life away
                           from you

                                     starks
                           no he didnt

                                     jackie

                           the one that put you in that
                           goddamn medievaljacket hes
                           probably the one who killed you

               and with those words jackie starts to break down

                                     starks
                           no ones killing anyone

               starks takes her hand and runs it over his head

                                     starks
                           touch me im okay

               starks looks at her with love understanding and for the
               first time a sense of peace he strokes her hair to calm her
               down

               starks looks at her without answering jackie wipes her eyes
               fastens starks seat belt and seeing that starks eyes have
               started to flutter starts driving in the distance the
               barely audible sound of the drawer opening and their time
               ending is heard

                                     starks
                           where are we going

               int jackettunnel passage

               starks is trapped back on the day when officer harrison was
               murdered

                                                         flashback to

               ext highway rural vermont winter late afternoon 1992

               contd from the scene after starks left jean and jackies
               place

               starks is walking back on the same highway just after the sun
               has set and just after he helped jean and jackie on that
               fateful day

               this time we see a car stop for him from a much closer
               distance tenny pulls up towards starks and rolls down the
               window on the passenger side starks bends down to be able to
               see the driver

                                     tenny
                           hey mister you need a ride

                                     starks

                                     tenny

                           you ride with me up to the border

               starks considers this

                                     tenny
                           can you drive

                           great get in well switch off in
                           a bit

               we pull back and see the same shot from a distance of
               starks putting his bag in the back and getting in as he
               opens the car door we hear the music playing inside as they
               drive off the music fades further and further in the
               distance as we

                                                         cut to

               int bedroom jackies apartment night

               its the night that they slept together and the departure we
               never saw we see from starks pov jackie sleeping
               serenely in the bed

               we catch one glimpse of starks in the moonlight standing
               naked in the doorway before he turns and thendisappears 
               having been taken out of the jacket at that point

               int hospital room vermont 2004

               jackie is by starks side lying on the hospital bed next to
               him smoothing his sweating head

                                     jackie
                           william please honey wake up
                           for me

               starks eyes flutter open

                                     jackie
                           can you hear me

               starks nods jackie tries to continue without choking up

                                     jackie
                           i found out about eugene the little

                           prove this to her

               jackies voice fades as we

                                                        cut to

               int lorensons home vermont night 1992

               lorenson watches eugene continue to look unresponsively
               in the distance

                                                        return to

               int hospital room vermont 2004 some time later

               starks is awake watching jackie sleep wearily on his chest
               he sees the toll this has taken on her just as he senses he
               is about to be taken out of the jacket he nudges her gently

                                     starks
                           jackie

               jackie stirs her eyes to look at him

                                      starks somewhat urgently
                            where do you live

                                     jackie
                           what

                                     starks

                           where was the house you lived in
                           with your mother do you remember

                                       jackie
                             112 orchard way realizing in a
                             whisper youre not coming back
                             are you

               starks faint struggles to get out of the bed

                                       starks
                             you gotta stop thinking like that

                                       jackie
                             then where are you going

                                       starks
                             nowhere beat i just think im
                             gonna be sick

               starks   moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room
               jackie   moves to help him and he motions for her to stop
               starks   falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at
               jackie    like it might be for the last time

                                      jackie in a whisper
                            you come back to me

               starks nods then goes in and closes the door behind him
               jackie stares after him  alone in the total silence of the
               room she listens for the slightest noise and thats when she
               actually hears the sound of the drawer being opened for
               herself

               she realizes hes gone she rushes after him opens the door
               in a fit and then sees what she feared most no sign of
               starks jackie falls to her knees right there on the
               bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to
               realize how unfathomably deep her heart is

               int alpine grove 2004

               starks is suddenly in the waiting area outside lorensons
               office  still severely weakened

               he walks slowly to the office door and feebly knocks
               lorenson answers and starks falls into her arms

                                       lorenson stunned
                             oh dear god

               int lorensons office

               lorenson has laid starks down on the couch in her office
               starks can barely talk he spews as much of it as he can out
               in his feverish state

                                     starks
                           im william starks im not his son

                           your friends soneugene

               lorenson is stilled by the words starks just spoke

                                     lorenson
                           i know i know it all save your

                                     lorenson

                           happened

                                     starks

                                     lorenson
                           yeah

               starks clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him
               out

                                     starks
                           whowho kills me

                                     lorenson
                           you have nothing to fear william

               but when we look to see starks reaction hes not there

               int beckers office alpine grove evening

               becker is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly
               decides not to he takes off his coat and his gloves but not
               his scarf and walks out of his office with a decided
               urgency

               int morgue basement alpine grove 1992

               becker pulls starks out of the drawer and looks down ruefully
               at starks scathed face starks drenched in blood and sweat
               seeks the outline of beckers face in the light

                                     starks whispering
                           becker i know about you beat i
                           know what you did to your patients

               becker looses the straps around starks neck to help him
               speak

                                     starks
                           nathanpiechowski beat jackson

                           didnt cure them you killed them

               becker momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien
               after some seconds starks passes out and becker  hands
               trembling  looks as though he might stick him back in when
               instead he starts to remove him from the jacket himself he
               silently and carefully unties each of the straps  taking
               unusual care for starks flesh as he prepares to put him on a
               stretcher

               int starks room icu alpine grove early morning

               as the sun starts to rise we see starks  now cleaned up 
               recovering in his bed he is unconscious from his window we
               look down and see dr lorensons car pulling into the lot

                                                          fade to

               int starks room icu alpine grove early morning

               lorenson still wearing her winter gear walks into starks
               room anxiously checking his vitals her anxious expression
               reveals starks frailty she looks to the window then and
               sees an empty chair with only beckers scarf on it

               lorenson goes to the window in time to see becker getting
               into his car

               int starks room icu ward alpine grove later that morning

               starks lies unconscious in the bed the nurse sally stops

               int starks room icu ward alpine grove morning 1992

               lorenson still gets taken aback by starks knowledge of
               eugene

                                     starks
                           no one knows youre working with him

                           your friends son right

               its true no one could have known about lorensons private
               life starks coughs clearly in great pain

                                     lorenson
                           william i cant indulge these
                           delusions even when youre in this
                           state

                                     starks
                           listen to me thats all i ask

               lorenson has no choice

                                     starks
                           hes having absence pronounced
                           absance seizures when he stares
                           off into space like he does he has
                           them so often that thats why he
                           hasnt learned to speak properly

                                     lorenson
                           who told you this

                                     starks
                           you did in the future you figured
                           it out because a part of you already
                           knows this thats how it works
                           beat im just telling you something
                           you already know even if you havent
                           realized it

               starks closes his eyes gathering what strength he can

                                     starks
                           i dont know when itll happen but
                           soon i think youll shock the boy
                           and itll wake him up

                                     lorenson
                           what are you talking about

                                     starks
                           youll figure it out and youll do
                           good by him

               thats all starks can manage before lorenson sees hes about
               to pass out again

                                                         cut to

               int lorensons apartment night 1992

               lorenson answers the knock at her door its eugene and
               talia

                                     starks
                           hey

                                     talia
                           what is it

                                      lorenson finding it hard to explain
                            nothing beat i dont know i
                            thought of something i could try

               lorenson looks at talia helplessly talia nods and leads
               eugene inside lorenson cant help but look down the hall to
               make sure no ones there

               int studyoffice lorensons apartment night 1992

               lorenson sits across from eugene holding up a picture of a
               dog between them is a tray of milk and cookies

                                     lorenson
                           come on eugene try to say it with
                           me this is a dog

                                     eugene
                           ddd

               but eugene cant hold the sound of the letter long enough to
               make the word an absence seizure takes hold of him as he
               looks out unconsciously into space

               lorenson moves closer to him

                                      lorenson softly
                            whats happening to you

               lorenson checks eugenes pulse and leans in close to the
               boys unconscious face like the answer is there if she just
               looks hard enough

                                     lorenson
                           are you having a seizure is that
                           really whats going on

               lorenson spots a corner of eugenes eye twitching slightly
               and rushing to get a better look takes the shade off of the
               nearby lamp and holds it above his head so she can get a
               better look at him

               just then talia opens the door startling lorenson she
               knocks over the milk and as it spills on the lamp cord  now
               on eugenes lap  it causes an electric shock eugene catches
               it talia gasps and lorenson watches the boy in fear

               the moment passes and eugene  more responsive than he has
               ever been before  looks at his mother and lorenson he
               doesnt know whats happened but he is aware and awake
               like never before

               eugene picks right up where he and lorenson left off

                                     eugene
                           dog to talia hi

               talia and lorenson look at him and each other at shock

                                     starks os distantly
                           youre going toshock the boy and
                           then things will change for him

                                     lorenson
                           you ok eugene

               eugene holds lorensons gaze steadily for a few moments

                                      lorenson stunned himself
                            yeah you are ok

                                     talia
                           whats happening

                                     lorenson putting the pieces together
                           he got a little shock to himself
                           and its reset him not permanently
                           probablybut at least for a little
                           while they use it on epileptic
                           patients sometimes

                                     talia
                           but hes not epileptic

                                     lorenson
                           no but he is having seizures

               talia looks at lorenson shes still confused lorensons
               merely surprised

               int starks room icu unit alpine grove 1992

               starks looks up from his paper  now covered in words  to
               see dr lorenson in the doorway starks still looks weak but
               much better than before

                                     starks
                           it worked didnt it

               lorenson helps starks into the parking lot as it snows

               int lorensons car day 1992

               lorenson and starks are driving on the same now familiar
               highway

                                     starks
                           you know how to get there

                                     lorenson
                           sure its an easy address a
                           little far out there but easy
                           enough

                                     starks
                           good

               bob dylan plays on the radio starks smiles as he hears him
               and turns the music up the act is sad because as lorenson
               notices it belongs to someone with an interest to live

               ext jackie and jeans house day 1992

               dr lorenson and starks drive up to jean and jackies house

                                     starks
                           you want me to come with you

                                     starks
                           no ill be ok

               starks slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on
               it as best as he can the sound however is still
               understandably soft

               starks waits and then reaches for the knob on the door he
               opens it and looks inside we first see his face and the
               devastation on it as we guess the sight hes laid eyes on

               jackie is sitting at the kitchen table still only 7 years
               old though starks expected it he falters under the
               disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman
               he loved as she looks up at him its all he can do not to
               break down

                                     starks
                           hi

                                     jackie surprised
                           hey beat i remember you

                                     starks
                           i remember you too

               starks shakes his head looking at her she looks beautiful
               and still hopeful her life lays ahead of her and her fate 
               when he found her in 2004  remains as distant as possible
               from this innocent still promising image

                                     starks
                           jackie how have you been

               jackie smiles she doesnt get asked that often

                                     jackie
                           ive been ok

                                     starks
                           good hows your mom

                                     jackie
                           ok i guess

               starks nods jackie smiles its all he can do not to
               crumble

                                     starks
                           do you think i could see her

               she looks at him and senses like kids do the desperation in
               his eyes

                                       jackie
                           sure

               jackie calls out for jean then runs up the stairs to get
               her lorenson has gotten out of the car and is waiting
               outside on the porch starks remains in the doorway

               some seconds later jean appears  gaunt but in a slightly
               better state than we saw her before

                                     jean
                           can i help you

                                     starks
                           hey jean nice to see you

               jean looks a little confused

                                     jean

                                     jackie
                           mom this is the guy that drove us
                           home that afternoon we were stuck
                           on the highway the guy you yelled
                           at for no good reason

                                       jean
                           oh yeah

               she gives him a once over and seeing how weakened he looks
               decides intuitively he cant be much harm she also notices
               lorenson waiting by the car

                                      jean
                            there something you need

                                      starks
                            you could say that

               starks looks at jackie hesitating because of her sensing
               this jean asks jackie to leave

                                      jean
                            jackie go play in the snow

                                      jackie
                            why

                                      jean
                            just do it

               jackie leaves and walks to the yard starks watches

                                      starks
                            i cant stay long motioning to
                            lorenson thats my doctor and i
                            gotta get back to the hospital
                            everything i want to say is in this
                            letter beat you can check as
                            much of it as you can

               starks hands her the letter

                                     starks
                           i wont be around when you read
                           itbut i hope you believe it
                           itd be a real shame if you didnt

               jean looks baffled but seeming to grasp his urgency nods

                                     starks
                           beat i should be on my way

               jackie has been watching this exchange from the shed when he
               looks over there he catches her eye and calls out with what
               strength he has left

                                     starks
                           bye jackie

               these are the hardest words starks has probably ever had to
               say jackie just stares after him as does jean as he shows
               himself out

                                      starks
                            happy new year to both of you

                                      jean
                            thanks you too

               ext jackie and jeans house day 1992

               as starks is walking away we see his eyes begin to tear in
               the cold  but not from it

               int jackie and jeans house day 1992

               jackie abruptly runs after him

                                      jackie
                            hey wait

               starks stops in his tracks he clears as much sadness from
               his face as he can before he turns around to face her

                                      starks
                            beat you be good to yourself
                            jackie

                                      jackie
                            ok

               then suddenly she sticks her hand for him to shake as she
               did that day on the roadside only now it trembles slightly
               in the cold

               starks takes jackies hand and holds it in his own softly and
               affectionately jean and dr lorenson look on curiously as
               starks looks in her face at her hand in his and then to the
               heavens for the means to get through this

               as starks lets go at last jackie looks back at him sensing
               the connection even if she doesnt know it yet

               starks turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car
               lorenson moves to help him but starks tells her not to with
               his eyes he makes his way to the car on his own

               jean sits down and starts to open the letter starks voice
               as we hear it now is presumably from parts of the letter
               hes written to her

               int lorensons car dusk 1992

               lorenson looks over to starks who stares painfully out the
               window they drive on in silence

                           i was 25 years old the first time i
                           died it didnt end anything though
                           beat sometimes i think we live
                           through things only to be able to
                           tell them to bear witness to say
                           this happened

               int alpine grove new years eve 19921993

               starks walks back through the gates of the hospital
               despondently returning inside with lorenson at his side

                            and it wasnt to someone else it
                            was to me and i lived despite it
                            sometimes i think we live to beat
                            the odds and sometimes i agree
                            that life can only begin with the
                            knowledge of death that it can all
                            end even when you least want it

               mackenzie looks up from his game of solitaire as lorenson
               helps starks down the hall he holds up his hand in the
               gesture of hello or goodbye

               starks raises his hand back with an earnest smile

                                      starks
                            im telling you my story because

               tenny officer harrisons murderer is at the bar ordering a
               drink from the bartender as he gets his drink he slaps a
               bill down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar

               int jackies room jackie and jeans house evening 1992

               jackie rummages in a box of her personal belongings looking
               for something specific in them she stops finally when she
               finds starks dog tags she takes them out slowly and puts
               them around her neck

                                     starks vo
                           i am not a crazy man even though
                           they mistook me for one i live in
                           the same world as the rest of you
                           only i saw more of it

               then after a moment of staring down at them she tucks them
               under her sweater

               int captain medleys home night 1992

               captain medley holds a beer as he stares blankly at a tv
               broadcasting news about mike tysons rape conviction
               medleys barely watching the footage

               int starks room alpine grove 1992

               dr lorenson helps starks back to bed starks looks up at
               lorenson thanking her without words but with his eyes
               lorenson smiles as she looks back sadly at starks even more
               weakened self

                                     starks vo
                           and the seeing is the only way you
                           can hear what the truth around you
                           is saying you can always start
                           believing in things you dont
                           already believing in and while
                           youre alive its never too late

               then he turns and walks out closing the door so that starks
               room and the screen darken at the same time

               int hallway alpine grove new years eve 1992

               two pairs of legs walk down a corridor darkened by the
               night through the now familiar passage to the basement

               starks is not restrained this time though we dont see who is
               walking down the hall with him he runs his hand over his
               forehead and looks at it when hes done still no cut

               they slow down their pace as they round the corner as starks
               appears dizzier and dizzier he doesnt stop and the person
               beside him doesnt see how weak he is until starks trips

               in slow motion we hear a distant garbled voice call out

                                     distorted voice
                           no waatch out

               but starks head hits the glass case of the fire extinguisher
               on the wall as it was destined to in the terrific shower of
               glass one piece cuts a neat deep fatal gash in starks
               head

               blood starts to flow as starks eyes struggle to regain
               their focus we see the blurred indiscernible face of the
               person leaning over him to see if hes all right

               the details start to make sense even to starks this is the
               wound they said he died from

               int morgue basement alpine grove new years eve 1992

               starks collapses on the familiar slab ready to be strapped
               into the jacket one final time blood pours from his head
               onto the floor

               the person with him struggles to get all of starks weight
               onto the metal slab shes doing it as carefully and gently
               as she can  taking observable care with every strap of the
               jacket almost as if the act itself is a humane one

               when the hands finally reach the straps around his neck and
               the hardest part of the struggle has passed starks smiles
               kindly and thankfully into the single overhead light in the
               room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in

               as the drawer is pushed in one of the straps gets caught on
               the side cutting starks arm we hear a small cry in the
               room then the hands adjust the strap and slowly push starks
               in

               int jackettunnel

               its more beautiful and serene inside than its ever been
               before this time as he travels through the tunnel its as
               though hes traveling in a heaven of his own the images he
               sees are the best moments of his past  connected in a
               tranquil fluid narrative that suggest starks has finally
               retrieved his memory without it haunting him

                                      starks vo

               exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there
               she stares at the closed drawer like looking at it is one
               way to look after starks

               jean puts down starks letter and walks out of the kitchen
               and watches jackie sitting absently on the couch looking
               past the tv

               jean kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her
               daughter in the eye jackie looks back curiously as jean
               wraps her arms around jackies legs and rests her head in her
               lap holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly
               missed a tragedy

               over the sounds of cars slushing in the snow an image fades
               up slowly on the screen until we see its starks standing
               in the parking lot outside the diner once more

               this time he seems situated and hopeful after a slightly
               longer wait than the first time jackie walks out  in the
               same way as before except that she wears a nurses uniform
               and an unmistakable air of vitality

               jackie looks directly at starks and we see the same
               attraction between them teeming even more than before even
               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel with a
               bleeding cut on his head and no coat in the cold starks is
               someone we see she wants to be near

               then we see jackie as starks does she looks beautiful
               alive happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
               leave she approaches starks warmly less suspicious of the
               world  and less devastated by it  than we remember her
               being

                           i think so

                           youre bleeding pretty bad there

               starks touches his forehead in a panic and seeing the blood
               on his hands looks up at her terrified sensing this she
               moves closer to calm him

                                      jackie

               starks looks at her  immensely relieved and grateful

                                      jackie laughing a little
                            yes you are alive but listen its

               starks falters slightly as he walks jackie helps him make it
               to the car much like before

                                      starks

               int jackies car 2005

               starks can hardly keep his eyes off her when her cell phone
               suddenly rings

                                      jackie
                            sorry one sec

               starks listens nervously to her conversation and the
               affection in her voice

                                      jackie

               jackie hangs up and looks at starks  feeling a little
               awkward after the call

                                     jackie
                           sorry about that it was my mom

               starks smiles back warmly at her he gets it more than she
               knows

                                     starks
                           nothin to worry about there

               ext overhead vermont highway 2005

               jackies car pulls onto the highway alongside the other
               more modern cars on the highway

                                     jackie os

                           im doing fine

               the happy sound of their engine on the highway continues
               uninterrupted for some seconds before first faintly then
               louder we hear a racking all too familiar sound the drawer
               creaking as its opened once more

                                         the end
