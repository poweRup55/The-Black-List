               on the fountain at el pueblo a jet of waiter rises into the
               air at regular intervals tossing an empty ball in rhythm
               below the ball the water cascades into the second tier of
               the fountain superimposed over this fountain are the main
               and credit titles throughout the running of the titles we
               hear castanet music growing louder and louder when the last
               credit title fade off we begin to


                                                       dissolve


               the corridor backstage at el pueblo an empty corridor
               stretches away before us the camera trucks along this
               corridor the sound of the castanets is so loud and ringing
               now that it has a furious and stormlike quality the camera
               seems to search for the source of this sound it approaches
               two open doorways at the end of the corridor


               through the doorway on the right we see a dancer in spanish
               costume she pirouettes in a final whirl of the dance as the
               camera moves in to a close shot of her beautiful back and the
               two castanets she holds up over her gleaming naked shoulders
               over the diminishing trill of the castanets as the dancer
               finishes her dance we hear a dull and angry pounding the
               castanets click to an end


               the camera moves left to take in the adjoining door to show
               us the source of this sound

               of this jet as it rises and falls for a few beats over this
               shot we hear the music of a mexican orchestra

               the camera moves down and back to reveal the upper tier of
               the fountain with the water flowing over its edges 

               the camera moves back and we see the wide pool at the base of
               the fountain in this pool we see cloclo reflected as she
               dances

               the camera pans to take in the actual dancer and we see clo
               clo whirling and turning in a tight circle she is
               illuminated by several baby spots concealed at the base

               of the fountain and this light makes a nimbus of light
               around her it is a sort of superaura which washes out the
               background haze leaving the dancer clearcut and sharp in
               the midst of this superaura

               as cloclos dance widens in movement taking her to the edge
               of the light nimbus we can see her the tables and the
               patrons of el pueblo

               the el pueblo cafe is the smartest night club in this small
               new mexican resort town the main dining room is in the
               patio here are tables mantled in snowy tablecloths
               glittering candlelight and sparkling glassware on the porch
               is an open space for the performers and the orchestra on one
               side  on the other side is a bar

               tonight el pueblo is crowded waiters dressed in rather
               formal costumes with black trousers and short white coats
               scurry between the tables a good portion of the patrons are
               in evening clothes

               clo—clo dances the rhythmic rattle of her castanets beat out
               above the orchestra

               cloclo is new mexican like the broncos of her native state
               she is all fine proud pure spanish blood it has suffered a
               change in the high clear air of new mexico in her dance
               too we see the more primeval strain of the indian twisted
               among the finer threads of spanish rhythm

               she dances in the pool we see the heavy flutter and turn of
               her skirt her neck her bosom her arms bend and sway and
               turn and pulse with the bloodbeat of the castanets she is
               just entering a graceful turn of the dance the castanets
               beginning a glissade when suddenly she stops dead the click
               of the castanets cutting off abruptly

               reverse shot  the doorway leading into the el pueblo framed
               in this doorway is kiki slim and tall in a black gown with
               black gloves and in her outstretched hand is a black leash
               which links her to the leopard behind her the doorway is hot
               with light so that we see her dramatic outline a silhouette

               passes a waiter carefully holding the chair between him and
               the leopard makes a place for her at an empty table

               and holding the castanets watches the orchestra plays
               feebly on

               suddenly clo—clo smiles she lifts her hands a little higher
               takes a step forward and lets the castanets loose with a roll
               that sounds like machine—gun fire the leopard startled
               twists in a half turn of fright strains suddenly at the
               leash and lunges forward the leash pulls out of kikis
               frightened hand

               reflection shot in the pool the still water reflects the
               quick bound and leap of the leopard in its panic flight for

                         too poor to buy corn meal do you
                         wish we should be so disgraced

               teresa shakes her head but makes no move to go exasperated
               sra delgado reaches for the nearest weapon  the broom

                                   sra delgado
                         then go

               sra delgado brandishes the broom toward teresa who backs up
               again

                         i know what shes afraid of

               pedro lifts his hand it casts a sharp shadow on the wall
               behind him watching the shadow he manipulates his fingers
               so as to create the shadow of a leopards head in miniature

                         this

               teresa braves the threatening broom and moves a step toward
               her mother

                         lady at the el pueblo had it on a

                         you

               pedro jumps the shadow on the wall to simulate the leap of a
               leopard

                         things yet when you went to the
                         store for me

                         you

               sra delgado gives the broom such a backward swing of final
               purpose that teresa hurriedly opens the door behind her and
               slinks out backwards  her big liquid dark eyes still
               futilely pleading the last to disappear sra delgado moves
               after her pushing the door closed

               she puts the broom in the corner and goes to where pedro is
               seated here she stands a moment fondly watching him as he
               masticates his beans behind her the door stealthily opens
               teresa tries to sneak back into the room mamacita sees the
               movement and makes a tempestuous rush toward her but teresa
               sidles out of the door before she can be caught mamacita
               muttering slams the door shut and with difficulty pushes the
               heavy rustcovered iron bolt into place

               teresa stands outside the door we hear the heavy bolt inside
               driven home forcibly

               teresa steps down from the single doorstep outside her house
               she crosses her arms and pulls her shoulders together in a
               gesture of fear she looks once despairingly at the closed
               door behind her —— and then reluctantly steps out into the
               dirt road and starts walking

               ext calderon grocery  night

               only a large corner window with the word provisiones
               printed on it shows that this ordinary house is a grocery
               store in the moonlight one can see a few boxes of groceries
               stacked on shelves inside teresa comes up to the window and
               peers in she knocks on the window

               over teresas shoulder we see the interior of the little
               store light up dimly as a curtain is pulled at the back of
               the room beyond the curtain is revealed another room
               brightly lit by a bare electric globe hanging from the
               ceiling on a cord under the light a man sits at a table
               heartily eating from a plate heaped with food the curtain
               has been pulled back by senora calderon we see her only in
               silhouette and the details of her face and figure are
               indistinguishable we do see however that her long black
               hair is down her back and she is braiding it she walks a
               little ways into the darkened store

                                   sra calderon
                             speaking loudly to be

                         arroyo to the big grocery 

               teresa taps against the window hopefully but sra calderon
               turns back toward the doorway into the inner room where the
               solitary feaster hasnt even bothered to look up during this
               exchange

                             as she goes
                         it means taking off the lock again

               sm calderon steps into the inner room and draws the curtain
               closed behind her as she speaks the last words again the
               store is in darkness  only a rim of light showing around
               the edges of the curtained doorway

                                   teresa
                             quietly — hopelessly
                         senora

               there is no reply teresa turns away

                                                       dissolve to

               ext edge of arroyo  night

               the arroyo is a deep narrow cut in the mesa bone—dry in this
               season its floor of bleached sand and weeds stretches
               desolately wider a vast moonlit sky here and there
               childrens feet have scuffed steep little trails down the
               banks

               teresa appears at the top of one of these trails she looks
               down into the arroyo  and then off to the right

               a distance down the arroyo is a bridge which carries a train
               track across the dry river bed to divert the rush of rain
               water in winter and spring the bridge is underpropped by two
               slanting stone piers they stand out like ribs against the
               blackness of the underpass which they divide into three
               tunnels

               teresas face shows her dread of the arroyo she turns back
               the way she came takes a step away hesitates and then
               returns to the edge of the bank
               she starts down the little trail her feet sliding in the
               loose sand and a shower of pebbles bouncing down ahead of
               her

               ext	arroyo floor — night

               teresa stands at the bottom of the bank she looks off to the
               bridge again then she starts walking forward slowly a very
               little figure in the large loneliness of the night

               ext east side of bridge  night

               teresa comes up to the face of the underpass with its three
               openings she stares from one black tunnel mouth to another
               she glances behind her then looks at the underpass again
               teresa goes forward again toward the middle tunnel

               ext east entrance of middle tunnel  night

               the roof of the underpass is only a little higher than
               teresas head and the passage is not more than ten feet wide
               the opening is dimly lit by the moonlight but beyond it is
               dense blackness teresa enters slowly she takes a few steps
               toward the blackness — and stops she listens teresa moves
               forward again walking as lightly as possible the light dims
               rapidly so that after teresa has taken a half dozen steps
               she is swallowed up in complete blackness

               the camera holds for a moment on the dark underpass before
               teresa emerges from the blackness on the west side a light
               scratching sound is heard teresas eyes widen in panic as
               she hears it and she hurries out of the tunnel watching
               fearfully ever her left shoulder she must cut across in
               front of this other tunnel in order to get to the south bank
               she starts across never taking her eyes off the black tunnel
               mouth suddenly she gives a convulsive start and a little cry
               escapes before she can control it a shadowy shape low to
               the ground detaches itself from the dimness of the tunnel
               opening and moves toward her almost at once we see that it
               is a large tumbleweed blowing clown the arroyo in the wind
               teresa sighs soundlessly and goes on to the foot of the bank
               she starts scrambling up another steep little path

                                                       dissolve

               counters a tall indiantype mexican with irongrey hair
               puts a paper sack of cornmeal on the counter in front of
               teresa

               she starts toward the door but noticing a bronze cage with
               two toy birds in it a mechanical device which has stood
               there for years she goes toward it puts down her sack of
               corn meal and goes up close

                                   teresa

                         the dark they shouldnt send you

               the birds have begun to singa highly mechanical rendering of
               a bird song

               against the inner door of the grocery watching her smiling
               and amused finally his smiling irks her into action she
               picks up her sack of corn meal

                         were all poor together

               in the bronze cage the two birds continue to sing their
               mechanical song their heads turn from side to side
               we hear the door close behind teresa the birds are still
               singing as we

               ext corner west side of bridge  night

               there is a sound of slow measured dripping it comes from
               water seeping out between two rocks and dropping onto another
               rock below these rocks are piled up at the juncture of the
               bridge and the left bank and the water is evidently leaking
               from some water main or sews go pipe running under the
               highway overhead

               ext west side of bridge  night

               teresa is approaching the entrance of the middle tunnel she
               is evidently scared — her footsteps are lagging and she
               holds the sack of corn meal in both hands as if feeling its
               weight she looks fearfully at the black tunnel before her
               and comes to a standstill trying to peer into the blackness
               in the silence the dripping of the water can be heard
               teresa looks up and to the left to locate the sound she sees
               the shining dampness on the rocks she turns back to the
               middle tunnel before her  and drawing a deep breath of
               resolution starts to enter it but she hesitates and then
               suddenly veers over to the left she peers into the opening
               of that tunnel

               int opening of north tunnel  night

               the wall of the tunnel is also damp with the seepage from
               above it reflects the outer moonlight in glistening streaks
               so that the blackness here is not so complete as in the other
               tunnel

               ext west side of bridge  night

               teresa gets a fresh grip on the bag of corn meal by shifting
               her hands under it  and walks into the entrance of the
               north tunnel

               int north tunnel  night

               again the crunching sound of teresas footsteps are
               magnified in the enclosure of the tunnel walls it is very
               dim but the luminosity of the damp wall casts a faint light
               on teresa reflecting in her wide frightened eyes she walks
               slowly and lightly her eyes going from side to side in the
               darkness her neck and head held rigidly suddenly she stops
               with a sharp intake of breath ahead of her and to her left
               are two tiny gleams of light teresa backs away from them as
               she does so they seem to fall and vanish
               slowly teresa moves forward again staring at the place where
               the lights had been as she moves parallel to the spot they
               appear again a halfcry dies away in her throat she sees
               that the gleams are two drops of seepage trickling down the
               side of the tunnel wall teresa half closes her eyes and
               sways a little faint with fear then she forces herself to
               move forward again she takes one  two fearful steps  and
               then the underpass reverberates with a sudden tremendous
               shock of sound — more a giant vibration than actual noise
               it is a train passing overhead

               int north tunnel  night

               as teresa stands transfixed the terrific roar continues
               second after second flashes of light as brilliant as
               lightning illuminate the interior of the tunnel — the
               reflections thrown into the arroyo by the train windows and
               then as abruptly as it began the noise ceases it is
               cavernously dark in the tunnel again in this thick

               in the frame of the tunnel opening teresa stands for a
               moment behind her there is a new sound  a mere whisper of
               sound carried forward on the light wind a little shower of
               rubble falls from the top of the concrete pier teresa turns
               to look behind her

               crouched on one of the piers of the trestle — and seen only
               very dimly in the darkness  is the leopard looking down
               into the arroyo

               teresas nails dig into the paper sack of corn meal and
               little trickles of the meal start spilling from the slits
               her eyes widen and her face falls slack from the horrible
               shock of what she sees she turns and runs

               ext  edge of arroyo  night

               teresa scrambles frantically up over the edge of the bank
               she stumbles ana falls and the sack of corn meal drops from
               her hands and spills onto the ground in a single move
               teresa is on her feet and running again a shadow flashes
               over the spilled meal and we hear a heavy ripping snarl

               it is quiet and peaceful in the delgado home senora delgado
               is puttering about the brasero pedro on all fours is
               reading a comic book his rump high in the air his chin two
               inches from the book suddenly a wild rain of knocks on the

                         nip at her heels and hurry her up  

               she is interrupted by a scream so high of such agonized
               finalitythat it makes the others before it seem like nothing
               at all mingled with the scream and blurring the end of it
               comes an impact of such violence that the whole door
               structure shakes with it from top to bottom a puff of dust
               wells up around the door from the impact of the blow

               as senora delgado tugs vainly at the bolt pedro darts over
               to the fireplace and grabs up a stone from the hearth

                         your mother will let you in  

               pedro rushes to the door and pushes his mothers hands aside
               he hammers the unruly bar back with the stone

               then he draws back and looks down at his feet senora

               delgados horrified eyes follow his glance

               under the crack of the door seeps a dark tongue of blood
               widening and lengthening on the rough wooden floor

                                                       dissolve

               into a film of water flowing across the window

               the camera pulls back and we see a long handled squeegee come
               down the left hand side of the window clearing a strip of
               clear glass through this clear glass we look into c t

               this shop occupies an ordinary store building the display
               window contains a solitary wreath of gilded leaves behind
               this wreath is a green baize curtain the shop itself has a
               sad air of unctuous gentility on the left side of the room
               are coffins on polished brass tressels these coffins are
               half open to reveal the luxurious satin linings in the back
               is a rolltop desk and swivel chair in the rear of the shop
               is a door leading to the embalming room this is curtained
               with the sane green baize over this whole interior is the
               eerie moire light that comes through the waterflowing
               window

               uncomfortable and stiff in their grief we see the delgados

               blue serge sunday suit stand near the wall with them is a
               nun in the sweet sad costume of the carmelite order at the
               other side of the room stands kiki somewhat abased and very
               ill at ease in the presence of the delgados grief

               the window cleaner steps closer to the glass lifts up his
               long handled squeegee and opens up another strip beside the
               first

               her big flat cheeks her husband unable to express his
               grief stands twisting a cheap velour hat in workgnarled
               hands the little delgado boy unable to comprehend the
               finality of death is interested and quickeyed letting his
               glance rove from one object of interest to another then
               suddenly bored as is the manner of children distracts
               himself by making the leopard shadow on the wall

               from the other room we can hear the sound of mens voices
               not clearly distinguishable but growing in clarity kiki
               opens her purse fumbles out a little soiled sheaf of bills
               and crosses the room she hands the money to the nun

                                   kiki
                             in a half whisper

                         this  might help with the funeral

               the nun smiles nods her head and tucks the money up under
               her sleeves kiki crosses back to the other side of the room

               midway through this action the voice in the other room has
               risen in volume and clarity so that we hear the coroner
               speaking from behind the green baize curtain the words come
               in that solemn yet routine fashion which is the specialty
               of county clerks and other minions of the law

                         declare that teresa guadalupe maria
                         delgado was brought to her death by
                         violence resulting from the
                         release of a wild animal a
                         leopard purportedly on theatrical
                         exhibition in this city  death by
                         accident

               as the last word is spoken jerry makes his appearance
               through the doorway his face is drawn and earnest
               reflecting the ordeal of looking at the mutilated remains of
               the young girl he crosses the room toward kiki

               med shot of jerry as he takes his place beside kiki he
               looks at her as if seeking some comforting sign of
               friendliness she keeps her eyes purposely averted from him

               med shot through the curtained doorway come the coroner and
               robles the coroner carries a sheaf of papers in his hand
               coming through the doorway quickly he turns and seats
               himself at the desk in order to sign and seal these
               documents

               chief robles with his uniform cap in his hand goes over to
               the delgado family in his face we can see the sympathy and
               feeling he has for his fellow townsmen fe puts his arm about
               delgados shoulder and embraces him with that peculiar
               mexican embrace in which the hand and arm thump the
               embracess shoulders

                                   robles
                         its all right my friend it is
                         the will of god

               the genuineness of his sympathy and the sincerity of his
               voice take the banal touch from these simple words jerry
               looks on with interest he turns to kiki

                                   jerry
                             sotto voce

               she pulls sharply at his arm to emphasize the point he
               shrugs abashed

               from the inner room a fourth man comes out a medium sized
               gentleman in a light gray business suit with a felt hat in
               his hand his face seems stiff and he walks a little bit
               unsteadily passing jerry he extends his hand and pats
               jerrys arm

               delgado family and comes over to where jerry and kiki are
               standing

               med shot  cloclo and maria cloclo is behind maria she
               has on a practice suit black jersey leotards to the waist
               and a black silk bandeau about her breasts she is using the
               chair rail of the dressing room as a bar to practice a ballet
               step while she beats out the slow rhythm of her exercise with
               the moorish finger cymbals maria again deals the cards and
               cloclo continues to play and practice there is a
               contrapuntal rhythm between the dealing of marias cards and
               the slow tinkle of the cymbals

                                   maria
                         i made a mistake it was a

               the cards slap—slap as she deals as they fall maria
               speaks

                         its a blackcard and bad card but
                         not the card of the cat — not the
                         card of four—footed things

                                   cloclo
                         i saw teresa maybe i was the last
                         to see her except perhaps her
                         mamacita and her little brother i
                         was going past

                             still dealing 
                         they buried teresa today and they
                         were hunting the leopard again 
                         out in the country this time but
                         they didnt get him

                         make a big show — shout and hunt 

               she is about to deal the last card when she stops and looks
               at it then sweeps up the deck without dealing the remaining
               card

                                   cloclo
                         the bad card again

                         card came up

                             with a shrug
                         watch and see a day or a week 
                         but certainly this month  you

                                   cloclo
                             shooing her out

                         the evil eye on me vamoose

               maria unhurriedly snuffs out her cigarette pockets her cards
               and starts for the door as she opens the door we see jerry
               manning going past dressed in slacks and sports shirt
               carrying his coat over his arm he is dusty and tired clo
               clo looks after him with a malicious grin

               int dressing room doors  night

                                   jerry
                         are you decent

               from inside we hear kikis voice

                                   kikis voice
                         yes come in

               he opens the door we can see she is seated in the armchair
               and has a magazine in her hand which she has been reading
               she is dressed in street clothes

                                   kiki
                         well does everybody love us now

                                   jerry
                             without particular
                              conviction
                         yeah

                                   kiki
                             drawling
                         and did you find the leopard

               jerry realizes that kiki is onto him he gives her a look as
               if to say so you knew he bends down and starts brushing
               at his trousers

                                   kiki
                         it must be the altitude —— you
                         bucking around the countryside with
                         a lot of boot—and—saddle boys 

                                   jerry
                             trying to explain
                         the whole towns in a state kiki
                         ——doors locked people huddling
                         together like scared sheep ——nobody
                         on the streets at night ——

                                   kiki
                             bitterly
                         our first real break  and we
                         throw wild animals at the audience

                                   jerry
                         forget it im buying a drink for a
                         fellow who was on the posse with
                         me a nice guy come along hell
                         get a great kick out of meeting
                         you

               kiki picks up her hat from the dressing table and goes toward
               the door slowly jerry finishes brushing his clothes

                                   kiki
                         who is he

                                   jerry
                         you remember the fellow this
                         morning  galbraith youve got
                         time before the supper show

               kiki joins him in the doorway and they start down the
               corridor

               int el pueblo cafe  night

               med close shot of eloise coming toward camera she is in
               professional costume and passes slowly along the front of
               the bar she is smiling and opening a package of cigarettes

                                   jerrys voice
                             evidently at end of long
                              recital
                         and it was sand sand every foot
                         of the way 

               eloise turns and the camera turns with her she stops at a
               small table where jerry kiki and galbraith are seated she
               hands the package of cigarettes to jerry note kiki is
               wearing her hat in this scene

                                   jerry
                             finishing and paying for
                              cigarettes
                         ——	as long as my feet held out

                                   kiki
                         and not a sign of the leopard

               galbraith shakes his head jerry smiles his thanks to eloise
               she goes on out of scene

                                   kiki
                         jerry told me you were an expert
                         with animals mr galbraith
                         couldnt you tell where it went

                                   galbraith
                         to know where that leopard went  —
                         im afraid youd have to be a
                         leopard and think like a leopard i
                         was a naturalist that hardly
                         qualifies me as an expert in
                         hunting down lost leopards i used
                         to teach zoology in a little
                         fresh—water college back east i
                         gave that up

               kiki is just normally curious not conscious that she is
               prying

                                   kiki
                         what do you do now

                                   galbraith
                         theres a little museum here in
                         town theyve hired me to run it
                         weve some interesting exhibits of
                         indian arts and crafts its fun 
                         and i like living here in new
                         mexico

               	

                                   kiki
                         why did you give up teaching

                                   galbraith
                             after a little pause
                         various reasons
                             switching the
                              conversation
                         but i cant see why youd be
                         interested in the rather dusty
                         career of william galbraith —
                         teacher naturalist curator 
                         when you lead such a gay and
                         exciting life yourself

                                   jerry
                             wryly
                         show business

                                   galbraith
                         yes its always fascinated me
                             confidentially
                         you know once when i was a
                         youngster i went to see mrs
                         leslie carter in zaza after the
                         play i stood in the alley just to
                         watch her come out

               both the younger people laugh at his unabashed simplicity

                                   galbraith
                             to kiki
                         so you see meeting you is a real
                         thrill for me

                                   kiki
                         well im hardly mrs leslie carter
                         —whoever she was in fact im not
                         even much of a success around here 
                         particularly after the backfire on
                         jerrys little publicity stunt with
                         the leopard

                                   galbraith
                         that was unfortunate

                                   kiki
                             with a hard look at
                              jerry
                         that was a calamity

               she nods her head toward the main door

                                   kiki
                         look

               med long shot including the table and the door beyond
               through this doorway cloclo emerges in her costume she
               enters with the proud step of a reigning favorite there is a
               light spatter of applause from the bar and the tables on the
               porch clo—clo taking the castanets from her bosom begins
               walking toward the dancing space passing the table where
               kiki jerry and galbraith sit she grins broadly end
               maliciously leaning slightly toward them she makes a
               derisive sound on her castanets then stalks on they follow
               her with their eyes as she starts down the steps from the
               audience in the main portion of el pueblo cafe comes the
               sound of brisk applause and clo—clos answering hail on the
               castanets her dance music begins kiki starts getting up
               the two men rise with her

                                   kiki
                             she rises
                         well im next you wont hear
                         anything like that mr galbraith
                             gesturing toward
                              applause
                         im not a popular favorite since i
                         let the leopard loose

                                   galbraith
                             with heavy gallantry
                         im sure if you are as talented as
                         you are charming miss walker you
                         have nothing to worry about

                                   kiki
                             moving off
                         thanks

               galbraith starts to knock out his pipe on the heel of his

               jerry gives a little sigh of relief

                                   galbraith
                         there is no danger at all its a
                         wild animal do you think a wild
                         animal prefers walls streets and
                         people when it can get into open

                                   galbraith
                             starting toward the
                              steps
                         dont feel so concerned jerry

               as they descend the stops together the camera having panned
               left to stay with them now dollies before them as they go
               down the path toward the fountain they come abreast of the
               fountain and galbraith pauses a moment

                                   galbraith
                         ive seen a bit of life and i have
                         learned one thing we are like that
                         ball dancing on the fountain we
                         know as little about the forces
                         that move us and move the world
                         around us as that empty ball which
                         lives only because the water pushes
                         it into the air lets it fall and
                         catches it again you shouldnt
                         feel too badly about teresa
                         delgado

               close shot  the fountain we see the ball rising and falling
               — oscillating in its movement

               cloclo is dancing and although we can not see her we can
               hear the click of her castanets the quick hard tread of her
               feet we catch an occasional glimpse of her shadow as she
               passes in dancing on the other side of the fountain

                                                       dissolve

               int  el pueblo cafe  early morning

               close shot of the fountain the jet of water has been turned
               off and the ball floats quietly on the surface of the
               innermost basin

               med long shot of cloclo as she makes her way to the gate
               she is dressed in street clothes bus boys are busy piling
               chairs onto the tables while two young maids are hosing down
               the tiles cigarette butts bits of paper and ether odds and
               ends of the nights trade litter the cafe and go swishing
               ahead of the streams of water

               cloclo smiles to one of the young maids as she passes

                                   cloclo
                         a long night chiquita

                             straightening up and
                              shutting down the hose
                              with her thumb
                         how long can a night be cloclo
                         when you spend it dancing

                                   cloclo
                             passing by
                         twice as long as a day with your
                         mop and pail

               the girl laughs and lets the water of the hose spray out
               again cloclo goes on out of the gate

               trucking shot of cloclo as she walks wearily down the
               deserted street she is smoking a cigarette
               swinging from one hand is the little ornamented chamois bag
               in which she keeps her castanets she comes to the flower
               store sees that it is open and throwing her cigarette away
               starts in

               int  flower store  early morning

               med shot  rosita senora contreras maid has selected a
               bouquet of long stemmed roses from a large tin bucket as she
               holds them aloft the flower vender a chubby goodnatured
               little mexican in his late fifties gently wraps a piece of
               newspaper around the wet stems

                                   flower vendor
                             indicating the stems
                         roses are like children — some
                         have short legs and some long

               the flower vendor laughs loudly his body vibrating rosita
               sees no humor in this remark and taking a coin from her
               pocket hands it to him still chuckling the vendor moves to
               his cash drawer to make change in the bg cloclo can be
               seen entering the store she tiptoes forward directly behind
               the flower vendor and ignoring rosita completely snatches a
               wilted gardenia from a tin the flower vendor has caught this
               action in the mirror and whirling pulls the gardenia out of
               her handand at the same time turns back to the cash drawer
               clo—clo isnt at all abashed by the vendors action

                                   cloclo
                         you cant sell it  its a day old

                                   vendor
                         but my stomach isnt a day old if
                         i dont sell flowers  i dont eat
                         — and i love to eat

               cloclo tries a new approach coyly she winks at him

                                   cloclo
                         ill tell everybody you gave it to
                         me  that will be good for your
                         business

                                   vendor
                         yes  but bad for my wife

               the vendor drops the change into rositas hand then turning
               on cloclo shoes her off with a motion

               another angle — taking in rosita at edge of stall she looks
               off at cloclo and with a grand gesture pulls a long stemmed
               rose from the bouquet

                                   rosita
                         my mistress consuelo contreras
                         does not have to beg for flowers
                         she wont miss one

               rosita flings a rose to cloclo cloclo catches it with a
               snap she breaks the stem and thrusts the rose into her hair

                                   cloclo
                             impudently
                         thank the senorita for me

               ext  street  early morning

               med long shot the camera pans with rosita as she hurriedly
               crosses the street and mounting the opposite sidewalk enters
               the contreras home

               int entrance hall contreras home  early morning

               it is a cool shadowy square room at the back is a stairway
               the floor is tiled through an arched grilled doorway we can
               see the living room beyond the front door opens and rosita
               steps in hurriedly her heels clicking on the tile floor
               three people are standing waiting they are senora contreras
               cousin felipe and marta an old servant who is more companion
               than maid in the household by this time marta is dressed all
               in black — dress shoes and apron her grey hair is dragged
               back to a knot she wears tiny gold loops in her pierced ears
               and a gold cross at the fastening of her high collar senora
               contreras a dignified imposing woman with the remnants of
               great beauty still apparent in her expressive eyes and lovely
               hair is dressed in a flowing lacy negligee in her arms she
               carries a little chihuahua dog cousin felipe is a dapper
               little cat of a man meticulously dressed in the proper
               apparel of thirty years ago the senora and cousin felipe are
               waiting on the stairs marta is in the hail

                                   marta
                             crossly
                         shhh

                                   senora contreras
                             softening the rebuke
                              whispering
                         it will spoil the birthday song
                         rosita if we wake her too soon

               rosita nods contritely walking with exaggerated care she
               joins them and they all start up the stairs

               the camera follows them as they go upstairs

               int upper hallway  early morning

               shot of senora contreras marta and rosita as they come up to
               the landing and start on tiptoe toward a door the senora
               contreras puts her hand on the knob softly cousin felipe
               pulls a single rose from rositas armful marta sees him 
               she glares but says nothing

               int consuelos bedroom  early morning

               although the curtains of the room are drawn the softly
               filtered daylight shows this to be a room of delicacy and
               lightness the simplicity of the white walls the sheer
               curtains hanging across the barred embrasured windows the
               lovely lace coverlet and the pretty younggirl trinkets on
               the dressing table give the room an air of lightness

               as the door swings inward the sunlight fills the room then
               we see lying in the bed serenely asleep consuelo
               contreras this is her eighteenth birthday

               senora contreras walks to the foot of the bed and stands
               looking down at her daughter she smiles sadly in still
               untroubled sleep the full vulnerability of consuelos youth
               is touchingly apparent

               marta stands to one side a little behind senora contreras
               cousin felipe remains in the background near the open door
               rosita tiptoes cautiously to the head of the bed and
               carefully puts down the roses so that the blossoms lie in
               the curve of consuelos outflung arm she has to drop on one
               knee to do this and she stays in this position slowly
               drawing her hands away from the flowers they start singing
               las mananitas the traditional birthday song of mexico 
               singing very softly at first

               consuelo stirs slightly and then opens her eyes lying as she
               does the first thing she sees are the roses lying beside
               her

               she lifts her eyes from the roses to see rositas eager
               smiling face almost on a level with her own rositas smile
               broadens but she goes on singing dutifully

               still bemused but beginning to smile faintly herself
               consuelo looks beyond rosita and sees cousin felipe standing
               back by the door very much the gallant he touches his
               stolen rose to his lips and tosses it to consuelo

               consuelo continues her survey of the room and turns her eyes
               to the foot of the bed

                                   consuelo
                             happily and lovingly
                         madrecita

               senora contreras nods slowly but continues to sing with the
               others as they go into the chorus

               consuelo starts to sit up pulling the roses to her

               rosita gets up too and props the pillows behind her young
               mistress senora contreras comes around the bed and sits on
               the edge of it as the song finishes

                                   rosita
                         good morning on your birthday
                         senorita consuelo 

               marta goes to one of the windows and motions rosita to the
               other

                                   marta
                         it is a good morning nina  see
                         how the sun is shining for you  

               marta draws back the curtains and the room already light
               seems to grow even lighter senora contreras leans forward
               and kisses consuelos forehead

                                   consuelo
                         what a lovely way to wake up

               she looks from the bouquet of roses to the single rose that
               cousin felipe threw onto the bed she picks it up and holds
               it to her face

                                   consuelo
                         it is so beautiful cousin felipe
                         thank you for buying it

               at consuelos first words cousin felipe begins to beam but
               he glances across the room and encounters martss grin
               sardonic glance just as consuelo says how carefully you must
               have picked it out abashed he murmurs something
               unintelligible and quietly slips out of the room

               at the window rosita has been standing with her back to
               marta staring fixedly at consuelo to attract her attention
               she makes a little notion with her hands now and consuelo
               glances at her smiling secretively rosita draws a white
               envelope part way out of her apron pocket just enough to let
               consuelo see what it is then she hastily puts it out of
               sight again there is a sudden light in consuelos eyes she
               is transfigured with a really exultant happiness

                                   senora contreras
                             amused
                         had you forgotten that it was your
                         birthday i believe you had 

               consuelo gives a helpless little laugh of delight throws her
               arms around her mother end puts her head down against her
               mothers shoulder

                                   consuelo
                         im so happy  so happy

               senora contreras pats the girls head fondly marta leaving
               the room smiles at mother and daughter

                                   marta
                             turning at the door
                         rosita

               rosita slowly walks away from the window and toward the door
               but as soon as marta has gone out of the door she stops at

               then her eyes go frantically to the clock senora contreras
               lets go consuelos hand and leans back against the chaise
               lounge she gives a little sigh of defeat

               then leans against the base of the statue gasping for
               breath suddenly a wind springs up and the silence is broken
               into a thousand rustles and murmurs as the wind stirs through
               the trees consuelo shivers and slowly lifts her head to look
               up toward the tree tops she looks directly up into the face
               of the statue

               closeup of the angels face is curiously sinister because
               there is light touching its contours

               consuelo whirls about to find the source of light through
               the windstirred branches she sees the great lop—sided moons
               just rising into the night
               she stumbles away from the statue and down the right—hand
               path walking a few steps then running a few steps trying
               to force herself to rush on

               consuelo stands looking down into the old burial ground a
               depression filled with weedgrown graves and ancient wooden
               headstones either crazily askew or down entirely it is
               entirely surrounded by the tall trees of the cemetery —— and
               the moonlight seems to fill the place with mist consuelo
               starts down the slope

               ext old burial ground in cemetery  night

               there are no paths here the weeds grow solidly across the
               ground — except where a grave here and there has fallen in
               and its earth is broken into clods consuelo stumbles about
               aimlessly as she crosses one of the mounds her foot strikes
               a fallen wooden marker it is rotten and the green light of
               phosphorescene flashes across it

               ext path leading to wall in cemetery  night

               moving again between tall trees consuelo moves on no longer
               able to run but when she sees a whiteness between the trees
               ahead of her she does spur herself forward more rapidly

               ext wall of cemetery  night

               consuelo flings herself against the wall her face alight
               with hope

                                   consuelo
                             calling loudly
                         help help help

               there is silence slowly keeping her hands pressed against
               the wall and moving sideways consuelo goes alongside the
               wall until she comes to a tree growing very close to the
               wall in fact one massive bough extends out over the wall
               and consuelo looks up at it hopefully  then her expression
               changes — becomes tense

               close shot of consuelo  her eyes are wide and frightened
               from the other side of the wall comes a sound — a light
               scratching sound exactly the same sound as that heard by
               teresa delgado in her first trip through the underpass
               tunnel listening intensely consuelo turns her head until
               her ear is pressed against the wall now we hear the sound
               more distinctly — as she is hearing it — but it is still a
               light feathery sound then suddenly it ceases and as
               consuelo strains to hear it again there is the sharp hollow
               clap of a car door carelessly flung shut just outside the
               wall it is followed by the grind of a car starter consuelo
               jumps up

                                   consuelo
                         wait —— wait

               the car motor starts pressing herself against the wall
               consuelo screams again and again finally as the unseen car
               starts to slip away the roar of its motor subsides and at
               that moment consuelos scream sounds clearly brakes rasp

                                   autoists voice
                         hello — whos that

               consuelo is breathing in such convulsive gasps that she
               cannot emit any sound for a moment

                                   consuelo
                             weakly
                         here im in here behind the wall

               there is the sound of a car door being opened and then
               footsteps beyond the wall

                                   consuelo
                         ive been locked in please get me

                         now dont get panicky ill climb
                         over and get you 

               pressed tightly against the wall consuelo listens she hears
               running footsteps and then the thud of someone jumping up at
               the wall trying to get over it with a running start once
               twice

                                   autoists voice
                         i cant make it you wait there and
                         ill get someone to lend me a
                         ladder  

               there is the sound of the car door banging shut again

                                   consuelo
                             frantically
                         no dont leave me dont go away — 

                                   autoists voice
                         but youre all right now its just
                         a matter of a few minutes

                                   consuelo
                         you wont forget —— youll come
                         back

                                   autoists voice
                         stay just where you are

               the roar of the motor fills the scene again then it is quiet

                                   autoists voice
                         be back before you know it

               there is the sound of the car drawing away the sound of it
               lessens fades — is swallowed in renewed silence consuelo
               stands against the wall motionless she turns fearfully so
               that her back is to the wall and peers into the shadows
               suddenly she stiffens

               close shot of consuelo her eyes widen she turns her head so
               that her ear is close to the wall and again we hear the
               curious scratching sound and with it another sound — a
               soft living breathing sound as of animal nostrils
               snuffling along the wall searching the scent of prey there
               is a brief silence and then consuelos head snaps up as we
               hear a soft padding sound near the top of the wall she sees
               only the moon just visible in the space between the tree
               bough and the top of the wall there is nothing to be seen ——
               but a rustling sound comes from the top of the wall
               consuelos eyes are motionless fixed on the bough overhead
               very gradually the great bough lowers blotting the moon
               from view consuelo presses her back against the wall as if
               she would push herself into it escape through it her head
               thrown back is motionless — her eyes watching the ominous
               movement of the great bough are motionless and as she
               stares a spasm of terror contorts her face the bough
               suddenly springs back and the moon can be seen for one
               instant during that instant we hear simultaneously a low
               horrible snarl and a scream both are cut off as the whole
               scene blacks out

                                                       fade out

               fade in

               a high angle shot through the branches of a great tree
               overhanging the wall shows a scene of sad activity
               consuelos body covered with a light canvas sheet lies the
               at the foot of the tree  five ladders three against the
               outside wall two against the inside wall form a curious
               pattern of bars and stripes in the clean morning sunlight 
               uniformed policemen and plain—clothesmen bustle about one of
               them is making a moulage of footprints his little working

               two policemen one uniformed stand at the side and between
               them stands a young man dazed and broken almost hanging in

               the policemen gently shake him into silence

               robles followed by galbraith and jerry come up over the
               ladders robles climbs down the inside ladder as does
               galbraith but jerry being younger leaps down

               the museum is built on a hilltop and from the portico we
               overlook the sagebrush and mesquitecovered hills of new
               mexico rolling away to the horizon at one end of this open
               porch an old indian hand loom has been set up and here an
               indian woman in zuni costume sits patiently weaving a rug
               the shuttle flying back and forth monotonously and the foot
               pedal creaking as she changes threads charlie and jerry come
               into the portico and cross to the door they push open the
               heavy bronze door and enter the museum

               int museum  day

               this museum probably erected with the aid of government
               funds is wellproportioned and severely plain a portico a
               long rectangular display room and a combined office and
               workshop in an alcove off the main room comprise the museum

               the display room has glass showcases containing various
               indian artifacts on the walls are examples of indian rug and
               blanket weaving masks and ceremonial properties

               cases containing labeled shards and artifacts are in this
               alcove on the trestle table which galbraith uses as a desk
               is a reading glass on a fixed stand which he uses to examine
               specimens

               charlie and jerry walk in charlie has evidently been here
               before because he shuffles down the main aisle through the
               display room without looking around jerry keeps pace with
               him but glances from side to side at various pieces at the
               end of the museum they turn and enter the little alcove where
               galbraith is seated at his desk he is sharpening a pencil
               and does not look up they wait

                                   galbraith
                             looking up
                         why hello

               he gets up comes around the table

                             to jerry
                         come to look around

                                   jerry
                         more or less

                         things

               he starts off and they follow him

                             as they walk

                         about charlies leopard

                                   jerry
                         yes

               they have reached the display room and pause a moment from
               this point on the camera trucks with them as they go
               galbraith acts as cicerone conducting them about walking
               ahead of them as he displays the exhibits

                                   galbraith
                             pointing
                         here is something that should
                         interest charlie  a stone leopard
                         head made by his ancestors some six
                         hundred years ago they used it in
                         ceremonies the jaguar  in fact
                         all the cat family  were
                         considered the personification of
                         force and violence in their
                         religious rites

                                   charlie
                             squinting at it
                         it dont look like a leopard to me

               they walk on jerry has paid no attention to the exhibit

                                   jerry
                         charlie doesnt think the leopard
                         killed the girl in the cemetery

                                   galbraith
                             turning with a smile
                         charlie likes his leopard

                                   charlie

                                   jerry
                         but he admitted quick enough that
                         it killed the first girl

                                   galbraith
                             patiently
                         well charlie just why do you
                         think your cat didnt kill the

                         nothing to scare it

                                   galbraith
                         if a leopard didnt do it who did

                                   jerry
                         it could be a man

                                   galbraith
                         it could be why would a man kill
                         her for what it wasnt robbery
                         it wasnt a crime of jealousy or
                         passion she had no enemies

               charlie shrugs

                                   jerry
                         there are all sorts of men you get
                         to see some funny ones as a
                         reporter

                                   galbraith
                             sagely
                         i can understand what you mean 
                         demented men pathological cases
                         but what sort of man would kill
                         like a leopard and leave the traces
                         of a leopard

                                   jerry
                         some crazy guy

                                   galbraith
                         but he would have to know about
                         leopards  have access to leopard
                         claws and hair

               they walk on galbraith points out a nicely molded jug

                                   galbraith
                         heres our prize exhibit  an
                         artifact of the paleolithic period

               he looks into the case with a glance almost of affection
               then turns back to jerry

                                   galbraith
                         we had given up digging in a
                         certain barrow i went back and i
                         tried again i just had a hunch

                                   jerry
                             thoughtfully
                         a hunch  thats all ive got
                         about this leopard thing its just
                         a hunch yet i feel it deep in the
                         stomach it was a man

                                   galbraith
                         yes but what sort of a man

                                   jerry

                             turning toward charlie
                              chuckling
                         you charlie  you know leopards
                         you might have had an old claw
                         around somewhere and perhaps a bit
                         of hair from the cage — eh

                             seeing the joke with a
                              wide grin
                         sure

               trucking shot  cloclo dressed in dancing costume with a
               black shawl over it passes along the street clicking her
               castanets idly from afar we hear a sad sweet mexican love
               song being sung in a high tenor voice

               cloclo passes a dimly lit doorway and we see a woman
               sprinkling holy water on the door step from a font that hangs
               beside the door

                                   mexican woman
                         valganos dios

               she makes the sign of the cross and softly closes the door

               further down the street two policemen pass clo—clo walking
               in step she grins at them

                                   cloclo

               they pass on the camera follows clo—clo the love song has
               grown louder and clearer and now we come to its source a
               young boy is perched on ton of some vegetable crates on an
               old truck parked alongside the curb he is singing for his
               own pleasure and hardly notices cloclo as she passes
               smiling she lifts one pair of castanets to follow the beat
               of his song he waves to her and she passes on into the 
               darkness beyond the truck

               the camera holds for a moment on the young boy as the

               rear skirts the dance floor — watching the customers with
               amusement in doing so she almost bumps into a waiter with a
               full tray to let him pass she backs aside and stands by one
               of the tables

               at this table are three people john brunton his daughter
               helene and her husband dwight

               john brunton is a heavy—set rather impressive looking man of
               about sixty  because he is an older man with the air of
               authority which comes from success and money you have to
               look twice to catch both the gaiety and the gentle irony in
               his eyes helene and dwight are two of his closest reasons
               for that irony they are nicelooking well—groomed somewhat
               conventionally smart people

               waiting for the waiter to go by cloclo half turns and looks
               down at the three people she smiles

                                   cloclo
                         hello —

               helene looks up coolly at cloclo and then reaches for her
               cigarette case dwight with a faint smile which is intended
               to put brash women in their places busies himself lighting
               helenes cigarette brunton looks up at cloclo end gives her
               a friendly smile

                                   brunton
                         hello there

               cloclo continues on her way to the bar without looking
               back

                                   dwight
                             fretfully looking at his
                              wristwatch

                         waiting

               brunton leans back a little and cranes his neck to see if he
               can locate the waiter helene puts her hand over his on the
               table

                                   helene
                             sweetly
                         dont bother i dont want one —
                         do you dwight

               dwight disinterested shrugs his shoulders helene gives him
               one of those saysomethingdope looks

                                   dwight
                             hastily
                         no — no thank you

               the music has stopped and the dancers applaud in the brief
               pause then the orchestra starts again  this time a tango

                                   brunton
                             brightening

                             shrugging her shoulders
                         i suppose so 

               as she starts to rise he gets up to pull back her chair

                         dwight 

               dwight rises from the table and the two of them walk over to
               the dance floor brunton watches them as they go off then he
               walks away in the direction of the bar

               quite a crowd of people are standing around the bar either
               waiting for their drinks or drinking them there others are
               seated at the small tables here and there on the veranda that
               houses the bar at a table quite near the steps leading down
               to the patio cloclo is seated a tall thin goblet of beer
               stands in front of her

               brunton starts up the steps seeing him cloclo grabs the
               beer and puts it on the floor between her chair and the
               veranda railing then she starts looking toward the bar as
               if waiting for someone to wait on her

               as brunton comes to the top of the steps cloclo just
               happens to catch his eyes

                                   brunton
                             pleased

                         another beer

               he looks over the side of the table and gently nudges the
               hidden goblet with the toe of his shoe for a moment clo—clo
               is startled — then she begins to grin

                                   brunton
                             to the waiter
                         two beers  big ones

               brunton looks off toward the steps an expression of dismay
               comes over his face clo—clo turns around to see dwight
               coming up to them dwight looks from cloclo to the unopened
               champagne — and then smiles at his fatherin—law with a
               disagreeably understanding smirk

                                   dwight
                         theyve finally gotten around to
                         our dinner 

                                   brunton
                             shortly

                                   dwight
                             nastynice
                         sorry  but you know how helene is
                          shes been worrying about you 

               still smiling dwight turns away cloclo looks after him and
               then straightens around and faces brunton again

                                   brunton
                         my son—in—law what do you think of
                         him

                                   cloclo
                             flippantly
                         that depends how much money has
                         he

               brunton studies her  not disapprovingly but as he would
               study a child or an animal that appealed to him

                                   brunton
                         when you marry champagne cloclo
                         you cant trade it in for beer

                                   cloclo
                         i cant understand that fancy talk
                             excitedly

                         im a golddigger  why not

                                   brunton
                             echoing her calmly
                         why not  if you like it — if
                         thats what you really want

               cloclo sniffs angrily the waiter serves the two glasses of
               beer clo—clo grabs hers and gulps thirstily

                                   cloclo
                         maybe i should just forget all

                                   brunton
                             interrupting
                         whos carlos domwhatshisname

               clo—clo shrugs her shoulders in a dramatic gesture of
               indifference

                                   cloclo
                         nobody a boy who works in a
                         grocery

                                   brunton
                             watching her
                         good looking

                                   cloclo
                         mmm———yes

                                   brunton
                         nice fellow

               again cloclo shrugs her shoulders

                                   brunton
                         is he in love with you

                                   cloclo
                         i dont know —

               clo—clo looks down at her glass of beer sullenly brunton
               watches her not saying anything

                                   cloclo
                             in a sudden outburst
                         why do you ask so many questions
                         what difference does it make how

                         buy clothes and houses

                                   brunton
                             kindly
                         drink your beer and dont get so
                         excited

               in spite of herself cloclo starts smiling brunton smiles
               back at her and lifts his glass of beer she lifts hers to
               touch it in salute

               the bruntons table the younger bruntons are halfway
               through dinner he looks at his watch she frowns

               she rises and he helps her on with her stole

               john brunton is still seated at the little table he is
               laughing and coughing from the exertion of the laughter clo
               clo stands behind him thumping him on the back she looks
               worried several people in the bar are watching them with
               amusement  but a nice kind of amusement

                                   cloclo
                         youll kill yourself isnt there
                         something sad we can talk about
                         just until you get over this

               brunton wipes the tears of laughter from his eyes

                                   brunton
                         thats what we were supposed to be
                         doing this time but the sadder you
                         try to be the funnier it comes
                         out

                                   helene s voice
                         father

               brunton makes a little face and then turns around to see
               helene who is coming coward him from the steps

                                   helene
                             furiously
                         we finished dinner hours ago

               brunton gets to his feet

                                   brunton
                             wearily
                         all right ill be with you as soon
                         as ive settled this ——

               he waves his hand at the glasses on the little table

               with a fishy eye for cloclo helene turns and goes back down
               the steps

                                   cloclo
                         why do you let her boss you around
                         like that give her a good slap and
                         tell her to keep still

               brunton chuckles he takes some change from his pocket and
               puts it down on the little table the waiter from the patio
               comes up the stairs and hands him the bill on a plate

                                   waiter
                         madame will be waiting at the
                         entrance —

               brunton looks at the bill and then reaches into an inner
               pocket for a wallet he takes a couple of greenbacks from it
               and hands them to the waiter the waiter bows and smiles and
               goes off

                                   clo—clo
                             muttering
                         madame will be waiting  madame
                         ought to go on waiting to have
                         such a father and treat him like a
                         poor cousin

               brunton smiles again  he starts to put his wallet away —
               	then opens it up again and takes a single bill from another
               compartment he puts it in cloclos hand and folds her
               fingers over it

                                   brunton
                         this is for mama and the kids

                                   cloclo
                             without looking at the
                              bill kidding
                         what about me

                                   brunton
                         you get your money from your
                         husband

               clo—clo stares at him

                                   brunton
                         carlos whatshisname  the boy
                         at the grocer

               cloclo looks at him questioningly for a moment — then very
               suddenly puts her arms around his neck and kisses his cheek
               brunton greatly touched pats her shoulder they smile at
               each other  and then brunton turns and walks away

               cloclo looks after him then down at her hand she lifts the
               fingers from the bill crushed in her palm her eyes widen in
               shocked amazement

               insert	100 bill crumpled in her hand  the fingers close
               on it again

               big head closeup  cloclo she smiles happily and starts
               off

                                                       dissolve in

               ext street  night

               cloclo is scurrying down the street as fast as her stilt
               heeled pump will carry her her face is bright with
               excitement and she hums to herself snapping her fingers in
               imitation of her castanets she passes the flower shop and
               then the window of the store where maria tells fortunes clo
               clo hesitates  goes back and peers through the window

               int fortune telling booth  night

               the interior of the store is dismal on one wall hangs a
               phrenological chart in the center of the room is a plain
               kitchen table with two rickety chairs one of them a bentwood
               affair with a sagging cane seat on the table sleeps a white
               cat curled up against a cracked crystal ball a cheap thick
               restaurant saucer on the table is more than half—filled with
               cigarette butts and ashes

               maria is seated at the table a cigarette is in her mouth
               she just sits there not touching the deck of cards in front
               of her —— staring across at the wall

               there is the sound of the door opening and maria looks up
               she says nothing as cloclo comes into the place but waits
               until cloclo stands beside the table

                                   maria
                         well  did he give you a lot of
                         money

                                   cloclo
                         who

                                   maria
                         the elderly man i told you about

               cloclo shrugs her shoulders and sits down at the table

                                   cloclo
                         he was old enough  but you
                         slipped up on the money try it
                         again why dont you

               maria looks at her sardonically but obligingly picks up the
               deck of cards

                                   maria
                         put your wish in them

               cloclo shuffles thorn a few times and then hands them to
               maria maria cuts them into seven piles face down she
               starts turning up the top card on each pile

                                   maria
                         money

               she looks up at cloclo who maintains a completely blank 
               expression cloclo smiles

                                   cloclo
                         maybe a honeymoon 

               maria starts to turn up the next card with a practiced roll
               of the wrist — as she sees what it is however she drops it
               and quickly swirls all the cards together again and hands the
               pack to cloclo

                                   maria
                         cut

                                   cloclo
                             astounded
                         what are you doing that for

               maria shrugs her shoulders cloclo cuts the deck into three
               sections maria starts turning the top cards

                                   maria
                             murmuring
                         again 

               cloclo looks down at the cards perplexed because maria is
               perplexed she sees a ten of diamonds followed by a four of
               spades the third pile is still untouched

                                   maria
                         something black — something on its
                         way to you ——

                                   cloclo
                         go on —

               maria stares down at the third pack and then with a deft
               twist flips the top card face up almost simultaneously
               maria slaps her hand over it

                                   maria
                             sharply
                         dont look at it

                                   cloclo
                             whispering
                         let me see it ——

               slowly seemingly reluctantly maria uncovers the card

               insert	the ace of spades

                                   cloclo
                         the death card  

                                   maria
                         maybe not  cards mean different
                         things different times 

               cloclo just stands there staring down at the card

               cloclo nods her head slowly she lays some silver on the
               table in payment for the reading then goes across the room
               to the door maria stands up and walks over to join her clo
               clo stands looking out of the door she turns abruptly to
               maria at her elbow

                                   cloclo
                         walk a little ways with me —

               again over and over as she moves toward the corner she
               retraces the pattern of her steps when she stopped to talk to

               but just then something further down the sidewalk catches her
               eye she runs along the wall and leans down to grab at the
               bit of folded green and white paper there the elation dies
               from her face stonily rigidly she stares at it the wrapper
               from a stick of gum

               suddenly she whirls and looks across the street there is
               nothing over there nothing moving nothing making sound she
               walks on to the corner arid looking back once goes on

               around the corner she hears footsteps

               — and then an imitative silence she takes a few more steps
               stops suddenly again — and again the pursuing footsteps
               overlap hers as cloclo stands there the silence is
               protracted puzzled but still showing no expression or
               gesture of fear cloclo listens then smiles and turns back

               a hoarse cry of terror is broken off by a violent snarl and a
               flash of cloclos body arching back  almost in the posture
               of a dance  away from the assault of something black which
               rises from lower lefthand corner of the frame and instantly

                         the first girl  but no more

               charlie looking satisfied at having had his say turns and
               goes off after robles jerry and galbraith start off in the
               opposite direction

               the cemetery wall  day

               trucking shot with robles and jerry as they walk along

                                   jerry
                         you must admit its possible that
                         it might have been a man

                                   galbraith
                         just barely possible   yes

               jerry pauses and galbraith stops and looks at him
               inquiringly

                                   jerry
                         you know a lot youve taken a lot
                         of fancy courses in colleges and
                         that kind of stuff   what kind of
                         a man would kill like that

                                   galbraith
                         but all those fancy courses were
                         about the dead jerry not the
                         living

                                   jerry
                         all right  the dead then  in
                         history there must have been men
                         like that  men with kinks in
                         their brains 

               galbraith nods his head he starts walking slowly forward
               again and jerry goes along with him

                                   galbraith
                         yes there have been men who kill
                         for pleasure  strange pleasure
                         there was blue beard in france 
                         jack the ripper in london its not
                         uncommon

                                   jerry
                         if there were a man like that with
                         a kink in his brain around here
                         loose what would he be like

                                   galbraith
                         to the eye like other men

                                   jerry
                         i dont mean that how would he
                         act what would he do

                                   galbraith
                         hed act normally when he was with
                         other people it would be a man who
                         suffered remorse and even pity when
                         it was all over

                                   jerry
                         couldnt you tell a man like that
                         when you saw him

                                   galbraith
                         no he would be a hard man to find
                         jerry particularly if he were a
                         clever men he would go about his
                         ordinary business calmly and coolly
                         except when the fit to kill was on
                         him

                                   jerry
                         youve thought of all this before

                             insistently
                         dont you

               galbraith makes no answer jerry looks at him and senses the
               finality in this the two men start walking once more

                                                       fade out

               the door opens simultaneously with a knock and a mexican
               waiter appears with a large box of flowers in his hands he
               hands the box of flowers to jerry who is	nearest him

               flowers is between them it is covered but the ribbon has
               been taken off kiki holds a card in her hand she looks down
               at it

                                   kiki
                         that was nice of mr galbraith

                                   jerry

                         in touch with him

               kiki looks down at the box of flowers she lifts the box
               cover a little and then closes it again

                                   kiki
                         pretty you know  its funny but

                                   kiki
                         yes

               in the following pause kiki looks out the window jerry
               looks over at her watching her seriously and questioningly
               but as she turns back he looks away again

                                   kiki
                         jerry ——

               jerry waits but says nothing

                                   kiki
                         jerry these flowers arent really

                         you mean you want to take them to
                         the cemetery

                                   kiki
                             a little shamefaced
                         yes do you mind

               jerry leans forward and taps on the glass partition between
               themselves and the driver

               dissolve

               int belvedere in the cemetery  day

               in the arborlike inclosure two or three white pigeons are
               moving about on the sunlit ground as kiki and jerry enter
               the inclosure they lift into the air with a flutter of wings
               and fly away kiki looks around the little inclosure

                                   kiki
                         and she waited here for him

                                   jerry
                         robles says it looks that way
                         belmonte had already been there and
                         left they only missed each other
                         by a few minutes

               kiki goes over to the little marble bench and sits down

               jerry stands and looks down at her

                                   kiki
                         what do you suppose she thought
                         about  alone in here

               jerry shrugs his shoulders

                                   kiki
                         its such a sad little place 

               kiki stands looking out at the sunlit trees of the cemetery

                                   jerry
                         why do you want to stay around
                         here itll only make you feel
                         badly

                                   kiki
                         maybe i want to feel badly

                                   jerry
                         that doesnt make sense

               kiki turns around and faces him across the belvedere

                                   kiki
                         maybe im tired of pretending that
                         nothing bothers me  that i dont
                         care about anything but myself 
                         myself and my twobyfour career

               jerry comes part way across the belvedere to her

                                   jerry
                         what else do you care about kicks

                                   kiki
                         you us

               jerry comes over and takes her in his arms he looks into her
               eyes and then kisses her deeply as he lifts his head again
               he holds her even more tightly

                                   jerry
                         im glad you care about us kicks
                         sometimes that gets kind of lost in
                         the racket 

                                   kiki
                             looking up at him
                         maybe there ought to be less racket
                         and more us

               jerry smiles at her leaving one arm around her shoulders he
               steers her over to the little marble bench they sit down
               still with their arms around each other

                                   kiki contd
                         weve been so busy pretending to be
                         tough hombres 

               jerry nods with a little sigh kiki puts her head down on
               his shoulder

                                   kiki

                                   raul
                             in a hard voice

               raul swings himself into a sitting position on the edge of
               the couch he puts his head into his hands

                                   raul

               raul reaches down and gets the bottle and the glass he
               starts automatically to pour a drink for himself —— then

               table he puts them down and then comes back to raul who has
               sat watching him stupidly

                         it wasnt an animal

               raul frowns and moves uneasily trying to understand through
               his alcoholic haze

                                   jerry
                         it was a man

               the two men stare at each other

                             whispering
                         a man — killed consuelo

               jerry nods his head raul slowly gets to his feet and stands
               eye to eye with jerry

                         to find out

               raul goes over to the table and picks up the bottle he pours
               some liquor into the glass and takes it off quickly as if it
               were medicine then he turns back to jerry

               these worn by the ku klux klanners in the doorways and
               windows the townspeople are watching

               galbraith passes through the crowd he has a small paper
               package in his hand his pipe in his mouth and is walking
               along obviously on his way to somewhere eloise who is
               standing watching the processionists blocks his way for a
               moment he tries to pass around her she sees him and smiles

                                   eloise
                         oh mr galbraith im so glad
                         youre here

                                   galbraith
                             a little puzzled and
                              trying to pass on
                         good evening

                                   eloise
                             stopping him
                         you know all about these things  
                         and ive lived here all my life —
                         and i still dont know what the
                         procession means

                                   galbraith
                         its to remind people of the great
                         tragedy that took place here so
                         that they wont ever forget that a
                         peaceful village of indians was
                         wiped out by the conquistadores
                         back in the 17th century a band
                         of monks buried the dead and prayed
                         for them and did penance for their
                         deaths —— thats what this
                         procession is supposed to be

                                   eloise
                             gushing
                         oh thats so interesting

                                   galbraith
                         well now that youve had your
                         history lesson i think ill get on
                         to the museum

               he nods and starts off eloise turns back to watch the
               processionists

                                                       dissolve in

               ext  cemetery wall  night 

               galbraith is walking along the quiet empty street outside
               the cemetery wall

               there is a very faint cry from inside the cemetery

               galbraith slows his stride perceptibly but does not stop

                                   girls voice
                             os very faint
                         help get me out help help

               galbraith stops and looks up at the cemetery wall 

               closeup of galbraith shows fear and puzzlement in his eyes

               still looking toward the wall galbraith walks on

               ext corner where cloclo was killed  night

               galbraith is walking along the brick wall approaching the
               corner just before he gets to the corner a lighted
               cigarette spins out and falls to the pavement in front of
               him	galbraith stops as if he had come up against stone	he
               stands there forcing courage to go on he takes the few
               steps to the corner and faces the direction from which the
               cigarette was thrown there is on one in sight anywhere

               very slowly galbraith reaches down and picks up the
               cigarette the unlighted end is dark with lipstick with an
               almost imperceptible shudder galbraith lets the cigarette
               fall walking rigidly he continues on his way

               int museum  night

               the large room is in shadowy darkness the heavy front door
               swings open suddenly the place is brilliantly lighted from
               the overhead fixtures galbraith takes his hand from the
               lightswitch just inside the door he pushes the clear closed
               and leans up against it exhaustedly he is breathing heavily
               and his eyes are dull and heavylidded with the reaction from
               violent fear

               he sighs deeply and then walks slowly and wearily across the
               display room to the office alcove he sits down at his
               worktable and starts work on a small model of indian ruins
               done in colored clays

               suddenly far away but clear in the silence he hears the
               sound of castanets —— just three widely spaced clicks his
               hands becomes motionless above the model —but he does not
               look up

               the same sound comes again repeated twice the clicks a
               little more rapid

               galbraith gets to his feet and stands staring into the empty
               brilliantly lighted museum room

               the castanets sound again and this time they go into a steady
               rhythm still faint and faraway a purr of sound but the
               sound increases in volume and intensity every second
               galbraith listens his eyes mirroring his growing terror his
               hands pressing down onto the worktable

               the castanets come up to a brain—splitting reverberation of
               sound the tendons in galbraiths neck stand out —— his
               forehead is wet with sweat

               as the tenseness of his body and the madness in his eyes
               signal that his control is about to break —— the castanet
               furor abruptly ceases

               for another few seconds galbraith stands there  then he
               lifts his hands from the table and draws in a deep shuddering
               breath he takes a handkerchief from his pocket and slowly
               wipes his face and his bands

               re steps out of the alcove and presses a light—switch on the
               wall nearby the overhead lights in the display room go out
               the alcove is new like a little lighted stage at the end of a
               dark auditorium galbraith steps back into it takes a book
               from the worktable and settles down in an armchair at one end
               of the table he begins to read

               the sound of the front door opening breaks suddenly into the
               stillness it brings galbraith to his feet in an instant his
               book falls to the floor

               across the shadowy display room a figure moves to the
               accompaniment of a womans brisk footsteps

               there is no terror in galbraiths face this time  but he
               waits tensely toidentify his visitor

               kiki steps into the lighted alcove

                                   kiki
                         ive disturbed	you im sorry 

                                   galbraith
                         miss walker  i didnt expect
                         anyone ——

               kiki steps closer to the table

                                   kiki
                             apologetically
                         i came up on the spur of the
                         moment

               galbraith leans down and picks up the book

                                   kiki
                         i wanted to	see the procession ——
                         and i remembered your kind
                         invitations	

               she smiles a little uncertainly

                                   galbraith
                         of course only im afraid youll
                         be cheated there isnt much of a
                         view of the procession here

                                   kiki
                             puzzled
                         i thought they came right past
                         here ——

                                   galbraith
                         they do but  there are no lights
                         out there — theyll just be
                         shadows —

               kiki moves across the alcove to a window

                                   kiki
                         its not so terribly dark out if
                         we turn off these lights we can
                         see

               a panicstricken look leaps into galbraiths eyes

                                   galbraith
                             no trace of fear in his
                              voice
                         no use turning the lights out until
                         they get here

               kiki stands looking out at the window

                                   kiki
                         but theyre coming now listen

               very faintly in the far distance can be heard the chanting
               of the procession

                                   kiki
                         hear them

               galbraith listens as if he wore listening to fate itself

                                   kiki
                         turn off the lights 

               galbraith stares across at her with great effort he speaks

                                   galbraith
                             thickly
                         wait ——

                                   kiki
                         no — really i can see them 
                         theyre coming now — turn off the
                         lights ——

               as if hypnotized galbraith walks out of the alcove and to
               the lightswitch on the nearby wall his fingers move up
               towards the second switch he still stares toward kiki he
               has the set bloodless look of a manlost in some fearful
               resolve

               close shot of kiki for the first time we see that she is
               terrified she is looking at the window where galbraith is
               faintly mirrored

               close shot of galbraiths hand on the lightswitch the
               fingers curve clawlike as he pushes down the switch

               int museum alcove  night

               in the window the reflection is blotted out

               outside we can see the processionists marching the pin
               points of their candles are making bright spots against the
               dark background of their robes and the night sky the loader
               chants and the rest answer him monotonously over and over
               again

               kiki stands at the window behind her galbraith crosses from
               the light switch walking normally his footsteps following
               one another with great regularity

               kiki stands perfectly still keeping her eyes to the window
               only her left hand slowly rising to press against her heart
               betrays her anxiety as the hand rises we pick up the beat of
               her heart trick effect

               galbraith comes closer and closer until finally he stands
               behind her the beating of her heart subsides there is
               perfect silence even the processionists cease their chant
               for a moment kiki and galbraith stand this way for an
               instant then suddenly galbraith moves violently toward her
               she screams the side door bursts open and jerry and belmonte
               come pell—mell into the room

               it has all happened with such suddenness that for a moment
               galbraith stands stock still the two grapple with him this
               physical contact rouses him he shakes himself loose and
               dodges around the desk they chase after him through the
               dark

               int display room  night

               galbraith runs in followed closely by jerry and belmonte he
               dodges among the showcases he tries the great door it has
               been locked he turns and starts running back toward the
               alcove they stop him he dodges them and goes on jerry
               starts after him again belmonte reaches under his coat and
               pulls out a revolver the movement has caught jerrys eye and
               he turns

                                   jerry
                         raoul  dont put that gun away

               jerry runs on without seeing whether or not raoul has obeyed
               his order with the gun still in his hand raoul follows
               after

               int museum display room  night

               galbraith runs in past kiki who has left the window and is
               standing in front of the desk just as he passes her

               jerry reaches him grabs his arm and whips him around the
               two men struggle belmonte comes up to avoid the struggling
               men kiki steps backward and knocks against the showcase
               containing the butterflies it falls with a great crash and
               the sound of breaking glass kiki falls with it

               jerry glances over and sees kiki on the floor he lets go of
               galbraith who dodges out of the side door belmonte after
               him jerry kneels down beside kiki

                                   jerry
                         kiki

                                   kiki
                         its all right im not hurt

               he scrambles up from his knees and runs after belmonte

               the processionists slowly climb the hill toward the cross
               the leader is still calling out and the others answer him in
               the long established rigmarole of their ceremonies galbraith
               with a hurried look over his shoulder runs into the scene
               and slips in with the marching men

               med close shot of galbraith as he makes him way to the
               center of the marching column

               jerry and belmonte stand panting beside the marching column
               of processionists he looks right and loft there is no sign
               of galbraith he too falls in the rank near the end of the
               procession he begins to slowly make his way to the head of
               the column peering under the hats and into the dark faces of
               the men his gun is still in his hand

               another angle of the marching column we see galbraith in the
               very center and behind him jerry and belmonte come up and
               look into his face they seize his arms galbraith struggles
               to get away from them there is a disturbance in the ranks of
               the processionists quickly six of the enormous tall
               hooded figures gather menacingly around the center of the
               disturbance no word is spoken there is only the convergence
               of these six great figures about the two struggling men the
               three men subside galbraith ceases to struggle the six
               hooded men leave them drawing back to the flanks of the
               procession

               closer shot of jerry and galbraith the two men are close
               together but march on in step with the processionists and
               as they walk they talk sotto voce despite the urgency of
               what one demands from the other and the other denies the
               silent authority of the hooded figures mutes their voices

                                   jerry
                         it was you galbraith

               jerry studies galbraith a new note has crept into the mans
               voice  an odd note of irrationality and self—pity

                                   galbraith
                             miserably
                         in the whole world there isnt a
                         single human being who knows what
                         it is to be tormented this way 

               the procession has reached the crest of the hill as the head
               of the column begins to make its way around the cross the
               whole file slows from a march to a shuffling half step jerry
               and belmonte seize the opportunity to edge galbraith out of
               the column toward a joshua tree they stand in its deep
               shadow while the procession goes on and off

                                   galbraith
                         when he went away  i thought
                         maybe i was going to help her get
                         over the wall  i cant remember

                             with mounting hysteria
                         i looked down  in the darkness
                         i saw her white face turned up to
                         me  the eyes dark and wide with
                         fear  the fear  that was it 
                         the little frail body  the soft
                         skin —

               slowly galbraiths two hands lift the fingers curved
               slightly inwards he looks at them as if he too were
               terrified by their deadly potentiality

                                   galbraith
                         and then 
                             smiles strangely and
                              appallingly
                         ——	she screamed

               crumpling down at the base of the joshua tree belmonte
               throws the gun away and stands looking at him

                         know we were talking and he said
                         that people were like that ball on
                         the fountain at the hotel they
                         got pushed around by things bigger
                         than themselves thats the way it
                         was with us  and we were too
                         small to see it that way

               he puts his arm about her and they begin to walk up the
               street
