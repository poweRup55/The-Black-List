               head in wonderment at her departing form the barkeep steps 
               up as ray pulls out his bottle

               number about backdoor lovers and broken dreams

               ray steps out of the mens room and is instantly collared by 
               bullethead a man who makes his living being large and 
               threatening

               out the back door past the bouncer who let him in

               claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of 
               approaching footsteps echoing across the vast space claude 
               and ray peer into the darkness

                                     spanky

               spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril 
               he glances at claude

               spanky holds up a hand silencing claude

                                     spanky

               claude protests loudly as bullethead and the henchman bind 
               his hands and feet spanky turns to ray

                                     spanky

                         to keep a low profile but not ray 
                         gibson

               the goons hoist claude up on another pulley and dangle him 
               head first over a hole in the floor several feet down the 
               harlem river laps against the wooden pylons

                                     claude

               shrugging ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks 
               the goons release the rope and claude plunges into the water 
               spanky turns back to ray

                                     ray

               the henchman yanks on the rope claude emerges from the hole 
               gasping for breath

               the henchman releases the rope sending claude back into the 
               water ray reaches into his jacket bullethead pulls a gun 
               and presses it into rays temple ray gives him a look and 
               cautiously pulls out his bottle

               spanky considers the terms can he afford to trust ray can

               ray glances around the pulley rope is still twitching in 
               the water

                                     ray

                         bullet in my back once the truck is 
                         full

               spanky sees rays point he nods to the henchman who hoists 
               claudes limp body out of the water and onto the cement 
               spanky plants a foot on claudes chest and applies pressure 
               a geyser of harlem river water shoots from claudes mouth as 
               he sputters back to life

                                     spanky

               the spinning wheel of a truck

               the camera moves up the side of the old ford truck to find 
               claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat

               int truck moving  night

               ray palms the wheel

                                     ray

                         down the aisle one of these days

               tightlipped claude shifts in his seat

               a look of excitement crosses claudes face but he quickly 
               shakes it off

                                     claude
                         thats gas money

               against the truck

               up aheadext juke joint  night

               ray emerges from the woods and heads down the hill toward 
               the juke joint claude hustles up next to him

                                     claude

               int juke joint  night

               a ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the mississippi 
               the band is laying down some serious delta blues creating 
               an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption

               on a far side of the room ray is playing poker with some 
               locals he seems to be having a bad night winston hancock 
               a formidable black man sweeps in another big pot and puffs 
               happily on his cigar

               over at the bar

               perched on a stool claude shoots a dark look at ray and 
               motions for the door ray waves him off and returns to his 
               game claude becomes aware of a soft young female hand on 
               his shoulder

                                     sylvia
                         ive never seen you in here before

                                     claude
                              staring at the hand
                         thats because ive never been here 
                         before

                                     sylvia
                         im sylvia whats your name

               against his better judgement claudes gaze follows the long 
               slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on sylvias 
               angelic face he is struck dumb

                                     sylvia
                         cant you remember your own name

                                     claude

                         girl a drink

                         two bourbons

                                     claude

                         he looks like he can take care of 
                         himself

               the drinks arrive she places a shot glass in claudes 
               reluctant hand she winks provocatively and slowly pours the 
               whiskey down her throat instinctively claude tosses back 
               his shot

                                     claude
                         claude thats my name claude thats 
                         never happened before

                         claude

                         why would you want to go home its 
                         so early

               the bartender refills their glasses

               back at the poker table

               winston considers his cards hardly looking up as a waitress 
               lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of 
               it he glances at ray who casually considers his cards

                                     ray
                         ill take two

               the dealer tosses ray a couple of cards

               insert  ray fans his cards to reveal a full house

               after considering the other players at the table ray pushes 
               whats left of his money into the center of the table the 
               three other players fold with disgust winston squints long 
               and hard at ray then pushes everything he has into the center 
               of the table

                                     winston
                         ill see that

               winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more 
               money on the pile

                                     winston
                         and while were at it lets sweeten 
                         the pot

                                     ray
                         looks like my sugar bowls empty 
                         mr hancock

                                     winston
                              reaching for the pot

                                     ray

                         with you yet

               ray checks his cards again he looks at the pot its a lot 
               of money with this hand theres no way he can lose he 
               places his daddys pocket watch on top of the pile winston 
               checks the time piece

                                     winston
                         thatll cover it

               ray lays down his hand

                                     ray
                         full boat ladies doing the paddling

                                     winston
                         four threes

               ray sits back stunned winston rakes in his winnings the 
               game is over for the night the three other players head to 
               the bar

                                     winston
                         dont take it too hard new york 
                         have a round on me

               winston tosses a silver dollar to ray who snatches it out

               superintendent abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white 
               curtain surrounding mae roses bed suddenly mrs abernathy 
               staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on 
               her face she tries to speak but words fail her her legs 
               go wobbly and she faints dead away

               the nurse turns around cradling the baby in her arms 
               abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket his eyes widen 
               with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the

               hmm scowling he moves a little further down the line 
               scrutinizing the features of each man he pauses in front of 
               claude holds up the baby maybe abernathy stops in front

                         camp i can feel it in my bones

               against his head

               and so it goes down the line until every last man of camp 8 
               has stepped forward to claim kinship with the superintendent 
               even hardass dillard cant help cracking a smile disgusted 
               confused and thoroughly fed up abernathy jams the revolver 
               into his belt and climbs into the car as he guns the engine

               steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing

               ray lifts his head off his dates shoulder something about

               bead but he cant pull the trigger he lowers his gun

               his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without

               toward his fallen companion jangle leg gently lifts biscuits 
               lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him

               wilkins trains his gun on claude but the moment passes 
               claude lowers the gun bewildered wilkins does the same

               ray mouths the word  soft claude clenches his jaw points 
               the gun and pulls the trigger click

               pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot but as he 
               raises it  blam pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast 
               shocked ray and claude look at wilkins his gun still smoking 
               in his hands

               after a significant beat ray reaches down and gingerly
