     wilsons first impression of los angeles was blue  he was in
     the sky at the time so it was a curious reversal looking
     down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
     natures finest

     swimming pools  hundreds of them  pockmarking the landscape
     like miniature lakes  a flat landscape of straight streets
     and square blocks and sparse grass that didnt look quite
     green enough

     as far as wilson could remember he had only ever seen seven
     or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
     public ones  here everyone had their own  marvellous

     there was the one at the butlins holiday camp where he had
     enjoyed his last legitimate employment  as driver of a tour
     bus  and there was the one at crystal palace he had gone to
     once or twice when he was younger  he was most familiar
     though with the chelsea baths as he had lived for some time
     in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
      before hed gone grey went to prison and found himself in
     a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
     his daughter










     whoosh  the sound of automatic doors opening and ext arrivals terminal  la airport  afternoonwilson steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
     day  a slowmotion moment while he gets acclimatized  he
     wouldnt have ever felt quite this kind of heat before
     after such a rigorously airconditioned interior  or seen
     cops wearing guns on their belts  or black cops for that
     matter with guns on their belts  or seen people as fat as
     americans on their home turf  things someone from england
     notices immediately whether consciously at first or not

     glide  his moves are neat  his expressions just as
     economical not giving much away  outside the planes are

     chemical

     of it besides a sense of wilson  cool cat ambling along
     loner sun beating down not bothered his shadow doubling
     him  is this

     the building approaching  the one he has his eye on  the
     target  its across the street  a kind of flat windowless
     warehouse with adjoining loading yard  loading yard
     surrounded by a chainlink fence  topped with barbed wire

     the actual geography of where he left his car in relation to

     enough to accommodate the couple of trucks parked within

     nearing it now  taking something out of his pocket  one of
     the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit  snaps his
     wrist unfolding the tool with a crack  wire cutters

     he doesnt go for the gate the padlock like we might have
     thought  he suddenly drops to one knee in shadow where the
     fence meets the adjoining building  snap snap snap snap
     snap  so quick with great dexterity though his face
     grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
     application of pressure  he cuts just as many links as he
     knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
     under  whole thing accomplished in seconds

     walks fast to the cover of the trucks  passes  looks
     around  cement loading docks and bays  shuttered doors  he
     jumps up to one puts his ear to the metal  listens awhile

     scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything
     then cocks an ear upwards camera craning up to show us
     what he hears  an airconditioning unit humming away  which
     means someone must be inside

     doors  but a conventional door at one end with a

     many  they beat him  when they find that hes armed they
     beat him harder

     to his feet  dusting himself  reaches for another gun tucked
     in his lower back  he reenters the building

     a beat  we hear several shots

     seconds later one of the meat puppets comes stumbling out of
     the door terrified  he runs past us fast

     a moment later wilson emerges gun in hand

     sure of herself and stops to look at things just like we do
     at one point she looks to see a beefy guy gordon sitting at
     the kitchen counter flipping through a magazine  he looks
     her up and down more from reflex than anything

     she continues on  eventually she emerges through sliding
     glass doors and on to a patio

     approaches then sits beside him  his voice is soothing but
     with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
     slightly ahead of everyone

               for good behavior you grab the boodle
               for as long as it lasts
                   the kicker
               only difference is you cant get arrested
               afterwards

     wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
     table  ice cubes clinking as he holds his  a busboy
     bringing them to other people too just like that without
     anyone even asking

                         wilson

               footloose and fancy free

                         elaine
               she was happy here  however the two of
               you might have parted  dont think she
               wasnt

     its because wilson thinks the opposite that hes here
     looks at elaine

               some word

     wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean  sound
     of waves gently lapping the beach

                         wilson
               i already knew  knew beforehand  when
               was it supposed to have happened  two
               oclock in the morning eddie said

                         elaine
                   watching him
               thats what was estimated

                         wilson
               eight hours difference between here and
               london  wouldve been what ten in the
               morning my time  i was just coming out

               the blood drain right out of me head
               and i knew 
                   beat
               something had happened to jen

     they stand here a while  listening to the breakers hit the
     shore

                                                               cutint elaines apartment  nightthey come in

                         elaine
               make yourself at home  steal something

     that gets her a look

                         elaine
               theres nothing i cant afford to lose

     she goes to make coffee  wilson looks around

                         elaine
               do you even know who terry valentine is

                         wilson
               well i gathered something from the
               article what eddie sent me  some sort of
               pop music producer wasnt it

     maybe a smile from elaine at the quaintness of pop music

                         elaine
               rock n roll is what we called it  hes
               sort of a forgotten figure now but back
               when the west coast was the grooviest
               place on earth terry valentine was where
               all the happenings happened  more of a
               kind of promoter i guess whatever that
               means  just took that whole southern
               california sixties zeitgeist and ran with
               it  packaged and sold it  made out like
               a banditflash cuts

     valentine at home watching as adhara undresses either
     deliberately for him or just casually she smiles as she
     notices hes lookingwilson
               whats he done lately

     that line pregnant with meaning  elaine looks at him
     avoids answering the question actually implied there

                         elaine
                   brings a tray over
               lives high off the hog and waits for the
               next big thing  like me  but on a
               grander scale of failure

                         wilson
               now you shouldnt run yourself down  my
               employer mr lindgren 

                         elaine
                your employer

                         wilson
                mr lindgren

                         elaine
               whos mr lindgren

               longstanding

                         elaine

               concerns

               dishonest exactly

                         elaine
                   she gets the picture
               right

                         wilson
               anyhow hes always saying to me dave
               never run yourself down son  cause
               therell always be plenty of people

               mr lindgren

                when he wants someone run down youre
               willing to do it for him

     they sort of come together  in mutual understanding  and
     sit down  coffee steaming

     of framed posters on the walls  more 60s psychedelia

               that you have down at your office

     valentine sits on the edge of the tub  with a nostalgic air
     as he looks at her  the embodiment of youth

                         valentine
               different ones

     he strokes her wet skin  they kiss lightly

               have you ever dreamed of a place  you
               dont really recall ever having been
               to  a place that probably doesnt even
               exist except in your imagination 
               somewhere far away halfremembered when
               you wake up  but when you were there you
               spoke the language you knew your way
               around 
                   significant pause
               that was the 60s

     she gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel
     quickly wrapping herself she exits

     adhara enters and goes for her purse  she pulls the ringing
     phone out and answers it

     she hangs up and begins toweling her hair  after a moment
     she stops  something isnt right  she looks around the
     room and her eyes stop on the tv  her brow furrows trying
     to place the familiar image on the screen  a girl towel
     drying her hair by the bed

                         adhara
               thats me

     she looks over to see the video camera which has been turned
     on and pointed toward the bed  shes not sure if its funny
     or creepy

               what i like about ian he believes in a

               respect you understand what im saying

     the guy leaves  wilson sees that adhara is now on the other
     side of the room separated from valentine  he heads for
     her

     valentine

     still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
     attention  he notices

     wilson and adhara

     talking in a corner  she seems attentive

     valentine

     in a series of cuts still being the gracious host still
     keeping his eyes on

     wilson and adhara

     who in a series of cuts continue to talk  finally they
     separate wilson heading outside onto a deck

     valentine

     excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her

     adhara

     valentine approaches and begins talking to her low  after a
     few moments of conversation they both look toward

     wilson

     on the deck outside  joining ed whos taken refuge out here
     with a plate of food  what wilson cant belleve when he sees
     it  is that behind valentines house which is on top of a
     high hill is nothing but desolate scrub canyon  on the other
     side of the railing around the deck which is surely less
     than regulation height is a sheer drop into an abyss

                         wilson contd
                   jumps back with only slightly
                    affected vertigo
               flipping heck

     ed a little more accustomed to la architecture nods in
     agreement

                         ed
               if you could afford a house like this you
               would buy a house like this

     wilson edges forward to the rail again

                         wilson
               what are we standing on

                         ed

     they stand there looking out  quite a view once you get used
     to it  breeze

                         ed contd
                   nods to the hazy distance
               you could see the sea from here if you
               could see it

                         wilson
               could you

     but now ed gives wilson a nudge  seeing that valentine
     inside the house is making his way out here

                         wilson
               why dont you go nick one of those little
               cooker whats its warming up the sausages
               cocktail and meet me in the garage  look
               about for a toolbox while youre at it

     ed considers  his is not to reason why

                         ed
               okay

     ed moves off  valentine steps up smile fully loaded

                         valentine
               hi  terry valentine

     he extends his hand  wilson shakes it

               fine the way they were

                         wilson

     legitimacy as an invited guest  closer  about to speak

     but wilson doesnt even give him a chance to do that  in
     quick succession  wilson head butts gordon splintering his
     nose knees him in the groin then using the knee for
     leverage grabs gordon by the lapels  and heaves him over

               turned up  i called the house but only
               got the answer machine  when they found

                         elaine
               i dont believe it

                         wilson
               honest  didnt know where to look till i
               was 21

                         elaine
               pushing the legal limit even then

     he stands again vaguely disappointing her

                         wilson
               me mate introduced me to a woman up the
               street  funnily enough she was married
               to a milkman  straight up  i said
               good is she  been around  he said
               good  listen mush its not that shes
               been around its that shes been around
               hell of a long time

     he laughs uproariously at that  but the point is  hes sort
     of complimenting both elaine and himself  theyve been
     around had their knocks theyve lasted  elaine remains
     unsmiling

     still leaning back on her elbows on the bed in bra skirt
     hose no shoes  she asks again the question wilson avoided
     answering

                         elaine
               your most recent incarceration  what was
               that for

     and again he evades the answer she wants

                         wilson
               it was for nine years
                   buttoning his shirt
               the last nine years

               swam the length of my pool

     adhara looks back over her shoulder  checking the road
     behind

                         valentine
               whats the matter

                         adhara

               just feels like the car behind has been
               following us the longest time

               i sure hope soint the car behinda big utility vehicle  with avery in the front passenger

     valentine  rick driving tom and larry in the back

                         tom
               all im sayin is travel time shouldnt
               be the same rate  travel time is down
               time right  i mean were not even in
               the same car as the client
                   to avery
               you told me the job was at the house
               when we get to it  well are we shadowing
               the client right now or are we just going
               the same way  the company i was with in
               seattle these distinctions were made
               now i dont disputehimgetting the full
               whack
                   he means rick whos older
               seniority and all that  but if im
               getting paid the same hourly rate when
               were at thehouseas i am in this car
               that doesnt sit well with me and i feel
               obliged to say so  cause in seattle
               what youre payingnowfor socalled
               travel time was half what we got for
               actual clocktime with the client  so i
               just feel we should get more when the job
               actuallycommences

     after this spineless whining weakwilled sob story larry
     just turns to him and says

               you dont miss a trick

                         wilson
               i fiddle it  they got me down as an
               immigrant with five kids

     elaine sort of shares a laugh at that

                         elaine
               yeah  jenny spoke fondly of her
               imaginary siblings

     though real ones might have been nice  this an unspoken
     thought between them

                         elaine contd
               do you remember the last time you saw
               her

                         wilson
               last time might as wellve been the
               first  i remember all the times dont
               i  watching her grow up 
                   finding the word
               in increments

                         elaine
               she told me you were a ghost in her life
               daddy the friendly ghost  coming back to
               haunt her

                         wilson
               well she twigged by the time she was
               eight or nine that daddy wasnt in the
               royal marines or doing scientific
               research in the jungles of borneo or
               playing iago in a worldwide tour of
               othello

                         elaine
               still you could never  do what she
               wanted

     wilson shakes his head

                         wilson
               she used to tell me shed turn me in
                   tries to laugh about it
               little kid  ten year old  if youre
               naughty dad ill tell on ya  she
               didnt want me sent down again see

               picking up the telephone  i can see her
               the phone in her hand  became a sort of
               joke between us  only it wasnt a joke

                         elaine
               she never would have turned you in not
               in a million years

                         wilson
               i know that  but as time went on 
               well itwasnta joke was it  she had
               a feeling about it  about the last job
                how long id get the hook for  said
               she wouldnt be there this time when i
               got out

     crane

     feather squints a little  seems ready to listen to whatever
     wilson has to say

                         wilson contd

               i mean  it didnt matter  it meant sod
               all in the end

     feather has been listening to this expressionless  now he
     raises a finger as if theres a point he wants clarified

                         feather
               theres one thing i dont understand
                   wants to make this clear
               the thing i dont understand  is every
               motherfucking thing youre saying

                         wilson

               money

                         wilson
               i can well believe it  im sure he has
               done son  hes about as straight as a
               dogs hind leg

                         feather
               but i cant be sure  i dont even know
               who he is  hes too insulated  too many
               layers around him

                         wilson
               your guess is as good as mine mate  im
               here on another matter entirely

                         feather

               yeah i guess you are

                         wilson

               the one sent those guys after you  you
               know that

                         wilson
               yeah  shouldnt wonder  mustve done

                         feather
               so whats your beef pal

                         wilson
               nothing financial  strictly personal
                   moves to window
               i can see how all this importexport
               malarkey might give rise to confusion
               where im concerned  a foreigner
               showing up unexpectedly like

                         feather
                   looks at him
               it was you  downtown

                         wilson
                   all innocent
               eh

                         feather
               because that wasnt anything to do with
               me  and suspicion has been cast in my
               direction
                   pondering
               didnt make any sense  choosing those
               shitheads over me cutting me out of the
               deal then screwing them over too

                         wilson
               no i can reassure you on that point
               valentine was just as surprised by that
               turn of events as you

                         feather
               hed already grabbed more than his
               allotted cut  didnt think hed be so
               bold as to take all of it

                         wilson
               all of what

                         feather
               of the deal man

                         wilson
               oh yeah right  the deal

                         feather
               but if youre mad at him too and hes mad
               at you  that must make us pals

                         wilson
               as you prefer squire  as you prefer

                         feather
                   weary of his life
               in which case ill just do what i usually
               do

                         wilson
               and that is

                         feather
               what am i doing

     and pushes him back into the room

     bounces off the couch and onto the floor

     comes toward him

     valentine

     grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at wilson  it
     careens off wilsons arm and shatters

     tries to scramble away  throwing anything he can get his

     throws him into the television

     crashes into the tv face first and bounces to the floor

     out his gun with the other  he seems about to speak when
     suddenly he screams instead

     has just stuck a kitchen knife into wilsons back

     turns instinctively and whips the pistol around smashing
     adhara in the mouth

     adhara

     hits the ground  she wont be retaliating

     in agony spinning trying to reach the knife in his back
     but its just beyond his reach

     mortally wounded  goes to him  as if concerned  but
     actually just to take the gun  then runs off the porch
     toward the steps that lead down to the sea

     wilson

     comes out after him the knife still in his back  so intent
     on catching valentine he fails at first to notice avery lying
     in the shadows

     avery

     has just barely managed to reach stacys pistol  raises it
     weakly  points it at wilson

     wilson

     seems to feel it  turns  locks eyes with avery  avery
     could already have shot him  but theres a momentary sense of
     recognition  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats 
     and averys is not worth saving

     lowers the gun  nods in the direction valentine went

     lands on the crumpled dead body of larry the bodyguard who
     was thrown off the cliff  valentine recoils  when wilson
     appears valentine fires at him  a wild shot that only makes
     wilson duck momentarily  valentine scrambles to his feet
     runs on

     wilson

     jumps down from the steps  stops for a moment and leans his
     back against the railing  bends at the knees slightly

     the knife

     the handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now

     wilson

     grimacing pulls the knife out and discards it

     further down the beach

     valentine runs  or tries to  its dark and the ground is
     treacherous  the beach runs out pretty soon  now just
     rocks  maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
     point at the other end  but he cant see very far ahead
     and the tide is in water making any escape extremely
     difficult  he tries to scramble over some rocks  theyre
     wet slippery  he falls cries out as he literally breaks an
     ankle

     painfully rights himself  a small bone protrudes from his
     broken ankle  he fires at wilson gun in one hand other
     hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it  doing his best
     to aim  but the shots miss their mark

     steadily coming

     valentine

     out of bullets now  gun clicking crazily on empty  he
     simply drops it

     now stands before him

     the two of them

     both breathing hard

     easing up just enough for valentine to sputter out a
     response

                         valentine

               handed it to her if she wanted  i would

     theyre locked in a kind of embrace  sprayed by the waves
     crashing into the rocks  sweating and gasping and exhausted
     and hurt and furious

                         valentine
               she didnt want to share it she wanted
               to stop it  to stop meshe said shedturn me in

     shock of recognition on his face  at those words

               she said you go ahead with this ill
               turn you in terry

     wilson sits back  panting  totally spent  the two of them
     both on the ground now  whatever energy they had left drained
      valentine from his confession wilson from hearing it
     valentine shaking sobbing  still not realizing the pathetic
     folly of his actions

                         valentine
               she was serious  she would have done it
               she had the phone in her hand  she was
               going to do it

     wilson

     knows that the girl he loved  loved valentine too  having
     heard the truth the last vestige of revenge has vanished
     he gets up and walks away  leaving the quivering shell of
     valentine behind
