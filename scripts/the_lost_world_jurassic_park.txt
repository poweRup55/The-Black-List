        tropical lagoon  the beach is a stunning crescent of white
        sand at the jungle fringe utterly deserted

                                isla sorna
                87 miles southeast of nublar

        two ship hands dressed in white uniforms have set up a
        picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
        laying out luncheon service  fine china silver crystal
        decanters with red and white wine

        paul bowman fortyish sits in a chair off to the side

        surprised look of a woman whos had her eyes done more than
        once supervises the settings of the table

        she looks up and sees a little girl cathy seven or eight
        years old wandering off down the beach

                                bowman
                        eyes still in his book
                leave her alone

                                mrs bowman

                her have fun for once

        further down the beach

        cathy keeps wandering away muttering to herself as her
        parents quarreling voices fade in the distance

                                cathy
                please be quiet please be quiet
                please be quiet

        rounding a curve in the beach her parents disappear from view
        behind her  a rustling sound draws her attention and she
        turns toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
        sand

        a large bush maybe twelve feet tall is moving its branches
        swaying and shaking  curious cathy walks up to the bush
        which abruptly stops moving

        a small lizardlike animal dark green with brown stripes
        along its back steps out from the bush  only about a foot
        tall it stands on its hind legs balancing on its thick tail
        it walks upright bobbing its head like a chicken

                                cathy
                well hello there

        the animal a compsognathus just stares at her  cathy squats
        down on her haunches

                                cathy contd
                what are you  a little bird or
                something

        she opens her hand  shes got a handful of goldfish crackers

                                cathy contd
                are you hungry  you want a goldfish

        the compy bobs forward a few steps cautiously

                                cathy contd
                come on  i wont hurt you

        the compy draws closer  cathy holds the cracker in the palm
        of her hand  the compy gets closer still 

         and hops numbly up onto cathys palm  her arm dips a bit
        under the weight but its not that heavy and she holds it up
        easily  it bobs its head scarfs up the goldfish and eats
        it

        enchanted cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
        hand calling back over her shoulder

                                cathy contd
                mom  dad  you gotta come see this
                i found something

        she turns back

        thirty more compys have come out onto the sand  theyre
        standing there bobbing anxiously staring at her from a few
        feet away  cathys smile fades

        she turns her head slowly to the right  twenty more compys
        have come in from that side forming a semicircle bobbing
        and chipping as they surround her

                                cathy contd
                        terrified
                what do you guys want

        back on the beach

        the table is set  mrs bowman calls out

                                mrs bowman
                cathy sweetheart  lunch is ready

        from around the curve of the beach a flock of birds bolts
        from the jungle trees as cathys shrill screams suddenly
        pierce the air

                                mrs bowman
                paul

        she takes off running down the beach mr bowman leaps out of
        his chair and follows and all available deck hands race off
        to help kicking up geysers of sand behind them

        down the beach

        mrs bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
        in the beach  we dont see what she sees but we hear the
        frenzied squeaking of the strange compys  mr bowman and the
        hands race past her to help cathy as mrs bowman lets loose a
        horrified slackjawed scream her mouth a perfect oval

                                                        dissolve to

        int board room  day

        mrs bowmans screaming face dissolves slowly over the
        yawning face of a bored corporate executive twenty other
        executives sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
        monied corporation  all are in expensive suits most are over
        sixty  there are rows of backbenchers too whispering in their
        lawyers who sit behind their clients whispering in their
        ears  empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
        hint that everyones been here a long time

        a familiar voice resounds through the boardroom as we move
        down the long table pat the grim faces of the board members

                                voice os
                the hurricane seemed like a disaster
                at the time but now i think it was a
                blessing natures way of freeing
                those animals from their human
                confines  of giving them another
                chance to survive but this time as
                they were meant to without mans
                interference

        the source of the voice is john hammond the founder of ingen
        and creator of jurassic park  but hes not in the room  his
        image is on a closed circuit tv screen which has been wheeled
        up to the end of the table

        and he doesnt look good  hes terribly infirmed propped up
        in bed his face pale and drawn medical equipment beeping
        around him

                                hammond contd
                there are some corporate issues that
                are not about the bottom line  we
                have so much still to learn about
                those creatures  a whole world of
                intricate interlocking behaviors
                vanished everywhere  except for
                site b please  lets not do what
                is good for more men at the expense
                at what is best for all mankind

        the chairman seventyish nods awkwardly to the television

                                chairman
                thank you john  mr ludlow

        he turns to peter ludlow late thirties a man with the
        anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk
        ludlow flips open a file pulls out a stack of black and white
        eight by tens and tosses them on the table

                                ludlow
                        an accent similar to
                         hammonds

                this corporation has been bleeding
                from the throat for four years  you
                our board of directors have set
                patiently and listened to ecology
                lectures while mr hammond signed
                your checks and spent your money
                you have watched your stock drop from
                seventyeight and a quarter to
                nineteen flat with no good and in
                sight  and all along we have held a
                significant product asset that we
                could have safely harvested and
                displayed for profit  enormous
                profit

        he reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove
        sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
        them  its a minimall version of a zoo  cages hold tiny
        replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while boy scout troops
        and tourists look on in wonder

                                ludlow contd
                enough money to wipe out four years
                of lawsuits and damage control and
                unpleasant infighting enough to not
                only send our stock back to where it
                was but to double it  and the one
                thing the only thing standing
                between us and this asset is a
                bornagain naturalist who happens to
                be our own ceo  well i dont work
                for mother nature  i work for you

        two of his backbenchers distribute documents from a stack
        ludlow takes one and reads from it

                                ludlow contd
                whereas the chief executive
                officer has engaged in wasteful and
                negligent business practices to
                further his own personal
                environmental beliefs 
                whereas these practices have
                affected the financial performance
                of the company by incurring
                significant losses 
                whereas the shareholders have been
                materially harmed by these losses 
                thereby be it resolved that john
                parker hammond should be resolved from
                the office of chief executive
                officer affective immediately  mr
                chairman i move the resolution be

                                board member
                i second the motion  mr chairman
                please poll the members by a show of
                hands

        the chairman signs heavily feeling like a traitor  he cant
        bear to look at hammond on the tv monitor

                                chairman
                all those in favor of ingen corporate
                resolution 213c please signify your
                approval by raising your right hand

        it starts slowly guiltily but every hand in the room goes
        up  ludlow sits back victorious  hammond furious raises
        his right hand which holds a remote control and points it at
        the tv screen  it goes blank

                                                        cut to

        ext welders yard  night

        sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
        of a welders yard  scrap iron and steel lies everywhere
        somewhere inside the shed a phone rings

        the whoosh of the arc welder shuts off  dieter stark a big
        barrelchested man of forty or so his face streaked with soot
        and grime steps outside with a cordless phone a cigarette
        dangling from his lips

                                dieter
                yeah

        he takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end  he
        smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke

                                                        cut to
        int new york subway  night

        smoke turns into steam as a subway thunder into a station
        underneath manhattan  the door whoosh open spit out some
        commuters and suck up a few more

        a tall man hurries down the platform limping heavily moving
        as fast as he can  the subway doors begin to close but just
        before they meet 

         the man jams a cane in between stopping them  the man
        is ian malcolm fortyish dressed in black from head to toe
        theres a hard wisdom in malcolms eyes that may not have been
        theres a few years ago  he know what you think and he
        doesnt care

        int subway car  night

        malcolm finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down
        he looks awful  tired  weathered  he notices a curious man
        across from his is staring at his  malcolm looks away  the
        curious man still stares  nervy the curious man gets up and
        approaches

                                malcolm
                        under his breath
                shit

        the curious man sits down next to malcolm grinning

                                man
                youre him arent you

                                malcolm

                i believed you

        no response from malcolm  the guy leans in even closer

                                man contd

                                malcolm
                        a withering look
                i was misquoted  i was merely
                speculating on the evolutionary
                scenario of a lost world  i never
                said i was in any such place

        he gets up and moves to another seat on the car away from the
        curious man  as he sits down he notices two other commuters
        across from him are staring at him

        he looks at them  they looks away

        he pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him  nowhere
        to hide

        int john hammonds apartment  night

        a uniformed butler has a question

                                butler
                whom shall i tell mr hammond is
                calling

        malcolm stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated park
        avenue apartment

                                malcolm
                ian malcolm

        a door opens and a little dog comes yapping out of the back
        it bounds straight at malcolm growling jaws snapping  it
        lunges 

         and malcolm bats it away with one swift swing of his cane
        the dog rolls across the floor and slinks away whining  the
        butler looks at malcolm disapprovingly

                                butler
                not an animal lover

                                malcolm
                not really

        int hammonds bedroom  night

        malcolm enters a darkened bedroom  john hammond lies in the
        bed we saw earlier on the other side of the room

        medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
        the furniture and flowers but the sheer abundance of it tells
        us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle

                                hammond
                ian  dont linger in the doorway
                like an ingenue come in come in

        malcolm steps further into the room

                                hammond contd

                                malcolm
                resentful

                                hammond
                when you have a lot of time to think
                its funny who you remember  its
                the people who challenged you  it is
                the quality of our opponents that
                gives our accomplishments meaning  i
                never told you how sorry i was about
                what happened after we returned

        noticing hammonds deteriorated condition malcolm finds it
        hard to sustain anger

                                malcolm
                i didnt know you  werent well

                                hammond

                they do have motives  why did you
                want to see me  your message said it
                was urgent

                                hammond
                you were right  and i was wrong
                there  did you ever think youd hear
                me say that  spectacularly wrong
                instead of observing those animals i
                tried to control them  i squandered
                an opportunity and we still know next
                to nothing about their lives  not
                their lives as man would have them
                behind electric fences but in the
                wild  behavior in their natural
                habitat the impossible dream of any
                paleontologist  i could have had it
                but i let it slip away
                        pause
                thank god for site b

        malcolm just looks at him for a long moment

                                malcolm
                what

                                hammond
                        a spark in his eye
                well  didnt it all seem a trifle
                compact to you

                                malcolm
                what are you talking about

                                hammond
                the hatchery in particular  you
                know my initial yields had to be low
                far less than one percent thats a
                thousand embryos for every single
                live birth  genetic engineering on
                that scale implies a giant operation
                not the spotless little laboratory i
                showed you

                                malcolm
                i dont believe you

                                hammond
                isla nublar was just a showroom ian
                something for the tourists site b
                was the factory floor  we built it
                first on isla sorna eightsome
                miles from nublar

                                malcolm
                no no no no no no   

                                hammond
                after the accident at the park a
                hurricane wiped out our facility on
                site b  we had to evacuate and leave
                the animals to fend for themselves
                and they did  for four years ive
                fought to keep them safe from human
                meddling now i want you to go there
                and document them

                                malcolm
                are you out of your mind  i still
                have nightmares my reputations a
                joke my leg is shot  you think i
                need more of that

                                hammond
                it would be the most extraordinary
                living fossil record the world has
                ever seen

                                malcolm
                so what

        hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
        to him and open it on his lap  inside there are memos
        charts maps and photographs

                                hammond
                ive been putting this together for
                over a year
                        more
                i have personal suggestions for your
                entire team phone numbers contact
                people  they wont believe you about
                what theyre going to see so dont
                bother trying to convince them  just
                use my checkbook to get them there
                ill fund your expedition through my
                personal accounts as such money and
                equipment as you need but only if
                you leave immediately  if we
                hesitate all will be lost

                                malcolm
                john   

                                hammond
                youll need an animal behaviorist
                someone with unimpeachable
                credentials  i believe you already
                know sarah harding  shes got
                theories about parenting and
                nurturing among hunterscavengers i
                bet shed be dying to prove on a
                scale like this  if you convince her
                to go itll be a major coup  when
                she publishes the scientific
                community must take it seriously

        malcolm just shakes his head flipping through the file sadly

                                hammond
                your documentation you should use
                forensic photographic methods
                hasselbladt still cameras high
                definition video  when the trick
                photography analysts take your
                evidence apart make it impossible
                for them to say there was enhancement
                or computer graphic imaging  oh
                this is very important  avoid the
                island interior at all costs  stick
                to the outer rim  everything you
                need to know can be found there
                vindication lies on the outer rim

        malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to hammond

                                malcolm
                im not going john

                                hammond
                        fatigue returning
                ian you are my last chance to give
                something of real value to the world
                i cant walk so far and leave no
                footprints die and leave nothing
                with my name on it  i will not  be
                known only for my failures  and you
                will not allow yourself to go down in
                history as a lunatic  youre too
                smart  youe too proud  dr
                malcolm  please  this is a chance
                at redemption  for both of us
                theres no time to equivocate we
                must seize it now before 

        he stops staring over malcoms shoulder  malcom turns
        peter ludlow still in his overcoat is standing in the
        doorway to the bedroom  he looks back and forth from hammond
        to malcolm suspiciously

                                ludlow
                hello uncle john  dr malcolm

        malcolm doesnt answer  he seems to know ludlow and dislikes
        him

                                ludlow contd
                did i interrupt something

        malcolm turns back to hammond

                                malcolm
                find someone else

                                                        cut to

        int hammonds apartmentfoyer  night

        in the foyer ludlow hands malcolm his coat just a trifle
        rudely and shepherds him to the door

                                ludlow
                so you two were just uh telling
                old campfire stories were you

                                malcolm
                do me a favor  dont pretend for a
                second that you and i dont know the
                truth  you can convince time
                magazine and the skeptical inquirer
                of whatever you want but i was
                there

                                ludlow
                you signed a nondisclosure agreement
                before you went to the island that
                expressly forbade you from discussing
                anything you saw  you violated that
                agreement

                                malcolm
                you cost me my livelihood  that on
                which i relied to support my
                children

                                ludlow
                if your university felt you were
                causing it embarrassment by selling
                wild stories to hard copy i hardly
                see how i am to

                                malcolm
                i didnt tell anything i told the
                truth

                                ludlow
                you version of it

                                malcolm
                there are no versions of the truth
                this isnt a corporate maneuver its
                my life

                                ludlow
                we made a generous compensatory offer
                for your injuries

                                malcolm
                it was a payoff and an insult  ingen
                never

                                ludlow
                ingen is my livelihood dr
                malcolm and i will jealously defend
                its interests  people will know what
                i want them to know when i want them
                to know it

        ludlow tosses something to malcolm hard  it sails across the
        foyer upright and malcolm reaches out and catches it with
        one hand  its his cane

                                ludlow contd
                dont forget that

        malcolm stares at him for a long moment  finally he turns
        and walks away

        but he does not out of the apartment  instead he
        walks directly past ludlow crosses the living room and steps
        back into hammonds bedroom closing the door behind him with
        a determined click

        int hammonds bedroom  night

        hammond looks up hopeful as malcolm comes back into the room
        and walks over to his bed  he reaches down 

         and picks up the file folder

                                malcolm
                do you have a satellite phone

                                                        cut to

        int mombassa bar  day

        roland tembo late sixties skin like leather and the diamond
        hard look of a cobra sits at a table in the middle of an
        african cafebar in mombassa

        its daytime and the place is half full mostly with locals
        but there are a few obnoxious tourists too americans on
        safari who somehow found the local handout

        theyre a noisy bunch but roland tunes them out calmly
        eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book
        eyeglasses hanging low on his nose

        roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow  he looks
        up  he sniffs the air once then smiles and calls out a
        persons name

                                roland
                ajay

        he turns around  ajay ahjay sidhu a wiry east indian in
        his late forties is standing behind him caught trying to
        sneak up

                                ajay
                        delighted
                how did you know

                                roland
                        taps his nose
                that cheap aftershave i send you

                last time i plugged it in i suppose
                why

        behind them the group of tourists all men laughs loudly
        one of them the most obnoxious tourists berates the waitress

                wellfunded

                of a bitch  you go

        the most obnoxious tourist bellows for the waitress  his
        buddies laughs  roland throws a glance annoyed

                success together you and i

                                roland

                animal wins  if it escapes  but
                there werent enough escapes from you
                and me ajay  ive decided to spend
                a bit less time in the company of
                death  maybe i just feel too close
                to it my

        the waitress comes to the tourists table and the most
        obnoxious tourist actually paws her ass  roland is out of his
        chair in a second

                                roland contd
                        to ajay
                excuse me

        romand walks over to the tourists table says something to
        the waitress in the local dialect and she walks away behind
        him  he stares down at the most obnoxious tourist

                                roland contd
                you sir  are no gentleman

                                tourist

                                roland
                i can think of none greater

        the tourist looks at his buddies and laughs

                                tourist
                buzz off you silly old bastard

                                roland

                with one arm tied down

                                roland
                really

        in the middle of the floor

        the waiter finishes tying a mans wrist to his belt in the
        back of his pants with a napkin  he pulls the knot tight and
        the man turns around

        its roland with his arm tied down  the tourist stands
        across from him

                                tourist
                i mean my arm

        pow  roland punches him square in the jaw  the tourist
        reels stunned  enraged he lunges at roland swinging with
        both arms

        roland bobs neatly ducking the punches waits for the tourist
        to turn around and pops him thrice in the face  the tourist
        spins and goes down to the floor face first  a cloud of
        sawdust and a loud cheer from the locals rise up in the bar

        back at his table

        roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
        ajay  in the background the tourists buddies hurriedly
        carry their fallen cohort out of the bar

                                roland

        ext african savannah  night

        the african savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green
        seen through nightvision goggles  an animal yelp comes from
        the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it  the
        world blurs momentarily then comes into focus on a field of
        long grass

        the grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
        stealthily through it  one animal head pops up above the
        grass for a splitsecond teeth bared a white stripe between
        its eyes  sarah harding pulls the goggles away from her face

                                sarah
                hyenas  ace face is the striped
                snout

        sarah is thirty with a compact athletic body built for the
        outdoors  she loos through the goggles again sweeping ahead
        of the hyenas to their prey

        its a herd of african buffalo standing bellydeep in the
        grass agitated bellowing and stamping their feet

        sarah turns to makena her african assistant

                                sarah contd
                theyll try to take down a calf
                come on

                                makena
                closer

        sarah scurries up and over a rock face  makena follows
        closer now they watch as the hyenas rush the herd running
        through it trying to break it up

                                makena contd
                you know we could see everything
                from up on the edge of that cliff

                                sarah
                no way

                                makena
                but the view would 

                                sarah
                no cliffs
                        into a pocket recorder
                f1 headed sough f2 and f5 flanking
                twenty yards  f3 center  f6
                circling wide east  cant see f7

        while she talks breathless fascinated by the drama before
        her sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action
        makena follows with growing unease

                                makena
                sarah

                                sarah
                f8 circling north  f1 straight
                through disrupting  herd moving
                stamping  theres f7  straight
                through  f8 angling through from the
                north

        shes practically on top of the animals now

                                makena
                dr harding

        makena has a hold of sarahs sweatshirt and is tugging her
        back at least trying to slow down her progress as sarah
        wideeyed with fascination creeps even closer

        suddenly there is a tremendous bellowing and the grass right
        in front of them rips apart trampled under the feet of the
        hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf  they
        yelp and jump their muzzles bloody

        the adults move aside making room as the hyena pups come
        forward squealing to get at the kill  sarahs eyes shine
        with excitement and she moves even closer whispering into the
        tape recorder

                                sarah
                brooding behavior in evidence at the
                kill site pups are ushered forward
                and adults help them eat pulling
                flesh away from the carcass and

        a telephone rings

        sarah stops in midsentence unsure if she heard what she
        thought she heard  it rings again the unmistakable chirping
        of a cellular phone  sarah and makena both move at once
        pawing at a backpack

                                sarah contd
                        a frantic whisper
                i thought you turned it off

        two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone
        sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation

                                sarah contd
                yes

        someone speaks on the other end  sarah rolls her eyes

                                sarah contd
                ian  this better be important

        sarah doesnt say anything for a long moment just listens as
        the voice on the other end talks  and talks

        ian malcolms leg badly scarred is bared and draped over the
        end of a bench  two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
        malcolm is lifting them painfully rehabbing his injury while
        talking on a satellite phone

                member team

        behind them the sparks of a acetylene torch fly as workmen
        make modifications on several vehicles including a darkgreen
        mercedes benz aav allactivity vehicle  the hood of the aav
        is up and the v6 engine has been pulled out a new smaller
        engine is lowered in its place  to one side are two long
        trailers connected by an accordionlike passageway like on a
        subway car allowing one to be towed behind the other

                it has to be crosswise look at the

        from the ceiling a large metal age crashes down landing
        next to them on the floor with a deafening clang  they leap
        back and look up  a workman waves from a scaffolding

                                workman

        constructed of inchthick titaniumalloy bars  malcolm hangs

        twelve years old stands in the doorway to the garage a
        duffel bag slung over one shoulder  she looks at malcolm and
        breaks into a wide grin

        he looks at her hurt  eddie calls out a third time
        impatient now  grateful for the escape malcolm gets up and
        heads for the door  he pauses guiltily

                                malcolm
                im not like you wan me to be  ive
                what i can be

        he leaves

        int main floor  day

        while malcolm and eddie argue over something in the
        background kelly circles around the trailers and looks up at
        the windows  theyre all made of tempered glass fine wire
        mesh inside it  she looks around to see if anybodys
        watching  theyre not so she quickly slips inside the front
        trailer

        int trailer  day

        inside the trailer is a miracle of planning and design  its
        divided into sections for different laboratory functions
        the main area is a biological lab with specimen trays
        dissecting pans and microscopes that connect to video
        monitors

        next to it theres an extensive computer section a bank of
        processors and a communications section  all the lab
        equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
        slides into the walls  everything is bolted down

        she notices a large map on the wall  off the coat of costa
        rica there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
        ink

        kelly puts a finger on the map crossing westward through the
        pacific ocean  thegre are dozen s of islands out here but in
        the highlighted region there is a semicircle of five
        matanceros  muerte  tacano  pena  and sorna  underneath
        the whole island chain there is a bold legend

        the five deaths it says

        slowly an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
        face of the map leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
        of those three ominous words

                                                        dissolve to

        ext open sea  day

        the map dissolves slowly away as the barge spalasehs through
        five foot ocean swells in the open sea  the barge is crammed
        with equipment the aav trailers a jeep and the members of
        malcolms team

        on the boat

        malcolm stands in the bow riding the choppy seas  next to
        him dr juttson fortyish holds onto the railing
        seasick  he shouts over the drone of the boats engines

                                juttison
                        as the waves pound the
                         boat
                couldnt  we just  airlift 
                into the  island

                                malcolm
                dr harding insisted we go by sea
                helicopters are too disruptive
                these arent piles of bones youll be
                studying this time dr juttson they
                live they breathe and they react

        juttson looks at him skeptically 

         and throws up

        at the back of the boat

        nick van owen a goodlooking american in his late
        twenties is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other

        lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon
        sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground bleaching the
        nearby foliage white  in the distance one can hear the cries

        the boat is now beached and the crew flips the tarps off the

        narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the

        clay at the waters edge and the aav backs right over it
        swapping its track for the animals

        the jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
        just beyond the lagoon overlooking the interior of the
        island  the noon sun is high overhead below the valley
        shimmers in midday heat

        eddie connects a flexible cable to the jeeps power winch and
        flicks it on  the cable turns slowly in the sunlight  moving
        along the length of it we see the cable leads to a pile of
        aluminum some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
        color

        as the winch pulls the cable tight the jumble of thin struts
        begins to move slowly rising into the air  the emerging
        structure climbs spidery struts unfolding fifteen feet into
        the air  the light house at the top the cage that was
        tested back at eddies workshop is now just beneath the
        lowest branches of the nearby trees which almost conceal it
        from view

        nick lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the

                listen  i know you all have probably
                concluded that im out of my mind

        is it our imagination or did the trees behind malcolm just
        sway slightly

                thats all right for now  but just
                humor me and be careful

        no its not our imagination there they go again  whole
        trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
        again

                even if you think im harmless and

        now the trees creaks and groan as they sway  everyone has seen
        it and now malcolm turns around too

        postliving quarters  the books are lined up neatly on the
        shelves  the computers sit booted up and awaiting data
        input

        all the way in the back past the spare tires and life
        preservers and canned food and bottled water up in one
        storage bin all the way on top theres a rustling sound

        a plastic student id card pops out in the cracks under the
        bins door  a photograph in the lower right hand corner of
        the card is visible  its kelly malcolms twelveyearold
        daughter

        the card wriggles against the lock and with a soft click the
        door pops open  kelly herself tumbles out wrapped in several
        blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
        liquid  we can guess

        she leaps to her feet blinks the light out of her eyes and
        bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can
        she races through a narrow door and slams it shut

        a sign on the door says restroom  inside a sigh of relief
        is heard

        along a stream bed the jungle trees still shiver  nick loads
        a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
        chews anxiously on a piece of gum  sarah and dr juttson are
        beside him as the group nervously follows the groaning forest
        trees to their right

        at the rear eddie and malcolm walk side by side  eddie is
        carrying a heavy silver rifle an aluminum canister hanging
        beneath the barrel  he shows it to malcolm his voice low and

        from their right the shaking trees seen closer now  by
        walking down the stream bed the humans are tracking right
        along with the animals as they move in the foliage

                                eddie

                dead  before you realized youd
                accidentally pulled the trigger

        ahead of them thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
        stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet  but around
        them the crashing sounds get louder and closer the swaying
        trees shiver right beside them  eddie raises the rifle in
        defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
        and part  above the foliage they see the sudden
        movement 

         of a row of stegosaur fins  the spadeshaped fins run
        along a ridge down the middle of the animals back about
        three feet tall each  the group freezes amazed and as the
        stegosaur continues on they get a good look at it through a
        break in the foliage

        its a large dinosaur with a small head a thick neck and a
        huge lumbering body

        a double row of plates runs along the crest of its back and
        it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it

        the gum drops out of nicks mouth flops onto his shirt and
        sticks there

                its beautiful

        a second stegosaur a baby about a quarter the size of the
        first animal breaks through the foliage following the adult

        while the group is reaching to that the earth vibrates and
        a third stego by far the biggest of the three walks out of
        the foliage right behind them crossing within ten feet

        apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
        environment the stegos continue on across the stream bed

        sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures  her shutter
        is muted so that a muffled click is all thats audible

        juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
        it breathlessly

        his breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter of all
        things as he cant contain his astonishment  eddie covers
        his mouth trying to keep him quiet

                group even long after that infant
                was nestbound

                                juttson
                i want to see the nesting ground

        nick turns to malcolm eyes like saucers and makes a futile
        wordless boywasiwrongonthisone gesture  malcolm
        smiles leans over and taps softly on nicks video camera
        nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
        continues on into the bush after the animals

        in the bush

        the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
        where sarah crouches in the bushes  sarah raises her camera
        again and silently snaps a picture  she whispers to juttson
        who is beside her

                                sarah
                lone nest  not colonial  i dont
                see an egg clutch

        glasses

                        whispering back
                the empty shells are crushed and
                trampled  the young stay in the
                birth environment thats conclusive

                                sarah
                not without a shot of the nest

        she sees an opportunity  as the baby heads back to its
        parents sarah scoots right along with it moving behind it
        using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
        other two

        nick and eddies faces whiten in alarm  nick reaches out to
        stop her but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
        before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
        clearing

        in the clearing

        sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back
        toward the nest chewing the branches it carries in its south
        she raises up sightly squeezing off pictures of the herd
        ever better as she gets closer

        back at the hill

        the others can only watch her aghast

                                nick
                shes gutty

                                malcolm
                shes nuts

        in the clearing

        sarah keeps moving closer  the baby passes a small grouping
        of rocks and sarah ducks behind them  shes now in a perfect
        position to photograph the nest and she squeezes off picture
        after picture from this ideal vantage point

        she shoots the last picture on the roll 

         and the cameras autowinder whirs to life  sarah looks
        down in horror as the cameras motor whines loudly in her
        hands

        th noise startles the animals  the male turns toward her
        the plates on its back bristling  sarah gets to her feet and
        starts to move away slowly

        the male turns away from her and swings its tail spikes
        extended  it whizzes through the air right at her but sarah
        leaps back at the last second 

         and the tails spikes thud into the dirt where she was

        sarah crunches to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
        away disappearing into the bush moving surprisingly quickly
        for animals their size

        the others run to sarah help her to her feet and pull her
        back against a massive tree trunk  but the tree trunk lifts
        right up off the ground

        its no tree its a dinosaurs leg a massive one six feet
        across god knows how many feet high  the group gasps and
        looks up as a makenchiasaurus an enormous saurupod over a
        hundred feet from nose to tail  lumbers away from them

        the group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
        honks furtively its long neck stretched out above them

        now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
        surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first  the
        first mamenchiasaur thunders around in a semicircle getting
        into position behind the second

        nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
        suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating

        the mighty tails swing and snap around them as the two animals
        come together and trees start snapping and falling crashing
        to the jungle floor

        the group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
        where the trees are not falling  which is directly underneath
        the animals

        amid honks and bleats the swinging tails continue to deforest
        the jungle around them

        the noise and chaos is deafening drowning out the laughter
        and screams of the fascinated and terrified group

        there is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
        underneath the animals disappearing into the thick forest

        a short distance away

        the group collapses to the ground breathless chests heaving
        with wild frightened laughter  sarah goes to malcolm and
        throws her arms around him exhilarated

                                sarah

        suddenly the gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
        seriously  they march quickly back to base camp their energy
        and excitement palpable  nick strikes a match and raises it
        to a cigarette with a shaking hand but sarah leans in and
        blows it out

        nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a

        of smoke  in the middle of the base camp someone has neatly
        built a campfire surrounded by stones  flames burn in the
        middle

        nick races over to it and stomps it out as the others emerge
        from the trees behind him

                smell blood in the water youre
                dead  our presence has got to be one
                hundred percent antiseptic  that
                means if we bend a blade of grass we
                bend it right back the way it

        a low sound has been rising while she speaks and now it comes
        booming over the jungle around them a thunderous racket that
        shakes the very ground beneath them  suddenly three c130
        military cargo planes thunder overhead and roar toward the
        island interior flying very low  the planes are enormous
        fatassed creatures their rear cargo doors hanging open

        at a ridge

        the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
        over a ledge watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
        specific spot

        eddie raises a pair of field glasses

        down below

        huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
        cargo bays  they snap off trees like matchsticks crush flat
        anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land

        now men pour out the rear of the planes their lowaltitude
        parachutes billowing open behind them

        up on the ridge

        nick looks at sarah

                                nick
                you were saying something about
                antiseptic

        metal container doors clang to the ground jeep engines roar
        to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke blue laser
        barriers sizzle and burn through foliage as this group of
        hunters establishes a perimeter around their new camp

        peter ludlow dressed in brand new banana republic safari
        wear steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
        surroundings  he turns to dr robert burke a ragged
        ponytailed man in wirerimmed glasses

                                ludlow
                welcome to your dream come true dr
                burke

        burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
        he spreads out on the hood of a jeep

                                burke
                i believe the large herbivores forage
                in open plains like bison which
                would explain the great variety of
                heat dots were reading in the
                flatlands around this waterhole
                right  here

                                ludlow
                then thats where were going

        burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
        times  inside there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
        underneath  as each vehicle roars out of the equipment
        container burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
        icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
        dashboard

                                burke
                        calling them off
                hadrosaurus  carinthosaurus
                maiasaurus

        as the procession goes on ludlow turns to dieter stark the
        man we saw welding earlier

                                ludlow
                this is as good a place as any for
                base camp  first priority is the
                laser barriers i want them all up
                and running in thirty minutes  half
                an hour understand

        dieter nods and turns to some of the hunters who number about
        twenty in all that are working nearby  but someone steps in
        front of dieter cutting him off  its roland tembo the
        hunter from the bar in mombassa

                                roland
                cancel that dieter

                                ludlow
                what  why

        roland points to a stream running nearby

                                roland
                carnivores hunt near stream beds  do
                you want to set up base camp or an

                                ludlow
                        thinks
                you heard his dieter  find a new
                spot  and remember were after
                herbivores only  no unnecessary
                risks

        dieter sighs and goes to work  roland puts an arm around
        ludlow and pulls him aside

                                roland

                                ludlow

        ext jungle

        the jungle foliage shivers quakes and finally falls as the
        hunters convoy roars into the hart of the jungle  dieter
        stark stands in the front of the lead vehicle the
        speedbird waving the convoy forward his driver carter at
        the wheel beside him

        ludlow is in the back seat of the speedbird next to dr burke
        roland and ajay his tracker are in the second jeep  they
        look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
        stops forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well

        in the front the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
        front of it  dieter climbs out plainly irritated  he walks
        around the front of the car and sees 

         four pachycephalosaurs eating grass in the middle of the
        jungle trail  theyre about five feet tall thick heavyset
        animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing
        a tall impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
        heads  dieter doesnt seem impressed  he looks back at
        ludlow who look at dr burke

        burke stands up in his seat a look of wonder on his face

                                burke

                eater see that distinctive domed
                skull  thats nine inches of solid
                bone

                        who cares
                just get them out of the way dieter

                                dieter
                come on move it

        the pachys look up at him sluggishly still eating like cows
        chewing their cuds  as unimpressive with him as he is with
        them they go back to their grass

                                dieter contd
                oh for gods 

        he slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
        closest animal  behind him roland has climbed out of the
        second jeep

                                roland
                dieter  this is a roundup not a
                war  use your powers of persuasion

        dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead which it does
        slowly toward the animals  the pachys look up alert but do
        not move  dieter walks toward them

                                dieter
                come on come on dont have all
                day

                                burke
                        going on to no one in
                         particular
                see the pachys neck attaches at the
                bottom of its skull instead of the
                back of its head as with reptiles

        the speedbird draws closer  the first pachy stares at it
        intently  the lead vehicle gets closer closer 

         and bangs into the pachy knocking it back a few feet out
        of the way

                                burke contd
                so when it lowers its head its neck
                lines up directly with its
                backbone 

        behind dieter

        ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet  he
        takes a few steps further into the foliage then turns back
        toward roland

                                ajay
                roland

        up at the front

        the pachys turn and hop away  dieter turns and heads back to
        the speedbird  as he reaches for the door a voice calls
        look out from behind him  dieter spins around just in
        time to see 

         the first pachy in full charge  it slams headfirst into
        the speedbird smashing the headlights and denting the grill

                                burke
                        concluding his lecture
                which is perfect for absorbing
                impact

        dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car  the
        pachy has backed up  for another run and is now charging right
        at him

        dieter retreats quickly and rips open the passenger door to
        protect himself

        slam  the pachy clobbers the door sending dieter flying
        against the car knocking the wind out of him

        in the other jeeps the rest of the hunters stand up or lean
        out the window for a better look laughing

        pow  the pachy headbutts the tire next to dieter  it
        bounces off tumbles to the ground and rolls to its feet as
        dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
        speedbird

        but the pachy is quicker and lunges at dieter again  hes
        forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
        speedbird just as the animal slams into the rear of the
        vehicle

        now the other three animals join the jun  ludlow and the
        driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
        car again and again smashing the steelmeshed windows and
        mangling the quarter panels  the rest of the group watches
        vastly amused

        a few steps into the jungle

        ajay and roland are staring at something on the ground  an
        animal footprint threetoed enormous

                                ajay
                it matches the pictures

                                roland
                it certainly does

        roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle ignoring the
        pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird
        roland opens a case in the back of the jeep revealing 

         his gun  its an antique elephant gun a double barreled
        600 nitro express  nearly a hundred years old its still in
        immaculate condition its rosewood stock buttery smooth
        bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach

        the barrels are twentyfour inches long topped with an ivory
        bead foresight at the business end  roland scoops up the gun
        breaks the breach and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
        shirt pocket

        four inches long and threequarters of an inch in diameter
        these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made
        he slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush

        roland pauses before he goes as if noticing the animals
        trashing the speedbird for the first time

                                roland
                hey

        the pachys all freeze staring at him  roland waves one hand
        hisses sharply between his teeth 

         and the pachys scatter back into the jungle  takes care
        of that problem  roland turns and heads back into the jungle
        calling out over his shoulder to ludlow

                                roland contd
                dont worry about us  well catch
                up

                                ludlow
                where do you think youre going

                                roland
                to collect my fee

        and with that he disappears into the foliage

        the driver of the speedbird drops it into gear and the
        battered car groans forward  as it moves ahead it reveals
        dieter lying underneath it ego bruised worse than body

        in the jungle

        ajay takes a step into the bush but at a ninety degree
        angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
        lead

                                roland
                ajay

        ajay turns  roland points in the direction in which the
        footprints lead

                                roland contd
                im no tracker but even i can read
                this spoor

                                ajay
                do you wish to go where the animal
                has been or where the animal is

        roland smiles  ajay sets off in his direction and roland
        follows

        kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as

        the group moves on ahead but malcolm lingers angry staring
        through the binoculars

                what are you doing to me john

        ext the caves  day

        ajay and roland make their way through the foliage and come
        into a small clearing where a cluster of caves is carved into
        the rock  ajay freezes gesturing ahead to the cave on the
        far left

        roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
        breeze  it floats back between his legs  thats good

        he proceeds toward the cave carefully ajay behind him  they
        can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave only a
        black interior

        roland pauses looking down  on the ground to his right he
        sees the partially eastern leg of a creature  its old
        crawling with white maggots and flies

        roland continues on  closer to the cave he now passes the
        skull of a large animal some of the flesh and green skin
        still adhering to the bone  it too is covered with flies

        still he continues on  a short rise leads into the cave and
        they edge up it  from inside the cave they can hear an odd
        squeaking sound very highpitched

        crawling now roland and ajay scale a fourfoot circular
        rampart of dried mud and peer into 

         the tyrannosaur nest  its flattered inside about ten
        feet in diameter completely encircled by earthen walls

        a baby tyrannosaur about four and a half feet long is in the
        center of the nest  it has a large head very large eyes and
        its body is covered with a fluffy red down which gives it a
        scraggly appearance

        it squeaks repeatedly tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
        chunk of animal flesh biting decisively with tiny sharp
        teeth

        the cave itself is a foul boneyard  animal carcasses litter
        the edges flies buzz in the captive air  roland raises a
        bandana to his nose to cover the stench  he  turns to ajay and
        whispers

                                roland
                its the rex nest

        ajay nods  the baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
        up cocking its head in curiosity

                                ajay
                make a blind here  wait for the buck
                to return

                                roland
                        shakes his head no
                if the nest is upwind so are we
                when he comes back hell know were
                here before we have a chance  the
                truck 

        in the nest below the baby squeaks angrily at the intruders

                                roland contd
                 is to get him to come where we
                want him

        the baby squeaks again indignant  roland turns and looks
        down at it  thinking

                                                        cut to

        ext ridge  dusk

        as the sun glows bright orange on the horizon nick raises a
        pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
        below the ridge

        in the lenses of the binoculars we can clearly see a mixed
        herd of midsized herbivores  hardosaurs pachycephalosaurs
        and callimimuses  racing across the plain below

        malcolm also staring through binoculars lies on the ridge
        beside him  sarah is several feet behind them her back
        pressed against a tree unwilling to go to the lip of the
        ridge

        through nicks binoculars

        we see a shaky point of view of the herd running  the
        binoculars whip to the right 

         revealing a jeep chasing the herd  not just one jeep in
        fact but a whole fleet of hunter pursuit vehicles

        there are two herding jeeps one motorcycle as speedier
        minijeep and further behind a container truck and a
        wranglers pickup truck

        although theres a great deal of commotion below up here its
        almost eerily silent

        on the ridge

        nick lowers the binoculars angry  when he raises them again
        the sun flares off the lens 

        ext the plain  dusk

         and when the brilliant flare clears were right down in
        the middle of the roundup  engines roar wheels spin and dig
        in the dirt men shout and radios squawk as the hunter
        vehicles pursue the fleeting herd theyre flushed

        the hunter shout and shriek with glee incredulous and
        thrilled by the spectacular animals theyre pursuing

                                hunter
                look at these things

                                hunter 2
                theyre beautiful man theyre
                beautiful

        one of the pursuit vehicles a snagger pulls ahead of the
        others  dieter stark stands in the passenger seat holding a
        long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it

        he swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and shouts to
        the driver

                                dieter
                faster

        the driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward gaining
        on the herd  aware of the danger behind them the herd veers
        to the right toward the cover of thick jungle 

         but the motorcycle roars in from the right side cutting
        them off herding them back out into the open

        back in the container truck

        peter ludlow stands in a conning tower a command post in
        the heaviest pursuit vehicle  he barks into a walkietalkie

                                ludlow
                alive dieter and uninjured

        back on the snagger

        the driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
        thrown by the herd ahead of him  dieter curses and throws the
        lasso pole into the back of the jeep  ludlows voice
        continues over the radio in dieters jeep

                                ludlow os
                those are very expensive animals
                can you hear me

                                dieter
                        to the driver
                turn that off

        the driver snaps off the radio as dieter grabs a longbarreled
        rifle from the back of the vehicle

        the motorcycle

        guns it again forcing the herd back into the middle of the
        plain  from the trees to the left two heads on enormous
        necks rise up in alarm  two apatosaurs are startled from the
        bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain

        the herd doesnt even break stride but keeps running
        scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
        massive legs

        one smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose but the motorcycle
        cuts it off and herds it back into the middle which now takes
        the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
        the apotosaurs

        the bike chases the pachy out the other side and as the
        apatosaurs disappear into the distance the cycle isolates the
        juvenile

        another truck a scissor rig spots the isolated animal
        high in the back of the truck a hunter mans a tranquilizer
        cannon drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down

        he fires and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
        neck  its pace slows and another hunter from the truck tosses
        a lasso around its neck

        they crank a winch reeling in the animal

        as the truck gain on it two sixfoot padded arms with what
        look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
        the truck

        as the animal is pulled in the scissors close with a
        hydraulic whir trapping the animal between its airbags

        now a pickup rig roars up and drops its back gate  the
        scissor rig rolls forward depositing the squirming pachy in
        this dinocontaiment vehicle

        two hunters throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
        the scissor rig backs away leaving the animal still pinched
        between the bars imprisoned in the back of the pickup rig

        the hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
        and it takes off back into the hunt

        back on the snagger

        dieter rifle in hand drops down into the passenger seat
        whips a harness over himself and clicks it into place  he
        jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard

        immediately a motor underneath the seat hums to life and the
        seat itself telescopes extending a good four feet out to

        dieter raises the gun picks a carinthosaur a redcrested
        herbivore from the rear of the fleeting herd and takes aim

        bang

        the carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
        its left hindquarter

        up on the ridge

        there is utter quiet  nick and the others stare wordlessly at
        the spectacle below

        down on the plain

        the snagger shudders to a halt in the dirt kicking up a huge
        cloud of dust and dirt

        the motorcycle spins to a stop beside it its driver pushing
        his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirtstreaked face

        the wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door which
        clangs heavily to the ground

        four wranglers carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
        the ramp and out of the truck

        dieter jumps off the snagger  he puts down his tranquilizer
        gun picks up a long steel rod and walks forward slowly
        ahead of him the carinthosaur is still on its feet

        the sedated animal staggers fighting to retain its balance
        while it is surrounded by the wary wranglers

                                dieter
                easy  easy  not too close
                full extension

        the wranglers adjust their poles extending them another three
        feet which allows them to stay further from the reeling ten
        foot tall animal

                                dieter contd
                now

        almost as one the wranglers flip their noose over the
        stunned animals neck  it thrashes but the wranglers hold
        their poles tightly surrounding and immobilizing it

        up on the ridge

        nick turns away  he cant watch

        down on the plain

        a bolerotype device a rope with a round weight at either
        end whips around the carinthosaurs legs  the animal thuds
        to the dirt with a snort of a defeat

        ludlow steps up next to dieter and both of them stare down at
        the helpless animal  ludlows breathing heavily eyes
        glowing

        the animal is still thrashing pumping its legs crazily
        dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod hes holding
        and thrusts it into the defenseless animals neck

        a blue arc of electricity cracks and dances over the
        carinthosaurs body  the animal convulses in pain a
        horrible highpitched squealing rips the air

        dr burke their paleontologist hurries forward with a
        syringe

        he draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
        injects it into the animals thigh

        carter dieters driver steps up with a can of spray paint
        and quickly tags the animal with an id number in dayglo
        orange

        dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
        dashboard of the jeep and marks a black x over the drawing of
        the animal

                                dieter
                next case

        ext ridge  night

        night has fallen over the island  the hunters have
        established base camp in an area they have trampled and
        cleared just below the ridge  blue laser fences encircle the
        perimeter  inside half a dozen tents are set up around a
        central campfire

        the vehicles are all parked at one end away from the tents
        at the other end there is a row of at least a dozen capture
        containers cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
        have already rounded up

        sarah malcolm and nick stand at the edge of the ridge above
        looking down at the scene  sarah stands a bit further back
        from the others not wanting to get too close to the edge
        voices waft up to them raucous laughing some even singing

        dr juttson has a pair of nightvision binoculars trained on
        the cages

                                juttson
                carinthosaurus  compsognathus 
                triceratops  pachycephalosaurus 
                or small scavengers only

        malcolm also with binoculars furrows his brow seeing
        something below

        through malcolms binoculars

        he sees peter ludlow standing in the middle of the camp
        pointing giving orders

        on the ridge

        malcolm drops the binoculars

                                malcolm
                ludlow  thats why hammond was in
                such a hurry for me to get here  he
                knew they were coming

        he gives the binoculars to sarah who moves forward gingerly

        ext jungle  night

        in the jungle ludlow approaches a small clearing  roland is
        bent over a small stake in the ground chaining something to
        it  as ludlow approaches and walks around him he sees what
        protest  roland looks up

                                roland
                offering a little incentive

        ludlow laughs and shakes his head  he takes a drink and
        offers roland one  roland accepts  ludlow notices rolands
        gun leaning against a tree

                                ludlow
                what kind of gun is that

                                roland
                my fathers 600 nitro express  made
                in 1904  karimojo bell gave it to
                him after he took down his last
                elephant  8700 foot pound striking
                force

                                ludlow
                how close do you have to be

                                roland
                forty yards  less maybe  i assume
                itll take a slug in the brain case
                to bring him down

                                ludlow
                why not just use a scope and a poison
                dart and snipe him from a hill

        roland just looks at him

                                roland
                or a laser beam from a satellite

        ludlow leans down close to the baby rex and examines it
        while it thrashes on its chain  its mouth has been bound shut
        with a leather strap

                                ludlow
                you rally think thisll draw the

                i once saw a bull elephant die
                charging a jeep  all the jeep had
                done was startle the bulls calves
                i saw a lioness carry wounded prey
                four and a half miles all the way
                back to its den just to teach its
                cubs how to finish off a kill

                                ludlow

                come

                                ludlow
                youre kidding yourself  an adult
                trex cares about one thing 
                filling its own belly  it acts the
                way people wish they could thats
                why everyones fascinated by it  if
                people had the chance to see one
                dinosaur and one only ninetynine
                percent would 

        he stops an idea on his face

                                ludlow contd
                wait  why not  sedatives
                growth inhibitors

                                roland
                what

                                ludlow
                i hadnt planned on bringing
                carnivores back because of the
                liability risk but i only thought of
                adults it never occurred to me 
                        close to the animal
                you are a billion dollar idea my
                little f

        crack  the tyrannosaur even with its jaws clamped shut
        lunges at ludlows face headbutting him right across the
        bridge of the nose  ludlow staggers back waiting in pain
        clutching his bleeding face

        roland laughs  ludlow like an enraged child snatches up
        rolands gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rexs
        leg  the bone breaks with a dry snap and the animal howls in
        pain

        roland lunges and throws ludlow to the ground but the damage
        is done

                                roland
                what the hell you do that for

        as his pain eases ludlow feels a bit foolish but he attempts
        to cover

                                ludlow
                had to  to keep him still for the
                trip

                                roland
                youve broken its leg

                                ludlow
                weve got to transport it seven
                thousand miles  would you prefer it
                bit off the leg of a crew member

        he gets up brushes himself off and heads back to the camp
        trying to salvage his dignity  roland watches him go

                                                        cut to

        ext edge of hunters camp  night

        at the edge of the hunters camp nick sarah and malcolm
        scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
        barriers  there are three beams each about two feet apart
        the tallest almost six feet off the ground

        nick reaches the edge and crouches  sarah helped by malcolm
        steps up onto his back and jumps over the top landing with a
        crunch  nick is next given a boost by malcolm who is then
        left alone on the other side

        he backs up a few steps jogs right at the lasers then
        springs off his good leg 

         and does the fosburry flop right over the top  he lands
        with a thud to the silent admiration of the other two

        further in the camp

        the three of them creep along hiding behind a stack of fuel
        barrels  they lean around the edge for a look  theyre
        directly behind the row of vehicle

        they move into the open covering the ground between them and
        the jeeps  reaching them nick hits the dirt and wriggles
        under the first one  malcolm and sarah stand lookout

        under the jeep

        nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket  he squirms
        along until he finds the jeeps fuel line 

         and he snips it  he ducks out of the way just as the
        stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt

        malcolm and sarah

        move slowly down the line standing watch as nick crawls out
        from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second  they
        hear another snip then keep moving to cover him as he moves
        to the third

        from in the distance malcolm hears a sound a faint
        highpitched screeching  he turns and looks to that
        direction

        ext jungle clearing  night

        its the baby trex still screening  up in a nearby tree
        roland and ajay have spread some broken branches crosswise to
        form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground

        they wait

        roland raises his binoculars  the light of the camp spills
        all the way out here illuminating some of the jungle  he
        scans it searching for any sign of movement

        ext hunters camp  night

        back in the camp sarah malcolm and nick have finished with
        all of the vehicles except the badly battered one which is
        parked some distance away undergoing repairs  the motor pool
        area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline

        the saboteurs walk casually across the camp unnoticed in the
        drunken revelry  they pass several tents the shadows of the
        partiers visible as they move inside

        they continue across the camp and arrive at the other side 

         to face the caged animals  the carinthosaur that was
        tranquilized earlier stands there dully eyes heavy and
        glassy still under the effects  they pass a stegosaur its
        row of fine bristling

        and finally they reach the largest cage which houses a
        triceratops the size of a pickup truck nick pulls out his
        trusty bolt cutters  he looks at them a glint in his eye

                                nick
                hang on  we may encounter some
                turbulence

        int hunters camp  night

        in one of the hunter tents peter ludlow leans over the
        satellite recon pictures of the island planning the next
        days assault with dieter and dr burke their paleontologist
        there are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
        photos indicating where certain species can be found

                                burke
                if youre really interested in
                infants well have better luck at
                the seaside because the sands offer
                a cushioning surface where the egg
                clutches can  can 

        he trails off  a low rumbling sound can be heard outside and
        the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board

        they look at each other  the rumbling gets louder  outside
        someone shouts on the board the little dinosaurs start
        hopping and bouncing from the vibrations the shouts outside
        turn to screams they turn and look at the back of the tent 

         and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas

        ext camp  night

        hunters go flying as the tentcovered triceratops its horns
        tearing through the canvas rumbles across the camp  men
        shout in alarm the triceratops bellows in anger and
        confusion chaos reigns

        in the crush of people running every which way malcolm and
        sarah are swept off in one direction while nick is buffeted
        in another  they shout but cannot be heard over the frey

        the triceratops blinded by the canvas shroud stomps right
        through the fire in the middle of the camp and the tent bursts
        into flame

        now really upset the animal panics and lashes out in all
        directions blasting through tents demolishing andor setting
        ablaze anything that gets in its way  its considerable
        hindquarters slam into a parked jeep sending it rolling
        across the camp

        the jeep flattens the largest tent and slams down on its side
        its broken gas line sprays gas over the ground the gas hits
        one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
        its wake and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas

        the jeep explodes

        out in the jungle clearing

        roland and ajay up in the tree leap to their feet as a
        fireball rises up from the camp in the distance

                                roland
                what in gods  

        back in the camp

        the rest of the newlyfreed animals now storm through the
        camp  the blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
        the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
        animals

        at the ridge of camp

        nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
        bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
        direction while malcolm and sarah vanish in the other

        the burning tent which was the equipment tent now detonates
        in a series of smaller explosions

        dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
        series of concessive blasts  he drags himself up onto all
        fours charred and bruised  a burning tire rolls slowly past
        him spinning to a stop 

         at rolands feet  dieter looks up at him

                                roland
                last time i leave you in charge

        out in the jungle

        nick breaks out into the jungle clearing the same one where
        ajay and roland had their blind  he sees the baby tyrannosaur
        chained to the stake

                                nick
                sick bastards

        he goes to the animal which now bleats in pain its broken
        leg hanging at an odd angle  with one strong tug nick pulls
        the stake out of the ground

        back in the camp

        roland surveys the destruction  the fire has spread and
        several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air
        the animals are gone or going and their personnel are
        scattered and terrified  peter ludlow breathless face
        smeared with dirt and smoke staggers up to roland

                                ludlow

        with a piercing shriek the baby tyrannosaur now in the back
        of the aav flings itself at the open doorway jaws snapping
        just short of malcolms nose

        he slams the door

                ian close the window its going to
                wake every predator in the jungle

        malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
        window  the tyrannosaur slashes with one of its powerful hind
        legs ripping the flesh of his forearm  he shouts in pain

        outside the listening jungle whizzes by

        ext high hide  night

        up in the high hide eddie dr juttson and kelly are
        standing watch scanning the jungle for any sign of their
        returning comrades

        juttson yanks the nightvision binoculars away from his face
        as he spots the aav pulling up to the base camp a couple
        hundred yards away

                                juttson
                there they are

        they all turn and look but eddie furrows his brow watching
        them pull the wounded animal from the back seat

                                eddie
                what is that they have with them

        ext camp  night

        sarah and nick carry the screeching baby tyrannosaur in their
        arms headed for the trailer  malcolm holding his bleeding
        arm isnt far behind

        int trailer  night

        sarah and nick bring the screaming infant to the metal dining
        table and hold it down  malcolm is right behind them

                                malcolm
                this is exceedingly unwise

        sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies holding a
        small syringe  her shirt is streaked with blood from the
        babys injured leg

                                sarah
                too late to worry about that  hold
                him together nick

        nick tightens his grip on the animal and sarah makes an
        injection into its thigh over its loudly voiced objections

                                malcolm
                just do whatever you have to do and
                get it out of here as quickly as
                possible

        sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
        the animals leg  a green and white skeletal image appears on
        a monitor next to the table

                                sarah
                okay theres the metatarsals 
                tibia fibula  there it is  see
                it  thats a fracture just above
                the epiphysis

        they peer closely at the monitor

                                nick
                that little black line

                                sarah
                that little black line means death
                for this infant  the fibula wont
                heal straight so the ankle joint
                cant pivot when he stands on his
                hind feet  the baby wont be able to
                run and probably cant even walk
                itll be crippled and a predator
                will pick it off before it gets more
                than a few weeks old

                                malcolm
                can you set up

                                sarah
                        thinking
                it has to be temporary something
                thatll break apart and fall off as
                the animal grows

                                malcolm
                think fast sarah

        the tyrannosaur still in pain shrieks again

        ext high hide  night

        through their binoculars the rest of the group watches the
        trailer carefully  even inside the animals screeches are
        clearly audible  kelly is getting scared

                                kelly
                what are they doing  why dont
                they hurry

                                eddie
                give me the radio

        from the trailer the baby lets out a long plaintive
        shriek 

        one by one eddie kelly and juttson turn around and stare
        into the night jungle

        int trailer  night

        nick holds the animal while sarah fits an aluminum foil cuff
        around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin
        malcolm at the window stares out anxiously  the animal
        thrashes again

                                nick
                give it more morphine

                                sarah
                well kill it with too much well
                put it into respiratory arrest  im
                almost done  damn it i need
                another adhesive something pliable i
                can 

        her eyes fall on nick  she holds out her hand urgently

                                sarah contd
                spit

        he spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand  the baby
        rex cries out again

        ext high hide  night

        from the swaying jungle there is another answering roar

        and this ones closer

        in the high hide the rest of the group stares trembling  in
        the distance a flock of birds shrieks and takes flight as the
        tops of some trees move a whole section of forest suddenly
        coming alive as if brushed by wind

        but its not the wind

        they hear noises thuds in the jungle  and then another
        section of forest trembles  closer  another flock of birds
        bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide

                                kelly
                what is it

        dr juttson puts an arm around kelly instinctively pulling
        her closer to him  eddie whispers urgently into the
        walkietalkie

                                eddie
                sarah come in

                                juttson
                its moving  fast

        int trailer  night

        there is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer
        the speaker buzzes urgently with eddies voice

                                eddie os
                sarah malcolm can you hear me

        on the table sarah is frantically molding nicks bubblegum
        into place on the makeshift splint  but the baby rex
        regaining its strength is thrashing again

                                sarah
                hold it down nick

                                nick
                im trying

                                eddie os
                        from the radio
                is anybody there

        malcolm moves to answer the radio but sarah shouts to him

                                sarah
                ian get the bottle of amoxicillin
                and fill a syringe  quick injection
                of antibiotics and i can get it out
                of here

        forsaking the radio malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
        comes up with what she wants  working fast he draws twenty
        ccs of the pink liquid

                                eddie os
                        still from the radio now
                         desperate
                sarah or ian answer me

        they ignore him as sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
        injection

                                eddie os
                whatever you brought into the
                trailer get it out now

        ext high hide  night

        eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
        desperately

                                eddie
                we estimate two large adults headed
                in your direction  i repeat 

        int trailer  night

        nick sarah and malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
        piece of information

                                malcolm
                oh christ

        he bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button

                                malcolm contd
                let me talk to kelly is she

        a deafening roar sound from just outside the trailer
        followed immediately by a crashing sound  they whirl and look
        to the window just in time to see 

          the aav tumbling by rolling on its side

        there is another roar and the baby on the table roars in
        response  outside the window the head of a fullgrown
        tyrannosaurus rex lowers and peers inside

        malcolm sarah and nick all freeze in absolute terror

        the rex outside gurgles making material cooing noises  the
        baby rex calm for the first time gurgles back

        but across the trailer in the opposite window another trex
        head suddenly appears

        this one roars deeply a roar so low and loud it rattles
        anything in the trailer that isnt tied down

                                nick
                what do they want

                                malcolm
                what do you think they want

                                sarah
                thats impossible they cant have
                the sensory equipment to track it all
                the way here

                                malcolm
                current evidence seems to be to the
                contrary wouldnt you say  give it
                to them

        nick hands shaking grabs the shoulder video camera he used
        earlier  he whips out the cassette thats in there hurls it
        into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others slams a
        fresh cassette in and flicks the on switch

        sarah and malcolm meanwhile hurry to the other end of the
        trailer carrying the baby rex  outside the two adult rexes
        stay with them walking in the same direction watching them
        through the window

        ext trailer  night

        seen from outside the light inside the trailers clearly
        illuminates sarah and malcolm as they carry the bay rex  the
        adult rexes tower over the trailer twice as tall and nearly
        as long  they walk slowly alongside it hunched over
        watching their infant

        int trailer  night

        at the door to the trailer sarah unmuzzles the frantic baby

                                sarah
                ready

        malcolm reaches for the door handle

                                nick
                wait

        he dives down on the floor under them pointing the video
        camera up at the door getting the best shot  malcolm takes a
        breath turns the knob and throws open the door

        outside the enormous rex heads pause for a moment staring
        surprised

        although terrified sarah actually starts to sing

                                sarah
                        softly
                born free as free as the wind blows
                as free as the grass grows 

                                malcolm
                are you insane

                                sarah
                i swear to god it works with lions
                sometimes  there we are  your baby
                is free 

        the baby excited wriggles free of them and lands on the
        ground outside  not wasting a second malcolm slams the door
        shut

        the three of them freeze not daring to breath  outside they
        can hear the snuffling and cooing of the animals as they
        inspect their young 

         and then the soft thud of their footsteps growing fainter
        as they move away

        from the wall eddies voice comes over the radio relieved

                                eddie
                theyre going back into the jungle

                                                        cut to

        ext high hide  night

        eddie juttson and kelly sag back against the railings of the
        high hide

                                eddie
                thank god  thank god

        malcolms voice comes over the radio

                                malcolm os
                kelly  are you all right

        she takes the radio her voice shaky

        malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer  sarah and
        nick sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall
        completely drained  sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
        speaks shakily into it

                                sarah
                note to dr juttson  tyrannosaurus
                rex does nurture its young

        they laugh weakly

                theres uh  theres an unwritten
                rule when a news crew is in a war
                zone  you stop the van every two
                miles and decide whether or not to go
                on  whether or not you feel lucky

                and you turn around right there no

                        getting up
                then the only thing left to do is
                make sure we do get back  ill

                phone and have them send the boat
                right now  this expedition is over

        he goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
        phone thats resting in a battery pack  the front panel
        lights up a brilliant green

        but from the wall speaker the radio crackles and eddies
        voice breaks through soft and empty

                                eddie os
                oh god  i am so sorry

        malcolm and sarah look at the speaker box

                                malcolm
                what the hell is he sorry f

        a low rattle sneaks into the trailer  malcolm sarah and
        nick takes a step forward from the walls looking around  the
        rattle gets louder the trailer shakes and vibrates
        everything in it starts to bang against the walls 

         and something huge smashes into the side of the trailer

        theyre all thrown against the far wall there is an
        earsplitting crack of electricity the entire trailer rocks
        and sparks a brilliant blue and then everything goes black

        the satellite phone flies out of malcolms hands and smacks
        against the wall  it lands on the floor its number pad still
        glowing green

        nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows  outside
        the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window
        revealing the second tyrannosaur charging straight at the
        trailer

                                nick
                hang on to something

        they hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
        for dear life  the charging rex slam into the side of the
        trailer which rocks up on one side bangs back  down and is
        quickly rammed again by the furious animal  this time the
        entire trailer rolls over completely upside down

        sarah nick and malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
        and drop onto the ceiling  the tables chairs lab equipment
        everything thats bolted down clings to the floor above them
        everything that isnt rains down on them

        but the rexes arent done  the trailer jolts into motion
        sliding forwards

        seen from outside

        the upside down trailer which is the rear of the two
        trailers slides along the muddy ground pushing up earth in
        front of it

        in the trailer

                                sarah
                theyre pushing us

        malcolm frantic crawls up to a window to get a look outside
        he looks down and sees a trex footprint in the earth outside
        as they move past it

        he cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
        they are being pushed  his eyes widen at something he sees
        outside the window

                                malcolm
                oh god

                                sarah
                what

                                malcolm
                theyre pushing us over the cliff

        sure enough out the back window we see a few more feet of
        muddy earth and then nothing but inky black  the three of
        them look at each other for a moment 

         and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
        trailer  the opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
        starts up to tip eversoslightly downward  they reach the
        accordionlike connector and malcolm crawls into it

        through the windshield of the front trailer

        which is rightsideup malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
        it pushing the front end of the trailer

        in the rear trailer

        nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer but
        sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
        starts to roll and tumble past her headed downhill

        the angle increases the trailer dips and now stuff starts to
        freefall right past her some smashing her in the head

        malcolm still in the connecting tube grabs hold  sarah
        starting to be pulled downward paws at the refrigerator
        getting a g rip on the handle  the door held by a safety
        latch doesnt open

        below sarah debris falls to the rear window of the trailer
        through the cracking glass we can see the surf crashing five
        hundred feet below

        the refrigerator bolts suddenly crunch free of the wall  the
        box strains on its power cord

        still clinging to the handle sarah swings wildly as it starts
        to come loose swaying above her

        the safety latch on the door gives it swings open and a
        shower of food bangs off of her as gravity empties the
        contents

        sarah loses her grip and plummets through the nowvertical
        trailer  she screams covers her head and smashes into the
        rear window  the glass spiderwebs but does not break

        five hundred feet below

        an enormous wave pounds the rocky shore  above sarah is a
        tiny figure sprawled out on the glass held invisibly by the
        breaking window

        in the trailer

        nick shouts to her

                                nick
                sarah  dont move

        sarah stunned by the fall blinks a few times regaining her
        senses  she looks down at the crashing surf so far below
        for a person with a fear of heights this is a real drag  as
        she stares the rocks seem to move even farther away from her
        she blanches the world spins around her

                                sarah
                oh god  please

        her breath fogs the cracked glass  slowly she tries to get
        up caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees

        but as she puts pressures on her hands the glass cracks even
        more tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers  the
        whole glass panel sags bowing out around the bottom of the
        trailer

        up above her

        malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
        balanced on one leg of the kitchen table its number pad still
        glowing green  nick is closest to it

                                malcolm
                nick  grab the phone

        sarah

        looks to her right at a metal grating that runs along the
        wall of the trailer  she shifts her weight leaning on one
        hand to reach for the grating with the other

        nick

        reaches for the satellite phone its antenna just six inches
        from his outstretched fingers

        sarah

        leans toward the metal grating all hairline cracks shoot out
        around her pivot hand shaking through the glass  the
        splintered glass spread like a disease it reaches the edge
        of the frame 

         and her hand cracks right through the glass  she gasps and
        pulls her hand out but now she knees smash through the
        glass

        nick

        has two fingers on the phone but suddenly the whole trailer
        shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls

                                nick
                sarah look out

        sarah

        lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
        heavy phone whizzes past her head and smashes into the glass
        opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window

        underneath the trailer

        glass food lab equipment and the precious satellite phone
        fall out the broken window and smash on the rocks far below

        in the cleaning

        the trailers are split like an l the rear trailer hanging
        straight down the forward one resting on the edge of the
        cliff  satisfied with their work the trexes turn and lumber
        back into the jungle

        in the trailer

        sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating  above her nick
        lowers himself as far as he can reaching for her

        on the cliffside

        we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
        corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
        out from the muddy cliff

        but now those branches splinter

        in the trailer

        malcolm sees the bellows the connector between the trailers
        stretch as the lower trailer jerks and dips lower

        below him

        sarah mountainclimbs through the trailers kitchen
        inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
        purchase

        outside

        the tree branch snaps and the trailer jerks stretching down
        again  the bellows expands to its full length stretching
        like a slinky

        inside

        nick knows he has to hurry  he climbs down bouncing off the
        builtin furniture moving ever closer to sarah

        but sarah slips and loses her grip dropping a few feet  she
        gabs hold of the sink the flowing water spraying her face

        ext jungle  night

        eddie carr is in the drivers seat of the jeep racing through
        the jungle as fast as he can

                                eddie
                hang on  hang on 

        the foliage smacks the windshield then clears suddenly
        revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
        him  the jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
        rex and skids to a halt

        int trailer  night

        sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls smashing into the
        frame of the halfbroken rear window again

        outside

        eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer  he
        shouts in through the broken front window

                                eddie
                hey  hello

        in the rear trailer

        the three look up from their precarious positions

                                malcolm
                were in here  get some rope

        outside

        eddie turns and run back to the jeep  he grabs a coil of
        rope secures one end around a tree and hurries back to the
        trailer

        in the rear trailer

        eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
        into the extended connector  he peers over the edge down
        into the second trailer and tosses the rope

                                eddie
                catch

        the rope falls through the center of the trailer its end
        dangling all the way out the smashed rear window  but the
        trailer shudders starting to move again

                                sarah
                were sliding

                                eddie
                climbs up if you can

        outside

        eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
        dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
        trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff

        he runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
        front grill

        behind him the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff

        eddie races back to the trailer pulling out a length of cable
        behind him  he runs up to the stillmoving trailer dives for
        its towing hook the cable goes taut 

         and he falls short  just by six inches but hes out of
        cable

                                eddie
                damn it

        inside the trailer

        nick and sarah are now together clinging to the rope near the
        bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them  malcolm is
        further up also clinging to the rope

        outside

        dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
        edge of the cliff

        eddie back at the jeep reels out more winch cable  he turns
        and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to lift
        the front end off the ground

        eddie dives again and this time the cable hook clicks
        securely into the trailers towing hook  the trailer lurches
        toward the edge of the cliff and stops

        but the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure

        in the trailer

        malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
        nick and sarah try to struggle up it but a sudden dig knocks
        them back and their hands slide down the line  screaming
        they slide through the trailer and their feet smash through
        the remains of the rear window

        regaining hold of the rope at the very end the two of them
        now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer
        dangling over the rocky shore below

        in the jeep

        eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud trying to
        get a grip  the jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
        trailer back to earth  but the tires spin fighting to hold
        it there

        on the cliffside

        sarah and nick dangle desperate

        in the jeep

        eddie chunks the shifter into four wheel drive and guns the
        engine  as the motor roars the sound is topped by another
        roar in the distance

        and this ones not a machine  but eddie doesnt hear it  he
        guns the engine again  there is another roar from the jungle

        eddie hears this one  he darts a look at the side view
        mirror  in it he sees one of the tyrannosaurs bolt out of
        the jungle behind him

        he gasps and looks at the other side view  in it he sees the
        other rex racing toward him

        the tyrannosaurs stomp forward to confront the roaring jeep
        the first rex bends over chomps down on the rear tire and
        lifts the car to its teeth

        but the spinning tire lings in the rexs mouth burning it
        surprised by the fight in this foe the rex loses its grip and
        the jeep bangs back down onto the ground

        eddie horrified dives down under the steering wheel to get
        away  the gas pedal pops up 

         which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff

        but the rex stomps down on the jeep to prevent its escape
        the trailers stop

        now the rexes lean down over the jeep and focus on eddie
        who still covers under the steering wheel  the first rex
        snaps at him hitting the steering column with it leaving eddie fully
        exposed

        he screams and the second rex lashes in seizing him in its
        teeth and tossing him out of the car

        eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes both their
        heads flash at him at the same time and in a splitsecond he
        disappears between their teeth

        now completely ignored the jeep rolls freely forward and the
        trailers drop over the edge of the cliff

        inside the trailer

        nick sarah and malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
        the trailers fall around them  the windows flash by as the
        trailers plummet equipment bangs and scrapes them but they
        hold on to the rope still tied to the tree for dear life

        on the cliffside

        the trailers slide the rest of the way exposing the three
        who pop out the space where the front windshield was
        dangling from the rope they look up and see the jeep which
        is now rolling to the edge of the cliff

        it falls past them and the whole mess explodes on the rocks
        below  finally it is silent except for the sound of the
        surf

        ext clearing  night

        its quiet up here too the rexes nowhere to be seen  at the
        cliff a hand appears from over the edge  then another
        sarah pulls herself up back onto solid ground then comes
        nick then both of them reach over and help malcolm up over
        the edge

        they collapse there in the mud completely exhausted

                                malcolm
                        softly
                eddie

        he looks at the other two  they glance around then drop
        their heads  sarah hears a sound in the distance

                                sarah
                oh god  now what

        from the edge of the jungle a criscross of flashlight beams
        moves toward them  but rather than the three or four that
        would signify their own group there are nearly twenty of
        them

        the hunters peter ludlow is in the lead roland and ajay
        with him  dieter is there too shepherding kelly and dr
        juttson along in front of him

        malcolm sees kelly they call out to each other and race
        together  malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
        as he possibly can

                                malcolm
                are you all right  anything broken

                                kelly

        in the ruins of the first teams base camp the survivors of
        the nights two separate catastrophes stand face to face in a
        heated argument

        malcolm sits off to the side still holding kelly in his arms
        just looking down at the ground and shaking his head  theres
        something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
        than any of the hot tempers that are flaring  ludlow rants to
        sarah while dieter looms menacingly over nick

                i said if we could get there

                                nick

                                ludlow

                the problem

                                roland
                what is

                                ludlow
                the velociraptors

        malcolm looks up sharply

                                ludlow contd
                our infrareds show their nesting
                sites are concentrated in the island
                interior  thats why we planned on
                keeping to the outer rim

        malcolm shepherds kelly away from the conversation and mutters
        something to her quietly in the background

                                dieter
                what are velociraptors

                                juttson
                carnivores  pack hunters  about six
                feet long three or four hundred
                pounds and very very fast

        dieter brandishes his weapon

                                dieter
                i think we can handle ourselves
                against them

        malcolm rejoins the conversation alone  he keeps his voice
        low

                                malcolm
                no  im quite certain you cant

                                roland
                look we have two choices  we can
                hike back down to the lagoon where
                we can sit for two days in the open
                next to a heavily used water source
                while were waiting for your boat to
                arrive or we can head for the
                village where we might find some
                shelter and we can call for help

                                malcolm
                wed never make it past the raptors
                trust me i have some experience in
                this matter

        roland looks at him

                                roland
                that may be  but you werent with
                me at the time

        malcolm just shakes his head then turns and walks back to
        kelly  roland turns to the others

                                roland contd
                load up  lets get this moveable
                feast underway

                                                        cut to

        ext island  night

        the survivors set forth marching through the jungle in a
        column  two hunters strap on small shouldermounted
        servoflashlights  wires run from the lights end in
        sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks  thus
        attached when the hunters turn their heads the servolights
        turn with them illuminating whatever direction they look in

        malcolm screws the barrel into the lindstradt rifle and slings
        it over his shoulder as he marches limping heavily  he looks
        down at kelly who is marching alongside him  his face shows
        the deepest of regret  he shakes his head cursing himself

                                malcolm
                damn it

        he looks away as kelly looks up at him questioning  roland
        falls into step with malcolm and notices his limp

                                roland
                you all right

        malcolm looks at him then looks away without answering

                                roland contd
                wrong question

                                malcolm
                you ever heard of gamblers ruin

                                roland
                whats that

                                malcolm
                a statistical phenomenon  says
                everything in the world goes in
                streaks  its real you see it
                everywhere  in weather in river
                flooding in baseball in blackjack
                in stock markets  once things go
                bad they tend to stay bad  bad
                things cluster  they go to hell
                together

                                roland
                feeling a bit blue are we

        malcolm glances at kelly who has taken a slightly faster pace
        and is a few steps ahead of them now

                                malcolm
                just  flawed  very deeply flawed

                                roland
                why did you come here

                                malcolm
                so that others would know about this
                place

                                roland
                why should they

                                malcolm
                because it exists

                                roland
                itll still exit if they go on not
                knowing wont it

                                malcolm
                yes  and people will live in the
                absence of truth

                                roland
                so the truth is more important to you
                than your life

                                malcolm
                        lowers is voice
                i dont care about my life  but if
                id ever thought for a second that
                she would be in danger 

        roland follows his gaze forward to kelly whos about ten
        yards ahead now

                                roland
                she yours

        ahead of them

        kelly can hear their voices faint but clear  they are not
        as far away as they think they are

                                malcolm os
                im afraid so  i dont know what the
                hell im doing with kids  i never
                should have had her

        kellys face shows she heard that part

        behind her

        malcolm unaware continues with roland

                                malcolm contd
                why are you here

                                roland
                somewhere on this island there
                exits the greatest predator that
                ever lived  and the second greatest
                predator must take him down

                                malcolm
                but why

                                roland
                you remember that guy about twenty
                years ago i forget his name but he
                climbed everest without any oxygen
                came down almost dead  and they
                asked him why did you go up there
                to die  and he said i didnt  i
                went up there to live

                                malcolm
                        nods
                its called selftesting  but in
                your case it sounds more like
                selfdestruction  a uniquely human
                characteristic  in fact human
                beings destroy things so well that i
                sometimes think thats our function
                maybe every few sons some animal
                comes along that kills off the rest
                of the world clears the decks and
                lets evolution proceed to his next
                phase  maybe death and destruction
                are our job maybe were supposed
                to destroy ourselves and every other
                living thing that

        every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
        staring at malcolm shaken by his words  roland grabs malcolm
        by the shirt collar and pulls him close growling in his ear

                                roland
                tell you what  you can see whatever
                you want to to me but you will not
                spew any more nihilist rants at
                anyone else in the group  im
                fighting panic and you push the
                wrong buttons  understand

        malcolm just blinks  this guys in charge

                                                        cut to

        ext jungle  dawn

        as a purple dawn dissolves the night sky the survivors
        stagger on exhausted  some are starting to tire and there
        are spaces in the column  malcolms limp seems to be getting
        worse  nick reaches out to take malcolms pack but malcolm
        swats his hand away

        kelly still ahead of him falls into step with sarah

                                kelly
                i dont think  my dad doesnt
                think were going to make it

        sarah looks at her

                                sarah
                your dad is wrong  about a lot more
                than he knows

        she puts an arm around her  kelly looks up at her grateful
        the long march continues

        up at the front

        nick catches up to roland

                                nick
                i think you should call a break

                                roland
                another half hour

                                nick
                some of them wont make another half
                hour  we didnt come this far to
                start dropping in the middle of the
                jungle  if you dont call it i
                will

        roland looks at him steely then shouts to the group

                                roland
                five minutes break

        immediately the marchers drop where they stood absolutely
        drained

        at the rear of the group

        drs burke and juttson are bickering

                                juttson
                i cant believe youre still angry
                about that

                                burke
                you know its very easy to criticize
                the first person who studies
                something

                                juttson
                no its easy to criticize sloppy
                research and hasty conclusions

        nearby

        malcolm checks nicks bag of videotapes making sure theyre
        still dry and undamaged  sarah comes up watching him

                                sarah
                you know even if we do get those
                tapes back people are going to say
                its just another hoax  ian
                malcolms alien autopsy

                                malcolm
                maybe  maybe not

                                sarah
                ian they will misplace our evidence
                shoot holes in our testimony and say
                some special effects genius created
                the animals  the only way people
                will ever believe that dinosaurs
                exist is if you dump a trex in the
                middle of times square

        he doesnt look at her  she sits down beside her

                                sarah contd
                theres something more important that
                you should be thinking about instead

        behind them

        dr burke furious has stalked away from juttson and sits
        down on a rock  h does a double take noticing something
        behind the rock  he leans over and picks it up

        its an oval shape about eight inches long with a pebbled
        exterior  a dinosaur egg

        burkes face lights up fascinated and he carefully pieces
        the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder

        at the rear of the group

        dieter stark pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack drops
        the pack on the ground and turns to the hunter nearest him 
        carter his driver who has his back turned

                                dieter
                wait here for me would ya carter

        he steps off the path into the jungle  but as we come around
        the front of carter we see hes wearing a walkman the
        headphone blaring tinnily in his ears

        and he didnt hear a word

        ext thick of the jungle  day

        only a few feet off the path its primary forest the growth
        so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured  dieter claws
        forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself

        he clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
        hand to his belt buckle  he freezes hearing something we
        didnt  he glances around head darting alert to any danger

        nothing there  just a few distant animal calls

         and s scurrying around to his left

        dieter snaps his head in that direction  at first he sees
        nothing but as he moves closer gun extended in front of him
        he sees a small dinosaur a compsograthus the same
        chickensized animal cathy saw on the beach so long ago

                                dieter
                its not polite to 

        he pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
        it to the compys back  the blue bolt of electricity cracks
        and dances over the compys body and it convulses in pain

                                dieter contd
                 sneak up on people

        the wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle
        whimpering  dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
        paces pushes aside two large palm fronds and steps out
        into 

         more jungle  he stops puzzled not sure if he went back
        or forward

        he looks behind him  he pauses recalculating the path he
        took coming into the jungle muttering to himself gesturing
        with his hands retracing his steps

        he adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
        that direction  but after five or six hardfought steps he
        stops again  still nothing but jungle

                                dieter
                hey  carter  yell or something i
                got turned around in here

        on the trail

        dieters cries are faint but audible  the only marchers hear
        enough to hear him is carter but the walkman is blaring in
        his ears

                                dieter os
                carter me

        in the jungle

        dieter hears that scurrying sound again this time from his
        right  he adjusts his angle again and scrapes through the
        foliage moving faster and faster

        panicking he ties to run but the roots rise high out of the
        ground in the jungle and he trips on one and falls flat on
        his face

        he looks up  the scurrying sound comes again this time ten
        times louder than before like a hundred feet coming at him

        dieter gasps as something rushes in at him

        he whirls to his right  whatever it is rushes in from that
        side as well  and the left  and behind him  dieter
        scrambles up into a sitting position 

         and laughs  he is surrounded by at least forty compys now
        the same as the one he wounded

        for a long moment they just stare at him  slowly he brings
        his gun around to point it at them

                                dieter
                easy  wait  one more sec

        as one the compys shriek and hurl themselves forward
        covering dieters body  their teeth and claws flash as they
        each try to grab a scrap of his flesh tearing savagely

        dieter screams and flails waving his arms and legs wildly
        some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off
        smashing into trees or the ground  but dozens of others hang
        on and dieter falls over backwards now lying on his back on
        the ground

        hysterical he fights like hell to get to his feet screaming
        shaking swatting the compys loose  he spins and that tactic
        seems to work as the compys themselves begin to panic and
        drop off of him  but he also loses his grip on his weapon
        which goes flying landing in the thick foliage five or six
        feet from him

        losing the attack the compys turn and dart away en masse
        stopping ten yards away from him

        but they turn and regroup facing him in a line hopping up
        and down chirping and shrieking

        dieter bounds into the foliage looking for his gun  but the
        compys follow him in and hes forced to flee abandoning his
        lost weapon

        ten feet on he stops knowing hes screwed without the gun
        he turns to face the pursuing compys

        they stop

        dieter charges them shouting waving his arms

        the compys turn and run  dieter stops

        the compys stop  they stare back at him  there is a moment
        of quiet then they start to hop again chirping and
        squealing

        dieter tired of this game turns and runs away

        from the front of the convoy roland shouts out

                                roland
                breaks over move on

        the exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
        start to march again  at the rear of the group someone taps
        carter who is still listening to his music  carter gets up
        hoists his backpack and marches away

        behind him dieters pack is left forgotten on the jungle
        trail

        ext deep in the jungle  day

        dieter stumbles along exhausted  he reaches the edge of a
        stream that runs under the foliage and his feet slip on the
        stones  he falls into the rocky stream

        behind him the army of compys pours over the little hill he
        just crested  they disappear for a moment down an incline 

         and then swarm over his body  in a frenzy of splashing
        dieter shrugs them off and crawls away through the stream
        he gets to his feet but falls again this time over a log  a
        geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
        dieter drops out of sight

        the compys leap over the log and disappear from view too
        throwing up their own splashes of water  screeching
        chirping and the sound of tearing flesh mixes with dieters
        screams

        now as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
        water below the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
        are pink

        and then theyre a deep deep red

                                                        cut to

        ext jungle  day

        the group has stopped again  near the rear sarah nick
        malcolm ludlow and roland are in a tense conversation with
        carter

                                roland
                how long ago was this

                                carter
                seven eight minutes

        roland looks at them thinking  finally

                                roland
                then hes dead  nobody tells the
                little girl  last thing we need is
                screaming hysterics

        he turns and heads back to the front of the column

                                sarah
                we have to send someone to look for
                him

                                roland
                you go if you like but were not
                waiting for you  move it out

        they look at each other appalled but the column starts to
        move  numbed shocked but left with no choice they move on
        one by one

                                                        cut to

        ext island ridge  dusk

        the column of marchers has finally reached the island ridge
        where they are silhouetted against the setting sun  theyre
        taking a break sprawled out on rocks or over the ground

        malcolm sits next to kelly whos sitting on a log

                                malcolm
                you okay

        she doesnt look at him just gets up and walks away going to
        sit over next to sarah

        malcolm watches pained but sarah puts an arm around her and
        makes a shes okay gesture to malcolm

        at the ridge

        roland steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
        interior  from his vantage point hes able to see all the
        way to the far side of the island a rim of herd black cliff
        miles away  between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
        gently undulating jungle

        he refers to one of the satellite recon photos

                                roland
                looks like the worker village is down
                in there about a mile and a half
                northeast from the base of these
                cliffs

        malcolm is next to him

                                malcolm
                there must be a game trail some kind
                of path that goes down there

        roland looks around at the exhausted marchers

                                roland
                theyll have to rest before we look
                for it  eat  sleep  two hours
                then we hit it

                                                        cut to

        ext campsite  night

        the group has made camp in the jungle  the mood is somber
        most of the marchers asleep already  three or four tents have
        been put up

        in one tent

        kelly sits quietly in a corner her eyes wide knees hugged up
        to his chest  sarah comes in

                                sarah
                there you are  your dads looking
                for you

                                kelly
                i doubt that

        sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
        the broad red smear across its front

                                sarah
                oh come on  go talk to him

                                kelly
                why  he likes to be alone  i can
                stay with you

        in the campsite

        all is still  the nocturnal jungle hoots and buzzes around
        the sleeping marchers

        in his tent roland abruptly sits up  as if he heard
        something  he looks out the open flap  in the middle of the
        campsite he sees ajay stop in his tracks head cocked

        roland gets up and goes outside joining ajay in the middle of
        the camp

                                roland
                you hear something

                                ajay
                no  i feel something

        roland looks at him  this isnt so good  he looks out at the
        shifting jungle  he notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
        over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp

                                roland
                oh no

        in sarahs tent

        kelly and sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags trying
        to get a few minutes rest  sarahs shirt hangs over them
        swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap

        as the shirt dangles there swinging softly from side to side
        we notice the broad red smear across the front  oh thats
        right  its blood

        the baby trexs blood

        at the ridge of camp

        the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
        thats been lit by dr burke

        hes set a small frying pan on top of it and now he cracks
        the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan

        roland and ajay run up behind him

                                roland
                        hisses
                are you out of your mind

        burke leaps out of the way as roland kicks dirt on the fire

        bmbb

        roland ajay and burke all freeze  what was that

        in sarahs tent

        sarah and kelly sit up  they felt it too

        bmbb

        at the cocking fire

                                roland
                get my weapon

        ajay turns and trots away a few steps then stops cold
        staring down at the ground

        bmbb

        a recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp and
        impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles  concentric
        circles spreading to the outer edges

        bmbb

        in sarahs tent

        sarah and kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
        into ziploc bags

        bmbb

        now they leap into sarahs sleeping bag to seal themselves
        and draw the zipper up all the way around

        outside the silhouette of the rexs head passes by the tent
        sarah works faster her fingers struggling to close the last
        few inches but 

         the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent  it
        sniffs snorting the air in and out  it looks around the
        tent

        it sniffs sarahs hanging shirt the one that is stained with
        the blood of the baby tyrannosaur  the adult tyrannosaur
        gurgles again cooing and cocking its head curiously

        in the sleeping bag sarah and kellys eyes are barely
        visible wide in panic  the rex sniffs and nudges the bag
        trying to figure out what this thing is

        it rolls the bag over once decides its uninteresting and
        then rises straights up 

         taking the whole tent with it  the stakes pop out of the
        ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
        away leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
        beneath it

        in the campsite

        the second tyrannosaur now steps out of the jungle joining
        the first  panic hits the camp as the sleeping hunters wake
        up  many of them start to run

        roland scrambles toward his tent where he can see his weapon
        lying near the open flap  as he draws close an enormous
        trex foot stomps down on the tent driving the rifle deep
        into the mud

        roland weaponless stands frozen watching as the panicked
        hunters flee in all directions

                                roland
                for christs sake dont run

        but they ignore him sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
        prey that pours across the campsite  some toss random and
        illaimed gunshots back at the rexes

        across the campsite

        nick bursts out of the crowd sees kelly and sarah struggling
        to get out of the sleeping bag and grabs each by an arm  he
        rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him into
        the jungle

        in the middle of the crowd

        malcolm blinking back sleep stands a good head above the
        rest of the panicking crowd  frantically he scans the group

                                malcolm
                kelly  keeeeellly

        but he cant see her

        at the edge of camp

        the two rexes join forces herding the fleeing hunters into a
        narrow ravine

        up on a rock race

        roland scrambles up a steep rock face  no way in hell hes
        going down  that ravine  he sees malcolm still in the middle
        of the camp start to head for the ravine

                                roland
                malcolm  over here

        malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face
        scrambling to climb up the smooth steep boulders

        behind him one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
        camp toward him

                                roland contd
                faster

        malcolm gives it everything hes got clawing his way up the
        rock face 

         and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs 

         and roland reaches down grabs malcolm by the hair and
        pulls him up out of the rexs grasp

        the rex falls short but hes close enough that we can hear
        his teeth snap together closing around nothing but air  it
        turns sees easier prey in the fleeing hunters and takes off
        after them

        malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a crunch  roland
        unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap

        in the ravine

        kelly in the middle of the fleeing crowd with sarah and nick
        hears her father screaming her name and looks up  malcolm and
        roland are on the rock ridge above them keeping pace

                                malcolm
                        shouting
                kelly up here

        but kelly continues to flee as the rexes are in the ravine
        now and drawing closer to the group

        some hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks but the
        ravine is deepening theres no way out  one rex grabs hold
        of a hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face

        the second rex picks up another hunter and snaps its massive
        head left and right quickly to break its victims neck  the
        hunter goes flying forward and crashes into 

         carter dieters driver who stumbles and falls  the rest
        of the fleeing humans run around or over him but when the
        rex lifts its foot we see carter is actually stuck to the
        bottom of it 

         and when the animal takes its next step it crushes him into
        the earth

        up on th rock face

        malcolm is frantic

                                malcolm
                i gotta get down there

        down in the ravine

        its obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes and nick
        knows it  he bursts ahead of sarah and kelly and spots
        something off to his left

        its a waterfall apparently right in front of a sheer rock
        face  but theres something about the way the water is
        falling that tells him something

                                nick
                sarah kelly come here

        he grabs each of them and hauls them forward running straight
        at the waterfall  apparently he intends to jump right into
        the rock and hes dragging them along with him

                                sarah
                what are you

                                nick
                jump

        the three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
        through the water

        dr burke fleeing along with everyone else is watching as
        they vanish

        behind the waterfall

        there is a small recess which is what nick had hoped for
        its small only four or five feet deep but its just enough
        for him sarah and kelly to cover behind the flowing water
        breathless terrified they can hear the mayhem outside

                                nick
                shhhh shhhh

        with an enormous splash something bursts through the
        cascading water and crashes into them

        dr burke

                                burke
                get out of the way

        he pulls his way up against the far wall as far away from the
        water as he can

        foooom  now another shape bursts through the watery curtain

        a tyrannosaur head  burke gave away the hiding spot

        the four scream as the rexs jaws snap left and right
        searching for them falling just inches short  they squeeze
        as far back against the wall as they can get

        the rex cant quite get its head all the way through the
        opening 

         so it uses its tongue  a long dark blue shape slithers
        out of its mouth and touches the humans trying to wrap around
        them to pull them out of the cave

        burke blind with panic forces himself even further into the
        cave which pushes kelly further out

                                sarah
                stop it youre pushed her out stop
                it

        but burke doesnt listen throwing elbows to make room for
        himself  his movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth and
        a flurry of enormous cockroaches eight or nine inches long
        each pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck

        burke screams and instinctively leaps away toward the flowing
        water

        and thats all the leverage the rex needs  it curls its
        tongue wrapping burke up in it and pulling him between its
        teeth  screaming hideously he is dragged out through the
        waterfall and disappears

        sarah nick and kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
        water turn pink

        up on the rock face

        malcolm and roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
        with burke leaving the hiding place unmolested  malcolm is
        nearly hysterical

                                roland
                shes okay  theyll stay in there
                shes okay

        in a jungle clearing

        routed hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
        jungle  ahead of them there is a large open plain covered by
        long elephant grass

        ajay running along with them stops abruptly at the edge of
        the grass shouting to the others

                                away
                no  dont go into the long grass

        not in the frenzy they ignore him  behind ajay the enormous
        shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well holding
        up at the edge of the jungle

        ajay torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
        judgement opts for the former and races into the grass after
        the other hunters waving his arms

        up above them

        roland and malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
        of the plain below  roland can see the hunters leaving trails
        as they plow through the grass

                                roland
                elephant grass

        on the plain

        the groups of hunters wades into the middle of the long grass
        one of them stops and turns looking back at the jungle trees

                                hunter
                they gave up  theyre not chasing
                us

        there are cheers sighs of relief  in the distance ajays
        voice can be heard faintly calling to them to come back  up
        on the rock in the distance they can see roland waving his
        arms madly

        but in the giddiness of their escape they pay it no mind
        they continue plowing into the high grass anything to get
        further away from the tyrannosaurs

        about fifty yards away

        the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly backlit by
        the full moon  in the distance the heads can seethe hunter
        party  the heads descend back into the grass

        back with the hunters

        they continue forward oblivious  now behind them four
        more heads rise up in the grass  as then descend

        on all sides of the hunters the grass ripples as animals move
        forward toward them undetected inexorable as torpedoes

        and these torpedoes are on target  one hunter is suddenly
        dragged down yanked silently below the surface of the tall
        grass

        in his place a long lizardlike tail rises up as the animal
        drops its head to make the kill

        behind him two more hunters are taken down and two more
        animal tails rise up in their place  a hunter ahead hears the
        rustling and turns  his face turns white as behind him 

         a velociraptor springs out of the grass

        velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs
        the second tow of each foot bearing an extralarge curved
        claw carried in a retracted position with which it slashes
        on attack

        like now  this raptor snarls and slams into the body of the
        hunter taking him down  a feeding frenzy ensues  the
        hunters run in all directions but are pulled down and vanish
        into the twitching long grass

        another raptor enters from the right leaps high into the air
        past the full moon slams into the chest of more human prey
        and takes him down into the grass

        behind them ajays face falls defeated  he looks around
        realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
        grass

        around him four torpedo trails head straight for him

        ajay simply closes his eyes

        up on the rock

        roland turns away from the carnage pained

                                                        cut to

        roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was
        he has pulled his 800 nitro express from the mud and more or
        less cleaned it now hes checking the loads

        kelly nearly catatonic with fear clings to sarah and it
        doesnt look as if shell ever let go  malcolm who is on his
        knees picking through the wreckage of a tent looks over at
        them but sarah waves him off  shes okay

        roland appears standing over the group  he looks at malcolm
        who has found the lindstradt rifle intact

                                roland
                how many rounds did you find for that
                weapon

                        to sara but looking at

                                kelly

        while he addresses the group roland straps on one of the
        servolights the shouldermounted flashlights that follow
        your gaze

                                roland
                were going to find a path down into
                the interior of the island  load up
                whatever you think you need and i

                hours and be out of here before dawn

        at the edge of camp

        roland bends over one of the threetoed footprints left by the
        rex  behind him the rest of the group is packing up
        slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders

        roland bends over and sniffs the footprint  its filled with
        a liquid of some kind

        he takes his canteen dumps the remaining water into the
        ground and plunges the canteen into the footprint filling
        it  ludlow hovers over his shoulder

                                ludlow
                what is that

                                roland
                piss

        ludlow doesnt ask

        now at the fire

        roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
        to such disaster  he grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
        in his pants pocket

                                                        cut to

        ext valley of death  night

        roland and ludlow who along with sarah and malcolm is also
        wearing a servolight now maneuver down a rugged hillside and
        come out in a flattened area  ludlow gasps looking ahead in
        wonderment  malcolm breaks through the hillsides foliage a
        moment later  he too stares in amazement

        sarah and kelly come next then nick then juttson  one by
        one they all stop and stare

                                sarah
                god help us

        theyre standing in a flat sandy area lined with boulders at
        the sides  the flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
        side and as far as they can see ahead  but thats not what
        amazes them so

        everywhere the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons  some
        are huge apatosaurs sixty feet from head to tail tip
        others are smaller herbivores of many different kinds  the
        more intact skeletons lie on their sides their ribcages arcs
        of pale bone  but just as many have been ripped apart bits
        of carcass tossed in every direction

                                nick
                i do not feel lucky

                                roland
                keep moving

        they march on tiny figures moving among the mountainous
        skeletons by the light of the full moon  roland notices one
        carcass in particular a recent kill  its an enormous
        hadrosaur with fresh bites taken out of it

        he bends down studying the soft earth around it for
        footprints

        further on

        malcolm looks up noticing the bony shapes around them which
        fall in heavy shadows like cell bars seem to be changing

        he turns and his servolight shines on the bones  but
        theyre not bones any more at all theyre pipes the animal
        graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
        objects  twisted rotting machinery

                                ludlow
                we made it

        they hurry over a small rise 

        ext worker village  night

         and find themselves at the edge of what was once isla
        sornas worker village  the size of a football field the
        town is divided by a main street thats dotted on both sides
        by stores residences cafes a gas station  all the way at
        the far end is a large blocky fourstory building

        but the town is a mess  the hurricane that hit here must have
        been ferocious for everywhere things are smashed broken
        upended  and the jungle has stepped into the breath growing
        up around and over everything  huge root systems snake
        through the street making it almost impassable

                                malcolm
                the jungle  its always ready to
                return

        roland catches up and looks at ludlow

                                roland
                wheres the power and radio setup

                                ludlow
                operations building  far end of the
                street

        a light rain falls as they start down the street carefully
        silently roland and malcolm with their weapons at the ready

        they pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower  an empty gas
        station its vinesnarled pumps now useless  the only sound
        is the low mechanical hum of the servolights as they follow
        the groups gazes obediently

        every few feet the group encounters strange grayish lumps
        that lies in random places in the middle of the street
        malcolm curious stops and taps one of them  its a rockhard
        nick looks over his shoulder

                                nick
                lava

                                malcolm
                no

                                nick
                what are they

                                malcolm
                i dont know

        finally they reach the operation building at the far end of
        the town

                                ludlow
                the radio rig is inside  it runs
                directly from the geothermal
                generator so power shouldnt be a
                problem

                                roland
                good

        he pulls out his canteen  ludlow watches as he screws the top
        off moves toward the building and starts splashing the
        contents on the outside of it

        the rest of the group just stares at him

                                malcolm
                whats he got in there

                                ludlow
                piss

                                sarah
                what

                                ludlow
                dont ask me  the guys completely
                out to lunch

                                nick
                what in gods name would he want
                with

        roland rejoins them

                                roland
                tyrannosaur urine  i dont want
                anything to do with it and neither
                does any other animal on this island
                this building is now demarcated as
                the rexs territory  as long as you
                stay in that building youll all be
                safe until the helicopter comes

        he drops his pack swings his gun off his shoulder and checks
        the load  dr juttson looks fearful

                                juttson
                where are you going

                                roland
                after the rex  i saw a fresh kill
                back in the valley with tyrannosaur
                tracks all around it  if im not
                back in time dont wait for me

                                sarah
                youve got to be kidding

                                roland
                runs against my nature to hole up in
                a cave and wait

                                ludlow
                do you think the rex might have the
                infant with it

                                roland
                possible

        ludlow takes off his hat and turns to nick

                                ludlow
                you know how to work a radio dont
                you

                                sarah
                youre going too

                                ludlow
                i lost everything i came after on
                this trip but one trex in one theme
                park could singlehandedly bail
                ingen out of chapter 11

        he takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
        to nick

                                ludlow contd
                this is the broadcast frequency  id

                you gentlemen feel you have to do
                this now

                                roland
                nows the perfect time  the animal
                just fed so it wont stalk us for
                food  predators dont hurt when
                theyre not hungry

        ludlow double checks the clip on his semiautomatic rifle 

                                nick
                no

         and smacks it back into the belly of the gun

                                nick contd
                only humans do

        int communications room  night

        the console of a sophisticated radio setup glows brightly
        all green red and yellow  nick tunes the dial to a specific
        frequency  the radio whines and hisses tuning in

                                nick
                        into microphone

                harvest leader to harvest base  come
                in please

        the remaining survivors minus ludlow and roland shine their
        flashlights around the dusty vinehung interior of the
        communications room  on the wall a row of chrome letters says
        we make the future  but the words are obscured by a tangle
        of vines  mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet

        on one wall there is a mural of what the completed jurassic
        park would have looked like  big hotels ford explorers with
        tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures big crowds
        at the fences around the animal exhibits  but none of it came
        true and now even the mural is runny and dustcovered

        there is a pause filed only with radio static  sarah looks
        at nick tensely waiting  finally a voice comes over the
        radio clean as can be

                                voice os
                go ahead harvest leader

        they all breath a sign of relief

        ext main street  night

        with roland and ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
        group inside the operations building main street stands
        deserted and silent

        nearly deserted anyway  moonlight shadows lengthen at one
        end of the street 

         and five velociraptors stroll into town

                                                        cut to

        ext valley of death  night

        roland and ludlow are back in the valley of death standing
        amid the giant skeletons of longdead animals  roland bends
        down checking the carcass of the freshlychewed hadrosaur he
        saw earlier

        a set of giant threetoed rex tracks leads away from the
        carcass down the stream bed  roland follows them  ludlow
        follows roland

        as they near a bend in the stream roland looks down at the
        surface of the water  a pattern of ripples moves toward them
        washing over their ankles  roland follows the ripples with
        his eyes  from up head around the bend he can hear the
        sound of an animal eating and drinking  a very large animal

        he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
        from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
        that on the wind  they float there for a second suspended
        then blow back at him

                                ludlow
                were downwind  good

        roland darts a contemptuous look at him  he puts a finger to
        his lips gesturing for silence then steps up onto the
        shore  ludlow follows

        they creep forward toward the sounds  they round the bend
        and roland hits his belly edging up over a small rise

        over the rise he sees the tyrannosaur about a hundred yards
        ahead  its stooped over the stream bed drinking  like a
        bird it dips its head in the water and then straightens up
        to let the water fall down its throat  a dozen compys are at
        the water as well drinking

        roland gently flicks the safety on his gun to off

        ludlow edges toward the cover of a lowhanging branch  as he
        puts his weight on one knee it presses down hard on the
        middle of a small stick which cracks in half  roland turns
        eyes blazing

        out in the open the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
        well staring in the direction of the sound  but since
        rolands own head is turned he doesnt see the dinosaurs
        reaction  roland holds a warning finger out to ludlow

        roland turns his head back  the tyrannosaur is gone

        further on

        the trail of threetoed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly
        roland stops too gesturing for ludlow to freeze behind him
        roland glances both ways looking for any sign of the track

        to the right the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock
        a short distance behind them the rock is solid a massive
        green pebbled boulder ten feet high  roland frowns and
        whispers in ludlows ear again

                                roland
                we took to the rock

                                ludlow
                why

        in front of roland a palm frond sways gently in the night
        breeze  rolands eyes widen  he pulls out another pinch of
        campfire ash and releases it on the wind

        this time the ash blows off straight away from him

                                roland
                wind shift

        they freeze terrified  behind them the enormous green
        pebbled boulder 

         opens an eye

        thats no boulder thats the male tyrannosaur standing
        rocksolid still its natural camouflage blending into the
        surrounding foliage perfectly  very slowly and almost
        silently the rex brings its head all the way around until it
        is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away

        roland and ludlow stand frozen their back to the rex
        unaware of its presence

        until it exhales  the soft snort of its breath isnt quite
        audible but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
        ever so slightly

        their hearts drop into their stomachs  ludlow speaks his
        voice a queasy hiss

                                ludlow
                its behind us

                                roland
                        the very softest whisper
                its just fed  it wont attack unless
                its threatened  dont move

        as the rex silently cocks its head sizing up the danger from
        these intruders it breathes again  a few strands of ludlows
        hair flap in the exhalation  he closes his eyes near tears

        he cant take it  his eyes dart glancing down at the weapon
        he holds in his hands  unfortunately its extended in front
        of him away from the rex

        he risks another hiss

                                ludlow
                if i dont move i cant shoot it

                                roland
                let it go peter  the animal won

        behind them the rex appears satisfied  it starts to swing
        its massive head around back toward the jungle  it lifts one
        great leg and takes a step into the trees

        roland signs and closes his eyes relieved

        but ludlow seizes the opportunity  he whips his weapon around
        and drops to one knee

                                roland contd
                no

        the rex is infinitely quicker  ludlow just has time to
        squeeze off a short burst of semiautomatic gunfire when the
        animal whirls takes one elegant step forward and pounces

        ludlows bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
        the rexs legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down
        jaws wide  they close around ludlows body lift his straight
        up into the air and toss him once readjusting their grip so
        it is firmly around his midsection

        the whole combination of movements takes but half a second
        by the time roland turns around the animal has pivoted and
        darted back into the jungle carrying ludlow still screaming
        and writhing in its mouth

        roland raises his gun to draw a bead on the animal but
        through the shivering trees he can only see that the
        tyrannosaur is gone

        int communications room  night

        malcolm sarah nick kelly and dr juttson wait nervously in
        the communications room  an empty can of dr pepper sitting
        on one of the countertops begins to rattle  they look over at
        it confused as the lightweight aluminum can chatters on the
        formica counter

        other objects in the lab begin to rattle too  glass jars
        clank against one another books start to drop off the
        shelves a stool shudders across the floor

                                kelly
                whats going on

        above them the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
        actually tear away chunks of moldy timber flying up into
        the night  they look up a deafening roar fills the room 

         and a helicopters searchlight floods in

        as the chopper dips lower looking for a place to land the
        violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
        heads

        int helicopter  night

        up above the operations building the helicopter circles  the
        roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber
        impossible to land open

        below the pilots see the survivors through the torn roof of
        the building  they wave frantically their flashlight beams
        piercing the night sky

                                pilot
                there they are

        the copilot scans the street below but its choked with
        overturned cars and fallen trees

                                copilot
                no lz in the street too much debris

                                pilot
                check the other buildings

        the copilot nods and they peel off swooping over the rest of
        the village

        at the far end of the street the copilot brings the
        searchlight to bear on the large flat roof of a three story
        building

        the pilot gives him a thumbsup

        ext main street  night

        malcolm sarah kelly nick and finally dr juttson run out
        the front of the operations building  at the end of the
        street they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
        the building to land on its roof

                                malcolm
                there it is

        happily the group doubletimes it down the street headed for
        the chopper  again those strange rock formations are
        everywhere  some seem to be on the sides of buildings as if
        they once dripped there and then turned to stone

        this time sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
        of a car like solidified lava  her face falls as a thought
        occurs to her

                                sarah
                ian  its guano

                                malcolm

        a velociraptors jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them

        they dont see it

                                nick
                who cares  lets go

        unaware of the raptors presence they resume their trot
        toward the helicopter  behind them the raptor crouches and
        snarls but the sound is lost under the whine of the
        helicopters engines  it springs covering the distance
        between them quickly

        the animal slams into juttson the last person in the group
        and takes him down  juttson is thrown forward into the
        others who fall like dominoes

        juttson screams his voice an unnatural highpitched squeal
        as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him

        sarah looks up panicked  her eyes widen at the sight of a
        second raptor this one running straight at hr at top speed
        she buries her face in the dirt covering her head with her
        hands 

         and the raptors foot slams into the ground between her
        legs as it bounds over her and dives onto juttson joining the
        first raptor in the kill

        panicked the group scatters in all directions  kelly jumps
        up and scrambles into the middle of the street where she hits
        the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
        road

        malcolm rolls over to the space where kelly was but shes
        gone now  he looks around frantically

                                malcolm
                kelly  kelly

        sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
        nearest her

        behind her a third raptor gives chase bounding after her
        with horrifying speed  sarah runs flatout but her speed is
        nothing compared to the raptors and it gains on her rapidly

        the walls of a structure of some kind close in around sarah
        and as she leaps across a leather seat and slams a door behind
        her we realize shes crawled into the back seat of an
        abandoned car

        but the car door is thin protection against the charging
        raptor which slams into the window head first  the window
        spinderwebs but does not yield  the raptor crumples to the
        ground

        sarah looks up through a three inch hole in the middle of the
        web  the raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
        into the tiny hole thrashing widening it

        sarah screams and the animal forces its entire head through
        the hole snapping its jaws just short of her face

        she hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
        animal penetrates even further into the car but its torso
        will not fit through the window opening  it pulls away

        in the front seat sarah gets some very bad news

        theres no windshield

        the raptor springs up onto the hood its claws clattering on
        the sheet metal and tosses its body through the opening 

         just as sarah hurls herself out the door  while the raptor
        struggles to right itself in the front seat sarah runs to the
        nearest building ducks inside and slams the heavy wooden
        door

        ext gas station  night

        malcolm races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
        station building closing the door behind him  a moment
        later a raptor bounds after him slamming into the door

        meeting resistance it bounces off notices the plate glass
        window next to the door and pounces at that  the window
        shatters and the raptor clings to the ledge staring inside
        its tail hanging out

        just as it gets inside malcolm opens the door and comes back
        out keeping the place of wall between them  he pulls the
        lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim 

         but the raptor whirls and springs forcing him back inside
        through the door again

        willing to play along the raptor turns and jumps through the
        window again

        int gas station  night

        balancing on the window frame the raptor hisses and crouches
        ready to spring at malcolm

        malcolm takes cover behind the door which is hanging open
        between them  he raises the rifle

        th raptor springs into the door blasting it off its hinges
        knocking malcolm right through a window behind him

        but the door smacks up against the wall covering the window
        preventing the raptor from following malcolm out that way

        for the moment

        ext gas station  night

        malcolm flies through the window and crunches to the ground
        he groans  in agony and rolls off his bad leg which is twisted
        unnaturally beneath him and claws in the mud for the gun

        rough hands reach down grab him by the shirt and haul him to
        his feet  its nick  he drags malcolm away but in the
        commotion nicks duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
        the street spilling some of the precious videotapes

        malcolm scoops them up

                                nick

        int kiln house  night

        high above sarah we see she is standing alone in a three
        story kiln house a windowless shed used for firing pottery
        and other construction projects  catwalks lined with heavy
        chains hang above her and onto the floor below she turns in
        circles wondering what to do now

        from outside the kiln house she hears scratching digging
        sounds  from the other side of the door comes an animal
        snort and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
        the crack along the ground

        on the other side of the door

        the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously trying to
        tunnel underneath

        inside

        sarah runs to the opposite wall falls to her knees and
        starts digging a tunnel of her own clawing frantically at the
        ganging tools always and clanks as it tears at the earth below
        it

        sarah digs faster  so does the raptor

        with about eight inches of space under the wall sarah grabs
        hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
        hard as she can  it snaps off with a loud crack

        at the door the raptor stops digging  its silent for a
        moment

        sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now
        she starts to lower her body into it 

         just as the raptors claws flash through from the other
        side

        sarah falls back screaming leaps to her feet and jumps up
        grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above  she starts to
        climb up anywhere up as the raptor now squirms and thrashes
        its way inside coming in through her hole

        sarah climbs hauling herself up leaping from one catwalk to
        another

        the raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her

        ext kilm house  night

        a window in the slanted roof of the kiln house explodes in a
        shower of glass as sarah kicks through it and climbs outside

        can see helicopter at the far end engine roaring and
        searchlight playing over them as they draw closer  they
        approach a rusted abandoned pickup in the middle of the
        street 

         and a raptor leaps on top of it  its claws clack on the
        roof as it goes into its preattack crouch

        they dont stick around to negotiate  nick hauls malcolm off
        into the nearest building

        int worker hotel  night

        nick and malcolm hurry inside and slam the door behind them
        theyre standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind
        probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
        spend the night  the room and staircase wind around a large
        openaired central area four stories tall  they shout at each
        other frantic

        with a crash the wood sprinters around the lock and the door
        swings open violently  malcolm is thrown aside landing hard
        on the floor

        a velociraptor stands hissing in the doorway  nick throws his
        weight against the door  slamming it hard against the raptor

        malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back

        slam  the raptor charges the door again this time blasting
        it off its hinges knocking nick to the floor beneath it  the
        raptor turns and snarls at malcolm

        malcolm swings the gun around 

         the raptor lunges at him 

         malcolms finger closes on the trigger 

         and the raptor lands on top of him

        the weight of the animal crushes him into the floor but the
        gun barrel now stands between them  the raptor chomps down
        hard on the barrel its teeth grinding on the metal and snaps
        its head to tear it from malcolms hands

        malcolm pulls the trigger

        the raptors eyes pop wide as the dart slams into the back of
        its throat  it makes a gurgling sound then convulses
        violently and rolls off of malcolm yanking the gun from his
        hands as it falls and dies

        nick scrambles out from under the door  malcolm tries to
        wrench the gun from the raptors clenched jaws but it wont
        budge

        two feet from where shes hiding 

         a raptors feet pick their way past her down the middle of

        kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream

        only three rooftops away  they turn and head for it nick in
        the lead but theres an eight foot gap between the buildings

                                malcolm
                its too wide

        nick looks around desperate  a fallen power pole leans
        against the building theyre standing on its lines gone
        slack

                                nick
                help me push this

        malcolm understands  he and nick throw a shoulder into the
        pole and give it a mighty push tipping it over in the other
        direction  one good hard shove and it falls to the far
        building thudding against it solidly

        its power lines are not taut a lifeline from this rooftop to
        the next  nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
        the gap hand over hand

        behind them the door of the building splinters and crashes
        open as a raptor throws all its weight into it  malcolm leaps
        onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
        himself across

        but even with the door wide open the raptor on the other side
        hesitates  it snarls and backs away refusing to come out
        onto the roof

        on the other rooftop

        malcolm lands next to nick on the second rooftop  they look
        back at the frightened animal which takes tow steps out onto
        the roof snarls and backs into the doorway again

                                nick
                its afraid to come onto the roof

        malcolm looks around at the rooftop  strange bits of scrap
        and debris seem to have been arranged there in an odd
        concentric pattern

                look  sarah

        he points to the roof of the kilm house in the distance
        malcolm turns and sees sarah crawling across the tile  his
        face turns white

                                malcolm
                shes alone

        ext kilm house roof  night

        sarah has problems  still on top of the kilm house she
        reaches the edge and pushes off the roof leaping to the roof
        of the next building

        she lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
        sloping roof  as she pulls herself up 

         a raptor appears on the rooftop behind her  in full
        stride it leaps sails over her and lands on the roof
        ahead of her

        sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope
        away from the raptor  suddenly the roof board under her
        sprinters and cracks under her weight  the whole section
        pulls up and starts to slide off the roof  sarah clinging to
        it rides the roof  planks down away from the raptor

        she looks over her shoulder down 

         and sees another raptor waiting for her on the roof of the
        building below

        sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof which
        keeps sliding falling  the raptor below jumps up just in
        time to get whacked in the head by the falling roof section

        sarah tries to cling to the spanish tile roof fingers and
        nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface  she slides all
        the way to the edge grabs hold of the gutter and dangles
        there suspended above one raptor and trapped below another

        the raptor above works its way down  the one below leaps up
        at her dangling legs  she has left them in time with its
        jumps to avoid losing her feet  this cant go on for long

        desperate she pulls one of the spanish tiles up from the roof
        and hurls it at the raptor below  it hits the animal in the
        head for all the good that does

        but sarah keeps on pulling and throwing more tiles  she
        edges to the right toward a fresh supply

        the raptor above edges even closer claws clicking on the
        slick roof

        something interesting is happening  as sarah pulls the loose
        tiles free the ones above slide down to take their place
        sarah sees this and pulls more free knocking them out of the
        way as fast as she can

        suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
        footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates  the
        animals feet flail and grasp it slides towards the edge amid
        the tumbling tiles

        sarah seeing it coming swings in close to the building
        hugging it as closely as she can  the raptor falls off the
        roof right past her 

         and crunches into the raptor below  both animals snark and
        attack one another

        now sarah her grip exhausted falls too landing right next
        to the enraged animals  they fight and roll right over her
        she groans and hugs the wood below her the raptors continue
        to thrash and bite they roll back toward her she rolls out
        of their way 

         and plunges through a hole in the roof

        int lab  night

        sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
        lands in the tray of an oldfashioned hanging fluorescent
        light fixture

        one end of the fixtures support snaps it drops at a 45
        degree angle sarah slides out the other end and crashes
        through a window

                                malcolm
                kelly  kelly

                                                        cut to

        ext main street  night

        sarah sprints down the main street as fast as she can toward
        the building on which sits the helicopter  above her she can
        see nick has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her

        sarah reaches the fallen water tower which is next to the
        helicopter building and starts to climb it

        elsewhere in the street

        kelly is still covering underneath the fallen shed  in the
        distance she can see the helicopter  but she is trembling
        with fear unable to move

        the whole shed suddenly rattles as something heavy hits it
        outside  kellys mouth drops open to scream but her terror
        is so complex that no sound comes out  she raises her hands
        in selfdefense whatevers outside roars with effort the
        entire shed is suddenly ripped right up off of her and she
        looks up 

         into her fathers eyes

                                kelly
                dad

                                malcolm
                come on

        he grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street

        on the rooftop

        sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
        leaps onto the roof into nicks arms

                                nick
                wheres kelly

                                sarah
                wheres ian

        eyes wide with panic they both turn and look down at the
        street below where they see kelly and malcolm racing at top
        speed down the middle of the street 

         with a velociraptor chasing them

        down in the street

        malcolm and kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal
        theyre pretty fast but its faster

        above them nick and sarah are at the edge of the roof
        shouting and urging them on  they push it faster

        they reach the base of the fallen water tower the jumble of
        struts and metal poles that sarah climbed

                                malcolm
                climb

        kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles
        pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
        next one

        malcolm stretches and makes the same effort but for him its
        much harder

        below them the raptor springs and slams into the struts
        shaking the whole structure  it pulls itself up

        higher up kelly climbs fast hands gliding over the poles
        she breaks out into the open where a long narrow pole runs
        on a slight incline up to the roof  she scampers across it
        running the balance beam

        she reaches the other side on a ledge below the roofline and
        looks back  malcolm is at the other end hesitating drained
        breathing hard

                                kelly
                dad come on

        below him the raptor closes in  malcolm sets out across the
        beam his legs shaking  he places his feet carefully he
        doesnt have nearly the balance kelly did

        the raptor draws closer

                                kelly contd
                faster

        malcolm slips

        one foot twists right off the bar and he spins arms flailing
        trying to regain his tenuous balance

        but he overcompensates and his whole body wrenches out from
        under him  he falls the bar smacks him hard in the chest
        knocking the wind out of him and he drops flipping right off
        the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below

        he drops right past the pursuing velociraptor crunching to
        a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground probably
        cracking a rib  kelly screams from above him

                                kelly contd
                dad

        she stares down in horror at her father  wrenched in among
        the bars malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
        feet above him now with an open attack route

        the animal snarks and goes into its preattack crouch

        up above kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
        and leaps out into space grabbing hold of one of the bars

        the raptor springs

        kelly spins around over the top of the bar and at the very
        peak of her trajectory she lets go

        the raptor sails through down from above feet first slamming
        both of them squarely into the raptors side sending it
        hurtling into space

        she lands hard and awkwardly clanging into the spidery
        scaffolding next to malcolm as the raptor smashes to the
        ground below  but kelly manages to hold on

                                kelly
                get up

        she grabs hold of malcolm and pulls him to his feet

        on the roof

        kelly and malcolm appear over the roofline  the pilots shouts
        from inside

                                pilot
                lets go lets go lets go

        malcolm and kelly scramble toward the helicopter  but at the
        opposite side of the roof a raptor claws its way over the
        edge as well

        malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter but the
        animal is far faster  its only ten feet away then five
        theyre surely done for this time when 

         kaboom

        there comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard
        and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
        the roof dead  they look up to the source of the
        gunshot

        its roland standing at the edge of the roof holding his
        smoking 600 nitro express

        but theres no time for celebration as suddenly the
        helicopters left skid cracks right through the surface of the
        roof

                                pilot
                hurry  the roofs giving way

        the skid dips even further ripping right through the
        thatchandwood construction  kelly who had one foot in the
        helicopter loses her balance 

         as the roof caves in beneath her

                                malcolm
                kelly

        she falls  screaming through the hole and down into the
        building below

        one floor down

        kelly lands with a crunch on the floor immediately below the
        roof about nine feet down  but her landing is cushioned by
        an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
        arranged there  she lifts one hand and a yellowy viscous
        substance drips off of it

        its yolk  she looks around noticing half a dozen large
        oblong shapes  eggs

        above her malcolm is scrambling climbing down to her through
        the wreckage of the creaking crumbling roof

                                malcolm
                kelly  im coming

        kelly climbs to her knees but behind her a large dark shape
        is moving  rising  unfolding in a way

        its a pteranodon

        yep flying dinosaur  the enormous animal raises its head a
        brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long
        saberlike beak  it squawks at kelly in fury  she can only
        stare spellbound

        malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
        its massive twentytwo foot wingspread

        on the roof

        the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
        roof and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris
        roland races over to the hole climbs in a few feet and
        starts kicking at it making it larger

                                roland
                give me a ladder

        in the pteranodon nest

        malcolm tries to haul kelly back up the way he came but a
        second pteranodon now appears from the depths of the building
        screeching in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
        middle of their clutch of eggs

        an emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof
        malcolm grabs kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
        and they start to climb out of the nest

        on the roof

        malcolm and kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
        belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
        through the surface of the roof around them

        the pteranodons are emerging

                                malcolm
                go go go go gog go

        the helicopter lurches up a few feet but it yanked to an
        abrupt stop  the engines whine the chopper just hovers
        there

                                pilot
                were snagged on something

        they loos down both pteranodons have come out through the
        hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
        helicopter  they flap their gigantic wings in unison and
        drag the helicopter off into the air away from the nest 

         and let go  freed the helicopter gains altitude quickly

        in the helicopter

        the pilots gape as the pteranodons coast along right next to
        the helicopter

                                pilot
                hang on  if i tip it hard i can cut
                em with the rotors

                                sarah
                no  dont  theyre not attacking

        they look out the windows where indeed the magnificent
        animals are merely accompanying them flying escort as the
        chopper gains altitude

                                sarah contd
                theyre protecting their nest
                thats all  thats all theyre
                doing

        kelly completely drained sits between sarah and malcolm
        each of whom has a protective arm around her  she sags
        against her fathers chest nothing left

        he holds her tight and whispers in her ear

                                malcolm
                thank you  kelly thank god  thank
                god for you

        in the night sky

        over the island the helicopter steadily gains altitude  a
        hundred feet  three hundred  a thousand

        as the helicopter is clearly leaving the island the
        pteranodons now peel off their job done  one of them banks
        sharply right in front of the moon  the moonlight
        silhouettes it shining right through its membranous wings
        lighting it up like a halloween skeleton

        below the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
        the winedark sea

        ext tyrannosaur nest  night

        elsewhere in the forest its not such a happy story  peter
        ludlow still alive drops through the air and crunches to the
        muddy ground  dizzy bleeding the breath knocked out of him
        he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud

        from behind him he hears a chirping sound  he turns

        hes in the tyrannosaur nest

        the baby tyrannosaur faces him still with a strange
        aluminumfoil cast on its leg  the baby squeaks with
        excitement as it toddles toward him

        ludlow scrambles to his feet unsure what to do  both adult
        tyrannosaurs stand outside the nest staring down at him

        the baby runs toward ludlow so he turns and runs away

        but in an instant the male brings its head down knocking
        ludlow to the ground  then it raises its head again
        watching  waiting

        ludlow gets up again and tries to run but now the female rex
        strikes knocking him over again

        ludlow tries to crawl away on all fours  the male bends down
        and closes its jaws around one of his legs holding it
        tightly  ludlow screams 

         and the rex bits down decisively  the bone breaks with a
        dry snap  ludlow howls in pain unable to move and the baby
        toddles forward eagerly  ludlow can only stare as it leaps
        up onto his chest and opens its jaws wide

        peter ludlow screams

                                                        cut to

        ext cemetery  day

        snow falls in a gray midwinter sky  in a cemetery a group of
        fifty mourners is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
        that is festooned with cascades of flowers  on a table there
        is an array of framed photographs 

         of john hammond  a minister reads from the bible while the
        mourners wipe away tears  ian malcolm stands a respectful
        distance from the group kelly right beside him  malcolms
        face is blank tired his sunburn out of place with the white
        winter setting around him

        at gravesite a young woman turns looking back over her
        shoulder  about sixteen shes lovely with long blonde hair
        and an honest open face  she notices malcolm recognizes
        him

        she nudges a young man next to her about thirteen years old
        the young man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming

        as the ceremony breaks up they walk over to him

                days  tim and i have been thinking

                what your grandfather created it
                wouldnt be around for very long

        back on isla sorna we float over the deserted worker village

                do you feel the cold wind blowing on
                your face  thats real

        we sweep low landing on the roof the helicopter took off
        from the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
        scrap a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it

                do you see the four of us standing
                here together alive  thats real

        a pteranodon land gently on the nest  ever so carefully it
        positions itself over the eggs lowers itself to roosting
        position and folds its giant wings around its body
