               the magic is all around you 
               all the time everywhere 
               in every thing 
               the trick is to see it

               in black

               the insistent persistent eighttothebar beat of boogie
               woogie hot exciting pulsating rhythm ramping up

               then

               in the blackness falling slowly tumbling gentl
               y a picturepostcard

                               greetings from hollywood

               then another and another each one dropping through frame 
               a gentle rain

               in these old postcards hollywood is a dream town where movie 
               stars glide out of big cars to press their hands and 
               footprints in the wet cement

               another postcard

                       im meeting the stars at hollywood  vine

               in this postcard myth youd toddle down to hollywood and 
               vine bump into bogie and bacall and join them for dinner 
               at the brown derby or ciros or the coconut grove

               more postcards pictures of movie theaters but not the ones 
               that you and i know today these are palaces temples

               paramount the million dollar from a time when moviegoing 
               was a complete experience not a trip to the local mall the 
               ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded 
               jackets and guided you to your seat the popcorn was hot and 
               fresh and buttered with real butter not 30weight motor 
               oil

                                                                    cut to

               the pile of postcards

               a wild jumble then one last postcard drops lazily on top 
               of the pile its a view of hollywood at night a carpet of 
               lights under the yawning protective smile of mt lees most 
               famous resident the fullylit hollywood sign we push into 
               the picture of the sign dissolving until were

               pushing into the real hollywood sign closer and closer 
               until we fly right through it  then crazily loop up and 
               behind it until were looking down at

               super title 1951

               a gigantic aerial shot postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer 
               evening air with the sounds of thousands of honking horns a 
               mere precursor to the traffic yet to come darkened outlying 
               neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction 
               boom as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the 
               areas surrounding the beating heart of the town a swath of 
               garishly bright concrete called

               still in the same shot we rocket down into the center of 
               the intersection of hollywood and vine then head west along 
               the boulevard skimming just above the traffic  past musso 
               and franks grill and the hollywood canteen past the egyptian 
               theater and a rumbling pacific electric red car across

               queen  still the same shot buses disgorge tourists who 
               move into the forecourt of the theater the men doff their 
               hats and mop their brows the women pull their blouses away 
               from their chests fanning themselves with moviestar maps 
               as they marvel at the signed cement blocks

               we move among them until we pick up a couple and we stay 
               behind them as they work their way through the crowd on 
               their way to

               the theater entrance

               where an ornately attired doorman smiles and tears their

               ushers and we move into

               the darkened theater

               as the couple pete and sandra find seats we hear the 
               soundtrack of the film before we see the screen the 
               unmistakable strains of a march and then  still in the 
               same shot  we see the screen

               a newsreel

                         but it wasnt like i had a lot of 
                         choices

               petes headlights catch a glimpse of another sign reading 
               lawson wash just in front of a small wooden auto bridge

               barely reducing his speed pete heads onto the bridge

               his pov  through the windshield

               his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless 
               possum

               pete swerves to avoid the animal and a wheel drops off the 
               edge

               ext bridge  night

               and the plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and 
               into the rapidlymoving water below

               ext underwater  night

               the water is flowing very quickly and the current is intense  
               pete pulls himself out of the drivers seat thankfully 
               its a convertible and swims over the windshield

               but his left sleeve is caught on the door handle nearly 
               out of breath and panicking pete shucks off the jacket and 
               heads for the surface

               ext the wash  night

               pete breaks the surface and gasps for air his fight isnt 
               over yet as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream

               he swims with all his might toward the far bank

               ext far bank of the wash  night

               drained pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to 
               his feet

                              gasping
                         oh my god i dont believe oh my 
                         god

               he stumbles along backwards a couple of steps and his 
               heel hits a rock

               pete falls backward  and his head strikes a glancing blow 
               on another rock he rolls down the bank unconscious and 
               lands face down in the mud

               cut to black

               in black we slowly become aware of a panting breathing 
               sound  the sound of a dog

               fade in

               on a dogs face

               a yellow labrador full frame it takes a couple more sniffs 
               then starts licking furiously

               licked in the face by the dog

               on the old man

               old railroad cap he comes down to pete and using his walking 
               stick pokes him in the side

               he sits up and the old man gets a look at his head which 
               is caked with mud and blood on one side

               and slowly turns to face pete he looks closer and closer

               hesitantly he takes a couple of steps towards pete who 
               slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old mans gaze

               finally theyre standing practically toetotoe

               pete

               looks a bit puzzled but the old man has such a sweet face

               harry

               has tears forming in his eyes a smile turns up the corners 
               of his mouth and quickly lights up his whole face

               harry takes pete in his arms and hugs him tightly burying 
               his face in petes shoulder and sobbing

                         luke luke i like it

               luke looks at the town as they drive down commerce street

               his pov

               shops are open for business townspeople are going about 
               their lives a few stop and watch as the sheriffs car goes 
               by

                                     luke
                         how long have i been gone

               eldridge looks at harry who stares ahead

                                     luke
                         how long

               pause the silence is too thick and harry has to answer

               he turns around in his seat and faces luke

                                     harry
                              gently
                         you never came back from the war we 
                         were told you were missing and 
                         presumed dead

                                     luke
                         when did i leave

                                     harry
                         you joined up one month to the day 
                         after pearl harbor january seventh 
                         nineteen fortytwo

               luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in

                                     harry
                         nine andahalf years ago

                                     luke
                         nine andahalf years

                                     eldridge
                         comin up on the bijou gents

               ext in front of the bijou  day

               eldridges car rounds the corner pulls up and stops

                                     eldridge
                         here we are

                                     harry
                         well son youre home

               luke peers across the street his mouth gapes open

               his pov  the bijou

               the bijou is a decaying dadaesque grabbag of building 
               styles its as though the architect took random parts of a 
               chinese temple a mosque a pagoda a sphinx a symphony 
               hall and a slaughterhouse put them in a bag gave it a good 
               shake tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly 
               built the result

               as a matter of fact if you didnt know that the place was 
               the bijou youd probably wonder what the cryptic message

                                        he b j u

               was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet

               and now the reason for the deteriorated state of the  he b 
               j u sign becomes apparent train tracks run right behind 
               the building on an elevated trestle as we watch a train 
               roars by everything shakes its not an earthquake its a 
               trainquake the j teeters at a jaunty angle threatening 
               to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers

               luke

               stares at the monstrosity his face is ashen his heart has 
               sunk to somewhere below his knees

               the bijou

               harry jumps out of the car excitedly

                                     harry
                         thanks for the lift cecil

                                     eldridge
                         dont mention it welcome home luke

                                     luke
                              faint smile
                         thanks

               luke opens the back door and slowly steps out harry grabs 
               his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket

                                     harry
                         waitll you see the inside

                                     luke
                              deadpan
                         cant wait

                                                                    cut to

               int bijou lobby  day

               the interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by 
               the exterior motheaten velvetflocked wallpaper hangs in 
               shards and pieces from the walls its sort of a cross between 
               a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum served up with generous 
               helpings of dust and grime an almost unbeatable combination 
               of questionable taste and neglect

               above the center of the lobby hangs what was  and is  
               probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater 

               a delicate crystal chandelier

               even under a veneer of dust the fragile droplets of cut 
               crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and 
               scatter it in a hundred directions

               tilt down to reveal

               luke and harry standing below luke is lost in a gulf 
               somewhere between surprise and disgust

                                     harry
                         weve been closed for a while

                                     luke
                              smiling wanly
                         ah

               luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly cracks 
               one open

               int auditorium  day

               the ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem 
               to be for the most part intact  although the occasional 
               row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved 
               itself up against the row behind or in front

               the screen

               is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin 
               framed by ragged red velveteen drapery

               in the tiny orchestra pit as we will see later is an old 
               upright piano

               luke walks a few steps down the aisle he picks a seat on 
               the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits as he 
               does a cat an orange tabby leaps out from under another 
               seat jets past luke and disappears down the aisle and 
               backstage harry comes over and sits behind him

                                     luke
                              turning to harry
                         exactly how long has the bijou been 
                         closed

                                     harry

                                     luke
                         why

                                     luke

                                     harry

                         will be different around here thats 
                         for sure
                              rises grabs lukes 
                              arm
                         cmon ill show you where we live

                                                                    cut to

               int bijou apartment  day

               the small apartment above the projection booth is quite a 
               contrast to the rest of the theater its neat as a pin and 
               fairly lit as harry has just pulled back the curtains 
               allowing the sun to flood the room

               a beam of golden light falls across a table atop which are

               several framed photos

               one of the photos is of the real muchyounger luke its a 
               norman rockwell scene at a train depot with an armyissue 
               olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder he has one 
               arm around harry and the other around his mother

               and by the way petes resemblance to the real luke  even 
               in a nearly 10 year old photo  is pretty damn startling

                                     harry
                         the day you shipped out that was a 
                         proud day for your mother and me 
                         last time you saw her last time i 
                         saw you

               he smiles

                                     harry
                         till today

               luke sets it down and picks up another photo that of a fine 
               looking woman its a formal portrait dating perhaps from 
               the 30s

                                     harry
                         thats lily your mother rest her 
                         soul

                                     luke
                              repeating
                         mother
                              to harry
                         shes beautiful

                                     harry
                              coming over
                         well yes that she was she certainly 
                         made this place a home

               he takes the picture from luke kisses it and gently replaces 
               it on the table luke goes over to the sofa and sits

                                     harry
                              brightly
                         can i get you anything i can put 
                         some coffee on or some

               harry looks at luke who has almost instantly fallen asleep 
               on the sofa

               he goes to him gently picks his feet off the floor lifts 
               them onto the sofa removes his shoes sets them on the floor

                                                                    cut to

               a blanket

               being drawn up lukes chest

               harry

               stands looks down warmly at his son then suddenly hes 
               seized by a thought he turns and crosses to the window

               close  the window

               theres a small picture frame in the window harry reaches 
               down gingerly picks it up and turns it around

               on the frame

               its a single faded gold star one war casualty

               harry clutches it to his chest looks over at the sleeping 
               luke and smiles

                                     harry
                              softly
                         when i woke up this morning my son 
                         was dead now i have my boy again

               fade to black

               fade in

               int bijou apartment  morning

               its early morning luke is sound asleep still in his 
               clothes in the distance a train sounds its horn

               luke rolls over on his back still asleep snoring lightly

               slowly he starts to wake up eyes still closed

               somethings strange though he frowns the train is getting 
               closer lukes eyes pop open

               lukes pov

               as the train rumbles by shaking everything in the room 
               luke looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at 
               him

               harry an elderly woman and an elderly black man

                                     harry

               luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more awake  
               he rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged

               the elderly woman nudges harry gently

                                     harry

                         its convenient because you dont 
                         have to get dressed and put on a

               he stands behind luke and whispers in his ear

                              taps her head

               lardner gives her an extra squeeze continues to hold onto 
               her just a bit too long adele detects something amiss

                                     adele

               on a kitchen table offscreen we hear a hiccup then another 
               adeles hand reaches into frame

               wider

               int lardner kitchen  evening

               lardner stands over adele who is seated at the table holding 
               the glass of water

                                     lardner
                         drink slowly

               she raises the glass to her lips

                                     lardner
                         from the other side of the glass

               its a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water 
               but adele accomplishes it with aplomb she waits for a moment  
               then hiccups again

                                     adele
                         i think

                         he doesnt remember anything delly

                         your picture without batting an eye 
                         but its probably temporary he got 
                         all the way to lawson so he clearly 
                         knew who he was and what he was doing 
                         until he hit his head im sure itll 
                         all come back to him it just takes 
                         a catalyst

               luke smiles and watches adele as she makes the decision to 
               not struggle against the hiccups she has them and thats 
               just the way it is

                                     luke

               moment and in this particular light  hiccups and all he 
               moves closer to her she moves closer to him

               around him he starts kissing her neck and she suddenly 
               realizes  shes stopped hiccuping

               ext the bijou  night

               luke comes down the street and heads for the front door he 
               has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys 
               and enters

               int bijou lobby  night

               its very dark luke is about to swing shut the heavy door 
               when he looks down and sees

               the orange tabby cat

               shoot into the lobby stopping in the middle of the floor

               it looks at luke and purrs

               luke closes the door and moves to the cat he crouches down 
               and pets it and its back rises to meet his hand

                                     luke
                         hey fella so you live here too

                         that

               the cat moves to the auditorium door pausing to look back 
               at luke curiosity piqued luke follows the cat

               int bijou basement hallway  night

               in the dim light we see an old mop and pail some dirty 
               film cans and a large beatup cardboard standee of the 
               tramp with the legend chaplin short today

               the cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door 
               at the end of a hallway luke following the cat comes around 
               the same corner and looks at

               the door

               slightly ajar theres a light coming from within as well 
               as the sound of old tim softly humming its a long way to 
               tipperary

               luke moves to the door and knocks

                                     luke
                         um old tim sorry its late its

               the humming stops and after a moment the door swings open 
               revealing old tim a pipe in his mouth holding the cat 
               stroking its fur

               the room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot 
               which is perfectly made militarystyle

               its a much younger old tim looking quite serious and 
               handsome in his great war doughboys uniform

               the cat jumps down from old tims arms and moves to luke he 
               rubs against his legs purring luke leans down to pet him

               int bijou office  day

               luke is sitting at the desk making notes and adding up some 
               figures he puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes then 
               looks up at

               harry and old tim

               who are sitting on the floor going through piles of lobby 
               cards and folded onesheets like little boys fascinated with 
               their baseball cards

               he shifts his gaze to

               mrs terwilliger

               who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or 
               three file cabinets in the corner of the office as she works 
               she hums an old song occasionally breaking into the lyrics

                                     mrs terwilliger
                              sings
                         the object of my affection can 
                         change my complexion from white to 
                         rosy red

               luke takes a breath

               a tv screen

               its tiny with rounded corners blackandwhite and a 
               hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow

               wider

               int lardner living room  night

               doc lardner is fiddling with a brandnew console television 
               set trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of your show 
               of shows he adjusts the dials fiddles with the rabbit 
               ears steps back  and is successful sid caesar and imogene 
               coca are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch and 
               lardner fairly roars with laughter

               he turns to go back to his chair but the second he does so 
               the reception goes haywire he returns to the spot in front 
               of the tv and the picture is perfect again

               the doorbell rings hes torn  if he moves the picture 
               will break up the doorbell rings again and we hear adeles 
               voice from upstairs

                                     adele os

                              giving in
                         oh hell

               he moves from his spot the reception goes bad and he marches 
               to the door

               he opens it and luke is standing there wearing a slightly 
               outofdate coat and tie

                                     lardner

                         evening doctor lardner

               lardner freezes staring at luke

                         whats wrong

                                     lardner
                              shaken from his 
                              reverie

                         all my old clothes fits okay but 
                         its a little big

               adele comes down the stairs halfway down she stops suddenly 
               and stares at luke

                                     adele
                         oh

               awkward pause adeles staring at luke lardners staring at 
               luke and lukes getting nervous

                                     luke
                         i shouldnt have worn the suit

               adele comes down the stairs

                                     adele
                         no you were wearing that suit the 
                         last time we went out before

                                     luke
                         oh

                                     adele
                         and its just well deja vu

                                     lardner
                         thats it deja vu

               another awkward pause as adele and luke stare at each other

               lardner breaks it

                                     lardner
                         you kids off to the dance

                                     luke

                                     lardner
                         no im not much of a dancer

                                     adele
                              chidingly
                         besides daddys still trying to 
                         figure out how to get his new 
                         television set working

                                     lardner
                         i had it a minute ago

               he glances at the tv set the picture is suddenly crystal 
               clear

                                     lardner
                         ooooh its back
                              encouraging them 
                              toward the door
                         well you kids have fun now

               adele takes lukes arm and they exit exchanging goodnights 
               with lardner who closes the door and turns toward the living 
               room

               slowly he sneaks into the room watching the tv 
               carefully all the while the reception is staying perfect

               caesar and coca are involved in an intricate bit of business 
               and lardner wants to laugh but hes afraid to he stifles 
               his urge and heads for his chair gingerly he sits still 
               perfect

               satisfied he finally laughs out loud and puts his feet up

               the picture goes completely haywire again

                                     lardner
                         aw crap

               adele glances curiously at luke as we

               launching into the opening bars of dont be that way an 
               old benny goodman tune

               ext city hall square  day

               spencer wyatts big ban is comprised of a dozen or so 
               musicians about spencers age  except for the drummer 
               avery wyatt 40s spencers dad though no gene krupa he 
               pounds the skins pretty well all the while smiling proudly 
               as his son plays clarinet and leads the band

               despite the last minute decorations the square looks nice 
               hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights

               on luke and adele

               dancing to the music along with several other couples

                                     luke
                              nodding toward the

                         investment was paying dividends

                         play for the first time so you went 
                         out and got a used clarinet you 
                         wanted nothing more than to be able 
                         to play like him you tried hard 
                         but it wasnt long before it was 
                         clear that benny goodman would never 
                         be looking over his shoulder so you 
                         gave the clarinet to spencer

                                     luke

                         little box step

               her face the band finishes the song and everyone 
               enthusiastically applauds spencer bows shyly blushing 
               slightly he nods to the band and they bow before he motions 
               for the crowds attention

                                     spencer

               luke

                                     spencer
                              to luke
                         when you didnt come back i learned 
                         how to play this so i could remember

                         gave this night to all of us

               the crowd applauds warmly

                                     spencer
                         okay folks heres mayor cole

               the crowd applauds as ernie cole mounts the band riser he 
               turns and addresses avery wyatt on drums

                                     ernie
                         pretty proud of your boy avery

               avery smiles broadly and beats the kick drum five or six 
               times to register his reaction

                         someone else to mix paint at the 
                         store cause i think spencers got 
                         a big career ahead of him

               applause again and ernie waits for it to settle as soon as 
               he starts speaking the crowd becomes totally silent

                                     ernie

                         faltered and we never forgot

               ernies voice cracks slightly with emotion he clears his 
               throat and continues

                                     ernie
                         we never forgot and so when one of 
                         our own came back to us i gotta 
                         tell you folks it was like a miracle

               the crowd applauds adele takes lukes hand and smiles

               ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject

                                     ernie

                         financial ruin for the sake of a 
                         crumbling old building

               fitts takes lukes hand and shakes it

                                     fitts

               the crowd moans slightly and spencer kicks the band into 
               moonlight serenade slow and easy

               on adele and luke

               as they hold each other close and dance adele rests her 
               head on lukes shoulder her eyes closed luke strokes her 
               hair and sways her gently to the music

               luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor

               lukes pov

               bob leffert is standing there staring at the band mabel 
               comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder shes asking 
               him if he would like to dance bob looks down at the ground 
               selfconsciously shoves his hookhand in his pocket and moves 
               away leaving mabel standing there

               as luke watches and the music continues over we

                                                               dissolve to

               luke and adele dancing

               walking slowly arminarm down adeles street up her 
               walk to her door

               kissing passionately on her doorstep

               adele going inside and luke walking away each unable to 
               take their eyes off the other

               luke walking the quiet streets of lawson smiling 
               beatifically

                                                         match dissolve to

               ext the bijou  night

               luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door he 
               pulls out his keys and enters

               int bijou lobby  night

               lukes about to close the door when he looks down and sees

               cat

               meowing at him from the sidewalk he holds the door open 
               and cat shoots into the lobby disappearing into the 
               auditorium luke closes the door and stops he hears 
               something and so do we soft and faraway its a piano

               the melody is soft lilting  almost a lullaby

               luke turns toward the music which is coming from the 
               auditorium the piano continues building slightly in volume  
               he moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one 
               open

               int auditorium  night

               luke enters his face bathed in the soft flickering 
               reflected light of

               the screen

               the movie is the big parade the old decomposing nitrate 
               print is badly scratched and stained a young beautiful 
               renee adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover 
               john gilbert as he marches off to fight the great war

               luke stares at the screen the look on his face is one of 
               bewilderment  and awe

               angle  the piano

               the rickety old upright is tinnysounding and slightly out 
               oftune but it really doesnt matter

               closer

               mrs terwilliger is playing passionately she never takes 
               her eyes  which are full of tears  off the tattered 
               screen except to close them when she is overcome with 
               emotion even so she never misses a beat

               her hands

               fairly dance upon the keys stiff and wrinkled as they are 
               they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity 
               that the old piano can muster

               luke is moved by what hes witnessing this is the magic

               wider angle  the center section

               to the right of luke sitting in the center of a row is old 
               tim stroking cat old tim stares at the poignant scene 
               unfolding on the screen pausing only to wipe his eyes and 
               nose with a handkerchief he doesnt notice

               luke

               who looks up towards the projection booth

                                                                    cut to

               a bright white flickering light

               filling the frame were looking directly into the beam of 
               light radiating from the projector

               pushing into the light we get closer to the windows of the 
               booth we come out of the beam and can just barely make out 
               the figure of harry framed in a small window next to the 
               projector

               we continue pushing in  closer and closer  until harrys 
               face fills the screen he is watching the film his eyes are 
               wide and moist as though hes experiencing the magic thats 
               unfolding on the screen for the very first time

               the warning bell on the projector chimes three times 
               signaling the end of the reel harry moves away from the 
               window

               int projection booth  night

               never taking his eyes off the screen harry watches as the 
               film comes to an end and flap falp falps out of the 
               projector he kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs 
               apart and the bright beam dies its not the end of the 
               movie but it is the end of the only fragment they have

               harry moves to the house lights rheostat and slowly fades 
               them up this done he pulls a handkerchief from his back 
               pocket and blows his nose loudly

               he crosses back to the projector unlatches the full takeup 
               reel and takes it down hes about to move away when he 
               senses that hes not alone he looks over the projector to 
               see

               luke

               standing there their eyes meet someone should say something  
               both men search for words suddenly luke feels very outof
               place almost embarrassed  as though hes interrupted a 
               very private ritual

               harry senses this clutching the precious reel of film tightly 
               to his chest he searches lukes face and smiles warmly

                                     harry
                         beautiful wasnt it

               smile at luke and still clutching the reel crosses to the 
               rewind bench methodically he mounts it and threads the end 
               of the film onto an empty reel slowly he begins to turn 
               the crank rewinding the film

               he stops and looks to where luke was standing but hes 
               not there

                         id like to ask your help to well 
                         to scrounge around a bit and see if

                         what kinds of things are you talking 
                         about

                                     luke
                         oh paint brushes plaster light 
                         bulbs yardage and if you cant

                         some oldfashioned elbow grease

               fitts leans forward

                                     fitts
                         so you do intend to fix the place

                         mr fitts with all due respect i 
                         think lawson needs the bijou a bit 
                         more than it needs a super market 
                         and i think lawson deserves the bijou 
                         theres not a lot that can be done 
                         to help us get past the pain weve

               covering it harry steps forward and gathers some of it in 
               his arms

               ernie and daley step forward and look up at the monument

               ernie touches the names of his two sons inscribed on the

                         out where people can see it

               luke overhears this last and as he smiles he turns to harry 
               who brightens as he pulls a large section of the muslin taut 
               between his outstretched arms

                                                                    cut to

               watching the goingson in wideeyed awe

               harry snips the last line and the rest of the old screen 
               drops down on lukes head suddenly lukes a ghost he 
               raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids who 
               scream in mock terror and scatter as harry and adele laugh

               old tim and harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the

               carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris

               the men are having a tough time carrying the seats and just

               hes improvising start to change  and before long its

               the reel is coming to an end harry looks out the window at 
               the screen then back to the task at hand

               int bijou lobby  night

               luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster

               with a satisfied smile he walks through the lobby admiring 
               how handsome the old place looks old tim snappily attired 
               in his uniform is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a 
               dustpan mrs terwilliger is straightening up the candy 
               counter all is well

               luke goes to the lobbys poster case he opens it and unfolds 
               a brandnew onesheet poster for sand pirates  the same 
               design as the onesheet we saw in petes apartment

               methodically he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the 
               case

               as luke passes the auditorium doors a man comes out of the 
               theater and crosses to the candy counter the door stays 
               open for a moment and luke decides to duck inside and catch 
               a bit of the picture

               on the screen  sand pirates of the sahara

               and says

               on luke

               his mouth is gaping open he stares at the screen

                              a whisper
                         sandra

               luke stands confused he stumbles backward moving into the 
               lobby as the man goes back into the auditorium with his 
               popcorn and the door closes

               int bijou lobby  night

               luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors old tim and 
               mrs terwilliger take note of his odd behavior

                                     mrs terwilliger
                         luke dear are you all right

               without answering luke turns and runs to the poster case

               on the poster  sand pirates of the sahara

               forget the cheesy bmovie artwork as luke looks at the 
               poster its clear that hes remembering something he looks 
               at the picture of sandra  then scans down to the credits 
               block at the bottom of the poster his eyes lock upon

                                written by peter appleton

                                     luke
                         my god my god no

               suddenly all of pete appletons worries have come crashing 
               down on him

               because he remembers

               int projection booth  night

               the warning bell dings twice but the changeover projectors 
               carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying

                                     harry
                              pleading

               harrys trying to keep the projector going as the previous 
               reel is about to end given no other choice he finally gives 
               the changeover projector a good swift kick

               it hums to life a perfect changeover harry pets the 
               projector

                                     harry

                         say

               as he turns away he feels a sudden sharp pain in his left 
               arm wincing he grabs his arm staggers back towards a chair 
               and sits heavily

               he tries to clear his throat but it dissolves into a hacking 
               choking cough he tries to stand but drops to his knees 
               clutching his left arm harder than before

                                     harry
                              in pain
                         oh jesus

               harry falls to the floor and as he does

               the film

               breaks in the projector gate flap flap flap

               int bijou lobby  night

               luke is still staring at the poster lost in thought

               offscreen we hear the audience whistling and hooting in 
               reaction to the broken film

               mrs terwilliger has been calling lukes name but he doesnt 
               come out of his stupor until old tim comes up behind him and 
               spins him around

                                     old tim
                         mr luke

                         they tear the theater apart

               finally luke pulls himself together hears the audience 
               noise and moves toward the auditorium doors

               int auditorium  night

               amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris luke 
               tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle 
               toward the stage

                                     luke

               the crowd quiets down a bit luke shields his eyes from the 
               light and calls up to the projection booth

                                     luke
                         harry harry why dont you cut the

               luke gripped by a sudden fear rushes up the aisle and into

               rose on harrys casket then as everyone surreptitiously 
               watches he turns and walks away from the gravesite toward 
               the cemetery entrance

               adele watches luke depart

               another angle

               and shes not alone agents saunders and brett are watching 
               everything from their car which is parked nearby

               as luke walks away saunders snaps his photo with a long
               lens camera

                                                               dissolve to

               and lukes name inscribed there

               ext city hall square  dusk

               luke stands in front of the memorial head bowed after a 
               moment he sits leaning against the memorial

               on luke

               lost in thought he buries his face in his hands

               she sits next to him tentatively she touches his shoulder

               he leans into her and she enfolds her arm in his

               her tears start and she moves to hug luke  but instead 
               she starts hitting him flailing beating on his chest he 
               hugs her tightly and she completely lets go

               pete comes out into the bright midday sun it takes a moment 
               for his eyes to adjust and when they do he becomes aware 
               of perhaps twenty people lining the sidewalk in front of the 
               station

               petes pov

               and mabel lanier daley thornhill katie rutherford stanton 
               lawson now theres nothing in the least bit threatening 
               about the gathering  and thats whats so disturbing about 
               it theyre not an angry mob theyre just standing there 
               running the gamut of emotions

               shock disillusionment betrayal

               its an awkward moment pete doesnt quite know how to react  
               he wants to go over and talk to them but he wouldnt know 
               what to say he wishes one of them would talk to him just 
               say something anything but no one does

               then bob leffert turns away from pete he shoves his hook 
               hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away followed by 
               mabel then his brother then the others

               leaving pete alone

               theres a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road 
               obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away its deadly 
               quiet as gas station owner rory late 60s pulls up and parks 
               his model a truck he gets out and an big old german 
               shepherd lottie jumps out of the truck bed

               rory moves to the door and is about to put his key in the 
               lock when lottie starts whining looking toward the fog 
               bank and sniffing the air expectantly

                                     rory
                         whatsit girl

               he stops  he hears something too  a low rumble lottie 
               starts barking the rumble is getting louder rorys getting 
               worried he looks at

               the fog bank

               its starting to glow from within lotties barking gets 
               louder and angrier suddenly a large black car punches out 
               of the fog bank and tears down the road its followed by 
               another and another  and perhaps a dozen more cars and 
               trucks all heading hellbentforleather toward the town

               rory moves toward lottie trying to quiet her as the cars 
               fly past the station

                                     rory

                         just remember two things first the 
                         law is a living thing it made us 
                         free and it keeps us free sometimes 
                         it gets twisted around by people for 
                         their own purposes sometimes it 
                         makes mistakes sometimes big 
                         mistakes  but in the end the law 
                         prevails for the just sometimes it 
                         takes a while

                                     pete

                         say anything before this committee 
                         as long as its the truth
