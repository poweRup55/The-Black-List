fade in

from the blackness before the first images we hear a young
womans tortured scream muffled by her own will  we see her
mouth open in agony her face beaded with sweat  her name
is anne and she is queen of france  she lies in

a royal bedchamber

the royal doctor kneels at the foot of her bed her own royal
mother grips her hands

on the opposite side of the huge bedchamber and separated
from the queens bed by an artistically painted screen are
royal advisors sweating and anxious for any word to take to
their king  they wince as the queen moans again in the pain
of childbirth

her fingers claw out for help but her doctor ignores her
need to be touched and comforted he is concerned only for
the baby  only her priest father belles sits at her head
stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers

                     doctor
          the head is born  one arm the
          other arm it is a boy

the advisors disregarding the queens privacy scurry around
the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby wet
with birth  the mother  the queen  is still in agony
yet she struggles to lift her head

                     advisor 1
          i shall tell the king

                     advisor 2
          i shall tell him

they hurry for the door  but their race to be first to bring
this great news to the king is interrupted as the queen emits
another cry it surprises the doctor

                     doctor
          mlady

he kneels again to examine the queen

                     doctor
          another  it is another

the joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors  they look
gravely at each other as they hear a second babys cry

                                                smash to

a dark courtyard  night

a door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard
and into the darkness steps a dashing figure  his face is
hidden in shadow but we know from the silhouette of his
cloak and plumed hat that he is a musketeer

he carries an oblong basket

a carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the
courtyard  the musketeer steps into its interior with a
sharp word to the driver 

                     musketeer
          away

the whip cracks and the carriage plunges into the night

                                           time dissolve

ext  establishing the island fortress prison  day

on a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of france stands an island fortress a prison
like an alcatraz of the mediterranean  just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty the fortress is horrible and
foreboding  as we superimpose

                            1662
                   twentytwo years later

int  the fortress prison

with the camera as our moving pov we survey the prison  it
is a horrible place  dungeons where prisoners lie in their
own filth corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive
women long twisting corridors lined with cells from which
prisoners whimper or moan in madness  up a long winding
staircase our pov moves we push through the barred window of
a cell it is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places
weve seen but still a prison  we pan the cell

and we see a man  a man in an iron mask  it is terrifying
to think of anyone imprisoned in this way  we push in on his
eyes they are blue childlike

a greasy jailer  the prisoners keeper  puts his face to
the barred window of the door and speaks with bored cruelty

                     keeper
          you dead yet

                     man in the iron mask
          no keeper

                                             dissolve to

ext  establishing paris  day

superimpose

                           paris

ext  paris street  night

through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight his horses hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows  he is a magnetic sight riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider
sitting lightly in the saddle is

dartagnan

famous musketeer captain of the kings royal bodyguard  he
is still handsome at midlife still erect unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty

he rides past a knot of angry beggars moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food  when they
see dartagnan some throw rocks at him  they sail by
dartagnans head he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches and keeps on riding

outside the cathedral

dartagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside notre dame cathedral  priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard  as dartagnan reins his
horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform  but dartagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him

he pauses as he sees parked to one side of the old
residence a big rickety carriage  dartagnan smiles

                     dartagnan
          porthos too

dartagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the
staircase of the tower above him

int  priests residence  a stairway  day

four people are moving up a winding stairway three are
women bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses the fourth
is porthos the former musketeer now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth  he and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs the women towing porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock  porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle

                     porthos
          ah ha  here we are  aramis
          porthos is here

they reach a doorway  porthos kicks it open staggers back
and begins shoving the women inside

int  a priests apartment  day

the first of the partying women tumbles inside she stops
short at what she sees  the second and third stumble in
after her and they too stop dead still sobered by what they
see  then with a great roar porthos barrels in

                     porthos
          aaaaaaaramis  porthos is 

he stops dead in his tracks  from the pov of porthos and the
women we see aramis  always the most theological of the
musketeers and ruthlessly brilliant he is still lean and
powerful  and still handsome or at least he would be but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer

                     porthos
          sorry my dears  you would have
          enjoyed it too  hes hung like a
          donkey

                     wench 1
          so are you

                     porthos
          really  i havent been able to see
          it for fifteen years  go on now
          leave his holiness alone  ill
          bring you back tomorrow when hes in
          a better mood

he whacks their bottoms herding them out then swaggers to
aramis heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend

                     porthos
          please revel with me aramis i need
          my spirits lifted  im old im
          weak my strength is gone 

                     aramis
          be quiet you fat fool  cant you
          see im praying

                     porthos
          i just said youre praying  are you
          deaf too  i know youre blind
          because if you had seen the tits
          that just walked out of here youd
          have tears in your eyes

                     aramis
               trying to ignore him
          there are more important things than
          tits

                     porthos
          really  if you can name me one
          thing one single thing that is
          more sublime than the feel of a
          plump pink nipple between my lips
          i will buy you a new cathedral

aramis is still trying to pray but rises to the bait

                     aramis
          forgiveness

                     porthos
          forgiveness

as if in reply porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart

                     porthos
               beat
          forgive me

aramis fingers clamp down on the rosary beads as he tries
to keep praying

                     porthos
          am i forgiven

aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend  porthos reels
backwards landing in a chair

                     porthos
          i observe your forgiveness isnt
          sweeter than a plump nipple

                     aramis
          cant you see im praying
          goddammit

porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls
aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it porthos
picks up the whole table  just as dartagnan enters

                     porthos and aramis
          dartagnan

porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs dartagnan

                     porthos
          how are you you skinny little pup

aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment

                     aramis
          a simple theological discussion

                     dartagnan
          aramis  the king wishes to see
          you

                     aramis
          still you serve him loyally 
          though people hurl rotten eggs at
          his royal emblem

aramis lifts dartagnans cloak as evidence  near its hem
sure enough is the remnant of a broken egg

                     dartagnan
          i see your mind is sharp as ever
          the king said right away  cut
          deep and hard my friends

                     porthos
          deep and hard dartagnan

dartagnan clasps porthos hand then that of aramis and
leaves as porthos shakes his head

                     porthos
          we were all musketeers once eh  oh
          i forgot  for the poor the ones
          you were praying for

he hands a purse to aramis  surprised even touched aramis
reaches for it  just as he takes the money porthos throws a
haymaker but aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks
suddenly the two old warriors are circling again

                     porthos
          i wonder how athos is doing

int  a small house  day

athos stands at the dressing table in a modest room dressed
in a dark plain coat he too is a former musketeer  gray
haired and handsome intensely intelligent with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion  he opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism he finds what hes
looking for just as his son raoul enters  raoul is in his
midtwenties he wears the uniform of a soldier in the french
army  he is nervous pacing looking at every angle in the
mirror

                     raoul
          do i look all right

                     athos
          none of the ladies will be able to
          take their eyes off you

                     raoul
          i care only about michelle  should
          i ask her when we first arrive
          or or when were leaving  i
          could ask her in the carriage  but
          it is more romantic at the palace
          i get so confused

                     athos
          perhaps this will help

he hands raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box

                     raoul
          mothers ring  i cant take this

                     athos
          she died giving you to me  and i
          want to die knowing it is one the
          finger of the women my son loves

they embrace  athos eyes mist but he smiles

                     athos
          now go and bring back your fiance

establishing  the royal palace  day

the palace glows golden in the parisian sunshine  carriages
deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens

ext  the royal palace  gardens  day

attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of louis xivs france the men like peacocks the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms  they laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other  but all eyes are on the
doorway through which the king is about to come

just beyond that palace doorway

king louis the fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors  he is twentytwo and would be quite
handsome except for the total selfabsorption  hes
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors pierre and claude try to speak with him

                     pierre
          your majesty i know it is a a
          festive time but before 

                     king louis
          the blue sash  no the burgundy

                     pierre
           before the party begins 

                     king louis
          the party has already begun  so
          why are you delaying me

                     pierre
          we do not wish to delay you
          majesty but as your advisors we
          feel it is our  our 

                     claude
           our duty

                     pierre
          yes  it is our duty to let you
          know there are riots in paris

                     louis
          riots  my people live in the
          worlds most beautiful city their
          king has the grandest palaces on
          earth  why should they feel
          anything but pride and contentment

                     pierre
          well yes of course majesty and
          im sure they are content except
          that well they are starving

                     louis
          sometimes the poor do grow hungry
          but why would they riot about it

as he says this a replica of the matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs

                     pierre
          majesty we have more than enough
          food set aside for your birthday
          celebration next week  if we
          distributed some of that we would
          have time to gather more before 

                     louis
          aramis  i have been expecting you
               to the tailors
          we are satisfied that will do

the tailors and advisors withdraw as aramis  still in his
simple priests robe  strides forward and bows to the kind

                     aramis
          your birthday celebration your
          majesty

                     louis
          next week  this is a mere garden
          party  and i wish to join it so i
          will be brief  i am experiencing
          resistance from the jesuits

                     aramis
          well perhaps you should speak
          with them your majesty

                     louis
          i have demanded it  and common
          priests present themselves  can you
          imagine the arrogance  common
          jesuit priests try to act as my
          equals and they refuse to reveal
          the names of anyone else in their
          order  no one can keep secrets like
          the jesuits can and the identity of
          their leader is the darkest secret
          they hold  even the pope himself
          does not know who leads the jesuit
          order in france  he suspects the
          governor general of jesuits whoever
          he is is angling to become pope
          himself

                     aramis
          how can i serve you in this

                     louis
          perhaps you can find out who this
          secret leader of the jesuits is
          you are now a priest but you were
          once a musketeer serving the throne
          of france a throne ordained of god
          can you accept this mission and
          keep it private

                     aramis
          if i find out the identity of this
          jesuit rebel  i will kill both him
          and the man who told me

                     louis
          once a musketeer always a
          musketeer eh

aramis bows and louis turns back to his mirror  there are
mirrors everywhere in his palace and he loves his
reflection adorned as he is all in golden cloth like fabric
from the sun  aramis leaves and the advisors return

                     louis
          ah yes the riots  we have food
          stocks on the wharves right now no

                     pierre
          that food has spoiled  that is why
          it was not shipped to the army

                     louis
          exactly why it should be given away

                     pierre
          what an excellent idea your
          majesty

ext  palace gardens  day

among the guests are raoul and michelle a stunningly
beautiful young woman  michelle is awed by the richness all
around them while raoul sees only her  he holds the ring

                     michelle
          isnt it glorious

                     raoul
          michelle

but just as he starts to speak trumpets blast and the king
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens the
party goers give him a rousing ovation  raoul returns the
ring to his jacket to wait for another moment

everyone watches the king who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants who howl at the kings
witticisms  then louis catches sight of raoul and michelle
and lowers his voice to his friends

                     louis
          who is that

                     friend 1
          raoul son of athos

                     louis
          not the soldier you idiot

                     friend 2
          her name is michelle

the king is transfixed

dartagnan

is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young musketeers
directing them to their positions around the gardens like
secret service agents protecting a president  he leaves
them and quickly moves to the king

                     dartagnan
          your majesty

                     louis
          what is it dartagnan  assassins
          falling from the sky now

the sycophants laugh loudly

                     dartagnan
          the plans for use of the maze were
          not disclosed to me

                     louis
          i decided it this morning

                     dartagnan
          then you must allow me to stay close
          to you so that 

                     louis
          i am king dartagnan  i will
          change my mind as i wish and i will
          enjoy my banquet as i wish

                     dartagnan
          but i deployed the royal guards
          according to your previous 

                     louis
          let us play a game dartagnan let
          us pretend i am king and you are
          captain of my musketeers  let us
          behave as if my wish is law  and my
          wish is to enjoy this party

dartagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle
dartagnan retreats then looks back to louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye
dartagnan recognizes raoul son of his friend athos

raoul and michelle

as the guests mix and mingle raoul tries again

                     raoul
          michelle i ever since i returned
          ive been wanting to speak with you
          about about 

a gaunt servant interrupts presenting a tray of delicacies

                     servant
          monsieur mademoiselle

                     raoul
          no  thank you  michelle i 

they are interrupted by the squeal of a piglet squirming in
the hands of the kings dwarf who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests

                     louis
          it pleases us to announce an
          entertainment for our guests  a
          contest of agility and cunning

he takes the pig from his dwarf the pig is clean and
perfumed a colorful fake horn tied onto its head

                     louis
          behold our unicorn  whichever of
          our guests captures the unicorn
          shall win its treasure

with this announcement the king produces a diamond the size
of a pecan suspended from a ribbon the guests gasp at its
richness  the king ties the diamond around the pigs neck

raoul and michelle

michelle is amazed at this

                     michelle
          i have never seen a diamond so
          large

it almost makes raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand

                     louis
          into the maze  all of you
          disperse i command you

the dwarf releases the pig poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge the critter skitters as only a pig can eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests

the pig chase is a merry melee as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion  louis climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze  from his perch he
looks down on all the action and calls encouragement

                     louis
          are you men or mice

michelle squeals as the pig scurries by and raoul dives for
it  he almost has the pig then it kicks free

                     raoul
          the pendant will be yours

with that he races after the pig

michelle tries to follow this way that way through the
maze  then she stops face to face with the king entering
through a gate hidden in one of the mazes dead corners

                     louis
          michelle isnt it

speechless she nods

                     louis
          i would have said it was impossible
          but i believe the excitement of the
          chase has made you even more
          beautiful

                     michelle
          sire i 

                     louis
          you blush  you do not wish to be
          beautiful to your king

her eyes go still she understands what is happening

from behind the gate we see dartagnan watching as louis
tries to seduce the young woman  even as dartagnan watches
the pig comes rooting through the hedge with a deft movement
dartagnan catches the animals leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was  the pig is quiet and
comfortable in dartagnans hands

dartagnan watches as the king approaches michelle and she
allows him to touch her cheek  the king leans to kiss her
michelle does not move

whheeekkkk  the pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running right at louis feet it sets him dancing

the spell of the kings royal attention is shattered as the
pig scrambles away michelle backs away

                     louis
          wait  michelle i 

too late he sees the shadow of the man looming above him
leaping down onto him from the observation platform  it is
the servant who offered the tray to raoul and michelle he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the kings throat

the king is helpless frozen  the assassin leaps falling
toward the king and is impaled on the sword of dartagnan
springing through the gate to save his king

michelle screams the king gasps and the assassin drops
mortally wounded  they stare down at him now the wouldbe
assassin gurgles words through his agony

                     assassin
          feed your people

party guests having heard michelle scream are running in to
find them  michelle rushes off to find raoul several
people are coming up

                     assassin
          your people starve  feed 

the king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the
throat of the dying man to stop these offensive words  the
king looks at his stunned subjects

                     louis
          a pitiful madman nothing more
          come let us continue our chase
          where is our unicorn

the king prances away  it takes the guests a moment but
they know that only gaiety will please their king and off
they go again laughing as if nothing happened

dartagnan stands still as the young musketeers under his
command come rushing up with swords drawn

                     young musketeer
          captain

seeing the dead assassin their eyes fill with admiration

                     young musketeer
          you are the best 

dartagnan cant even listen with a last glance at the king
he turns quickly and walks away

int  fortress prison

the man in the iron mask sits on the floor  a key rattles in
the lock and his keeper shuffles in carrying food

                     keeper
          food moron

                     man in the iron mask
          thank you keeper

not watching what hes doing the bulbous keeper trips on
something and stumbles dropping the food  the prisoner
jumps to his feet concerned

                     keeper
          look what youve done

he picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner

                     man in the iron mask
          im sorry keeper

the keeper looks for what he tripped on  a worn bible  he
snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle

                     man in the iron mask
          no keeper its my only book

hearing the pleading in the prisoners voice the keeper
looks squarely at him  and rips out the pages

                     man in the iron mask
          what number did you tear out

                     keeper
          eh

                     man in the iron mask
          what number on the first page

                     keeper
           twothirtyseven

                     man in the iron mask
          twothirtyseven   and the
          descendants of japeth are these
          obediah zebulon hezekiah

as the prisoner rattles off the names of biblical genealogy
the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand

                     keeper
          youve memorized

                     man in the iron mask
          what was the end page

as the keeper is speechless the prisoner looks for himself

                     man in the iron mask
          sixtwoone   though i speak
          with the tongues of men and angels
          and have not love i am but a
          clanging cymbal or 

the keeper staggers in shock the prisoner bubbles with joy

                     man in the iron mask
          were playing keeper  a game
          take another page any page  keeper
          and i are playing a game

and the prisoner takes the keepers fat hands in his own and
begins to dance and sing

                     man in the iron mask
          a game a game were playing a 

the keepers left arm goes rigid and he clutches his chest
with his right hand he drops upon the stone floor

                     man in the iron mask
          keeper

the prisoner approaches the jailer the man is stoned dead

                     man in the iron mask
          no no  keeper please you
          cannot die  youre my only friend

the prisoner tries to wipe his eyes but he cant get at
them inside the mask  he edges to the open door

                     man in the iron mask
          help  someone  keeper is dead

he slumps down beside the open door and weeps

int  palace  dartagnans room  evening

dartagnans room is spartan  a cot and weapons laid on a
plain table  it has a single small window and dartagnan
stands at it now looking out into the palace garden below

the guests have all gone home the party pavilions have been
cleared away  and now in the blue dusk a solitary lady
walks  she is anne of austria the queen mother the lady we
saw in the opening

now twenty years later she is a slim frail figure  her
clothes are drab and simple like the dress of mourning she
walks in silence watched at a distance by nun attendants

she glances up and sees dartagnans form in the window
when he sees her looking he pulls away from the window

int  palace corridor  evening

dartagnans room is along the same corridor as the royal
apartments  dartagnan sits at the small table going over
paperwork  through his open door he sees that anne and her
attendants are filing along in the corridor and he rivets
his eyes back to his work

in the corridor

anne reaches the door to her apartment and looks back to
where dartagnans door is open

int  dartagnans room

the queen mothers attendant appears at dartagnans door

                     attendant
          she wishes a word with you

int  the corridor

dartagnan approaches the queen mother and bows

                     dartagnan
          mlady

                     anne
          i understand you saved my sons life
          today

                     dartagnan
          god smiled upon us

                     anne
          and you were not hurt

                     dartagnan
          no mlady

                     anne
          that is good

without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad
face she enters her room

int  dartagnans room  evening

dartagnan returns to his room just as a young lieutenant of
musketeers andre arrives with two of the royal guards

                     lieutenant
          duty lists of the day captain

                     dartagnan
          thank you andre

they hand him the list and salute again to leave

                     dartagnan
          wait  there is an entry here 
          messenger sent by king to residence
          of mademoiselle michelle beaufort
          why was that

the young musketeers try not to smirk

                     lieutenant
          well captain

int  athos apartment  night

athos sits alone playing a haunting melody on a violin  it
is a sad tune played with feeling he stops as he hears a
knock at his door and opens it to 

                     athos
          dartagnan

                     dartagnan
          athos my friend

they embrace with deep affection  friends who have shared
each others darkest times

                     dartagnan
          its been too long

                     athos
          life is too long  except when we
          have our friends  look at you
          youre still a boy  sit sit  ill
          open a bottle of wine

dartagnan takes one of the wooden chairs by the meager
fire  the whole place is modest at best

                     dartagnan
          thanks but not for me

                     athos
          you cant drink with a friend you
          havent seen in months

                     dartagnan
          i have ordered a drill of the royal
          guard for midnight and must be
          clearheaded for it

                     athos
          midnight  mon dieu  driving the
          youngsters hard eh

                     dartagnan
          they must stay sharp  there was an
          attempt on the kings life today

                     athos
          another  how many times have you
          saved his life in this year alone
          three  four

                     dartagnan
          i heard your playing

                     athos
          i was feeling sorry for myself
          raoul is getting married he
          proposed today  i love that boy
          beyond all measure ive spent
          everything i own to give him
          education and opportunity  now he
          has complete happiness and i mope

a cloud passes dartagnans face he has something to tell
athos

                     dartagnan
          athos

but whatever it is that dartagnan wants to say is
interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs  as
athos face brightened with the arrival of dartagnan now it
glows as he jumps up to welcome his son

                     athos
          that must be raoul  raoul  look
          dartagnans come to visit
          whats wrong  you look awful

                     raoul
          michelle she  the king has
          invited her to come live in the
          palace

athos is stunned dartagnan witnesses this with agony

                     athos
          but  are you sure

                     raoul
          we were at her door  i was just
          taking the ring from my pocket for
          the third time today when a young
          musketeer brought the invitation for
          her to become a ladyinwaiting for
          the queen mother

                     athos
          michelle cannot possibly accept

                     raoul
          she cannot possibly refuse  her
          family is poor they have even less
          money than we do  and along with
          the invitation the king sent the
          diamond pendant from the piglet

                     athos
          piglet    what are you  

                     raoul
          never mind papa it doesnt matter
          now  she loved me once  i want to
          die remembering that

                     athos
          die  what

                     raoul
          i have rejoined the army and asked
          to resume my commission at the head
          of the troops of general fromberge

                     athos
          fromberge  at the front  no

                     raoul
          it is already done  i have just
          stopped at mothers grave to say
          goodbye before coming to tell you

                     athos
          raoul no you cannot do this  no
          matter how your heart is broken 

but raoul stops him with an embrace

                     raoul
          goodbye father  i am sorry

                     athos
          raoul 

raoul breaks away and runs from the room  athos so joyful
moments before holds his head as if his brain might erupt

                     athos
          this cannot be  everyone knows the
          queen mother is a recluse and the
          ladiesinwaiting are but
          mistresses for the king

                     dartagnan
          if the young woman truly loves
          raoul 

                     athos
          shes a woman dartagnan  from a
          poor family  you may still be young
          enough to believe love conquers
          everything but i am old and hard
          and ive seen too much  even when
          kings are hunchbacks they have any
          woman they desire because power
          seduces even more than love

dartagnan is silent and even ashamed  athos realizes 

                     athos
          you knew this was happening  you
          knew and thats why you came

                     dartagnan
          i fear i know our king  i came to
          try to bring you hope

                     athos
          what hope is there  a wartime
          commission cannot be vacated except
          by the king and what chance is
          there of that  fromberge is on the
          battle line and raoul 

                     dartagnan
          i have dispatches a message to
          fromberge requesting that raoul be
          kept far from the fighting

                     athos
          raoul is everything to me

                     dartagnan
          i know

                     athos
          oh my friend

athos grips dartagnan in gratitude and desperate hope

                     dartagnan
          i will also speak with the king for
          he is surely unaware of the problems
          his invitation to mademoiselle
          beaufort has caused

                     athos
          you trust his character more than
          anyone else does

                     dartagnan
          raoul is hurrying to the front so i
          must hurry too

                     athos
          save my son dartagnan

they embrace once more and dartagnan leaves

ext  paris streets  day

magnificent public buildings  palaces and cathedrals 
grace the citys skyline but here in central paris all is
squalor  on a narrow filthy street beggars bother the
sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves

but interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon
and one of them lieutenant andre announces 

                     lieutenant
          here is food the gift of your
          loving king on his birthday  he
          gives to himself by giving to you
          in that he loves you so much

slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward  as
the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs  bread cabbages
tomatoes eggs  those nearest the wagon begin to jostle
each other and a large crowd gathers quickly

                     lieutenant
          no need to fight there is plenty
          for all

its looking like a holiday celebration until a ruffian
breaks open a loaf of bread and wrinkles his nose

                     ruffian
          this stuff stinks  it is rotting
          the king gives us rotten food

he hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers  other paupers
sniff the food and its stink set off an explosion of anger
they throw food at the soldiers then a paving stone
crashes through a shop window and suddenly its a riot with
the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace

dartagnan riding toward the palace himself turns a corner
and sees the mob coming  and they see him  the elegant
dashing musketeer on the prancing stallion

and at that moment two more soldiers race out of a side
street fleeing a similar mob coming from another direction
dartagnan understands everything at a glance the second
pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic

                     panicked soldier
          back toward the palace  we cannot
          hold them off  we will fire a
          volley into them

                     dartagnan
          no  run to the palace and close the
          gates  but do not fire

the two new soldiers race away dartagnan waits calmly on
his horse as the mobs from both directions converge on him

the mob seeing the dashing musketeer wait so confidently for
them slow up but the ruffian urges them on

                     ruffian
          come on  to the palace

dartagnan sits calmly in their way  he doesnt even draw
his sword though members of the mob grab the reins of his
horse  some of the mob recognize him and murmur

                     mob
          its dartagnan  le generale de
          musketeers

the mob hesitates  for the name dartagnan means heroism
and patriotism to all of them

                     ruffian
          one musketeer cant stop us

                     dartagnan
          stop you  you are frenchmen are
          you not  i am one of you

                     ruffian
          the king is a frenchman but he is
          not one of us

                     dartagnan
          citizens of paris  give ear to me

                     ruffian
          well give you their ears

with that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it
to the ear of the young lieutenant who is already bloody from
being dragged through the street

                     dartagnan
          wait  and listen  i beg you

                     rioter
          they give us garbage not fit for
          rats  they think we are garbage

with that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at
dartagnan who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement
he cuts the vegetable from the air

the display of expertise is startling  someone else throws a
head of lettuce dartagnan slices it in half and as the
pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword

                     dartagnan
          im on my way to a salad  doesnt
          anybody have any endive

the mob laughs at this panache and the amazing display of
swordsmanship that lies behind it  someone tosses more
lettuce and dartagnan divides and skewers this one as well
this time the crowd applauds

                     dartagnan
          a tomato

can he do it  someone fires a tomato right at his head and
sure enough dartagnan spears it  then with a victorious
flourish he takes a bite of it  his face contorts with the
taste and he spits the pieces out the crowd is hushed

                     dartagnan
          you are right  it is rotten  i
          will speak to the king myself  you
          have my word

the mob is completely won over by dartagnan the ruffian
angry that his riot is fizzling raises his knife again over
the soldiers but now the point of dartagnans sword flicks
to the ruffians neck

                     dartagnan
          and you will release those men 
          for they serve france and you

                     rioters
          three cheers for dartagnan
          hurrah  hurrah

the soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart
now stand and look at dartagnan in gratitude and awe  the
mob has forgotten them they see only dartagnan as he rakes
his blade clean returns it to its scabbard reins his horse
around and slowly rides away escorting the soldiers back
toward the palace

int  palace  night

dartagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal
apartments  as he reaches the door to the kings rooms he
finds a knot of royal advisors  among them pierre and
claude  gathered outside the kings door

                     claude
          we already know about the riots

                     dartagnan
          does he know

                     pierre
          we will tell him when it is

                     claude
          convenient

blocked by the advisors dartagnan leaves them turning down
one hallway and then another he reaches the hall of mirrors
and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner the
mirror becomes a door revealing a secret passage within the
walls  dartagnan steps through and the portal closes again
leaving no trace of its existence

int  palace  bedroom  night

within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen
foot ceiling the king is making love the young woman lying
beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere

                     young woman
          oh yes  so good  ooo wonderful
          marvelous  fantas 

louis climaxes with a grunt  she tries to sound pleased

                     young woman
          oh louis that was incredible  it
          was better than ever before  it 

                     louis
          im hungry

he hops up throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold

                     young woman
          i will have food brought

                     louis
          i like to eat alone

he moves to what appears to be a wardrobe standing against
the far wall and opens its door revealing a secret
staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace

                     louis
          by the way youll be moving
          tomorrow

leaving the girl without another word he moves down the
concealed stairs

int  the kings bedchamber  night

louis reaches the bottom of the stairs disguised behind a
similar wardrobe in his own bedroom  he steps out  and is
startled as the lifesize portrait of louis xiii on the other
side of the room opens to admit dartagnan

                     louis
          aaa  dartagnan  these passages
          were constructed for the kings
          security not so you could step from
          my fathers portrait and startle me
          to death

                     dartagnan
          it is for your security that i have
          come your majesty  for the
          security of your honor

                     louis
          i already know about the riots
          dartagnan i heard them out there
          whispering  some fool gave the
          order to distribute rotten food  i
          will deal with it tomorrow

                     dartagnan
          then there is one more thing of an
          even more personal nature

                     louis
          a personal nature

                     dartagnan
          mademoiselle michelle beaufort  she
          is betrothed to raoul the son of
          athos the musketeer who has served
          france through many tribulations

the king begins to eat from the food laid out on the table

                     louis
          betrothed  i think not

                     dartagnan
          in his mind anyway and soon enough
          in hers  she had written him many
          letters of love

the king pokes at his food

                     louis
          miss beaufort has accepted our
          invitation  by this we can only
          suppose that she wishes to come 
          as we wish her to be here

                     dartagnan
          your majesty has had many women 

                     louis
          that is my desire and my desire is
          what should concern you not the
          sentiments of some commoner

                     dartagnan
          it is not raouls heart alone that
          concerns me  it is yours  i know
          you find women compliant 
          especially the poorer ones like
          michelle  but do they love you  do
          you love them  what about a queen
          to love  a son of your own

                     louis
          what quaint notions dartagnan
          but they contradict my father who
          picked his queen when he was old
          and only then to bear me

                     dartagnan
          there is more to love than he knew
          or that you know

                     louis
          you dare criticize my father  or
          lecture me

                     dartagnan
          not criticize  plead  love  love
          your people and you will not bear
          to see them hungry  love women and
          they will love you  love yourself
          and 

                     louis
          that is enough  you are a good
          servant dartagnan but you forget
          your place

                     dartagnan
          at least help raoul

                     louis
          silence  i order you

                     dartagnan
          order fromberge to keep him in
          safety  it is the least you can do
          to protect your own honor

                     louis
          i will consider it  now leave me

                     dartagnan
          thank you your majesty

dartagnan bows steps to the lifesize portrait of louis
xiii touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the
secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open

                                                  cut to

close on pierres face

he is sweating exceptionally pale as he tries to project
his voice past a huge lump in his throat

                     pierre
           and i only say that the
          rotten food was all my fault
          and i take full responsibility
          and beg the forgiveness of you all

he steps back having accomplished something terrifically
difficult and glances toward

the king

who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand whispering
quietly

                     louis
          well done pierre  it will be good
          for your soul that you have taken
          responsibility for your errors  and
          dont worry i will look after your
          family

pierre can only nod he takes two steps kneels crosses
himself and places his head between two upright rails of

the guillotine

the king pierre and other attendants are standing on a
platform before a crowd of parisians  the blade drops
pierres head hits the basket the crowd cheers

the king raises his hands to quiet the crowd

                     louis
          do not rejoice  but know that your
          king does not tolerate blunders that
          hurt his beloved people  more food
          is on its way and my advisors tell
          me the new harvests are sure to be
          bountiful

he shoots a glance at his advisors and they are pale from
the display theyve just witnessed

                     louis
          and i have new joys to announce to
          you  today we decree a fresh glory
          for paris and for all of france
          the laying of the foundations to
          expand versailles and make it truly
          a palace of the sun

the advisors all applaud furiously but from the crowd there
is almost no reaction at all the triple ranks of soldiers
surrounding the square discourage any protest and as the
king leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away

near the platform

aramis watching the crowd disperse hears behind him 

                     voice
          aramis

aramis turns to see the king who moves up alone

                     aramis
          your majesty

                     louis
          how goes that favor i asked of you

                     aramis
          i grow closer to my target your
          majesty

                     louis
          you bring me the heart of the jesuit
          general and you will have a palace
          of your own

the king moves away followed by his fawning advisors

int  the favorite mistress palace rooms  day

a young musketeer ushers michelle into the palace bedroom
previously occupied by the kings last mistress  the
musketeer leaves her alone frozen in the center of the room
awed by the opulence  her eyes play over the details

 the handcarved richly upholstered furniture beneath her
   fingertips

 the carved figures of cherubic angels gleaming with gold
   upon the posts of the bed

 the murals on the walls and ceiling

her reverie is interrupted by a handmaiden who bustles in
carrying a magnificent dress

                     handmaiden
          after your bath put on this it is
          the kings favorite color  that
          letter on the desk came here for you
          this morning

she tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone  left alone
michelle lifts the letter and recognizes the writing

                     michelle
          raoul

she opens the letter and reads quickly

                     michelle
          the army  oh raoul dont despair
          i will always be faithful

she interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous
dress  she looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment
and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed

they depict naked gods and goddesses in olympian orgies

                                                  cut to

close  steaming water poured into a tub

the handmaiden has prepared a 17th century bathtub for
michelle and now retires

                     handmaiden
          if you need me further just ring

as the handmaiden leaves exiting frame we push in on one of
the murals on the wall  the eye of one of the figures there
is no longer the painted eye it was before but is a real
human eye disguised by the mural

the king in the secret passageway

is spying on michelle

the kings pov

as michelle undresses and steps into the bath  louis catches
tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy
water and it stokes his desire

int  palace  michelles new room  day

michelle stands before the mirror staring at herself
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress  she stares for a
long time surprised at her own beauty

she reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out blotting it
around her neck perfuming herself with its fragrance  she
looks into the mirror at her eyes in guilt for what she
is already feeling she lifts raouls letter to read it
again  then she gasps  the king stands right before her

                     michelle
          sire  i  how did you 

                     louis
          how did i get in  youre new here
          and will soon learn many secrets
          what is that

                     michelle
           nothing

                     louis
          a letter  may i see

he takes the letter she has no resistance against him  the
king reads his eyes hardening suddenly but then he smiles

                     louis
          from raoul  he urges you to guard
          your honor  as if it could be in
          any danger from your king

                     michelle
          raoul is in love

                     louis
          enough of this our dinner waits

tossing the letter aside he offers her his arm  she takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room

int  palace  the hall of mirrors

the hall is alive with glorious light fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections
musicians line the length of the hall and when louis and
michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past  michelle is speechless as louis
smiles at her awed innocence

int  royal dining room  night

louis leads michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies  set for just two

the dinner

louis and michelle sit opposite each other attended by a
dozen servants  michelle stares at her plate

                     louis
          the food doesnt please you

                     michelle
          its lovely  its just

                     louis
          this is more than you are used to
          your mother is a seamstress your
          father is dead  you have three
          younger sisters two of whom suffer
          from consumption  dont look so
          surprised kings know such things

                     michelle
          i we are humble people

                     louis
          wait no  do not be ashamed  the
          straits of your family need not be
          permanent  it is a simple matter to
          have them brought to one of my
          country estates where they may have
          fine meals and physicians to look
          after them

                     michelle
          you would do that your majesty

                     louis
          my dear ive already done it

she rushes to him and throws herself at his knees weeping in
gratitude  louis smiles as if embarrassed

                     louis
          please darling that isnt
          necessary  we are friends now
          mademoiselle needs wine

a servant quickly approaches with wine the goblet at
michelles place is quite large and he pours it full

int  michelles bedroom  night

louis leads michelle back to her room shes a bit unsteady
from the wine but she grows alert as she notices him closing
the door behind her  he stares into her eyes

                     louis
          you are beautiful  you know you
          are

                     michelle
          sire i 

                     louis
          if you dont want to be so
          appealing why did you touch the
          rose to your skin  where was it
          here

he touches his lips to her throat  she gasps but then pulls
away  she glances at the letter on the writing table

                     louis
          what is it  raoul  if he really
          loved you he would have proposed
          marriage  he didnt did he

he sees her hesitation and uncertainty  hes smooth gentle

                     louis
          you have never known love until you
          have known the love of a king

he kisses her for a moment she seems frozen and then she
yields  never having doubted that she would  louis pulls
the gown from her shoulders  she doesnt resist

int  the fortress prison

the old jailer carrying a torch that barely pushes back the
darkness leads another guard up the winding stairs

                     jailer
          its a jolt at first so brace
          yourself

int  cell of the man in the iron mask

the man in the iron mask lifts his head as a key rattles into
his door  the door opens admitting his old jailer and a
new keeper  the new keeper is just a younger version of the
old one  greasy fat and cruel

                     new keeper
          ugh  he looks orrible

the man in the iron mask rises and takes a step forward the
new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly

                     new keeper
          stay back

                     man in the iron mask
          i frighten you  its okay  keeper
          was scared of me too at first

                     new keeper
          scared

the new keeper steps forward and clubs the man in the iron
mask in the shoulder then kicks him as he falls

                     new keeper
          scared of you  not me  ill kill
          him if he gets near me

the new keeper strides out  the man in the iron mask pulls
himself to his knees his eyes visible through the slits of
the mask look sadly at the old jailer

                     man in the iron mask
          i miss keeper  i miss him so much

                     jailer
          moron

the jailer leaves the cell locking the door behind him

int  a battlefield command tent

raoul has just received orders from general fromberge who
sits at a map table raoul salutes and follows a young staff
officer from the tent  as raoul leaves the general
withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter 
parchment with blue and gold seals  fromberge touches the
edge of the parchment to the candle and burns the letter

ext  trench  darkness

two men move along a deep trench the siege works of 17th
century siege warfare  one of the men is raoul carrying a
musket in his new uniform he looks out of place among the
dirty battle weary men they pass  he is following the staff
officer who is no older than himself but whose eyes are
already dead while raouls are wide and wild

the trench is deep as a grave by crouching both men keep
their heads below the surrounding ground  thick smoke rolls
over their heads we cant tell if it is day or night  from
all around come sounds of battle with the sporadic fire of
muskets and the rumble of cannons officers shout orders in
the distance wounded men nearby whimper for water and the
officer leads raoul by them as if they did not exist

the young staff officer stops at a bend in the trench

                     staff officer
          here

without another word he goes back the way he came  raoul
grips his musket and looks around him he finds himself among
several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the
trench  he has little time to wonder what will happen next
a horn trumpets close by and with a shout the french
soldiers clamber out of their breastworks

for an instant raoul hesitates in pure terror then joins
the charge with a shout of his own 

                     raoul
          micheeelllll 

on the stone wall looming above the french soldiers orange
blossoms of fire  the muzzle flash of primitive cannons 
penetrate the smoke and the ground at raouls feet explodes
hurling him backwards  he covered barely a few feet and
falls almost exactly where he started

dead

                                                  cut to

close  the door of athos rooms  day

a gloved hand raps on the door  athos opens it to a military
messenger who shoves at him a single sheet of paper rolled
and tied with ribbon

int  athos room  night

the message slams onto the table as athos staggers upon it
his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief

int  dartagnans room  day

dartagnan is working at his desk as the lieutenant enters

                     lieutenant
          sir a casualty report came

dartagnan looks at the paper the lieutenant hands him

                     dartagnan
          no no no

he sags for a moment then grabs his cloak and sword

int ext  musketeers gate of the palace  day

the musketeers gate is close to the stables where the
musketeers train and keep their horses  dartagnan hurries
from the palace and snaps an order

                     dartagnan
          saddle my horse

the grooms jump to work several young musketeers nearby stop
their training noticing their captains agitation

                     dartagnan
          hurry 

but then dartagnan sees athos coming riding furiously
through the musketeers gate  dartagnan steps out to meet
him as athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle

                     dartagnan
          athos my friend 

athos marches to the palace door dartagnan cuts him off

                     dartagnan
          athos please

                     athos
          get out of my way

                     dartagnan
               grabbing him
          athos i beg you 

athos punches dartagnan with furious strength knocking him
aside  the young musketeers reach for their weapons but
dartagnan is up quickly throwing himself in front of athos
again blocking the doorway into the palace

                     dartagnan
          where are you going

                     athos
          to kill the king

at this the swords of the young musketeers sing from their
scabbards  athos wears a sword but he has not drawn it

                     dartagnan
          athos  i know life means nothing to
          you at this moment but i will not
          let you kill yourself

                     athos
          the king killed my son

                     dartagnan
          the cannons killed raoul  the
          cannons and love  but not the king

a young musketeer steps up

                     young musketeer
          ill kill the old man for you
          captain if you dont wish to 

athos spins striking like a rattlesnake his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
musketeers ear  he flicks anothers sword from his grasp
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third shoving him back

                     athos
          come on  all of you

dartagnan tackles athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay  for a moment athos bellows in rage 

                     athos
          coward  fight me  fight me

emotion spills up into athos throat and he begins to sob

                     athos
          he killed my son dartagnan  he
          killed my son

dartagnan dying inside still grips athos  athos grows
quiet and the young musketeers drift closer

                     dartagnan
          get back all of you

dartagnan stands and athos rises still holding his sword
he looks at dartagnan a long beat then sheathes his sword
and turns to his horse  the young soldiers move to him

                     dartagnan
          let him go

athos mounts his horse and with a last glance back at
dartagnan he gallops away

int  kings bedchamber  day

the king has just climaxed in his lovemaking and lies spent
upon michelle  his rest is interrupted by a knock at his
door  the king scowls

                     louis
          what

                     voice
          your majesty it is andre

louis groans and pulls on a robe  michelle whispers 

                     michelle
          shall i leave

                     louis
          no you may wait behind the screen

michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as
louis goes to the door and admits the young lieutenant

behind the screen michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and
appraises her face she begins brushing her long hair  she
can hear the conversation

                     lieutenant
          i would not have disturbed you
          majesty but you ordered me to keep
          you informed 

                     louis
          yes yes go on

                     lieutenant
          athos the former musketeer has
          just fought with several of your
          guard at the musketeers gate

behind the screen michelle pauses at the mention of athos

                     louis
          did they kill him

                     lieutenant
          no  he cut an ear from one of the
          men no one else was hurt  captain
          dartagnan allowed him to leave
          athos was upset about the death of
          his son at the front

crash  from behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror
shattering as it drops to the floor  it startles the
lieutenant but the king goes on

                     louis
          who was athos seeking  tell me
          did he try to enter the palace

                     lieutenant
           he did  but captain dartagnan
          blocked his way

                     louis
          you may go lieutenant

the lieutenant moves back to the door

                     lieutenant
          do you want athos arrested your
          majesty

                     louis
          not by you  i will order dartagnan
          to do it

the lieutenant leaves and louis moves behind the screen to
see michelle stagger and grip the dressing table her bare
feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror yet she is
oblivious to the cuts  louis sees this and grabs her

                     louis
          my dear  the glass  

he pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her
cuddling her as she begins to shake

                     michelle
          did you know about raoul

                     louis
          i did not want to upset you  it was
          tragic  i did everything i could
          for him  i ordered him positioned
          in a spot of complete safety far
          from the fighting  but he
          disregarded my wishes and charged
          into danger

he cuddles her as she weeps

                     louis
          i will order a mass for his soul
          it will guarantee his place in
          heaven

                     michelle
          oh louis louis

she clings to him in her grief

ext  notre dame cathedral  day

the great cathedral rises next to the monastery where aramis
resides  we pan down and push in on the cobblestones between
the two structures as if penetrating to 

subterranean passages

aramis leads porthos through tunnels twisting descending

                     porthos
          aramis is this the way to hell

                     aramis
          hell may be our destination dear
          porthos but not this trip

they reach an iron door and move through it into

a gorgeous secret chapel

candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes  the place is
breathtaking

                     porthos
          where are we

                     aramis
          jesus of nazareth found the holy
          among the profane  if we are to
          have a place of private prayer
          where better than here beside the
          channels where the shit and the
          garbage run to the river

porthos notices niches in the walls he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse enclosed behind glass

                     porthos
          mother of god

                     aramis
          it is also a place of burial

                     porthos
          a tomb  were in a tomb

                     aramis
          catacombs  very holy

porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
 then jumps out of his skin as the door opens

                     porthos
          yaaaahhh

a hooded figure looking like the grim reaper enters

                     aramis
          relax you big fool its
          dartagnan

and sure enough the hooded figure whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk is dartagnan  aramis nods to the
monk who leaves quickly  before dartagnan can ask
anything porthos jumps again the back door has opened and
monks usher in athos who freezes as he sees dartagnan

                     aramis
          its all right  dartagnan was the
          one who warned us that hed been
          given an order for your arrest
          here you have sanctuary  does he
          not dartagnan

the escort monks disappear closing the chapel door so that
the four musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up athos and dartagnan opposite each other

                     aramis
          look at us  we are old men now  but
          once we were young  and when we saw
          injustice we fought it

                     dartagnan
          we have grown wiser with age  now
          we know that some problems cannot be
          settled with a sword

                     athos
          and some problems cannot be settled
          without one

                     aramis
          well here is the problem at hand
          the king has ordered me to discover
          the identity of the governor general
          of jesuits and kill him  as our
          english rivals have left the
          catholic church louis has struck on
          a plan to dominate the whole of
          europe by uniting church and state
          and making himself head of both  he
          has already picked the pope  only
          the jesuits who put god above
          throne or papacy stand in his way

                     porthos
          but  doesnt god ordain both pope
          and king

                     aramis
          so they tell us  but what are we to
          believe when the king is a tyrant
          and the church meant to stand for
          all those oppressed has become the
          tool of oppression  when no
          conscience is tolerated  no
          dissent no objection

                     porthos
          it is a weighty problem aramis 
          but perhaps you should leave it to
          this secret general of the jesuits
          whoever he might be

                     aramis
          easy to say but hard to do  for
          what i am trying to tell you is that
          i am the governor general of jesuits
          in france

a stunned silence

                     athos
          what do you propose to do

                     aramis
          replace the king

                     dartagnan
          i cannot hear this

                     porthos
          it cant be done

                     aramis
          it can  i know the way

                     athos
          i am with you

                     dartagnan
          no  stop 

                     aramis
          i will need you all  all for one
          one for all

                     dartagnan
               jumping up
          you  you cannot ask me to betray
          my king  i have sworn to him

                     athos
          it is honor you serve and when the
          king is dishonorable you are removed
          from your oath of honor

                     dartagnan
          an oath is an oath precisely because
          it cannot be removed

                     athos
          why do you follow him dartagnan
          i know you have put service above
          your own life but why does this
          king deserve such loyalty  he is a
          monster  he executes ministers for
          his own blunders with their
          families hostage so they take the
          blame  he has no honor

                     dartagnan
          no man is all bad or all good  i
          believe  i must believe  that
          louis can learn  and perhaps i can
          help him

athos leaps up from the table and glares at dartagnan

                     athos
          whatever the plan i am in it
          the next time we meet one of us
          will die

he storms out of the rear door of the chapel

                     aramis
          porthos see to athos wont you

porthos follows athos aramis and dartagnan are left alone

                     aramis
          i have heard many confessions
          dartagnan  but even if i were not
          a priest i could tell your heart
          has a secret weight and it is
          hurting you to carry it alone

                     dartagnan
          the secret i carry i cannot share
          not even with god

dartagnan moves to the door

                     dartagnan
          i cannot betray louis  i will
          defend him with my life

                     aramis
          i know  god go with you

dartagnan leaves aramis alone in the secret chapel

ext  the monastery  night

aramis leads athos and porthos out of the catacombs

                     aramis
          this way

they move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery  a
hooded jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows then
recognizes aramis and admits the trio to the monasterys
forge where more hooded jesuits are working in secret
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace

                     athos
          what are they doing

                     aramis
          making the key to the throne

                     porthos
          they are very large keys

one of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water  aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to athos and porthos

it is an iron mask

ext  a carriage  french countryside  night

the carriage rolls through the long sweep of the french
countryside traveling fast

int  the carriage  night

the three musketeers  aramis athos and porthos  have
been traveling for some time  porthos is asleep snoring

                     athos
          porthos sleeps and you plot  dont
          you think its time you told me what
          it is you are plotting

                     aramis
          soon enough  here we are

kicking porthos feet to wake him aramis opens the carriage
door and they step out

ext  french coast  night

lying just off the coast is the forbidden island where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore

                     athos
          the prison of belle sur

                     aramis
          come we have a boat waiting

as hooded jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them
athos and porthos glance at each other porthos shrugs

ext  among rocks at the beach  night

the guides lead the musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast
sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priests
garb at his feet is a long narrow bundle about the size of
a mummy with a rope tied at either end

the guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf
aramis throws off his cape and strips down almost naked
hes still fit and hard  with the guides helping him he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist

                     athos
          what is that

                     aramis
          a body

                     athos
          i see that is a body  but where did
          you get it

aramis ignores the question and the guides dress him in
priests garb  with the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to aramis waist it appears he is a very fat
priest the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of aramis as a wild reclusive monk

the sun is beginning to come up over the mountains

                     porthos
          he gets one day of confession each
          year  today is the day

                     athos
          who does

                     porthos
          best not to ask  shouldnt even
          talk about it

aramis steps onto the boat  the little priest who first
joined them gets in too along with a couple of rowers

                     athos
          what do we do now

                     porthos
          i dont know about you but i plan
          to wait here

the rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison

int  fortress prison  day

the pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of
the prison  the boat carrying aramis and the little priest
reaches the gate of the prison which reaches to the water
line  as aramis steps out guards meet them

                     head guard
          who is this then

the little priest remains in the boat slumped over  one
guard speaks to the little priest in italian and the little
priest seems barely able to left his head aramis answers for
him in italian and the guard translates 

                     guard
          he says hes the replacement

aramis rattles off more italian

                     guard
          he says it is only one day a month
          when the prisoner gets confession
          and the little one is too sick to
          move  the big one doesnt speak
          french either

                     head guard
          then lets get it done

the head guard gestures to let them pass

int  cell of the man in the iron mask

the prisoner has used the torn bible to make all sorts of
amazing origami invented from his own head  he looks up as
he hears the door open and sees aramis the priest

                     man in the iron mask
          my confession day  but where is the
          other one

aramis says something in latin  the first words of the
ceremony of absolution  as the guards lock the door behind
him and move off down the corridor

                     man in the iron mask
          i know you dont speak my language
           but is the other one all right
          please tell me he is not dead too
          or i will have lost everyone

aramis goes on mumbling latin mechanically for the sake of
the retreating guards  the man in the iron mask is desperate
for someone to talk to

                     man in the iron mask
          i tore my bible  or someone else
          did  but it was all right  let the
          words of my mouth and the
          meditations of my heart be
          acceptable in thy sight oh lord our
          god and my redeemer

aramis has stopped talking and stares transfixed at this
sight of the prisoner in the iron mask

                     man in the iron mask
          im sorry  youre never seen me
          before  i must frighten you

aramis puts his finger to his lips

                     man in the iron mask
          what are you doing  why do you 

aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole and whispers 

                     aramis
          i am a friend here to help you

aramis hurriedly removes his robes revealing the bundle

                     man in the iron mask
          what  

                     aramis
          it is an escape  to freedom

                     man in the iron mask
          freedom

he says it as if the concept is beyond him  aramis undoes
the bundle revealing the limp body

                     man in the iron mask
          wh   he is dead  who is he

                     aramis
          he is you

aramis uncovers the head of the body  it is covered in a
mask identical to the prisoners

int  prison corridor  cell

the guards are sharing a bottle of wine when they hear 

                     aramis
          hey  hey

                     guard
          what now

int  cell

the guards enter to find the man in the iron mask slumped on
the floor  aramis looking like the fat priest again stands
over him spouting italian as one guard translates 

                     guard
          he says he just fell stone dead as
          he was reading him the mass

                     head guard
          i never thought the bugger would
          last this long  but how could he
          just keel over and 

aramis rattles off more italian and suddenly the guard who
understands it stops examining the body and backs off

                     guard
          he says the prisoner has the fever
          just like the little priest does

                     head guard
          plague  they brought plague in
          here  get him out of here  now

aramis rattles off a protest in italian

                     guard
          no no last rites  get away

ext  prison  day

aramis climbs into the boat as he sits down his belly stirs
but the guards dont see it  they are using poles to push
the boat away into the sea

ext  the coastline  day

athos and porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore and
tucks in among the rocks  sheltered from the view from the
prison aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes

the prisoner dangles tied wrist and ankle from around
aramis neck

                     athos
          my god

athos porthos and the others gawk at the sight of the man
in the iron mask as aramis loosens the ropes  as they back
away from him he sees the sky  endless blue  and bright
he shields his eyes

                     aramis
          its all right  take your time

aramis helps him up and turn him slowly around to face

the fortressprison in the distance

the prisoners pov from within the mask  a vast vista  the
sky the sea and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all  the prisoner falls to his knees and weeps

                     aramis
          athos he needs a gentle hand

athos moves over hesitantly and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the man in the iron mask who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame

int  the prison  day

the guards are standing in the cell looking down at the body
now wearing the mask the man they think was their prisoner
the guards are quiet alone

                     guard 1
          you ever wonder who he was

                     guard 2
          no yes  but i never asked  and
          you better not either

they wrap the body still in its mask in a weighted sack

ext  prison  day

the prisons warden general stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body wrapped in canvas weighted with stones  as the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea the warden
writes a message on a royal scroll

               the unseen prisoner is dead

the warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger

ext  country estate  night

a carriage pulls into a country estate isolated among vast
woodlands silver in the moonlight  mysterious servants with
shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops

int  carriage  night

athos reaches for his sword but aramis stops his hand

                     aramis
          jesuits

ext  manor house courtyard  night

aramis emerges quickly whispering directives to the jesuits
athos helps the man in the iron mask from the carriage his
head shrouded by a cloak

aramis has a blacksmith waiting almost before he realizes it
the man in the iron mask finds his head placed on an anvil
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream

                     man in the iron mask
          no  please

                     aramis
          what is wrong  we only mean to free
          you from the mask

but the prisoner is shaking and athos understands why

                     athos
          prison was horrible but it was his
          home  hes been torn from it by
          strangers  hes frightened
          exhausted  and the mask is
          familiar  let him rest in it
          tonight and remove it tomorrow

                     aramis
          excellent athos  you have a keen
          sense of this man

                     athos
          his plight is obvious isnt it

athos angry with aramis arrogance and insensitivity leads
the man in the iron mask toward the house then aramis spots
porthos looking downcast

                     aramis
          and why are you so glum

                     porthos
          i expected action  there was no
          killing no fighting i was useless

in deep depression porthos climbs out and shuffles off
aramis sighs shakes his head and walks to the house

int  manor house bedroom  night

athos helps the man in the iron mask onto the bed the eyes
behind the slits in the mask are darting frightened

                     athos
          are you hungry

                     man in the iron mask
          just water

athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table
but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid
spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole

                     man in the iron mask
          this way

the prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a
drink then falls back to the pillow

                     man in the iron mask
          this place i once lived in a
          country house  i had guardians 
          an old man and woman  and tutors
          but no friends  then when i was
          twelve they came and took me to the
          prison

                     athos
          who came

                     man in the iron mask
          a man in black  i never saw his
          face  he took me to the cell  a
          blacksmith came and they put me into
          the mask  for days i shouted what
          have i done  why do you do this to
          me  but no one heard so i just
          stopped shouting

                     athos
          and you never knew why

                     prisoner
          i thought there is something
          about my face that men do not want
          to see  something that makes them
          cruel  but then i realized they
          were cruel even when i was wearing
          the mask  i knew there must be some
          other reason but i could not think
          what it was

                     athos
          what is your name

                     man in the iron mask
          the old man and woman called me
          phillippe

                     athos
          phillippe  rest now

athos moves to the door

                     man in the iron mask
          thank you for your kindness

athos nods pauses a moment and leaves

int  a dark apartment in paris  night

the lock rattles and the door swings open  dartagnan
enters lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room
it is athos apartment the one he visited earlier now he
finds it empty devoid of clues  he stands there alone

he turns to leave then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door  lifting his light he studies the portrait
athos aramis porthos and himself  four musketeers beat
friends in their prime  together then inseparable

                     dartagnan
          my friends where have you gone

he lowers the lantern and leaves

                                                  cut to

the message from the prison

has reached the court  gloved hands pass the message from
one advisor to another and finally to the king

int  palace  kings study  day

the king reads the message rerolls it thinks a moment and
hands the scroll to claude

                     louis
          take this to my mother

the message

is again passed this time into the hands of the queen
mothers eldest nunattendant and then into the hands of the
queen mother herself  the queen is in her private rooms and
for the first time we see her with her hair down  she
accepts the scroll opens it and reads

her eyes fill with pain grief guilt emotions she hides
turning away

                     nun
          mlady are you

                     anne
          please just go away

int  dartagnans room  night

dartagnan returns from his ride to athos place  he looks
down at the queens door  he checks the clock on the wall
it is a few minutes past nine  he enters his room moves to
the window and waits there to catch a glimpse of her

int  country manor house  front room  night

aramis is digging into a hearty meal while porthos only
stares at his plate

                     aramis
          see  there is plenty of food in the
          country  but the king keeps it
          going to the army instead of 

athos marches in all business

                     athos
          he is sleeping  now see here
          aramis its time you told us 

he breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto porthos plate her breasts jiggle below his
nose and she gives him a smile

                     porthos
          i have no appetite for food i am
          wasting away  say goodbye to
          porthos for he is gone  even women
          dont interest me now

the girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls who
seem fascinated with the roguish porthos their giggles and
winks make porthos even more morose he tells his friends

                     porthos
          i tell you a secret  i sleep with
          three women at once not because my
          appetite is so great but because
          now it take three to excite me

porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off aramis
sighs having heard all this before  athos sits down

                     athos
          who is he aramis

                     aramis
          tomorrow

                     athos
          tonight  right now  we steal a man
          from a royal prison we hide in a
          country chateau among an assortment
          of saints and sluts such as only you
          could provide and still you wish to
          tell me nothing

                     aramis
          you seek facts when it would be
          better to seek truth

                     athos
          you are not my priest aramis  you
          would not be even if i had one

                     aramis
          you are bitter athos  you are torn
          by grief not only for raoul but
          for dartagnan whom you love and
          now treat as an enemy

                     athos
          he who is not with us is against us

                     aramis
          those are the words of a broken
          spirit  my spirit is whole  i have
          trusted dartagnan with my deepest
          secrets and i will never believe
          he is my enemy

                     athos
          then you are a fool  a fool who
          has never lost a son  what gives
          you the right to judge me to play
          god with the lives of others  is it
          because you are so much holier than
          everyone else

                     aramis
          there is that of course  but
          mainly it is because i am so much
          smarter than everyone else

they are interrupted by porthos bloodcurdling scream

                     aramis
          porthos

he draws his sword and runs for the outside

ext  manor house  night

aramis and athos rush through the courtyard surrounded by
moonlight and trees confused about where porthos is  then
they hear bellowing scream of pain from the latrine

swords drawn they bang into the latrine to find porthos
just finishing urinating

                     porthos
          kidney rocks  it hurts when i pee
          it hurts when i shit  im just a
          fat old fart with nothing to live
          for any more  im going to hang
          myself as soon as im sober

they watch him shuffle toward the main house

int  the palace  the queen mothers room  night

anne paces in her room her hands trembling her beautiful
lips quivering with tortured emotion  with a sudden impulse
she bolts from her room through the outer room where her
attendants sit and into the corridor

                     nun
          mlady

the eldest nun follows her

ext  palace garden  night

anne rushes through the evening toward her little chapel in
the palace garden she is a tragic romantic sight her long
hair flying behind her as she runs

in his room dartagnan

has been standing at his window for his nightly glimpse of
anne  now he sees her not with her retinue of nuns but
running to her chapel clearly distraught

int ext  palace garden  garden chapel  night

anne reaches the door and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel  she staggers forward to the
altar  and falls to her knees there  the nuns and the old
priest seeing the queen mother so distraught stand silently
and file out leaving her in solitude

                     anne
          oh god i  forgive me

                     dartagnan
          mlady

she whirls to see him the sight of her face bursting with
emotions she has kept buried draws him nearer

                     dartagnan
          what  

                     anne
          no stay back  stay back

he freezes in his tracks she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow  hes desperate to move to her she
sees it on his face

                     anne
          dartagnan

her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away she
rushes into his arms  they clutch each other in an embrace
they have denied for many years  they kiss hungrily

                     dartagnan
          mlady if anyone sees it is
          death

                     anne
          if i dont kiss you i die anyway

                     dartagnan
          i cant bear to see you cry  what
          is wrong

                     anne
          nothing nothing

she draws back he tries to hold her  but the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen

                     anne
          nothing  this didnt happen  i
          must go back now

and just like that their moment is gone

ext  garden  night

dartagnan and anne move back to the palace in a stiff
procession she walking ahead he trailing like a proper
commoner several feet behind

int  palace corridor  night

they reach the queen mothers room dartagnan reaches to
open the door for her and she keeps her eyes lowered  but
before he can let her go he must whisper

                     dartagnan
          anne  i know i know that to
          love you is treason against france
          but not to love you is treason
          against my heart

                     anne
          then we will both die traitors
          dartagnan

with those whispered words hanging in the air she enters her
room  and dartagnan moves alone back to his

int  michelles bedroom  night

the king is trying to make love with michelle  but she
isnt responding  he stops exasperated

                     louis
          what is wrong

she says nothing  he tries kissing her again

                     louis
          what is wrong

she begins weeping uncontrollably and turns from him

                     michelle
          raoul oh raoul

                     louis

          a a good friend  and now he is
          dead and that is very sad but 

                     michelle
          well burn in hell  both of us

the king stands hes had enough of this

                     louis
          no my love  you will burn in hell
          for your sins  but i will not 
          for i am king  my position is
          ordained by god

he snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked
body and stalks to his stairway the embroidered coverlet
trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession
leaving her weeping he moves down into

int  the kings bedchamber  night

the king angrily stalks around his bedroom too agitated to
sleep  he grabs food from the table by the window and
starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops  he sees
something out the window it stops him dead cold

it is a man standing in the gardens wearing an iron mask

                     louis
          dartagnan  guards

ext  gardens  outside the kings window  night

the apparition ducks into the shadows

int  palace  dartagnans room  night

dartagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has
just happened when he hears the kings shouts of alarm

                     louis voice
          help

in an instant dartagnan is reacting snatching up his sword
and racing out into the corridor toward the kings room

int  corridor  night

the guards outside the kings room find the door latched from
within and they dont know what to do dartagnan running
up never slows down he crashes into the doors

int  the kings bedchamber  night

the king whirls as the doors explode inward and dartagnan
barrels through

                     louis
          out there  look  out there  he 

the garden is empty

                     dartagnan
          i just left the garden it was
          empty  what did you see

                     louis
          it was nothing  a nightmare
          nothing more  go away i 

dartagnan guides his guards out but glances back to see the
king ashamed and worried  dartagnan tells his men 

                     dartagnan
          check the garden

ext  garden  outside the kings window  night

an old jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray  he kneels at a back pew
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes  the young
musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel see only the normal piety and move on  the old
priest crosses himself bows his head and smiles

                                                  cut to

close  phillippes eyes through the slits of the mask

they are frightened  as we pull back we see the iron mask
in an overhead pov phillippe is lying on his back his
head resting on an anvil  athos stands close by lending
support aramis and porthos look on  a blacksmith stands
over phillippe  he positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask  it takes several ringing hammer blows
 which we experience from a pov within the mask  before
the lock breaks

athos as gently as he can pries open the iron mask

phillippes face

is a wretched sight overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard and with a deathly pallor

phillippe sits up lifting his head out of the mask  he
looks at the musketeers watching them for their reactions
at first they are frozen then there is recognition awe

phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge and looks
down into the surface of the water at his reflection

                     porthos
          aramis  athos  he looks exactly
          like exactly like

                     aramis
          i will answer all your questions
          but first soap water and a razor

int  the manor houses main dining room  day

aramis and porthos are sitting at the table when athos ushers
in 

phillippe cleaned up

the change in him is remarkable and his face so identical to
the kings that porthos actually jumps  phillippe takes a
seat opposite aramis and looks around wary vulnerable

                     aramis
          yes  identical

aramis eyes are aflame as he looks across at phillippe

                     aramis
          the greatest secret of life is who
          we truly are  now i must give you
          that secret which has been kept
          from you your whole life  it began
          on the night when louis was born

                     porthos
          i remember that night  dartagnan
          was drunk the only time ive seen
          him that way  the three of us were
          reveling remember athos

                     aramis
          but i was on duty

in flashback

we see the shadowy musketeer we saw in the opening moving up
the dark steps of the palace  we see now it was aramis

                     aramis voice
          i was summoned to the royal
          apartments  arrange a carriage
          they told me and wait by the door
          of the stables

intercut flashback

we see images of that night as we saw in the opening

                     aramis voice
          they brought a baby from the back of
          the palace into the black carriage
          i had waiting  they had given the
          driver instructions about where it
          was and i was ordered to make the
          whole journey with the blinds of the
          carriage drawn

in the flashback we see the young musketeer aramis his face
shielded in shadow handing a living bundle over to someone
at one of the back doors of a large country house

                     aramis voice
          i carried that baby into the
          countryside to a chateau like this
          one  and there i left him

aramis in the present

                     aramis
          i have never forgotten that night
          or what i carried

                     porthos
          i dont understand  what does this
          have to do with  you carried a
          baby somewhere its unusual but 

                     aramis
          not just a baby porthos  i carried
          the child of the king

                     porthos
          the child of the king is the
          king  louis

                     aramis
          no not louis

                     porthos
          athos do you understand this  he
          confuses me 

                     aramis
          i carried the kings child  the
          queen had twins that night and one
          of them was sent away in secret

                     porthos
          but why

                     aramis
          because the old king had a twin as
          well and through his whole reign
          his brother fought him for the
          throne  then he had two heirs not
          just sons but twins  so he decided
          that one be put away as if he never
          existed  you phillippe

phillippe is pale we dissolve to a flashback of
phillippes early education in the country house

                     aramis voice
          the old king ordered you be educated
          and well treated but your identity
          kept from you and all those around
          you

the flashback moves to the palace matching the narration 

                     aramis voice
          on his death bed he revealed your
          existence to louis and your mother
          your mother had been told by her own
          priest that you had died at birth
          somehow she blamed herself for ever
          believing it and she wished to
          restore your birthright  but now
          louis was king

we see in flashback louis wearing his new crown plotting

                     aramis voice
          a priest even a pope he could kill
          without hesitation but he was
          afraid to kill you for his whole
          claim to power rests on the sanctity
          of royal blood  so he had you
          hidden in a way that only a monster
          could devise  i know for it was i
          who took you to prison and the iron
          mask  someday i will ask your
          forgiveness  but not until we have
          restored to you what is yours

we are in present time again  all eyes are on phillippe

                     phillippe
          restored

                     aramis
          we will replace louis with
          phillippe  no one but the king
          himself  and now we  knows
          phillippe even exists  all we have
          to do is switch them

                     athos
          switch  that is your plan  it is
          ludicrous

                     aramis
          i have it all worked out

                     athos
          physical resemblance is but one
          small thing  louis has an
          arrogance a manner 

                     aramis
          those can be adopted 

                     athos
          and people close to him who 

                     aramis
          do you think i have not considered
          that  i have a plan  and you may
          rest assured that it is brilliant

                     athos
          it is not just our lives you risk
          with this conceit of yours  it is
          phillippes as well

                     aramis
          yes and he has a choice

aramis stops thundering at athos and turns to phillippe

                     aramis
          what about it phillippe  all that
          time in prison all that time you
          suffered was it for nothing  you
          memorized the entire bible or so
          your priest told me  an act of
          survival of defiance of courage
          your years within the mask have
          given you reserves of strength that
          others could not imagine  your home
          was a dungeon and now you may be a
          king if you have the heart to make
          it so  do you have the heart

phillippe stands shakily and faces them

                     phillippe
          i will try

phillippe walks  nearly wanders  from the room

                     aramis
          you see  a king

athos with a glare at aramis follows phillippe

ext  manor house gardens  day

the gardens are sun drenched bursting with the beauty of a
french summer  athos finds phillippe there sitting alone

                     athos
          recent hours have been a shock

                     phillippe
          perhaps not as much as you might
          imagine  when tutors answered every
          question except those about who i
          was  when i was imprisoned in a way
          no other man had ever been i knew
          there was something different about
          me  but a king

                     athos
          phillippe there is something i
          hope you understand  terrible
          cruelty has been used against you
          and you must understand that you
          did nothing to deserve it

                     phillippe
          there is wrath in me  i have
          learned to hide it  those years in
          the cell i dreamed that freedom
          would someday just happen the way
          the mask happened  now i am free
          and with each free breath i feel the
          growing desire to make someone
          suffer for all i lost  look at
          this all this that for ten years i
          could not see  what if i become a
          king  a king no different from my
          brother

                     athos
          the desire for vengeance can be a
          poison

                     phillippe
          what is its antidote

                     athos
          i suppose it is to remember there
          are many people who have never been
          in a prison who pass such beauty
          every day and never see it

phillippe reaches to a flower plucks it and smells it  he
looks around at the beauty of the garden taking it all in
athos looks around too then athos realizes phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden but at him

                     phillippe
          you look so sad  is it something i
          have done

                     athos
          it is something i have done  or
          did not do

                     phillippe
          what is that

                     athos
          i did not share beauty with
          someone who is no longer here for
          me to share beauty with

before phillippe can pursue this athos turns businesslike

                     athos
          we have much to do wed best get
          started  now suppose you were to
          walk into a garden as a king

int  manor house dining room  night

aramis is having dinner he calls toward the kitchen

                     aramis
          more wine

athos enters and sags into a chair his energy spent

                     aramis
          how is he

                     athos
          resting hes had a long day
          aramis 

                     aramis
               calling out
          more wine

                     athos
          you must reconsider this plan
          phillippe is like a child he 

                     aramis
          you can do it

                     athos
          in a year maybe two i could teach
          him enough to 

                     aramis
          three days

                     athos
          three days

                     aramis
          the king is having a ball a
          masquerade ball  it is the perfect
          opportunity and perhaps our only
          one  at any time phillippe could be
          discovered and what then  remember
          france  remember the poor
          remember raoul  more wine  where
          are those serving girls

ext  chateau  night

as aramis and athos are downstairs arguing we pan up to the
window of a candlelit bedroom

int  chateau bedroom  night

we pan from the window to the bed where porthos is making
love  or trying to  we see his huge bare broad back
blotting out all view of his partner  he grunts then roles
over in despair  revealing not one but three serving girls
lying beneath him jammed sidebyside like firewood all
nearly smothered by porthos bulk

                     porthos
          its no use  my sword is bent

                     serving woman
          itll be all right  youre just
          taking a while to get started

                     porthos
          no its dead  i am useless

porthos heaves himself out of bed

ext  chateau  night

while aramis and athos are visible through the window
arguing and gesturing porthos  still naked  walks across
the moonlit courtyard to the barn

int  dining room  night

                     athos
          phillippe  hes very bright hes
          perceptive but he is in such
          turmoil 

                     aramis
          you grow fond of him  thats good

                     athos
          dont play god with me aramis i 

athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked porthos
moving across the courtyard toward the barn

                     aramis
          go on

                     athos
          but  what is porthos doing

                     aramis
          going into the barn naked  or so
          it appears

we intercut porthos in the barn with aramis and athos in the
house

in the barn

porthos alone within the barn finds a thick plow rope and
fashions a noose

in the house

                     aramis
          now  you were saying

                     athos
          but  what is he doing

                     aramis
          about to hang himself i should
          think

in the barn

porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of
the barn and ties the other end off  he shoves a milking
stool up below the noose climbs onto it and fits the noose
around his neck  note when we see him in full view it is
only from behind  and this angle is a sight to behold

in the house

aramis detachment only aggravates athos excitement

                     athos
          hang himself

                     aramis
          hes threatened to do it its been
          building up in him for months

                     athos
          we must stop him

                     aramis
          come now athos if porthos is
          determined to end his life then he
          will certainly manage to find the
          opportunity

                     athos
          but  but 

athos jumps up and makes for the door  but aramis hooded
helpers at a signal from aramis bar his way

in the barn

porthos grave with drama utters his last words

                     porthos
          adieu cruel life  farewell to
          useless porthos

he steps off the stool

his great weight drops  the rope snaps taught  the beam it
is tied to snaps like a twig  right in the place where it
has been sawn nearly in half already

porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the
floorboards of the barn cracking them

aramis and athos

can hear the crack from where theyre sitting

                     aramis
          i sawed the main beam in half

in the barn

the chain reaction has just begun  the broken floorboards
buckle and the barns walls deprived of their central
support fall in on each other

in the front room

athos and aramis watch wideeyed as the whole barn completely
collapses around the unfortunate porthos  athos gives aramis
a look

                     aramis
          im a genius  not an engineer

they jump up and run out  the commotion draws others too 
especially the three wenches porthos had been trying to bed

the collapsed barn

its a tangle of debris  and from the size and weight of
the pile it looks as if no one could live through the
collapse  for a moment the whole pile lies silent then
suddenly it bursts apart and porthos emerges exploding with
anger

                     porthos
          aramis  you did this didnt you
          you knew i would try hanging myself
          and you sawed the beam  admit it
          admit it by god  admit it

porthos eyes are bulging hes terrifying in his fury  and
he holds one of the broken barns timbers like a giant club
ready to bash in aramis brains  aramis is totally casual

                     aramis
          well of course i knew it porthos

porthos stands there blinking

                     aramis
          youve been moping for months  now
          that youve gotten the idea of
          killing yourself out of the way you
          can stop boring me and start being
          useful to me  now get some rest

                     porthos
          well well okay

porthos starts back toward the house  then one of the
serving girls heading back inside sees in one of the upper
windows  the face in the iron mask  she screams 

                     wench
          aaaaaahhhhhhh

phillippe shies back from the window now but its too late
everyone has seen him  aramis with cold intellectual
curiosity quietly observes the womens reaction even as his
hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened
locals

                     athos
          poor phillippe

                     aramis
          the mask is terrifying especially
          when unexpected  do you notice

                     athos
          all i noticed was that phillippe
          feels even more like an animal

athos hurries in aramis looks at porthos

                     aramis
          see porthos  secrets are hard to
          keep  we dont have much time

int  phillippes bedroom  night

athos enters to find phillippe in a corner of the bedroom
slumped and ashamed in the darkness holding the mask

                     phillippe
          ive worn this mask so long i
          couldnt sleep without it

                     athos
          i will sit with you  i cant sleep
          either

athos settles into a chair as phillippe lays the mask aside
on the table and closes his eyes  athos looks toward the
flames of the fireplace and in their dancing shadows he sees
the face of raoul  phillippes voice interrupts 

                     phillippe
          athos  thank you for being my
          guide back into the world

athos had not thought of it that way  phillippe closes his
eyes again and falls asleep

int  phillippes bedroom  morning

light falls on athos face it is dawn  he hears the whinny
of horses and looks out the window to see a carriage about
to leave  reacting quickly he hurries out quietly

ext  chateau  morning

aramis and porthos are already loaded into the carriage as
athos runs up

                     athos
          where are you going

                     aramis
          paris  there is still much to do
          well be back soon  be ready

                     athos
          but aramis    phillippe can learn
          in time but 

                     aramis
          he can learn to be phillippe in
          time  but first he must learn to be
          louis and for that he has two more
          days

                     athos
          what youre asking is impossible

                     aramis
          i offer you the perfect revolution
          a revolution without bloodshed
          without any loss of life even
          without treason for he too is the
          son of the king

                     athos
          but 

                     aramis
          you said youd do anything athos
          anything to replace this king  so
          do it

aramis motions to the driver who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away

athos wideeyed and alone watches the carriage roll away
he turns back toward the house and sees phillippe looking
out the window  without the mask

int  manor house  dining room  day

athos and phillippe are having breakfast

                     athos
          no wait do not hold your goblet
          that way  with a king it is so

he shows him pinching the goblet between thumb and
forefinger as the other three fingers extend daintily

                     athos
          it is not to be dainty  servants
          have touched the kings goblet so
          he will touch it as little as
          possible

phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers
crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything

                     phillippe
          i am so sorry  forgive me i 

                     athos
          no  do not be sorry  never be
          sorry  the king cares for nothing
          and for no one  there are no
          mistakes when you are king  what
          you do is right for every person  a
          king has contempt for everyone

                     phillippe
          is that the king of king you wish me
          to be  or do you say this because
          of your son

                     athos
          how did you know  

                     phillippe
          porthos told me

for a moment athos can say nothing then he shoves back from
the table and storms from the room

int  country manor house  athos room  night

athos is pacing in his room all alone rehearsing the things
he wants to say to phillippe

                     athos
          i am not i am not angry with you
          you understand  good  now as to
          acting like a king we wish you to
          be a good king  but at first at
          first you must pass as louis and
          louis is cold and cruel  so you
          must stop looking at people with
          such softness  it is not kingly
          the eyes of a king say that all he
          cares about is himself and your
          eyes  how do i tell him this  
          you eyes ask so much  you
          shouldnt care about me about my 
          about

athos voice breaks his body sags

                     athos
          oh raoul my son my son

athos weeps

int  manor house  day

phillippe sits alone in the parlor he looks up as athos 
his face washed no sign of grief  marches in

                     athos
          come we have much to do

montage  athos training phillippe

 they practice sword fighting athos being sure that
   phillippe knows kingly posture

 they rehearse holding court with athos showing phillippe
   how to sit in a chair like a king on his throne and then
   phillippe trying it with athos then playing the roll of a
   courtesan paying homage

 they rehearse courtly dancing and as they stumble both
   of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous they laugh

ext  paris street  night

aramis carriage rattles to a stop the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones  they are near the same
area where the riots occurred now at night everything
looks deserted  aramis steps from the carriage

                     aramis
          coming

                     porthos
          what use am i

                     aramis
          we go someplace dangerous

                     porthos
          why didnt you say so

porthos steps out with him and aramis leads the way down a
dark spooky alley

ext  paris backstreets  night

they walk through the murky darkness of paris backstreets

                     porthos
          it is good to be out on a mission
          again we are out on a mission
          arent we

aramis grunts noncommittally lost in thought

                     porthos
          youre right  tell porthos nothing
          he needs to know nothing for he is
          useless

just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows
and blocks their way  he holds a knife  another robber with
a sword rises from a doorway beside them

                     robber
          your money or your life

aramis looks bored porthos stands blinking in surprise
then a third robber steps up behind them cocking a pistol

                     third robber
          make it quick old man

                     porthos
          old  old  youre all trying to
          rob us because you think were old

the man with a sword steps forward to hack porthos down but
porthos spins slapping the pistol making it boom but miss
he kicks the swordsman in the groin then smashes his head
against the alley wall he backhands the gunman  the robber
with the knife tries to run porthos snatches a barrel from
the street and hurls it into the fleeing robbers back he
falls in a heap

porthos fury has just begun  he picks the fallen gunman up
by the throat slams him stomach down across a broken alley
cart and with one sweep of his mighty hand porthos snatches
down the mans pants

                     porthos
          old  ill show you old

porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones  we see
the shock and terror on the robbers face as he feels
something shocking happen behind him

                     porthos
          lets see you rob somebody with your
          pistol there

aramis has found what hes looking for  a filthy brothel

                     aramis
          here we are

aramis leads porthos inside

int  brothel  night

sleazy whores lounge around women at the very bottom of
life  they stir and try to look more appealing as the two
well dressed gentlemen enter

                     porthos
          aramis these are these are
          whores

          loved her

                     porthos

a greasy disgusting pimp shuffles over

                     pimp
          what do you want  white  black
          both

                     aramis

                     pimp

          where you stand

aramis slowly falls to his knees before the pimp

                     aramis
          bless me father for i have sinned

the pimp  the former father belles the same man we saw as
the priest who prayed with the queen at the royal birth in
the opening  shoves his pistol at aramis face

                     pimp

                     aramis

          priests assurance of forgiveness
          can mean as much as yours  tell me
          that i can be forgiven no matter
          what i have done

aramis eyes are hypnotic staring deep into the fallen
priests soul  porthos is bugeyed certain aramis head is
about to be blown apart

                     porthos
          hes going to kill you aramis

                     aramis
          then let him kill me if all my
          faith is wrong

he stares at the pimp  the pimps finger trembles on the
trigger

                     aramis

          right  i have come to take you
          home

the pimp shakes convulsively he drops to his knees bows his
head and weeps

these secret movement sequences with an ominous jackthe
ripper quality  the carriage pulls into

int  cathedral courtyard  night

then porthos  but the appearance of the pimp surprises the
cathedral priests  they cross themselves

                     priests
          father belles

crossing themselves they embrace the prodigal priest one
monk kneels before aramis

                     monk

                     aramis

to him

                     jesuit
          the ball has been rescheduled  for
          tomorrow

                     aramis
          but what if something extraordinary
          happened  something so unusual that
          all the attention went to someone
          else  someone whose confirmation of
          phillippe the king would never be
          questioned

                     porthos
          who

                     aramis

and aramis leans forward to tell them his plan

teams of servants are filing in and out of the palace with
food and flowers decorating the ballroom for the ball that

move in single file toward the garden chapel

he slides open the partition window between them

                     anne
          father belles  

he taps a silencing finger to his lips

                     anne

                     father belles

          of faith  i have come back to ask
          you if you believe that one lie can
          poison your whole life and one
          truth can put it back together
          again

anne stares at the eyes of the priest back from hell

int  palace  kings room  day

as louis tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock
costume complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand
he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful
young women arriving early for the ball

                     louis
          it shall be interesting tonight

dartagnan enters looking concerned

                     dartagnan
          your majesty  this ball with an
          open invitation to the nobility of
          paris  we have no way of
          checking 

                     louis
          you will protect me as you always
          have dartagnan

through the window louis sees more beautiful young women

                     louis
          by the way claude  inform
          mademoiselle beaufort that she will
          be moving from her rooms 

he looks up to see that michelle has entered through the open
door behind him

                     louis
          never mind it seems we have already
          told her

but michelles appearance brings him up short  it is not the
cruel brushoff she is already harshly different  her eyes
are red from crying her lips are tight in anger

                     michelle
          murderer  murderer

she holds a letter crushed in her hand

                     michelle
          i wrote fromberge  under your seal
          i wrote as you demanding to know
          why he disregarded my order to keep
          raoul from danger  he writes back
          but your majesty  your last letter
          ordered me to put him in front of
          the cannon

she hurls the crumpled letter into his face  everyone is
frozen silent  she staggers toward louis as if to attack
him then falls to her knees weeping  no one helps her

except dartagnan  he kneels hugs her shoulders helps her
to her feet and guides her toward her room  but dartagnan
looks back once toward louis

                     louis
          hysterical woman

                     claude
          sire misuse of the royal seal  

                     louis
          shell be gone tomorrow

as dartagnan and michelle move out they pass anne coming
in  anne and dartagnan exchange a look he remembers to
give her a respectful nod but she moves past into the
kings dressing room  louis is surprised

                     louis
          mother  

                     anne
          may i speak with you  alone

                     louis
          i am preparing for a ball

                     anne
          we havent visited in three years
          and we should have privacy

exasperated louis waves his attendants away

                     louis
          what is it mother

                     anne
          i wish to discuss your brother

                     louis
          he is dead  by gods choice  there
          is nothing to discuss

                     anne
          first they told me he had died at
          birth  then your father admitted he
          was alive but well cared for in
          secret  but the message that told
          of his death said he had been a
          prisoner

                     louis
          i am king mother  and i do not
          wish to discuss this with you

                     anne
          he was my blood  and i demand to
          know what happened to him

                     louis
          why would you ask now  you never
          asked before

                     anne
          because i have dreamed of him  not
          as the baby they took away but as a
          man

                     louis
          you have prayed too much  your mind
          is weak

avoiding her stare louis lifts a plaster bust of his father
its eyes like the sightless pupils of greek gods

                     anne
          i believe in dreams louis  they
          are our souls speaking to us from
          that world beyond our eyes  and
          that son i never saw in daylight was
          standing in the moonlight of my
          dreams  and he wore an iron mask

we see her from a low angle from a pov behind louis  and
we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor

                     louis
          it  it doesnt matter mother  he
          is dead now  dead

                     anne
          yes  dead  two nights ago  the
          night of my dream

and the night of louis dream  anne begins to walk out

                     louis
          if if he was wearing an iron mask
          in your dream then how could you
          know he was your son

louis smiles he thinks he has her

                     anne
          then you did do it louis  you did
          put your brother in an iron mask

all the blood is gone from louis face  anne walks from the
room past louis waiting tailors  he snaps at them

                     louis
          i have a ball to attend

they rush in  as they scurry about dressing him in gold
louis composure returns he stares at himself in the golden
mirror likes what he sees and smiles

ext  road  night

aramis carriage pulls off the road and into the trees  the
musketeers and phillippe pile out to find another much
grander carriage there waiting  aramis ushers them into it

                     phillippe
          whose carriage is this

                     porthos
          it was mine  but since you are
          about to be the king it is yours

the new carriage lurches away

inside the new carriage

are bundles of elaborate clothes

                     aramis
          phillippe first

they begin to dress phillippe in a masquerade costume

                     aramis
          remember phillippe nobility is
          born in the heart

                     athos
          hold your goblet with two fingers

                     porthos
          and make love as if you dont care
          the way kings do  and fart whenever
          you wish

aramis tucks a note into phillippes pocket

                     aramis
          remember all you have to do is get
          through tonight  smile and nod a
          lot and if you get stuck just wave
          and announce continue  in the
          morning you hand this note to
          dartagnan pardoning athos and
          instructing that he aramis and
          porthos be brought to the palace as
          your advisors  and all is well

phillippe nods everyones nervous  aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out

                     aramis
          now the rest of us

ext  the palace  night

carriages disgorge guests wildly attired for the masquerade
ball  porthos carriage pulls in among them

int  palace ballroom  night

a magnificent masquerade ball is in full swirl the dazzling
light of chandeliers bounces off the gilt ceiling and
sparkles on the jewels of swirling dancers their numbers
multiplied in the polished mirrors that line the walls

the king is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies
dartagnan stands to the side of the ballroom ever watchful
ever remote

as the dancers swirl each one wearing a distinctive mask in
the garish style favored by the french nobility of the
1600s we see one particular couple  a large man with an
excessively large woman  they are dancing vigorously and as
they take a break behind a huge pillar they lift their masks
enough for us to see that the man is aramis and the woman
is porthos

from the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw
replicas of the iron mask that phillippe once wore

                     porthos
          dartagnan watches everything  we
          have to be lucky

                     aramis
          we will make our own luck tonight
          if phillippe holds up

aramis peers across the ballroom to where athos and
phillippe mix among the revelers using thin sticks to hold
broad masks to their faces  behind the masks we see their
eyes  athos intense phillippes nervous and darting

                     athos
          stay calm youre doing fine

then phillippes eyes go strangely still he sees for the
first time in his life his twin brother the king

                     phillippe
          my brother

louis dances the minuet prancing as if he is the center of
the universe but this bliss is broken when one of the
dancers who swirls by him  it is aramis  lifts the
baroque outer mask hes wearing and reveals an iron mask
beneath

the king staggers stopping  the sight stuns him confuses
him he looks around but the wearer of the mask has
disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers  louis
hands dart to his eyes  are they playing tricks on him

seeing his reaction phillippe whispers 

                     phillippe
          he knew  he knew what they did to
          me

the young beauty dancing with louis notices him falter

                     young beauty
          what is wrong your majesty

                     louis
          nothing i  continue

louis rejoins the dancing and then sees on the balcony
above him a different person  a huge woman porthos 
who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below

                     louis
          there  do you see it

                     young beauty
          see what majesty

porthos has slipped away from the railing when the king looks
back up the young beauty sees nothing and turns back to the
king with a look that questions his sanity

dartagnan notices the kings reaction  though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask  and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the king turns and staggers away

                     dartagnan
          your majesty

                     louis
           tired  must lie down

the music splatters to an awkward stop louis hurries out
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party

                     dartagnan
          carry on everyone

the music begins again and the party goers not knowing what
else to do politely continue

athos draws phillippe away from the ballroom into a side
corridor

at the foot of the stairs to the balcony

porthos waddles down stairs and meets aramis

                     aramis
          quick to the passages

they hurry in the same direction athos and phillippe went

int  palace hallway  outside the kings bedroom  night

dartagnan catches up to the king as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment

                     dartagnan
          your majesty is there anything  

the king shuts the door in dartagnans face

int  the kings bedroom  night

the king falls upon his bed pressing his hands to his head

int  palace corridor  night

the three musketeers and phillippe move quietly up a stairway
and to the door of a room  phillippe whispers

                     phillippe
          the room of the kings favorite
          mistress

                     athos
          she will be at the ball

int  michelles apartment  night

the door opens and they move in it is in fact empty though
a mess  they move to the wall where aramis after a little
looking locates the levers to open the walldoor to the
kings secret passageway  aramis enters first the others
follow  we half expect michelle to pop up at any moment but
the musketeers enter the passage without incident

int  secret passages  night

aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage
to the portal into the kings bedroom

int  kings bedchamber  night

the king is lying on the bed we see him from the pov of
someone approaching him slowly silently  when his eyes open
in panic it is too late we see aramis athos porthos
from the kings pov as they swarm him

                     aramis
          it is judgment day

his fist drops into frame louis loses consciousness

louis pov

as consciousness returns  he see phillippe in louis
clothes  aramis athos and porthos bow and say

                     musketeers
          your majesty

louis still on his bed now wears phillippes clothes

                     louis
          wh wha

                     aramis
          dont look so shocked phillippe
          come youre going back to prison

                     louis
          phillippe  why do you call me 

now louis understands everything  he tries to struggle but
instantly porthos shoves a rag into his mouth

aramis opens the main door a crack and sees dartagnan has
entered his room down the corridor through whose open door
he can guard the approaches to the kings rooms  aramis
shuts the door again and turns to the others

                     aramis
          dartagnan guards the hallway  you
          must go back the way we came

athos puts his hands on phillippes shoulders

                     athos
          now your majesty  it is time

aramis and porthos bow again to phillippe  now dressed and
looking exactly like the king  phillippes mouth is dry he
swallows hard and follows athos up the hidden stairs

int  michelles bedchamber

athos and phillippe move to the door they stop there and
athos adjusts phillippes costume one more time

                     athos
          you know the way

phillippe nods tremendously nervous

                     athos
          you have your note

phillippe pats his pocket like a boy being sent off to his
first day at school  he surprises athos hugging him  then
phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway
athos stands at the door and watches him go all alone
athos whispers though phillippe cant hear

                     athos
          you have the heart of a king

reluctantly he shuts the door behind phillippe

in the hallway following phillippe

as he conducts himself through the ornate corridor down the
gilded staircase and into 

int  ballroom  night

phillippe enters the ballroom and the reappearance of the
king draws new attention  everyone in the dazzling
ballroom seems to stop and look straight at phillippe

phillippe freezes  stares everywhere stares  for what
seems an eternity he cant move

but then he raises his hand and says 

                     phillippe
          continue

as if by magic the music plays the dancing resumes
phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it
he seems to have made it people glance  dancing ladies
young musketeers old advisors  but no one gives him a
second look  for a moment phillippe feels safe

and then he sees michelle her eyes glassy and riveted upon
him  she wears her most beautiful gown  the first one
louis gave her  but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily
her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged her hair is mussed
she is drunk  she weaves her way to him and curtsies
elaborately

                     michelle
          my gracious noble lord

phillippes heart is pounding he looks around for help  he
can only guess who this woman is  the advisors have now
noticed her claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the
party going along and waves guards over

                     phillippe
          how are you michelle

she doesnt react so he must have guessed right but
phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the
ball and hes ambushed by her anger

                     michelle
          how should i be  i came to give
          this back to you

she starts tearing off her dress  claude and the guards
reach her the young musketeers grabbing her

                     claude
          fret not with this your majesty 

but michelle fights slapping clawing  and when one of the
young musketeers grabs her from behind his arm to her
throat phillippe jumps up

                     phillippe
          stop  youre hurting her

phillippes face shows something louis never did
compassion  he looks into michelles eyes

                     phillippe
          however i have wronged you i will
          make amends  whatever the cost

phillippe could not have said anything more unlike louis
everyone who heard the remark  claude the guards and
especially michelle  stare at him in frozen amazement

phillippe realizes his blunder theyve caught him

the music stops  but the attention is not directed at the
throne all eyes shift to the main doorway where anne has
appeared  she is indescribably beautiful she wears a bright
gown her hair is brushed and bejeweled she radiates the
light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has
discovered at forty that she is more stunning than ever

her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance
of the king everyone watches transfixed as she approaches
phillippe sees her  his mother  he stands on legs that
seem to have no bones  his mother

she moves to him her eyes filling with tears  when she is
almost to the throne phillippe falls to his knees before her
and kisses her hand

no one can believe it not from this king  yet the moment
strikes them as beautiful and they applaud happily

phillippe and the queen mother rise and guide each other 
depending on each other for support to a seat he on the
throne she on a seat the servants place beside him

phillippe gives a wave

                     phillippe
          continue

the ball continues the music exuberant  michelle wanders
away like a blind lamb  phillippe and his mother sit side
by side holding hands their reunion passing in private
between their clasped hands and glistening in their eyes

int  the palace corridor  night

michelle alone and forgotten staggers down the corridor
toward the kings rooms she passes dartagnans open door

int  the kings bedchamber  the three musketeers

are tidying everything up they have louis gagged and trussed
up hand and foot his eyes flashing hatred

                     athos
          dont worry your majesty  we have
          a prison for you where you can rest
          peacefully

porthos drapes louis over his shoulder and they move into
the passages  just as they close the portal behind them the
door opens and michelle wanders in like a zombie  suddenly
dartagnan is at her shoulder

                     dartagnan
          michelle 

then he sees the room is empty he thought louis was here

                     dartagnan
          where is he

                     michelle
          in the ballroom  but he isnt
          the same man

int  ballroom  night

as a minuet ends claude raises his glass in a toast

                     claude
          to king louis  and to anne the
          queen mother

the guests applaud and reach for wine glasses servants
present phillippe and anne with champagne and they sip 

                     guests
          to king louis and the queen mother

everyone drinks phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips  and it slips through his nervous
fingers hitting the floor with a crash

dead silence everyone is looking  then anne drops her glass
too  and everybody does it as if to break the glass is
part of the celebration

as the music begins again anne leans to phillippe 

                     anne
          i retire now  wait two waltzes
          then retire to your room and spend
          the night in safety  we have much
          to talk about and have the rest of
          our lives to do it

                     phillippe
          good night mother

                     anne
          good night my son

she kisses him on the cheek it brings tears to both of them
she moves to the door everyone bowing as she leaves

just outside the ballroom door

anne encounters dartagnan  he stops so taken by the sight
of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her

                     dartagnan
          anne  you look 

remembering himself he bows deeply

                     dartagnan
          my queen

                     anne
          dartagnan

she takes his hand not caring who is watching

                     dartagnan
          i have never seen a sight more
          beautiful than you tonight

                     anne
          we have much to discuss  tomorrow

she moves off toward her room  dartagnan enters the
ballroom

int  ballroom  night

dartagnan sees louis sitting on the throne  more baffled
than alarmed he grabs one of the musketeer guards near him

                     dartagnan
          how long has the king been back

                     guard
          some while captain

                     dartagnan
          he didnt pass my doorway i was in
          my room

                     guard
          he mustve captain there is no
          other way here

dartagnan stands and thinks his mind begins to spin

phillippe

sees dartagnan staring at him then calling more guards
over and giving them quick instructions the guards hurry
away  then dartagnan moves to phillippe and bows  he
looks at him carefully but seems to see nothing unusual

                     phillippe
          continue

                     dartagnan
          sire we have an emergency  of
          security  i must ask you to
          accompany me

                     phillippe
           the ball continue

                     dartagnan
          i must insist sire

phillippe stands and follows dartagnan from the ball

int  passages to river  night

aramis athos and porthos  carrying louis  descend the
secret passages to the foundations of the palace into a
drainage channel leading to the river

they have stashed a boat there they plop louis into it and
climb in themselves  they row toward the archway that is the
exit to the river the moonlit waters of the seine glow
outside like a beacon of safe escape

but the steel grate of the archway slams down just before
they reach it and blades point at them from every angle of
the darkness  a shielded lantern rises and its wick is
turned up revealing

dartagnan

he stands with a small contingent of young musketeers  his
eyes are intense his face in agony

                     dartagnan
          my friends

the only one they can see it dartagnan  they all look at
each other in the small circle of light from the lantern

                     dartagnan
          only we four the most trusted
          musketeers knew about the passages
          meant to keep the king safe your
          majesty

phillippe steps out of the darkness his eyes are full of
shame and failure as he looks at athos but still he holds
on trying to maintain the charade that he is louis

                     phillippe
          yes  why do you bring me here
          dartagnan

                     porthos
          the king  look  its the king

he means phillippe

                     dartagnan
          then who is that lying beside you

porthos turns and looks at louis  then reacts as if hes
totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and
gagged beside him

                     porthos
          wh   where did he come from

athos grabs dartagnans arm

                     athos
          if you ever loved me  if you ever
          loved honor or anything else 
          then stand now and let it happen

                     dartagnan
          i cannot athos  dearly as i love
          you i cannot

dartagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind
louis hands and the gag that has kept him from talking
aramis suddenly backhands louis knocking him flat on his
back in the boat and pointing to him  louis

                     aramis
          this man is an impostor  we caught
          him trying to impersonate the king
          and were just getting rid of him

louis struggles upright

                     louis
          dartagnan arrest them all

                     aramis
          shut up knave

aramis slaps louis again and pleads with his eyes that
dartagnan accept their ruse  dartagnan is dying inside

                     dartagnan
          before i came here i insisted the
          king come with me  the real louis
          would never have let me insist

seeing they are about to be arrested the old musketeers in
the boat spring into action against their younger
counterparts  athos swats one swordsman with an oar porthos
seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and
flings the man back into two of his comrades aramis grabs
louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat

                     aramis
          pull them back dartagnan

                     dartagnan
          you cant do it

                     aramis
          pull them back

                     dartagnan
          everyone back

                     aramis
          phillippe get into the boat  into
          the boat  now

phillippe obeys

                     aramis
          open the gate

dartagnan nods to his men and they open the iron gate
leading out to the river

the boat makes for the opening  just as it is about to reach
it louis forces aramis hand

                     louis
          you will not shed royal blood

he kicks at the boat and struggles to stand making the boat
tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around  aramis
draws the dagger away from louis throat to keep from killing
him and dartagnan makes a grab at louis and drags him onto
the stone floor of the channel

the boat is almost through the opening  and louis snatches
at his brother phillippe

the current outside the gate is rushing by and the boat is
already caught in the current its pulling away and the
musketeers cant stop it  athos seizes phillippes legs and
tries to hold him but the pressure of the current is great
and now not only louis but some of the young musketeers are
helping hold phillippe

phillippes legs slip out of athos grasp and the boat
flashes downriver

aramis porthos and athos have escaped but phillippe is
captured looking into the hatefilled eyes of his twin
brother louis

int  secret passageway  night

louis is angrily climbing through the passageways back up
into the main floors of the palace venting his emotions at
dartagnan just behind him the young musketeers with
phillippe their prisoner follow along further back

                     louis
          i want all these passages sealed
          another stupid idea of my fathers
          seal them all every one

                     dartagnan
          it shall be done your majesty

                     louis
          even the bedchamber passages  let
          none remain

                     dartagnan
          yes your majesty

they reach a doorway and the king bangs through it into his
own bedchamber still spouting anger

                     louis
          i was told this impostor was dead

                     dartagnan
           you knew you had a double

                     louis
          he is my brother

dartagnan is frozen in surprise  phillippe and his guards
move into the room seeing him in full light wearing louis
own clothes fans louis anger he jumps forward and begins
ripping the royal garments off phillippe

dartagnan forces himself between louis and phillippe

                     dartagnan
          i  i thought he was but an
          impostor who resembled 

                     louis
          my twin  which has kept him alive
          until now

                     annes voice
          no

they whirl to see the queen mother who has entered through
the main door  she hurries to the space between her sons
hugging phillippe then trying to hug louis

                     anne
          louis please  

                     louis
          my guards are useless  take her
          from me

he motions to the young musketeers to restrain her
reluctantly they grip the arms of the queen mother

                     louis
          what had you to do with this
          mother

                     anne
          he is your brother

                     louis
          he is nothing now

louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young
musketeers  but dartagnan steps between him and phillippe

                     dartagnan
          your majesty this man before
          you he is royal blood the same
          as you  to spill it is the one
          thing even you cannot do  it is
          against the laws of god and of
          france

                     louis
          get out of my way

                     dartagnan
          not once have i ever asked anything
          for myself  i ask now  forgive
          this man this prisoner your
          brother

                     louis
          forgive

                     dartagnan
          aramis porthos and athos too  i
          know what they have done was a
          threat against you  and yet that
          threat has been removed with no
          harm coming to your majesty  if
          their passions were in error their
          spirits have ever been noble
          forgive them

                     louis
          they have plotted against me  me
          the embodiment of gods will

dartagnan sinks to his knees before the king

                     dartagnan
          your majesty every day of your
          life i have watched over you  no
          angel could have stood a more
          faithful vigil  i have bled for
          you and have prayed every day to
          see you become greater than your
          office better than the law  show
          me now what my faith and blood have
          purchased  show mercy

the words cut into everyone  anne phillippe the young
musketeers  but louis eyes are cold as he responds 

                     louis
          you take the side of traitors

                     phillippe
          please may i speak  mlord i
          beg that you kill me  i release
          you before almighty god from any
          claim of sin in taking my life  in
          fact i will pray that god reward you
          for your mercy to do it  but do not
           i beg you  return me to the
          prison where i have lived so long

phillippes plea makes louis pause then smile

                     louis
          dartagnan you will hunt down
          aramis porthos and athos and bring
          me their heads or i will have
          yours  and as for you phillippe
          back to the prison you shall go and
          into the mask you hate

                     anne
          no louis  no

                     louis
          wear it until you love it  and die
          in it

anne screams and louis waves to the guards who draw her
from the room as dartagnan sags on his knees before the
king he has served so faithfully

slowly phillippe lowers his head

int  dartagnans room

dartagnan returns to his bare room he sits down upon the
bed and drops his face into his hands

then he hears the sound like a scream but short and
muffled almost like the whelp of a kicked dog  he lifts his
head sharply where did that sound come from  he is almost
too tired too sad to investigate

then the king already shaken by the nights events hurries
into dartagnans room

                     louis
          what was that sound  did you hear
          it  it came from michelles room

int  kings bedchamber

dartagnan enters ahead of louis  they see nothing unusual
and dartagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward michelles
apartment

michelles apartment

dartagnan enters the room and finds it empty  but the
window is open  he moves toward it

int  kings bedchamber

the king is pacing as dartagnan reappears

                     louis
          where is michelle

                     dartagnan
          there

he points to the window  louis shoves open the drapes and
leaps back in horror  michelle has hanged herself outside
louis window the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose
around her neck

int  queen mothers apartments  dawn

anne has changed she is tormented but alive with energy
pacing  there is a knock at her door and the old nun opens
it to dartagnan  the old nun leaves them alone dartagnan
moves to anne and takes her hands to look into her eyes

                     dartagnan
          there were two  not one  but two

                     anne
          i couldnt tell you  you had enough
          to carry

                     dartagnan
          anne the night we had together
          i always wanted more  but that one
          it was enough  enough to make me
          love you forever  i want you to
          remember that and go on  as
          strong as you are now  no matter
          what happens

he kisses her  she drinks in his love  then he stands and
moves to the door  he looks back then stares out

                     anne
          dartagnan  

he looks back once more he seems to want to tell her
something but whatever it is he cant find the words and
with a last loving look at her he walks away

ext  establishing the bastille  night

a sudden visual establishing the bastille the horrific
legendary prison of paris

int  bastille  night

phillippe his head covered in a burlap hood is rushed
through the twisting stairways of the prison

int  a cell in the bowels of the bastille

the guards remove the hood and phillippe sees the cell
then he sees the blacksmith there with a new iron mask and
his eyes take on a fresh horror

                     phillippe
          no  please  no

the guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over
phillippes face as he screams  they seal the mask with a
small padlock whose key is distinctive and jeweled

int  bastille  later

the two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after
completing their work  far above them in the prison tower
the cries of the prisoner echo he sounds like a raving
madman now

the two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base
of the tower the bastille jailer looks up

                     blacksmith
          pay me quick i want out of here

soldiers swords drawn appear in the doorway behind them

                     guards
          what 

                     bastille jailer
          you saw the prisoners face

understanding the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the
soldiers but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer and
the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him  a soldier
lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard

the key

is handed to the king by andre the young lieutenant  louis
hangs the key around his own neck with a thin gold chain

                     louis
          now  where is dartagnan

                     lieutenant
          out directing the search for the
          traitors

                     louis
          when he returns watch him  when he
          leaves again you tell me

the lieutenant bows  louis smiles and fingers the key

ext  paris streets  night

squads of young musketeers gallop along the river and
through the dark streets around it searching

along the back wall of notre dame cathedral three forms
scurry through the darkness  aramis porthos and athos
heaving wheezing  they duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by  then aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in

int  catacombs

the three musketeers struggle through the catacombs reach
the chapel and fall gasping to the floor

                     aramis
          bloody hell

                     athos
          we cant stay here  that traitor
          dartagnan knows about this
          place

                     porthos
          can we eat before we go  this
          excitements given me an appetite

                     aramis
          bread and wine in that cupboard

porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of
the lantern  the rising light reveals a note stuck to the
cupboard with the blade of a dagger

                     porthos
          a note  pinned with a dagger like
          the old days

he removes the note and reads

                     porthos
          phillippe has been removed to the
          bastille to the lower dungeon  at
          midnight tonight i will order the
          guard changed and will delay the
          replacements for ten minutes  that
          should give you ample time  never
          have i needed more to say  one for
          all and all for one  dartagnan

                     athos
          he lures us to capture

                     aramis
          he seeks redemption

                     athos
          youre a fool

                     aramis
          perhaps  but of dartagnan i am
          certain  what he did tonight was
          what he told us all along he would
          do  be faithful to his king

                     athos
          so what has changed

                     aramis
          perhaps he serves a different king

                     porthos
          what choice is there  if phillippe
          is in the bastille then to the
          bastille we will go

                     athos
          you are right  but it is a trap

                     porthos
          so what  id rather die covered in
          blood than an old man lying in my
          own piss

                     aramis
          then to the bastille

                     athos
          to the bastille  and death

ext  bastille  night

the stone walls rising into the paris night seem to ooze
evil  the building looks impossible to get into much less
get out of its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood
encased in stone ramparts

we hear a sharp echoing knock aramis athos and porthos
stand outside the main entrance athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail

no one answers their knock the three musketeers exchange
doubtful glance and porthos knocks again  a guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door

                     porthos
          open up  we have a prisoner

the port shuts bolts rattle and the great door heaves open
the musketeers glance at each other again and play their
roles aramis and porthos dragging athos inside

int  the bastille  main courtyard  night

the prison courtyard is murky in the darkness and ringed by
doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons

                     guard
          take him down to level three  the
          captain will see to the documents

aramis and porthos drag athos into one of the shadowy portals
surrounding the courtyard

int  bastille  various shots  night

the three musketeers duck into the inky shadows aramis cuts
the bonds that hold athos hands and gives him the extra
sword he had beneath his cloak

                     porthos
          it worked

                     athos
          its a prison you idiot  they
          dont expect anyone to try getting
          in  the problem will come when we
          want out

aramis shushes them and leads them into another quiet
corridor  they hear the distant bells of a church then
suddenly they must scramble as a platoon of guards carrying
torches troop up stairs into the corridor the musketeers
dart like rats into dark nooks as the guards pass the
musketeers huddle and the bells end their tolling

                     aramis
          midnight  we have ten minutes

they press on deeper into the bastille

int  palace  annes room  night

anne moves to the window where she starts to kneel for her
nightly prayer but she stops  outside in the garden far
below her window is dartagnan on horseback waiting  their
eyes connect  he has a single rose in his hand  never
taking his eyes from her he places the rose on the stone
bench of the garden and reins his horse away

then she understands what he was trying to tell her before
in the hallway it was goodbye

ext  palace garden  night

dartagnan rides away quickly passing  without seeing 
lieutenant andre who has been watching him

ext  paris streets  night

through the night dartagnan gallops  we see his destination
in the distance  the bastille

ext  the palace gates  night

the great gates of the palace swing slowly open and out ride
a whole platoon of young musketeers surrounding louis
himself on horseback and dressed like a soldier

int  the bastille  various shots

the three musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs
through another corridor down another stairway  they pass
cells wretched prisoners look up but none of them is
phillippe  then the musketeers surprise a jailer

                     jailer
          hey

but before the man can say anything else porthos has crushed
him like a bug against the wall  they rip the huge ring of
keys from the jailers waist and take his torch

phillippes cell

he lies on the floor he sees the light of a torch coming to
him like sunrise and then he hears a voice 

                     athos
          phillippe

                     phillippe
          how did you 

they open the door and release him  from the cell but not
from the mask  he tries to hug athos

they head back the way they came

ext  paris streets  night

louis and his platoon of young musketeers ride through the
streets scattering the paupers who sleep there

int  bastille  various shots  night

back up the stairs through one corridor they start up
the second flight of stairs then stop and scramble back

                     aramis
               whispering
          someones coming

they take cover on either side of the corridor and lift
their swords  its a man coming down the stairs with a
hooded lantern they raise their swords to strike 

                     porthos
          dartagnan

                     dartagnan
          the way is blocked above  the
          captain of the bastille has turned
          back from the mission i sent him on
          and is in the courtyard with a party
          of men

                     athos
          he lies  he is here to trap us

                     dartagnan
          i came to see you safely out  check
          for yourself

porthos climbs the stairs to check dartagnan looks at
phillippe in the mask

                     dartagnan
          all you have suffered i would
          gladly have borne myself to keep it
          from you

athos spits on the floor in derision  but porthos comes
barreling back down the stairway

                     porthos
          dartagnan is right the courtyard
          is filling with soldiers

                     dartagnan
          this way

he leads them quickly down a side corridor the others have
no choice but to follow

a side corridor

dartagnan leads them around another corner into a long
corridor at the end of it is a massive door  they reach it
and dartagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal
seal of the musketeers he begins unlocking the three
padlocks that secure the door

                     dartagnan
          once you are through dont stop
          until you reach the river

                     aramis
          they will know you helped us if we
          go this way

                     dartagnan
          that doesnt matter now

they open the door and as they do they see louis and his
platoon of young musketeers arriving outside

                     louis
          there  stop them

                     athos
          betrayed

the young musketeers serving the king jump from their horses
and grab for the door but dartagnan leaps forward his
sword flashing  after a second of surprise athos aramis
and porthos jump forward too and there is a brief bloody
skirmish at the door  but the young musketeers have
overwhelming numbers and firearms too protecting phillippe
the old musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling
the door shut and latching it quickly

                     aramis
          back the way we came

they race back up the corridor  the four musketeers and
phillippe in the iron mask  and turn the corner  they
reach another inner door pass through it  and see the
soldiers of the bastille coming at them

                     aramis
          back

they retreat and porthos slams the second door  like all
the inner doors of the bastille its heavy wood a foot
thick and porthos seals it with a huger iron bar  but
theres nowhere else to run

                     athos
          trapped

at the far end of the corridor the kings young musketeers
have the same keys to the outer door that dartagnan did and
they are breaking through  louis and two dozen of his
personal bodyguard pour through the door

                     louis
          charge them

the young musketeers obediently charge down the corridor

stepping up shoulder to shoulder  aramis dartagnan
athos porthos  the four veteran musketeers meet the
charge first with pistols then with swords a wall between
louis men and phillippe  the battle in the cramped confines
of the corridor is bloody and fierce the young attackers can
only get a few men into the fight at any one time and those
who step before the famous veterans are cut down

louis young musketeers retreat to regroup

at louis end of the corridor

louis is furious jumping at lieutenant andre who has
dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight

                     louis
          cowards  twenty run from four

                     lieutenant
          the corridor nullifies our number
          and no one has stomach to fight the
          captain

louis is disgusted by this loyalty  and he has a solution

                     louis
          dartagnan

at the other end of the corridor

louis voice echoes down to the veteran musketeers and
phillippe in the iron mask

                     louis voice
          i am not angry with you  i knew you
          would lead me to them and so you
          have  lay down your sword and i
          will not punish you  i will let you
          retire in peace  to live out your
          days in the countryside  and i will
          give your friends a swift execution
          if you surrender now

the words bounce down the long corridor then silence
dartagnan stands holding his sword staring away from his
friends toward the king and his gang of young musketeers

                     aramis
          dartagnan  perhaps you should
          accept his offer for we are dead
          anyway

                     porthos
          he is right dartagnan

athos says nothing but when dartagnan looks at him he
lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted dartagnans
loyalty and friendship

phillippe speaks up from behind the iron mask

                     phillippe
          wait  bargain me to louis for all
          your lives  you have done your
          best  let me go and let all of you
          find peace

                     dartagnan
          no  even if i could give up my
          friends i could never give up my
          son

this hits them like a bombshell  and suddenly it all makes
sense dartagnans loyalty to louis his dogged hope that he
could somehow influence him toward goodness  we see their
stunned faces each in turn  athos aramis porthos and
phillippe

                     dartagnan
          i never had any idea you existed
          until they found you  and in all
          that time i never had a moments
          pride as a father  until now

dartagnan and phillippe embrace lost father to lost son

from the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful
pounding the bastilles soldiers are trying to break it
down  time is running out

aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the
outside barred now by louis and his young guards their long
muskets bristling like spikes and yet that way is the only
possible hope for escape to the outside

                     aramis
          dartagnan those are young
          musketeers down there  they have
          been weaned on our legends  they
          revere us  it is an advantage
          why dont we charge them

                     dartagnan
          i trained those men myself  they
          will stand and fight  but if we are
          to die let it be this way

he draws his sword and points it into the air  aramis lifts
the tip of his sword to join that of dartagnan  porthos
does too and then athos joins them

                     athos
          one for all  all for one

                     phillippe
          if i could have a blade then i
          would be please to run with you

dartagnan gives phillippe a dagger  they look at each
other  then dartagnan begins to scream  the others take up
the shout  then they step around the corner and charge

the last charge of the musketeers

we film it in all its glory a visual feast  the last charge
of the musketeers  their capes swirl about time their hair
flies their legs take on new life

at first the young musketeers at the end of the corridor are
frozen in surprise their youthful lieutenant is awed by the
dashing beautiful bravery of the thing

                     lieutenant
          magnificent valor

                     louis
          shoot them  shoot them

louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and
fires  sssboom  with the first explosion of gunfire the
others pull their triggers the powder in their weapons
flashes and crashes

the musket balls fly down the hallway sparking off the stone
walls and floor ricocheting punching holes through the
capes and flesh but still the musketeers charge like the
young men they once were  still are in spirit

in the confines of the bastilles stone corridor the noise is
deafening and the space in front of the guards is filled
with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder  none of them can
see anything beyond it and all is quiet

                     lieutenant
          draw blades

the kings guards draw their swords and wait are all the
old musketeers dead

slowly the figures emerge from the smoke  in slow motion
walking now no need to run  all are wounded but all are
still alive

the four musketeers along with phillippe move slowly and
steadily toward the blades of the young guards a fight to
the death  so be it

but the young lieutenant will have none of it as one of his
men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of dartagnan
the young lieutenant bats the sword down with his own

                     lieutenant
          stop

he steps forward toward dartagnan but instead of thrusting
his sword he salutes with it

his men follow suit saluting and bowing to the courage of
these men they have grown up wanting to follow

king louis for the moment is frozen

dartagnan looks back at phillippe he has bullet holes in
two different places at the edges of his clothes but he is
unwounded

then dartagnan sees louis with his long dagger leaping at
phillippe

                     dartagnan
          no

dartagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls
louis backwards then spins to phillippe

                     dartagnan
          phillippe

                     phillippe
          i am unhurt 

louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again driving
the blade into dartagnans back

dartagnans face jolts he staggers his legs buckle
dartagnan falls into the arms of his friends

louis stands holding his bloody dagger everyone staring at
him  dartagnan the old musketeers the young ones

                     phillippe
          you  vicious evil

he leaps into louis overwhelming him in fury wrenching the
dagger from his brothers hand and gripping his throat

                     dartagnan
          phillippe  no dont he is
          your brother

phillippe releases louis who falls choking gasping
lieutenant andre is surprised by what he just heard

                     lieutenant
          brother

phillippe darts to dartagnan being cradled by athos athos
lifts a hand from dartagnans back it is drenched in blood
dartagnan is dying

athos aramis porthos none of them can speak  they grip
dartagnan as if through their will alone they could keep
his life from leaking away  the young musketeers stand
transfixed watching their legendary captain die  phillippe
sags his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief

                     phillippe
          all this time i was a lost
          secret  but you were hiding all
          your loyalty all your love  you
          were the man in the iron mask

                     athos
          dartagnan

                     dartagnan
          shhh  all my life this is the
          death i have wanted  to die among
          you  one for all and all for

he is gone

phillippe rises with a slow terrible resolve and moves to
louis  when louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the
blade of the young lieutenant andre pointed at his chest

                     lieutenant
          all my life all i ever wanted to
          be was him

he points to dartagnan  phillippe rips away the key that
dangles around louis neck

                                                  cut to

at the other door

where the soldiers of the bastilles commander are finally
breaking through working the massive door aside they find 

the king with his guards and aramis athos porthos along
with their prisoner in the iron mask

                     lieutenant
          we have recaptured the prisoner

                     man in the iron mask
          no no  i am your 

a blow in his chest from the lieutenant stuns the prisoner
and drops him to his knees  the king orders the bastille
governor 

                     king
          you will put this madman where no
          one can hear his insanity  let him
          be fed by a deaf mute  but feed him
          well and let him have a long life
          within the iron mask

                     bastille governor
          and them

he means aramis porthos and athos

                     king
          they are my loyal servants

                     man in the iron mask
          no  no

but the guards are dragging him to the deepest darkest
dungeon of the bastille

                                             dissolve to

ext  lane of elms  beside the palace  day

at the end of a lane of elms where the markers of kings
graves stand clustered royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of dartagnan

athos aramis porthos and the king  phillippe known as
king louis now  stand gathered there as aramis in his
priests garments utters the funeral incantations  aramis
voice breaks as he does so  porthos eyes pour out rivers of
tears  athos grief is beyond weeping

phillippe holds the arm of his mother  she holds the rose
dartagnan left her

                     aramis
          amen

athos moves up between aramis and porthos and links them
with his arms

                     athos
          he was the best of us all

aramis and porthos move off together to walk the lane of
elms athos remains by the grave unable to leave

phillippe pats annes arm

                     phillippe
          i will be with you in a moment
          mother

she too moves down the lane of trees touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face

phillippe moves up to athos

                     phillippe
          after all you have done i must ask
          you one more service to your king
          i have lost my father  and you have
          lost your son  let me love you like
          a son to a father  and i pray you
          live for this to love me like your
          son

athos cant speak he can only nod yes  phillippe moves to
join his mother leaving athos to take one final look down at
the grave  then as athos moves off to join aramis and
porthos we pan from the name dartagnan on the stone to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name

it is a mask of iron

                                                fade out
