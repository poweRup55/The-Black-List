fade in

on computer screen

so close it has no boundaries

a blinking cursor pulses in the electronic darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light burning beneath the
derma of blackneon glass

a phone begins to ring we hear it as though we were
making the call  the cursor continues to throb
relentlessly patient until 

                         man vo
          yeah

data now slashes across the screen information flashing
faster than we can read  call trans opt  received
21996 132418  reclog

                         woman vo
          is everything in place

the man is silent  on screen  trace program  running

we listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a
third line  the mans name is cypher  the woman
trinity

                         trinity woman vo
          i said is everything in place

the entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers
shimmering like greenelectric rivers they rush at a 10
digit phone number in the top corner

                         cypher man vo
          you werent supposed to relieve me

                         trinity vo
          i know but i felt like taking a
          shift

the area code is identified  the first three numbers
suddenly fixed leaving only seven flowing columns

                         cypher vo
          you like him dont you  you like
          watching him

we begin moving toward the screen closing in as each
digit is matched one by one snapping into place like the
wheels of a slot machine

                         trinity vo
          dont be ridiculous

                         cypher vo
          were going to kill him  do you
          understand that  hes going to die
          just like the others

                         trinity vo
          morpheus believes he is the one

only two thin digits left

                         cypher vo
          do you

                         trinity vo
          i it doesnt matter what i
          believe

                         cypher vo
          you dont do you

                         trinity vo
          if you have something to say i
          suggest you say it to morpheus

                         cypher vo
          i intend to believe me  someone
          has to

the final number pops into place 

                         trinity vo
          did you hear that

                         cypher vo
          hear what

on screen  trace complete call origin  3125550690

                         trinity vo
          are you sure this line is clean

                         cypher vo
          yeah course im sure

we move still closing the electric hum of the green
numbers growing into an ominous roar

                         trinity vo
          i better go

she hangs up as we pass through the numbers entering the
nether world of the computer screen

suddenly a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
ourselves in 


int  chase hotel  night

the hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across
the polyester carpeting destroying several rooms as it
spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of
permanent shadow

we follow four armed police officers using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on
either side of room 303

the biggest of them violently kicks in the door 

the other cops pour in behind him guns thrust before
them

                         big cop
          police  freeze

the room is almost devoid of furniture  there is a fold
up table and chair with a phone a modem and a powerbook
computer  the only light in the room is the glow of the
computer

sitting there her hands still on the keyboard is
trinity a woman in black leather

                         big cop
          hands behind your head  now  do
          it

she slowly puts her hands behind her head


ext  chase hotel  night

a black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers

agent smith and agent brown get out of the car

they wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night  they
are also always hardwired small secret service earphones
in one ear the cord coiling back into their shirt
collars

                         agent smith
          lieutenant

                         lieutenant
          oh shit

                         agent smith
          lieutenant you were given specific
          orders 

                         lieutenant
          im just doing my job  you gimme
          that jurismydicktion and you can
          cram it up your ass

                         agent smith
          the orders were for your
          protection

the lieutenant laughs

                         lieutenant
          i think we can handle one little
          girl

agent smith nods to agent brown as they start toward the
hotel

                         lieutenant
          i sent two units  theyre bringing
          her down now

                         agent smith
          no lieutenant your men are already
          dead


int  chase hotel

the big cop flicks out his cuffs the other cops holding a
bead  theyve done this a hundred times they know
theyve got her until the big cop reaches with the cuffs
and trinity moves 

it almost doesnt register so smooth and fast inhumanly
fast

the eye blinks and trinitys palm snaps up and his nose
explodes blood erupting  her leg kicks with the force of
a wrecking ball and he flies back a twohundredfifty
pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop
farthest from her

trinity moves again bullets raking the walls flashlights
sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try to stop a
leatherclad ghost

a gun still in the cops hand is snatched twisted and
fired  there is a final violent exchange of gunfire and
when its over trinity is the only one standing

a flashlight rocks slowly to a stop

                         trinity
          shit


ext  chase hotel

agent brown enters the hotel while agent smith heads for
the alley


int  chase hotel

trinity is on the phone pacing  the other end is
answered

                         man vo
          operator

                         trinity
          morpheus  the line was traced  i
          dont know how

                         morpheus man vo
          i know  they cut the hardline
          this line is not a viable exit

                         trinity
          are they any agent

                         morpheus vo
          yes

                         trinity
          goddamnit

                         morpheus vo
          you have to focus  there is a
          phone  wells and lake  you can
          make it

she takes a deep breath centering herself

                         trinity
          all right 

                         morpheus vo
          go

she drops the phone


int  hall

she bursts out of the room as agent brown enters the hall
leading another unit of police  trinity races to the
opposite end exiting through a broken window onto the
fire escape


ext  fire escape

in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at
her  she can only go up


ext  roof

on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over
the parapet leading the cops in pursuit

trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her
movements so clean gliding in and out of each jump
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops

agent brown however has the same unnatural grace

the metal scream of an elevated train is heard and trinity
turns to it racing for the back of the building

the edge falls away into a wide back alley  the next
building is over 40 feet away but trinitys face is
perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other
roof

the cops slow realizing they are about to see something
ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself into
the air

from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight 

then hitting somersaulting up still running hard

                         cop
          mutherfucker  thats impossible

they stare slackjawed as agent brown duplicates the
move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto one
knee

just below the building are the rumbling tracks of riveted
steel  the train screeches beneath her a rattling blur
of gray metal  trinity jumps landing easily

she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air
barely reaching the last car 

agent brown stands yanking out a gun

trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head

ahead she sees her only chance 50 feet beyond the point
where the train has begun to turn there is 

a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
building

trinity zeros in on it running as hard as she can her
speed compounded by the train  the scream of the steel
rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
turn

trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body
leveling into a dive  she falls arms covering her head
as 


her pov

the whole world seems to spin on its axis 


back to scene

and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then
falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down
stairs bleeding broken 

but still alive

through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown
still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the wind
stonefaced he touches his ear piece as the train slides
him past the window

trinity tries to move  everything hurts

                         trinity
          get up trinity  youre fine  get
          up  just get up

she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs

trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the
end of the block in a pool of white street light she
sees it

the telephone booth

obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk
focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone
begins to ring

across the street a garbage truck suddenly turns uturns
its tires screaming as it accelerates

trinity sees the headlights of the truck arcing at the
telephone booth as if taking aim

gritting through the pain she races the truck 

slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly bright
bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as 

she answers the phone

there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk 

barrelling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick
wall smashing it to plexiglas pulp

after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck  agent smith inspects the wreckage
there is no body  trinity is gone

his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration
agent jones walks up behind him

                         agent jones
          then the informant is real

                         agent smith
          does that surprise you  it was
          inevitable

                         agent jones
          hell be contacting us again

                         agent smith
          expect it  did you get anything
          from the room

                         agent jones
          their next target  the name is neo

the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground separated
in the crash like a severed limb

                         agent smith
          well need a search running

                         agent jones
          its already begun

we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer
and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out like
a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall through
one 

swallowed by darkness

the darkness begins to ripple with bright flashes of bone
white as we pull out of the eye of a skull

it is a computer screen saver the jolly roger flutters
against an electronic wind

we drift back from the screen and into 


int  neos apartment

it is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with
technology

weedlike cables coil everywhere ducttaped into thickets
that wind up and around the legs of several desks

tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
open like an autopsied corpse

at the center of this technological ratnest is neo a man
who knows more about living inside a computer than outside
one

he is asleep in front of his pc  behind him the computer
screen suddenly goes blank  a prompt appears  wake up
neo

neos eye pries open  he sits up one eye still closed
looking around unsure of where he is  he notices the
screen

he types ctrl x but the letter t appears

                         neo
          what

he hits another and an h appears  he keeps typing
pushing random functions and keys while the computer types
out a message as though it had a mind of its own

he stops and stares at the four words on the screen
the matrix has you

                         neo
          what the hell

he hits the esc button  another message appears
follow the white rabbit

he hits it again and the message repeats  he rubs his
eyes but when he opens them there is another message
knock knock neo

someone knocks on his door and he almost jumps out of his
chair  he looks back at the computer but the screen is
now blank

someone knocks again  neo rises still unnerved

                         neo
          who is it

                         choi os
          its choi

neo opens the door leaving the chain on  a young chinese
man stands with several of his friends

                         neo
          youre two hours late

                         choi
          i know  its her fault

his girlfriend only has to smile

                         neo
          you got the money

                         choi
          two grand

he takes out an envelope and gives it to neo through the
cracked door

                         neo
          hold on

he closes the door  on the floor near his bed is a book
baudrillards simulacra simulations  the book has been
hollowed out and inside are several computer disks  he
takes one sticks the money in the book and drops it on
the floor

opening the door he hands the disk to choi

                         choi
          hallelujah  you are my savior man
          my own personal jesus christ

                         neo
          if you get caught using that 

                         choi
          i know i know  this never
          happened  you dont exist

                         neo
          right

neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly
returns

                         choi
          something wrong man  you look a
          little whiter than usual

                         neo
          i dont know my computer

he looks back at choi unable to explain what just
happened

                         neo
          you ever have the feeling that
          youre not sure if youre awake or
          still dreaming

                         choi
          all the time  its called mescaline
          and it is the only way to fly

he smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog

                         choi
          it sounds to me like you need to
          unplug man  a little r and r
          what do you think dujour should we
          take him with us

                         dujour girlfriend

                         dujour
          come on  itll be fun  i promise

he looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins  bands symbols
slogans military medals and 

a small white rabbit

the room tilts

                         neo
          yeah yeah  sure ill go


int  apartment

an older apartment a series of halls connects a chain of
small highceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements

smoke hangs like a veil blurring the few lights there
are

dressed predominantly in black people are everywhere
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle
cats around a tree

neo stands against a wall alone sipping from a bottle of
beer feeling completely out of place he is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him

the woman is trinity  she walk straight up to him

in the nearest room shadowlike figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of industrial music

                         trinity
          hello neo

                         neo

          wanting to meet you for some time

          dbase

                         trinity
          that was a long time ago

                         neo
          geezus

                         trinity

                         trinity
          most guys do

                         neo
          do you want to go somewhere and
          talk

                         trinity
          no  its safe here and i dont have
          much time

the music is so loud they must stand very close talking
directly into each others ear

                         neo
          that was you on my computer

she nods

                         neo
          how did you do that

                         trinity
          right now all i can tell you is
          that you are in danger  i brought
          you here to warn you

                         neo
          of what

                         trinity
          theyre watching you neo

                         neo
          who is

                         trinity
          please  just listen  i know why
          youre here neo  i know why you
          left your family and your friends
          why you left your home to come to
          this city  youre looking for him

her body is against his her lips very close to his ear

                         trinity
          i know because i came looking for
          the same thing but when he found me
          he told me i wasnt really looking
          for him  i was looking for an
          answer

there is a hypnotic quality to her voice and neo feels the
words like a drug seeping into him

                         trinity
          its the question that brought you
          here  you know the question just as
          i did  it is a hackers question

                         neo
          what is the matrix

                         trinity
          when i asked him he said that no
          one could ever be told the answer to
          that question  they have to see it
          to believe it

she leans close her lips almost touching his ear

                         trinity
          the answer is out there neo  its
          looking for you and it will find
          you if you want it to

she turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies

a sound rises steadily growing out of the music pressing
in on neo until it is all he can hear as we 

                                            cut to

int  neos apartment

the sound is an alarm clock slowly dragging neo to
consciousness  he strains to read the clockface
915 am

                         neo
          shitshitshit


ext  skyscraper

the downtown office of cortechs a software development
company


int  cortechs office

the main offices are along each wall the windows
overlooking downtown  rhineheart the ultimate company
man lectures neo without looking at him typing at his
computer continuously

neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface
of the glass

                         rhineheart
          you have a problem with authority
          mr anderson  you believe that you
          are special that somehow the rules
          do not apply to you

he stops glancing over his glasses at neo who turns in
time

                         rhineheart
          obviously you are mistaken

his long bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard

                         rhineheart
          this company is one of the top
          software companies in the world
          because every single employee
          understands that they are part of a
          whole  thus if an employee has a
          problem the company has a problem

he turns again

                         rhineheart
          the time has come to make a choice
          mr anderson  either you choose to
          be at your desk on time from this
          day forth or you choose to find
          yourself another job  do i make
          myself clear

                         neo
          yes mr rhineheart  perfectly
          clear


int  neos cubicle

the entire floor looks like a human honeycomb with a
labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators

neo slumps down into his chair

                         voice os
          thomas anderson

neo turns and finds a federal express man at his cubicle
door

                         neo
          yeah  thats me

neo signs the electronic pad and the fedex man hands him
the softpak

                         fedex man
          have a nice day

he opens the bag  inside is a cellular phone  it seems
the instant it is in his hand it rings  unnerved he
flips it open

                         neo
          hello

                         morpheus vo
          hello neo  do you know who this
          is

neos knees give and he sinks into his chair

                         neo
          morpheus

                         morpheus vo
          ive been looking for you neo  i
          dont know if youre ready to see
          what i want to show you but
          unfortunately we have run out of
          time  theyre coming for you neo
          and im not sure what theyre going
          to do

                         neo
          whos coming for me

                         morpheus vo
          stand up and see for yourself

                         neo
          right now

                         morpheus vo
          yes  now

neo starts to stand

                         morpheus vo
          do it slowly  the elevator

his head peeks up over the partition

at the elevator he sees agent brown and agent jones
leading a group of cops  a female employee turns and
points out neos cubicle

neo ducks

                         neo
          holy fucking shit

                         morpheus vo
          yes

one cop stays at the elevator the others follow the
agents

                         neo
          what the fuck do they want with me

                         morpheus vo
          im not sure but if you dont want
          to find out you better get out of
          there

                         neo
          how

                         morpheus vo
          i can guide you out but you have to
          do exactly what i say

the agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle

                         morpheus vo
          the cubicle across from you is
          empty

                         neo
          but what if

                         morpheus vo
          go  now

neo lunges across the hall diving into the other cubicle
just as the agents turn into his row

neo crams himself into a dark corner clutching the phone
tightly to him

                         morpheus vo
          stay here for a moment

the agents enter neos empty cubicle  a cop is sent to
search the bathroom

morpheus voice is a whisper in neos ear

                         morpheus vo
          a little longer

brown is talking to another employee

                         morpheus vo
          when i tell you go to the end of
          the row to the first office on the
          left stay as low as you can

sweat trickles down his forehead

                         morpheus vo
          now

neo rolls out of the cubicle his eyes popping as he
freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around

staying crouched he sneaks away down the row shooting
across the opening to the first office on the left

the room is empty

                         morpheus vo
          good  now there is a window  open
          it

                         neo
          how do you know all this

morpheus laughs quietly

                         morpheus
          the answer is coming neo

he opens the window  the wind howls into the room

                         morpheus vo
          outside theres a scaffold  you
          can use it to get to the roof

leaning out the window he sees that the scaffold is
several offices away

                         neo
          no  its too far away

                         morpheus vo
          theres a small ledge  its a short
          climb  you can make it

neo looks down the buildings glass wall vertigoes into a
concrete chasm

                         neo
          no way no way this is crazy

                         morpheus vo
          there are only two ways out of this
          building  one is that scaffold
          the other is in their custody  you
          take a chance either way  i leave
          it to you

click  he hangs up  neo looks at the door then back at
the scaffold

                         neo
          this is insane  why is this
          happening to me  what did i do
          im nobody  i didnt do anything
          fuck  fuck  fuck

he climbs up onto the window ledge  hanging onto the
frame he steps onto the small ledge

the scaffold seems even farther away

                         neo
          im going to die

the wind suddenly blasts up the face of the building
knocking neo off balance  recoiling he clings harder to
the frame and the phone falls out of his hand

he watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him

                         neo
          this is insane  i cant do this
          forget it

he climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door

                         neo
          i didnt do anything


ext  skyscraper

the agents lead a handcuffed neo out of the revolving
doors forcing his head down as they push him into the
dark sedan

trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle

                         trinity
          shit


int  interrogation room

close on a camera monitor wide angle view of a white room
where neo is sitting at a table alone

we move into the monitor entering the room as if the
monitor was a window

at the same moment the door opens and the agents enter
agent smith sits down across from neo  a thick manila
envelope slaps down on the table between them

neo glances at the name on the file anderson thomas a

                         agent smith
          as you can see weve had our eye on
          you for some time now mr anderson

he opens the file  paper rattle marks the silence as he
flips several pages  neo cannot tell if he is looking at
the file or at him

                         agent smith
          it seems that you have been living
          two lives  in one life you are
          thomas a anderson program writer
          for a respectable software company
          you have a social security number
          you pay your taxes and you help your
          landlady carry out her garbage

the pages continue to turn

                         agent smith
          the other life is lived in computers
          where you go by the hacker alias
          neo and are guilty of virtually
          every computer crime we have a law
          for

neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit

                         agent smith
          one of these lives has a future
          one of them does not

he closes the file

                         agent smith
          im going to be as forthcoming as i
          can be mr anderson  you are here
          because we need your help

he removes his sunglasses his eyes are unnatural ice
blue

                         agent smith
          we know that you have been contacted
          by a certain individual  a man who
          calls himself morpheus  whatever
          you think you know about this man is
          irrelevant to the fact that he is
          wanted for acts of terrorism in more
          countries than any other man in the
          world  he is considered by many
          authorities to be the most dangerous
          man alive

he leans closer

                         agent smith
          my colleagues believe that i am
          wasting my time with you but i
          believe you want to do the right
          thing  it is obvious that you are
          an intelligent man mr anderson
          and that you are interested in the
          future  that is why i believe you
          are ready to put your past mistakes
          behind you and get on with your
          life

neo stares to match his stare

                         agent smith
          we are willing to wipe the slate
          clean to give you a fresh start and
          all we are asking in return is your
          cooperation in bringing a known
          terrorist to justice

neo nods to himself

                         neo
          yeah  wow  that sounds like a real
          good deal  but i think i have a
          better one  how about i give you
          the finger 

he does

                         neo
          and you can cram that file up your
          secret service sphincter

agent smith puts his glasses back on

                         agent smith
          you disappoint me mr anderson

                         neo
          you cant scare me with gestapo
          crap  i know my rights  i want my
          phone call

agent smith smiles

                         agent smith
          and tell me mr anderson what good
          is a phone call if you are unable to
          speak

the question unnerves neo and strangely he begins to feel
the muscles in his jaw tighten

the standing agents snicker watching neos confusion grow
into panic

neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut melding into each other until all traces of his
mouth are gone

wild with fear he lunges for the door but the agents
restrain him holding him in the chair

                         agent smith
          you are going to help us mr
          anderson whether you want to or
          not

smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt

from a case taken out of his suit coat smith removes a
long fiberoptic wire tap

neo struggles helplessly as smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen  horrified he watches as the
electronic device animates becoming an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm

thin whiskerlike tendrils reach out and probe into neos
navel  he bucks wildly as smith drops the creature which
looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord 

 before it begins to borrow its tall thrashing as it
worms its way inside


int  neos apartment

screaming neo bolts upright in bed

he realizes that he is home  was it a dream  his mouth
is normal  his stomach looks fine  he starts to take a
deep everythingisokay breath when 

the phone rings

it almost stops his heart  it continues ringing building
pressure in the room forcing him up out of bed sucking
him in with an almost gravitational force

he answers it saying nothing

                         morpheus vo
          this line is tapped so i must be
          brief

                         neo
          the agents 

                         morpheus vo
          they got to you first but theyve
          underestimated how important you
          are  if they knew what i know you
          would probably be dead

                         neo
          what do you know

                         morpheus vo
          youre the one neo  you see you
          may have spent the last few years
          looking for me but ive spent most
          of my life looking for you

neo feels sick

                         morpheus vo
          do you still want to meet

                         neo
           yes

                         morpheus vo
          go the the adams street bridge

click  he closes his eyes unsure of what he has done


ext  city street  night

it is just beyond the middle of the night that time when
it seems there are no rules and everything feels unsafe

neos boots scrape against the concrete  every pair of
eyes he passes seems to follow him

as he reaches the bridge headlights creep in behind him
he turns just as the car slides quickly to a stop beside
him  the back door opens

                         trinity
          get in


int  car

a large black man named apoc is driving  beside him is a
beautiful androgyne called switch aiming a large gun at
neo

                         neo
          what the hell is this

                         trinity
          its necessary neo  for our
          protection

                         neo
          from what

                         trinity
          from you

she lifts a strange steel and glass device that looks like
a cross between a rib separator speculum and air
compressor

                         switch
          take off your shirt

he looks at the strange device and the gun still trained
on him

                         neo
          what  why

                         switch
          stop the car

apoc does

                         switch
          listen to me coppertop  we dont
          have time for twenty questions
          right now there is only one rule
          our way or the highway

                         neo
          fine

                         trinity
          no we cant let him go 

neo opens the door

                         trinity
          neo please you have to trust me

                         neo
          why

                         trinity
          because youve been down there neo
          you already know that road  you
          know exactly where it ends

neo stares out into the dark street beyond the open door

                         trinity
          and i know thats not where you want
          to be

                         neo
           shit

he closes the door


ext  lower wacker

a moment later the green lights of lower wacker curve over
the cars tinted windshield as it rushes through the
underworld


int  car

neo grudgingly strips off his tshirt

                         trinity
          lie back

trinity sets the device over neos stomach its three
corners resting on the points of his pelvis and sternum
she then guides a mounted cylindrical probe into his navel
and squeezes a hand pump a few times to form a tight seal

                         neo
          what is this thing

                         trinity
          we think youre bugged  try to
          relax

she turns a dial and the machine bears down on neos
midsection the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach

neo screams squinting in pain as trinity watches the
needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily

                         trinity
          come on come on

the machine quivers as the pressure builds higher and
higher until something finally rockets wetly out of neos
stomach through the machines coils

                         trinity
          got it

trinity shuts off the compressor neo cradling his
stomach

                         neo
          got what  my spleen

trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing
inside the small flukelike bug flips and squirms its
tendrils flapping against the clear walls

she unrolls the window and dumps it out


ext  car

it hits the pavement with a metallic tink reverted back
into a common wire tap as the car disappears down the
street


ext  hotel lafayette

the car stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
hotel


int  lafayette

it is a place of putrefying elegance a rotting host of
urban maggotry

trinity leads neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
thirteenth floor  they stop outside room 1313

                         trinity
          this is it

neo can hear his own heart pounding

                         trinity
          let me give one piece of advice  be
          honest  he knows more than you can
          possibly imagine


int  room 1313

across the room a dark figure stares out the tall windows
veiled with decaying lace  he turns and his smile lights
up the room

                         morpheus
          at last

he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses

he strides to neo and they shake hands

                         morpheus
          welcome neo  as you no doubt have
          guessed i am morpheus

                         neo
          its an honor

                         morpheus
          please  come  sit

he nods to trinity

                         morpheus
          thank you trinity

she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
adjacent room

they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy
leather chairs

                         morpheus
          i imagine right now you must be
          feeling a bit like alice tumbling
          down the rabbit hole

                         neo
          you could say that

                         morpheus
          i can see it in your eyes  you have
          the look of a man who accepts what
          he sees because he is expecting to
          wake up

a smile razorthin curls the corner of his lips

                         morpheus
          ironically this is not far from the
          truth  but im getting ahead of
          myself  can you tell me neo why
          are you here

                         neo
          youre morpheus youre a legend
          most hackers would die to meet you

                         morpheus
          yes  thank you  but i think we
          both know theres more to it than
          that  do you believe in fate neo

                         neo
          no

                         morpheus
          why not

                         neo
          because i dont like the idea that
          im not in control of my life

                         morpheus
          i know exactly what you mean

again that smile that could cut glass

                         morpheus
          let me tell you why you are here
          you have come because you know
          something  what you know you cant
          explain but you feel it  youve
          felt it your whole life felt that
          something is wrong with the world
          you dont know what but its there
          like a splinter in your mind
          driving you mad  it is this feeling
          that brought you to me  do you know
          what im talking about

                         neo
          the matrix

                         morpheus
          do you want to know what it is

neo swallows hard and nods

                         morpheus
          the matrix is everywhere its all
          around us here even in this room
          you can see it out your window or on
          your television  you feel it when
          you go to work or go to church or
          pay your taxes  it is the world
          that has been pulled over your eyes
          to blind you from the truth

                         neo
          what truth

                         morpheus
          that you are a slave neo  like
          everyone else you were born into
          bondage kept inside a prison that
          you cannot smell taste or touch
          a prison for your mind

the leather creaks as he leans back

                         morpheus
          unfortunately no one can be told
          what the matrix is  you have to see
          it for yourself

morpheus opens his hands  in the right is a red pill  in
the left a blue pill

                         morpheus
          this is your last chance  after
          this there is no going back  you
          take the blue pill and the story
          ends  you wake in your bed and you
          believe whatever you want to
          believe

the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses

                         morpheus
          you take the red pill and you stay
          in wonderland and i show you how
          deep the rabbit hole goes

neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules the moisture
growing in his palms

                         morpheus
          remember that all i am offering is
          the truth  nothing more

neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill  the
cheshire smile returns

                         morpheus
          follow me

he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with
hightech equipment glowing ashblue and electric green
from the racks of monitors

trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter

                         morpheus
          apoc are we online

                         apoc
          almost

he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex
system of monitors modules and drives

                         morpheus
          neo time is always against us
          will you take a seat there

neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and trinity
begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head
arms and the back of his neck  near the chair is an old
oval dressing mirror that is cracked

he whispers to trinity

                         neo
          you did all this

she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears  they
are wired to an old hotel phone

                         morpheus
          the pill you took is part of a trace
          program  its designed to disrupt
          your inputoutput carrier signal so
          we can pinpoint your location

                         neo
          what does that mean

                         cypher
          it means buckle up dorothy cause
          kansas is going byebye

distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding
on a keyboard  sweat beads his face  his eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror

wideeyed he stares as it begins to heal itself a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid

                         neo
          shit

cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
data  trinity monitors neos electric vital signs

neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
disappear beneath the rippling surface

quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirroredtaffy
stuck to his fingertips

                         morpheus
          have you ever had a dream neo that
          you were so sure was real

                         neo
          this cant be

                         morpheus
          be what  be real

the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break

                         morpheus
          what if you were unable to wake from
          that dream neo  how would you know
          the difference between the dream
          world and the real world

with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes of
electricblinking mercury fall hit the ground and fade

neo looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running like
wax down his fingers spreading across his palm where he
sees his face reflected

                         neo
          uhoh

                         trinity
          its going into replication

                         morpheus
          apoc

                         apoc
          still nothing

morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number

                         morpheus
          tank were going to need the signal
          soon

the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up
his arms like hundreds of insects

                         neo
          its cold

the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror trying to keep his mouth up

                         neo
          its all over me 

morpheus is right next to him with the phone

                         trinity
          i got a fibrillation

                         morpheus
          shit  apoc

streams of mercury run from neos nose

                         apoc
          targeting almost there

an alarm on trinitys monitor erupts

                         trinity
          hes going into arrest

                         apoc
          lock  i got him

                         morpheus
          now tank now

his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a
highpitched electric scream erupts in the headphones 

it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to another
computer 

neos body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
pulled into the holes of the phone 

 sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness


int  power plant  close on mans body

floating in a wombred amnion

his body spasms fighting against the thick gelatin

metal tubes surreal versions of hospital tubes obscure
his face  other lines like ivs are connected to limbs and
cover his genitals

he is struggling desperately now  air bubbles into the
jello but does not break the surface

pressing up the surface distends stretching like a red
rubber cocoon

unable to breathe he fights wildly to stand clawing at
the thinning elastic shroud 

until it ruptures a hole widening around his mouth as he
sucks for air  tearing himself free he emerges from the
cell

it is neo

he is bald and naked his body slick with gelatin  dizzy
nauseous he waits for his vision to focus

he is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
with red gelatin the surface of which has solidified like
curdled milk

the ivs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
to be grafted to his flesh

he feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
plugged and locked into the base of his skull

he tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off
a finger

to either side he sees other tubeshaped pods filled with
red gelatin beneath the waxlike surface pale and
motionless he sees other human beings

fanning out in a circle there are more  all connected to
a center coreeach capsule like a red dimlyglowing petal
attached to a black metal stem

above him level after level the stem rises seemingly
forever  he moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
out

the image assaults his mind

towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
heights disappearing down into a dim murk like an
underwater abyss

his sight is blurred and warped exaggerating the
intensity of the vision  the sound of the plant is like
the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
leviathan

from above a machine drops directly in front of neo  he
swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him

it is almost insectlike in its design beautiful housings
of alloyed metal covering organiclike systems of hard and
soft polymers

the machine seizes hold of neo paralyzing him as the
cable lock at the back of his neck spins and opens

the cable disengages itself  a long clear plastic needle
and cerebrumchip slides from the anterior of neos skull
with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid  the other
connective hoses snap free and snake away as the machine
lets neo go

suddenly the back of the unit opens and a tremendous
vacuum like an airplane door opening sucks the gelatin
and then neo into a black hole


int  waste line

the pipe is a waste disposal system and neo falls sliding
with the clot of gelatin

banking through pipe spirals and elbows flushing up
through grease traps clogged with oily clumps of
cellulite

neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
flow of waste

the metallic cable then lifts pulling him up into the
belly of the futuristic flying machine hovering inside the
sewer main


int  hovercraft

the metal harness opens and drops the halfconscious neo
onto the floor  human hands and arms help him up as he
finds himself looking straight at morpheus

he smiles

                         morpheus
          welcome to the real world neo

he passes out

                                            fade to black

fade in

int  hovercraft

we have no sense of time  we hear voices whispering

                         morpheus os
          we found him trinity  we finally
          found him

                         trinity os
          what if he isnt the one morpheus
          how can you be so sure


neos pov

neos eyes flutter open  we see morpheus face above us
angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick

                         neo os
           am i dead

                         morpheus
          far from it

                                            fade to black

fade in

neo

he opens his eyes again something tingling through him
he focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
acupuncturelike needles wired to a strange device

                         dozer
          he needs a lot of work

                         morpheus
          i know

dozer and morpheus are operating on neo

                         neo
          what are you doing

                         morpheus
          your muscles have atrophied  were
          rebuilding them

fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright

                         neo
          why do my eyes hurt

                         morpheus
          youve never used them before

morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on neo
neo lays back

                         morpheus
          rest neo  the answers are coming


int  neos room

neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better  he is
wearing a black tank top and shorts

he begins to examine himself  there is a futuristic iv
plugged into the jack in his forearm  he pulls it out
staring at the grafted outlet

he feels his bald head  his fingers find and explore the
large outlet in the base of his skull

just as he starts to come unglued morpheus opens the
door

                         neo
          morpheus whats happened to me
          what is this place

                         morpheus
          more important than what is when

                         neo
          when

                         morpheus
          you believe the year is 1997 when in
          fact it is much closer to 2197  i
          cant say for certain what year it
          is because we honestly do not know

the wind is knocked from neos chest

                         morpheus
          there is no reason for me to try to
          explain it when i can simple show
          it  come with me


int  hovercraft

like a sleepwalker neo follows morpheus through the ship

                         morpheus
          this is my ship the nebuchadnezzar
          its a hovercraft  small like a
          submarine  its cramped and cold
          but its home

they climb a ladder up to the main deck


int  main deck

everyone is there

                         morpheus
          this is the main deck  you know
          most of my crew

trinity smiles and nods

                         morpheus
          the ones you dont know  thats
          mouse cypher and switch  the two
          big guys are tank and dozer

the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo

                         morpheus
          and this this is the core  this is
          where we broadcast our pirate signal
          and hack into the matrix

it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment  vines of
coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery
slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks of life
systems and computer monitors

at the center of the web there are six ectoskeleton
chairs made of a polyalloy frame and suspension harness

near the circle of chairs is the control console and
operators station where the network is monitored

                         morpheus
          you want to know what the matrix is
          neo  the answer is right here

he touches the back of neos head

                         morpheus
          help him trinity

neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs
he feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at
the back of his neck  the cable has the same kind of
cerebrum chip we saw inside the plant

                         morpheus
          this will feel a little weird

there are several disturbing noises as he works the needle
in

we move in as neos shoulders bunch and his face tightens
into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop
like when you equalize them underwater

he relaxes opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
of weightlessness inside another place 


int  construct

neo is standing in an empty blankwhite space

                         morpheus
          this is the construct

startled neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the
room with him

                         morpheus
          it is our loading program  we can
          load anything from clothes to
          weapons to training simulations
          anything we need

morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the two
leather chairs from the hotel lafayette set up in front of
a largescreen television

                         morpheus
          sit down

neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits

                         neo
          right now were inside a computer
          program

                         morpheus
          wild isnt it

neos hands run over the cracked leather

                         neo
          this isnt real

                         morpheus
          what is real  how do you define
          real  if youre talking about your
          senses what you feel taste smell
          or see then all youre talking
          about are electrical signals
          interpreted by your brain

he picks up a remote control and clicks on the television
on the television we glide over lake michigan towards the
glinting skyscrapers of the windy city skyline circa 1997

                         morpheus
          this is the chicago you know
          chicago as it was at the end of the
          twentieth century  this chicago
          exists only as part of a neural
          interactive simulation that we call
          the matrix

he changes the channel and we see a very different chicago
as we enter the television

                         morpheus
          you have been living inside a
          dreamworld neo  as in
          baudrillards vision your whole
          life has been spent inside the map
          not the territory  this is chicago
          as it exists today

in the distance we see the ruins of a future chicago
protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a
longdead corpse

                         morpheus
          the desert of the real

beneath us the lake is gone

we turn and descend spiraling down toward the lake bed
which is scorched and split like burnt flesh where we
find morpheus and neo

                         morpheus
          the average temperature in chicago
          these days is minus eighty degrees
          celsius  of course the wind chill
          makes it feel like minus onetwenty

neo clings to the chair trying to get his bearings

                         morpheus
          we have only bits and pieces of
          information  what we know for
          certain is that at some point in
          the early twentyfirst century all
          of mankind was united in
          celebration  through the blinding
          inebriation of hubris we marveled
          at our magnificence as we gave birth
          to ai

                         neo
          ai  you mean artificial
          intelligence

                         morpheus
          yes  a singular consciousness that
          spawned an entire race of machines
          i must say i find it almost funny to
          imagine the world slapping itself on
          the back toasting the new age  i
          say almost funny

he looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian clouds
roiling overhead

                         morpheus
          we dont know who struck first  us
          or them  but we do know it was us
          that scorched the sky  at the time
          they were dependent on solar power
          it was believed they would be unable
          to survive without an energy source
          as abundant as the sun

as we descend into the circular window of his glasses
there is a flash of lightning

                         morpheus
          throughout human history we have
          been dependent on machines to
          survive  fate it seems is not
          without a sense of irony


ext  fetus fields

on the flash we pull back from the darkness which reveals
itself to be the black eye of a fetus

                         morpheus
          the machines discovered a new form
          of fusion  all they needed was a
          small electrical charge to initiate
          the reaction

the fetus is suspended in a placentalike husk where its
malleable skull is already growing around the brainjack

                         morpheus
          the human body generates more
          bioelectricity than a 120volt
          battery and over 25000 btus of
          body heat

the husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a thresher
like farm machine

                         morpheus
          for the longest time i wouldnt
          believe it  but then i saw the
          fields with my own eyes spreading
          in every direction for miles
          inside the power plant i watched
          them liquefy the dead so they could
          be fed intravenously to the living
          and standing there facing the
          efficiency the pure horrifying
          precision i came to realize the
          obviousness of the truth

still pulling back we see the image of the field now on
the television as we return to the white space of the
construct


int  construct

morpheus steps into view as he clicks off the television

                         morpheus
          what is the matrix  control

he opens the back of the television remote control

                         morpheus
          the matrix is a computergenerated
          dreamworld built to keep us under
          control in order to change a human
          being into this

he holds up a coppertop battery

                         neo
          no  i dont believe it  its not
          possible

                         morpheus
          i didnt say that it would be easy
          neo  i just said that it would be
          the truth

the room without walls begins to spin

                         neo
          stop  let me out  i want out


int  main deck

his eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair
trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck

                         neo
          get this thing out of me

                         trinity
          easy neo  easy

dozer holds him while trinity unlocks it  once its out
he tears away from them falling as he trips free of the
harness

                         neo
          dont touch me  get away from me

on his hands and knees he reels as the world spins
sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge

                         neo
          i dont believe it  i dont believe
          it

                         cypher
          hes going to pop

vomiting violently neo pitches forward and blacks out


int  neos room

he blinks regaining consciousness  the room is dark
neo is stretched out on his bed

                         neo
          i cant go back can i

morpheus is sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner

                         morpheus
          no  but if you could would you
          really want to

deep down neo knows that answer

                         morpheus
          i feel that i owe you an apology
          there is a rule that we do not free
          a mind once it reaches a certain
          age  it is dangerous  they have
          trouble letting go  their mind
          turns against them  ive seen it
          happen  i broke the rule because i
          had to

he stares into the darkness confessing as much to himself
as to neo

                         morpheus
          when the matrix was first built
          there was a man born inside that had
          the ability to change what he
          wanted to remake the matrix as he
          saw fit  it was this man that freed
          the first of us and taught us the
          secret of the war control the
          matrix and you control the future

he pauses

                         morpheus
          when he died the oracle prophesied
          his return and envisioned an end to
          the war and freedom for our people
          that is why there are those of us
          that have spent our entire lives
          searching the matrix looking for
          him

neo can feel his eyes on him

                         morpheus
          i did what i did because i believe
          the search is over

he stands up

                         morpheus
          get some rest  youre going to need
          it

                         neo
          for what

                         morpheus
          your training


int  hovercraft

there is no morning there is only darkness and then the
fluorescent light sticks flicker on


int  neos room

neo is awake in his bed staring up at the lights  the
door opens and tank steps inside

                         tank
          morning  did you sleep

                         neo

                         tank
          you will tonight  i guarantee it
          im tank  ill be your operator

he offers his hand and neo shakes it  he notices that
tank doesnt have any jacks

                         neo
          you dont have

                         tank
          any holes  nope  me and my brother
          dozer we are 100 percent pure old
          fashioned homegrown human  born
          free  right here in the real world
          genuine child of zion

                         neo
          zion

                         tank
          if this war ended tomorrow zion is
          where the party would be

                         neo
          its a city

                         tank
          the last human city  the only place
          we got left

                         neo
          where is it

                         tank
          deep underground  near the earths
          core where its still warm  you
          live long enough you might even see
          it

tanks smiles

                         tank
          goddamn i got to tell you im
          fairly excited to see what you are
          capable of  i mean if morpheus is
          right and all  were not supposed
          to talk about any of that but if you
          are well then this is an exciting
          time  we got a lot to do so lets
          get to it


int  main deck

neo is plugged in hanging in one of the suspension
chairs

                         tank
          were supposed to load all these
          operations programs first but this
          is some major boring shit  why
          dont we start with something a
          little fun

tank smiles as he plops into his operators chair  he
begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
discs

                         tank
          how about some combat training

neo reads the label on the disk

                         neo
          jujitsu  im going to learn
          jujitsu

tank slides the disk into neos supplement drive

                         neo
          no way

smiling tank punches the load code

his body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut
the monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds adrenaline
surges and his brain sizzles

an instant later his eyes snap open

                         neo
          holy shit

                         tank
          hey mikey he likes it  ready for
          more

                         neo
          hell yes


int  main deck

it is later

close on a computer monitor as grey pixels slowly fill a
small halfempty box  it is a meter displaying how much
download time is left  the title bar reads  combat
series 10 of 12 file categories flashing beneath it
savate jujitsu ken po drunken boxing

morpheus walks in

                         morpheus
          how is he

                         tank
          ten hours straight  hes a machine

neos body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open breath
hissing from his lips  he looks like he just orgasmed

                         neo
          this is incredible  i know kung fu

                         morpheus
          show me


int  dojo

they are standing in a very sparse japanesestyle dojo

                         morpheus
          this is a sparring program similar
          to the programmed reality of the
          matrix  it has the same basic
          rules  rules like gravity  what
          you must learn is that these rules
          are no different than the rules of a
          computer system  some of them can
          be bent  others can be broken

he assumes a fighting stance

                         morpheus
          attack me

neo assumes a similar stance cautiously circling until he
gives a short cry and launches a furious attack

it is like a jackie chan movie at high speed fists and
feet striking from every angle as neo presses his
attack 

but each and every blow is blocked by effortless reality
the two bodies appear quite serene suspended in the drive
chairs

tank monitors their life systems noticing that neo is
wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
steady rhythm of morpheus


int  mess hall

mouse bursts into the room interrupting dinner

                         mouse
          morpheus is fighting neo

all at once everyone bolts for the door


int  dojo

neos face is knotted teeth clenched as he hurls himself
at morpheus

                         morpheus
          good  adaptation  improvisation
          but your weakness isnt your
          technique

morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen
his feet and fists are everywhere taking neo apart  for
every blow neo blocks five more hit their marks until 

neo falls

panting on his hands and knees blood spits from his
mouth speckling the white floor of the dojo

                         morpheus
          how did i beat you

                         neo
          you  youre too fast

                         morpheus
          do you think my being faster
          stronger has anything to do with my
          muscles in this place

neo is frustrated still unable to catch his breath

                         morpheus
          do you believe thats air you are
          breathing now

neo stands nodding slowly

                         morpheus
          again

their fists fly with pneumatic speed


int  main deck

everyone is gathered behind tank watching the fight like
watching a game of mortal kombat

                         mouse
          jeeezus keeerist  that boy is fast


int  dojo

morpheus begins to press neo countering blows while
slipping in several stinging slaps

                         morpheus
          come on neo  what are you waiting
          for  youre faster than this
          dont think you are  know you are

whack morpheus cracks neo again  neos face twists with
rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo

                         morpheus
          come on  stop trying to hit me and
          just hit me

wham  a single blow catches morpheus on the side of the
head knocking off his glasses


int  main deck

there are several gasps

                         mouse
          i dont believe it


int  dojo

morpheus rubs his face then smiles

                         neo
          i know what youre trying to do 

                         morpheus
          im trying to free your mind neo
          but all i can do is show you the
          door  youre the one that has to
          step through  tank load the jump
          program


int  hovercraft

apoc and switch exchange looks as tank grabs for the disk


int  construct  rooftop  day

morpheus and neo are again in the white space of the
construct  beneath their feet we see the jump program
rush up at them until they are standing on a rooftop in a
city skyline

                         morpheus
          let it all go neo  fear  doubt
          disbelief  free your mind

morpheus spins running hard at the edge of the rooftop
and jumps  he sails through the air his coat billowing
out behind him like a cape as 

he lands on the rooftop across the street

                         neo
          shit

neo looks down at the street twenty floors below then at
morpheus an impossible fifty feet away

                         neo
          okie dokie  free my mind  right
          no problem

he takes a deep breath  and starts to run


int  main deck

they are transfixed

                         switch
          hes gonna make it

                         apoc
          no way  not possible

                         mouse
          no ones ever made their first jump

                         switch
          what if he does

                         apoc
          he wont

trinity stares at the screen her fists clenching as she
whispers

                         trinity
          come on


ext  rooftop

summoning every ounce of strength in his legs neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal
shriek 

but comes up drastically short

his eyes widen as he plummets  stories fly by the ground
rushing up at him but as he hits 

the ground gives way stretching like a trapeze net  he
bounces and flips slowly coming to a rest flat on his
back

he laughs a bit unsure wiping the windblown tears from
his face

morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet

                         morpheus
          do you know why you didnt make it

                         neo
          because i didnt think i would

morpheus smiles and nods


int  main deck

they break up

                         mouse
          what does it mean

                         switch
          it doesnt mean anything

                         cypher
          everyone falls the first time
          right trinity

but trinity has already left

neos eyes open as tank eases the plug out  he tries to
move and groans cradling his ribs

while tank helps morpheus neo spits blood into his hand

                         neo
          i thought it wasnt real

                         morpheus
          your mind makes it real

neo stares at the blood

                         neo
          if you are killed in the matrix you
          die here

                         morpheus
          the body cannot live without the
          mind


int  neos room

trinity enters from the hall carrying a tray of food

                         trinity
          neo i saved you some dinner 

she sees him passed out on the bed  she sets the tray
down and pulls the blanket over him

she pauses her face close to his then inhales lightly
breathing in the scent of him before slowly pulling away


int  hall

trinity steps out of neos room to find cypher watching
her

                         cypher
          i dont remember you ever bringing
          me dinner

trinity says nothing

                         cypher
          theres something about him isnt
          there

                         trinity
          dont tell me youre a believer now

                         cypher
          i just keep wondering if morpheus is
          so sure why doesnt he take him to
          the oracle  she would know

                         trinity
          morpheus will take him when hes
          ready

she turns and he watches her walk away


ext  city street  training program  day

morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown
street while neo struggles to keep up constantly bumped
and shouldered off the path

                         morpheus
          this is another matrix simulation
          a training program to help you get
          your sea legs and teach you one very
          important lesson

                         neo
          what  what lesson

neo collides with a man who looks just like rhineheart

                         morpheus
          the matrix is a system neo and
          that system is our enemy  when you
          look around what do you see
          businessmen lawyers students
          people  everywhere you look there
          are people  somewhere else
          somewhere in the future they may be
          human beings but here these people
          are a part of the system  that
          makes every one of them our enemy

a beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at neo as she
passes by

                         morpheus
          it is important to understand that
          if you are not one of us you are
          one of them

morpheus stops turning to neo

                         morpheus
          do you understand neo

                         neo
          i think i do

                         morpheus
          no you dont  did you see the woman
          in the red dress

                         neo
          yeah

                         morpheus
          look again

neo turns just as agent smith levels a gun at his face 

neo screams

                         morpheus
          freeze it

everything except morpheus and neo freezes

                         morpheus
          the agents are sentient programs
          they can enter any software that is
          hardwired to the system  they can
          become anyone who is still a captive
          of the matrix  if the matrix is a
          prison then the agents are its
          wardens and if humankind is to
          survive they first must be stopped

neo listens to his intense voice

                         morpheus
          every attempt to fight them has
          ended in failure  only a handful of
          men and women have ever crossed an
          agent and lived because they are
          everyone and they are no one
          unkillable  but now i believe that
          is going to change

                         neo
          how

                         morpheus
          ive seen an agent punch through a
          concrete wall  men have emptied
          entire clips at them and hit noting
          but air  yet as powerful as they
          are their speed and strength are
          but tethers to the rules of an
          unreal world  because of this they
          will never be as strong or as fast
          as you can be

neo scratches his head

                         neo
          what  are you trying to tell me
          that i can dodge bullets

                         morpheus
          no neo  im trying to tell you
          that when youre ready you wont
          have to

morpheus cell phone rings and he flips it open

                         tank vo
          we got trouble


ext  sewer main

the nebuchadnezzar blisters by trailing a swirling
supercharged electromagnetic wake


int  cockpit

morpheus slides into the copilots chair next to dozer

                         morpheus
          how much time dozer

                         dozer
          i estimate well be within range of
          detection in about two minutes

morpheus scans the decayed landscape of the sewer main
that rolls by as neo and trinity squeeze into the cockpit
behind him  morpheus points to a small tributary

                         morpheus
          set down in there

                         neo
          whats going on

                         dozer
          squiddy tripped one of our long
          distance alarm probes

                         trinity
          a sentinel  its a killing machine
          designed for one thing

                         dozer
          search and destroy

neo feels the ship rock to the side as it squeezes into a
tiny supply line


ext  hovercraft

the nebuchadnezzar sets down almost wedged into a pipe
that barely accommodates its size


int  cockpit

morpheus clicks the intercom

                         morpheus
          how we doing tank


int  main deck

tank works furiously at the operators station

                         tank
          done

he flips a series of switches and the ceaseless whir of
the ships turbines grind to a halt  the main deck is
plunged into dark silence

tank whispers

                         tank
          power offline  emp armed and
          ready

tanks fingers curl around a small key that glows a dim
red


int  cockpit

neo leans into trinitys ear

                         neo
          emp  an electromagnetic pulse

                         trinity
          it disables any electrical system in
          the blast radius  its the only
          weapon we have against the machines

through the cockpits windshield the vast cavern of the
sewer main yawns before them  strands of green haze curl
around mossy icicles that dangle into a pool of churning
frozen waste

neo begins to angle around dozer but morpheus grabs him

                         morpheus
          dont move  itll hear you

neo freezes and they wait

without the nebuchadnezzars heating systems the
temperature in the cockpit begins to rapidly drop  the
crew members huddle together their breath freezing into a
uniform cloud as it gets colder and colder

dozer quietly reaches to brush away the frost on the
windshield and as his hand clears a swathe 

they see it

in the darkness a shifting shadow of mechanized death
it is beautiful and terrifying  black alloy skin flickers
like sequins beneath sinewy coils and skeletal appendages

neo can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise as it
silently glides over them with sharklike malevolence
until it disappears into the darkness

in the frozen little room everyone breathes a little
easier


int  hall

the ship is quiet and dark  everyone is asleep


int  main deck

the core glows with monitor light  cypher is in the
operators chair as neo comes up behind him

                         cypher
          whoa  shit neo you scared the
          bejeezus out of me

                         neo
          sorry

                         cypher
          no its all right

                         neo
          what are you doing

                         cypher
          midnight watch

neos eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that
seem alive with a constant flow of data

                         neo
          is that

                         cypher
          the matrix  yeah

neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of information
bizarre codes and equations flowing across the face of the
monitor

                         neo
          do you always look at it encoded

                         cypher
          have to  the image translators sort
          of work for the construct programs
          but theres way too much information
          to decode the matrix  you get used
          to it though  your brain does the
          translating  i dont even see the
          code  all i see is blonde brunette
          and redhead  you want a drink

neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug

                         cypher
          you know i know what youre
          thinking cause right now im
          thinking the same thing  actually
          to tell you the truth ive been
          thinking the same thing ever since
          i got here

he raises the glass

                         cypher
          why the fuck didnt i take that blue
          pill

he throws the shot down his throat  neo does the same and
it almost kills him  smiling cypher slaps him on the
back

                         cypher
          good shit eh  dozer makes it
          its good for two things
          degreasing engines and killing brain
          cells

redfaced neo finally stops coughing  cypher pours him
another

                         cypher
          can i ask you something  did he
          happen to tell you why he did it

neo looks up unsure

                         cypher
          why youre here

                         neo
           yeah

                         cypher
          geezus  what a mindfuck  youre
          here to save the world  you gotta
          be shitting me  what do you say to
          something like that

neo looks down at his drink

                         cypher
          im going to let you in on a little
          secret here  now dont tell him i
          told you this but this aint the
          first time morpheus thought he found
          the one

                         neo
          really

                         cypher
          you bet your ass  it keeps him
          going  maybe it keeps all of us
          going

                         neo
          how many were there

                         cypher
          five  since ive been here

                         neo
          what happened to them

                         cypher
          dead  all dead

                         neo
          how

                         cypher
          honestly  morpheus  he got them
          all amped up believing in bullshit
          i watched each of them take on an
          agent and i watched each of them
          die  little piece of advice  you
          see an agent you do what we do
          run  run your ass off

neo gulps down another shot

                         cypher
          look im not trying to spook you i
          just want to help and im not going
          to bullshit you  see this is the
          real world and the real world aint
          about heroes and miracles  this
          worlds about one thing  survival
          thats all there is

he throws back a final shot

                         neo
          thanks for the drink

                         cypher
          any time

cypher nods as neo heads for the ladder

                         cypher
          sweet dreams


int  mess hall  close on bowl of singlecell protein

a substance with a consistency somewhere between yogurt
and cellulite

                         tank
          here you go buddy  over easy
          right

tank slides it in front of neo and takes a seat with the
other crew members enjoying breakfast

                         apoc
          breakfast of champions neo

                         neo
          what is it

                         tank
          singlecelled protein  we grow it
          in a vat

the substance jiggles a few moments before coming to a
rest  neo frowns

                         mouse
          its not so bad long as you dont
          think about liposuction

mouse sucks at the goo with a straw as morpheus enters

                         morpheus
          i want everyone on twelvehour
          standby  were going in  im
          taking neo to see her

with that he turns and leaves

                         neo
          see who

                         tank
          the oracle

trinity glances at cypher who smiles thinly


ext  hotel lafayette  day

the door opens and for the first time since his release
neo steps back into the matrix  he squints at the sun
which seems unnaturally bright  he is the only one
without sunglasses

apoc and switch remain at the door as the others enter the
alley

                         morpheus
          we should be back in an hour

cypher opens the metal garage where the car is parked  as
trinity morpheus and neo cross to the car cypher glances
about quickly then drops something inside a garbage can

it is a cellular phone and we see its blue display as the
line connects


int  car

neo sits beside trinity in the back  he cannot stop
staring as the simple images of the urban street blur past
his window like an endless stream of data rushing down a
computer screen

                         morpheus
          almost unbelievable isnt it

neo nods as the car continues to wind through the crowded
city

                         neo
          god

                         trinity
          what

                         neo
          i used to eat there really good
          noodles

he is speaking in a whisper almost as if talking to
himself

                         neo
          i have these memories from my
          entire life but none of them
          really happened

he turns to her

                         neo
          what does that mean

                         trinity
          that the matrix cannot tell you who
          you are

                         neo
          but an oracle can

                         trinity
          thats different

                         neo
          is it

                         trinity
          are you worried

                         neo
          should i be

                         trinity
          no

he turns to the window for a moment and then turns back

                         neo
          did you go to her

                         trinity
          yes

                         neo
          what did she tell you

                         trinity
          she told me

she looks at him and suddenly she is unable to speak or
even breathe

                         neo
          what

the car suddenly jerks to a stop

                         morpheus
          were here  neo come with me

neo and morpheus get out of the car  cypher looks into
the rearview mirror at trinity

                         cypher
          here we go again eh trin

he smiles as she turns to the window


ext  building

tenementlike and vast it is the kind of place where
people can disappear


int  building

morpheus nods to a blind man who nods back  an elevator
opens and neo follows morpheus inside


int  elevator

the idea of learning ones fate begins to weigh upon neo
with a steadily growing unease

                         neo
          so is this the same oracle that made
          the uh prophecy

                         morpheus
          yes  shes very old  shes been
          with us since the beginning

                         neo
          the beginning

                         morpheus
          of the resistance

                         neo
          and she knows what  everything

                         morpheus
          she would say she knows enough

                         neo
          how does she know

                         morpheus
          she is a true psychic  she sees
          beyond the relativity of time  for
          her there is no past present or
          future  there is only what is

                         neo
          and shes never wrong

                         morpheus
          dont think of it in terms of right
          and wrong  she is a guide neo
          she can help you find the path

                         neo
          she helped you

                         morpheus
          yes

                         neo
          what did she tell you

                         morpheus
          that i would find the one

ding  the elevator opens


int  hall

the long dark hall beckons  neo follows morpheus out of
the elevator and the doors rattle shut behind him  with
every step a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in
around him

at the end of the hall morpheus steps to the side of a
door

                         morpheus
          i told you that i can only show you
          the door  you have to step through
          it

neo blows out a breath  his hand reaches but stops
hovering over the spherical handle  he backs away

                         neo
          morpheus i dont think this is a
          good idea

                         morpheus
          why

                         neo
          i told you i dont believe in this
          stuff  no matter what she says im
          not going to believe it so whats
          the point

                         morpheus
          what do you believe in

                         neo
          what do i believe it  are you
          kidding me  what do you think  im
          still trying to deal with the fact
          that everything i believed was real
          wasnt  the whole world my entire
          life was a lie  i dont know
          anything anymore morpheus

                         morpheus
          thats why were here

                         neo
          why  so i can hear some old lady
          tell me what  that im this guy
          that everybodys been waiting for
          the one thats supposed to save the
          world  come on  how do i respond
          to that  i cant  its ridiculous
          i mean who am i  im nobody im
          just a guy  what did i do
          morpheus  why me

                         morpheus
          faith is beyond the reach of whys
          and why nots  these things are not
          a matter of cause and effect neo
          i do not believe things with my
          mind  i believe them with my heart
          in my gut

                         neo
          and you still believe im the one

                         morpheus
          yes i do

                         neo
          yeah  what about the other five
          guys  the five before me  what
          about them

morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his
chest

                         neo
          did you believe in them too

                         morpheus
          no  i did not  i have never told
          anyone this neo  after i saw the
          oracle i thought no i
          misunderstood what she told me  i
          believed that it was all about me
          that i would find the one not that
          he would find me

this is difficult for morpheus to admit

                         morpheus
          i believed that all i had to do was
          point my finger and anoint whoever
          i chose  i was wrong neo
          terribly wrong  not a day or night
          passes that i do not think of them
          after the fifth i lost my way  i
          doubted everything the oracle had
          said  i doubted myself

he looks up at neo

                         morpheus
          and then i saw you on the net
          searching for me and everything
          changed  i felt this charge this
          electricity through my whole body
          i started laughing and tears poured
          out of my eyes because i knew i
          knew that you were the one

his eyes blaze

                         morpheus
          listen to me neo  i know why
          youre afraid to go through that
          door  you cant get free of
          thinking that i could be wrong  you
          must believe me  there is a
          greatness inside of you neo  a
          greatness that is going to lift you
          to unimaginable heights and that in
          time will change the world

                         neo
          morpheus i dont know 

                         morpheus
          i know  that is why it is so
          important for you to go  please
          neo im asking you to find whatever
          respect you may have for me and
          trust me

neo feels a rush from morpheus intensity the
unadulterated confidence of a zealot

                         neo
          all right

he reaches for the handle which turns without him even
touching it  a woman wearing white opens the door

                         priestess woman
          hello neo  youre right on time


int  oracles apartment

it seems particularly normal

                         priestess
          make yourself at home morpheus

                         morpheus
          thank you

                         priestess
          neo come with me

she leads neo down another hall and into what appears to
be a family room

there is another woman in white sitting on a couch
watching a soap opera  scattered about the room are a
half dozen children

some of them are playing others are deep in meditation
all of them exude a kind of zen calm

                         priestess
          these are the other potentials  you
          can wait here

neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks
closer to him a skinny boy with a shaved head holds a
spoon which sways like a blade of grass

in front of him is a pile of spoons bent and twisted into
knots

neo crosses to him and sits  the boy smiles and hands neo
the spoon which is now perfectly straight

                         spoon boy skinny boy
          do not try to bend the spoon  that
          is impossible  instead only try to
          realize the truth

                         neo
          what truth

                         spoon boy
          that there is no spoon

neo nods staring at the spoon

                         neo
          there is no spoon

                         spoon boy
          then you will see that it is not the
          spoon that bends  it is only
          yourself

the entire room is reflected inside the spoon and as neo
stares into it it slowly begins to bend until 

a hand touches his shoulder

                         priestess
          the oracle will see you now

spoon boy smiles

she takes him to the last room parting a curtain that
leads into a kitchen

                         oracle
          just come on in


int  kitchen

an old woman is huddled beside the oven peering inside
through a cracked door

                         neo

                         neo

he turns to look around and his elbow knocks a vase from
the table  it breaks against the linoleum floor

                         oracle
          that vase

                         neo

she pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns

she sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot pad

                         oracle

          noodle later on is would you still

          why she likes you

she gestures to a wooden plaque the kind every kitchen
has except that the words are in latin

                         oracle
          you know what that means  its
          latin  means know thyself  im
          gonna let you in on a little secret
          being the one is just like being in
          love  nobody can tell you youre in
          love  you just know it  through
          and through  balls to bones

she puts her cigarette down

                         oracle
          well i better have a look at you

she widens his eyes checks his ears then feels the
glands in his neck

                         oracle
          open your mouth  say ahh

she nods then looks at his palms

                         oracle
          okay now im supposed to say
          hmmm thats interesting but

                         oracle
          your next life maybe  who knows
          thats how these things go

neo almost has to laugh

                         oracle
          whats funny

                         neo
          morpheus  he almost had me
          convinced

                         oracle
          i know  poor morpheus  without him
          we are lost  we will never find the
          one

                         neo
          what do you mean without him

the oracle takes a long drag regarding neo with the eyes
of a sphinx

                         oracle
          are you sure you want to hear this

neo nods

                         oracle
          morpheus believes in you neo and no
          one not you or even me can convince
          him otherwise  he believes it so
          blindly that hes going to sacrifice
          his life to save yours

                         neo
          what

                         oracle
          youre going to have to make a final
          choice  in one hand you will have
          morpheus life  in the other hand
          you will have your own  one of you
          is going to die  which one will be
          up to you

neo cant breathe

                         oracle
          im sorry kiddo  i really am  you
          have a good soul and i hate giving
          good people bad news  but dont
          worry as soon as you walk outside

          better  youll remember that you
          dont believe any of this fate crap
          youre in control of your own life
          remember

he tries to nod as she reaches for the tray of cookies

                         oracle
          here take a cookie  i promise by
          the time youre done eating it
          youll feel right as rain

neo takes a cookie the tightness in his chest slowly
beginning to fade


int  sitting room  day

morpheus rises from a couch as the priestess escorts neo
out  when they are alone morpheus puts his hand on neos
shoulder

                         morpheus
          there is a rule that no one can ask
          what the oracle said to you  what
          was said was said for you and you
          alone

he smiles

                         morpheus
          i can see it in your eyes that you
          are still confused  thats all
          right neo  give it time let it
          all sink in  i know it can be
          difficult to see the path even when
          its right under your feet

neo nods and takes a bite of his cookie


int  car

neo and morpheus get in the car

                         morpheus
          lets go

cypher slaps the car in gear and pulls into traffic
trinity looks at neo who is staring at the final bit of
cookie  he puts it in his mouth and chews

                         trinity
          are you all right

                         neo
           right as rain

the phone flips shut as he jumps up


ext  city street

cypher closes the garage door nervously looking around
at the end of the alley is another white van  he mops the
sweat from his forehead following the others into the
hotel


int  main deck

sweat rolls down cyphers face and neck  at the
operators station tank is typing rapidly

                         tank
          what is that


int  hotel lafayette  day

light filters down the throat of the building through a
caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft
four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around the
antique elevator

neo notices a black cat a yellowgreen eyed shadow that
slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs

a moment later neo sees another black cat that looks and
moves identically to the first one

                         neo
          whoa  deja vu

those words stop the others dead in their tracks


int  main deck

the monitors suddenly glitch as though the matrix had an
electronic seizure

                         tank
          oh shit  oh shit


int  hotel lafayette  day

trinity turns around her face tight

                         trinity
          what did you just say

                         neo
          nothing  just had a little deja vu

                         trinity
          what happened  what did you see

                         neo
          a black cat went past us and then i
          saw another that looked just like
          it

                         trinity
          how much like it  was it the same
          cat

                         neo
          it might have been  im not sure

trinity looks at morpheus who listens quietly to the
rasping breath of the old building

                         neo
          what is it

                         trinity
          a deju vu is usually a glitch in the
          matrix  it happens when they change
          something

she also listens as the staccato beat of helicopter blades
grows ominously loud

                         tank
          its a trap

combat boots builds then explodes into the room

                         tank
          no no no


int  stairs  day

morpheus stops as mouses scream is drowned out by the
report of machine gun fire


int  room 1313  day

mouse sails backwards as bullets pound him against the
bloodspattered brick window


int  main deck

mouses body thrashes against its harness blood coughing
from his mouth in one final spasm then lying perfectly
still  the flatline alarm softly cries out from the life
monitor


ext  hotel lafayette  day

more police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
doors


int  stairwell  day

flying downstairs morpheus stops hearing police swarming
below  he turns and rushes down the hall of the eight
floor  at the end of it he finds the bricked up windows

                         cypher
          thats what they changed  were
          trapped  theres no way out

the sound of heavy bootsteps close around them with the
mechanical sureness of a vice

                         morpheus
          give me your phone

                         trinity

          this building and find it fast

his fingers pound the keyboard


int  hotel lafayette  day

flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
search every floor

          floor


int  stairwell  day

cops flood the eighth floor rushing everywhere


int  room 808  day

several cops sweep through the room  it is empty  as
they pass the bathroom we see a mansized hole smashed
through the plaster and lathe


int  wall  day

they are inside the main plumbing wall slowly worming
their way down the grease black stack pipes

above them light fills the hole they made to get inside


int  hall  day

brown turns to smith

                         agent brown
          where are they


int  room 808  day

the cops search in silence straining for a clue when one
hears something strange near the bathroom


int  wall  day

cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
several thick supply pipes


int  room 808  day

the cop leans in his ear almost against the thin membrane
of plaster separating them  he can hear whispers hisses
and a grunt when 

the wall suddenly bulges shattercracking as the cop
realizes 

                         cop
          theyre in the walls


int  wall  day

trinity pulls cypher free just as the cop opens fire 

bullets punching shafts of light like swords into the box
of sootblack space

neo finds his gun first and begins blasting blindly
through the plaster and lath


int  room 808  day

the cops spins out of the bathroom for cover neos
bullets splintering the door jamb

about to whirl back in he freezes as something seems to
seize hold of him  the cops body starts to spasm and his
m16 falls to the ground long shadows springing up from
the mounted flashlight


int  wall  day

neo listens for a moment the gunfire quiet when he hears
footsteps rising fast

two arms suddenly smash through the wall punching neo
back against the iron stack pipe fingers gouging into his
neck

                         neo
          fuck

his gun clatters down the dark crevice

                         trinity
          its an agent

just as neos throat is about to collapse morpheus
explodes through the tattered plaster and lath diving on
top of agent smith

the two men crash to the wet terrazzo floor  before agent
smith can find his weapon morpheus is on him pinning him
in an iron grip

in the crawlspace trinity tries to scramble up past
cypher

                         trinity
          morpheus

morpheus squeezes agent smiths throat

                         morpheus
          trinity you must get neo out  do
          you understand  he is all that
          matters

neo suddenly glimpses what is happening but is powerless
to stop it

                         neo
          no  no  morpheus  dont

                         morpheus
          trinity  go  get to the basement
          find the catch basin

behind his crooked glasses agent smith smiles

                         agent smith
          the sewers  of course

                         morpheus
          hurry

                         agent smith
          they wont make it

trinitys fists ball in frustration  she yells down to
apoc

                         trinity
          go

                         neo
          we cant leave him

                         trinity
          we have to

she grabs his ankle and they begin almost falling using
the lath as a brake skidding down the inside of the wall


int  basement  day

this part of the basement a dark concrete cavern was the
main mechanical room  there are four enormous boilers
dinosaurlike technology that once pumped hot water like
arteries

apoc is the first to smash through in a hail of dirt and
plaster landing in the middle of an enemy search unit
apoc doesnt let them suffer too long

immediately he is on them a long blade flashing in his
hand in wide bloody electric arcs feet kicking bones
breaking

switch drops next to him from the wet wall  whipping out
small full automatic machine guns she begins laying down
cover fire as more men surround them

blinding lights cut open the darkness as gasmasked
figures fire grenade launchers

smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters

trinity never stops moving  searching the floor she
finds what she needs the cover of the catch basin

cypher watches her pry open the grate when a gas can
bounces near him

                         trinity
          come on

cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him

trinity watches cypher disappear into the smoke then
follows the others down the wetblack hole


int  room 808  day

morpheus and agent smith remain on the ground locked in
each others death grip

                         agent smith
          the great morpheus  we meet at
          last

                         morpheus
          and you are

                         agent smith
          smith  i am agent smith

                         morpheus
          you all look the same to me

agent smith counters morpheus and slowly begins to pry his
hands from his throat

striking like a viper morpheus drives a vicious head butt
into agent smiths face  his nose and glasses shatter

morpheus flips up over agent smith about to run but
lands in front of a wall of men  agent smith rises behind
him tossing off the broken sunglasses

                         agent smith
          take him

the wall of cops rush morpheus filling the tiny bathroom
until he disappears under the tide

a manhole cover cracks open  two eyes peek out just as a
truck rattles over it  the thunder dopplers away and the
cover opens

waterlogged phone from her pocket

with an oncoming car

                         cypher
          there was an accident  a fucking
          car accident  all of a sudden

                         tank vo
          nearest exit is franklin and erie
          an old appliance store

cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive


int  main deck

the phone rings  tank answers

                         tank
          operator

again inevitability seems to cinch around neo

                         trinity
          we need an exit

                         tank vo

          and erie

                         trinity
          got it


int  appliance store  day

dead machines eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
metal shelves like bodies in a morgue

plywood covering a small window is ripped off and cypher
crawls inside

deep in the back room a phone that has not rung in years
begins to ring


ext  street  day

trinity sees the appliance shop


int  main deck

tank punches the exit command

                         tank
          got him

cyphers body twitches in its harness jerking itself
awake


int  appliance store  day

neo crawls through the window that cypher opened


int  main deck

tank finishes loading the exit program as cypher pulls
back a heavy blanket exposing a hightech rifle


int  appliance store  day

the phone begins to ring as the others crawl in

                         switch
          god i love that sound


int  main deck

suddenly a white bolt of lightning explodes against
tanks chair blasting him into the air

cypher checks the gun unable to believe he missed

                         cypher
          shit

tank is on his feet lunging when cypher fires again
square into his chest

                         dozer
          no


int  appliance store  day

the phone is still ringing

                         trinity
          you first neo

neo answers the phone when there is a click  there is no
signal  nothing but silence

                         trinity
          what happened

                         neo
          i dont know  it just went dead

trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
cellular


int  main deck

the operator phone begins to ring  cypher steps over the
sizzling body of dozer and looks at the monitor


int  appliance store  day

every unanswered ring wrings her gut a little tighter
until 

                         cypher vo
          hello trinity

                         trinity
          cypher  wheres tank

                         cypher vo
          he had an accident

                         trinity
          an accident


int  main deck

he walks over to trinitys body staring down at it
hanging in its comalike stillness

                         cypher
          you know for a long time i thought
          i was in love with you trinity  i
          used to dream about you

he nuzzles his face against hers feeling the softness of
it

                         cypher
          you are a beautiful woman  too bad
          things had to work out like this

                         trinity
          you killed them

                         apoc
          what

                         switch
          oh god

wearing tanks operator headgear cypher moves among the
silent bodies

                         cypher
          im tired trinity  im tired of
          this war im tired of fighting
          im tired of this ship of being
          cold of eating the same fucking
          goop every day  but most of all
          im tired of this jagoff and all of
          his bullshit

                         trinity
          my god  morpheus  you gave them
          morpheus

                         cypher
          yes  you see the truth is
          trinity that we humans have a place
          in the future  but its not here
          its in the matrix

                         trinity
          the matrix isnt real

                         cypher
          oh i disagree trinity  i
          disagree  i think the matrix is
          more real than this world  i mean
          all i do is pull a plug here  but
          there you watch a man die

he grabs hold of the cable in apocs neck twists it and
yanks it out

                         cypher
          you tell me which is more real

apoc seems to go blind for an instant a scream caught in
his throat his hands reaching for nothing and then falls
dead  switch screams

                         trinity
          but youre out cypher  you cant
          go back

                         cypher
          thats what you think  theyve
          promised to back me trinity
          theyre going to reinsert my body
          ill go back to sleep and when i
          wake up ill be fat and rich and i
          wont remember a goddamn thing
          its the american dream

he laughs his hand sliding around the neck of switch as
he takes hold of her plug

                         cypher
          welcome to the real world eh baby

she suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
is murdered

                         trinity
          goddamn you cypher

                         cypher
          dont hate me trinity  im just
          the messenger  and right now im
          going to prove it to you

he stands over neo

                         cypher
          if morpheus was right then theres
          no way i can pull this plug is
          there

she turns to neo eyes wide with fear and he knows he is
next

                         cypher
          if he is the one then in the next
          few seconds there has to be some
          kind of miracle to stop me  right
          how can he be the one if hes dead

he takes hold of the cord

                         cypher
          you never did answer me trinity
          when i asked you before  did you
          buy morpheus bullshit  come on
          you can tell me did you  all i
          want is a little yes or no  look
          into his eyes trinity those pretty
          blue eyes and tell me the truth
          yes or no

trinity stares at neo as a single word falls soundlessly
from her lips

                         trinity
           yes

                         cypher
          no

cypher is frozen staring at us in terror

                         cypher
          i dont believe it

charred and bloody tank levels the gun

                         tank
          believe it or not you piece of
          shit youre still going to burn

he fires a crackling bolt of lightning that knocks cypher
flying backwards


int  appliance store

trinity throws her arms around neo and for a moment they
are alone and alive until 

the phone rings

                         neo
          go  you first this time


int  main deck

trinitys eyes snap open a sense of relief surging
through her at the sight of the ship  as tank unplugs
her she sees his charred wounds

                         trinity
          tank youre hurt

                         tank
          ill be all right

                         trinity
          dozer

tanks face tightens

                         trinity
          im sorry tank


ext  government building  day

a government highrise in the middle of downtown where a
military helicopter sets down on the roof

agent jones gets out of the helicopter flanked by columns
of marines  they open the roof access door and enter the
top floor maintenance level of the hotel


int  executive office  day

agent smith stands staring out the windows at the city
below shimmering with brilliant sunlight

                         agent smith
          have you ever stood and stared at
          it morpheus  marveled at its
          beauty  its genius  billions of
          people just living out their
          lives oblivious

morpheus is handcuffed to a chair stripped to the waist
he is alternately shivering and sweating wired to various
monitors with white disk electrodes  beside him agent
brown sucks a serum from a glass vial filling a
hypodermic needle

                         agent smith
          did you know that the first matrix
          was designed to be a perfect human
          world  where none suffered where
          everyone would be happy  it was a
          disaster  no one would accept the
          program  entire crops were lost

agent brown jams the needle into morpheus shoulder and
plunges down

                         agent smith
          some believed we lacked the
          programming language to describe
          your perfect world  but i believe
          that as a species human beings
          define their reality through
          suffering and misery

agent brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection

                         agent smith
          the perfect world was a dream that
          your primitive cerebrum kept trying
          to wake up from  which is why the
          matrix was redesigned to this  the
          peak of your civilization

he turns from the window

                         agent smith
          i say your civilization because as
          soon as we started thinking for you
          it really became our civilization
          which is of course what this is
          all about

he sits down directly in front of morpheus

                         agent smith
          evolution morpheus  evolution

he lifts morpheus head

                         agent smith
          like the dinosaur  look out that
          window  you had your time

morpheus stares hard at him trying not to show the pain
racking his mind

                         agent smith
          the future of your world morpheus
          the future is our time

agent smith looks at agent brown

                         agent smith
          double the dosage

agent jones suddenly enters

                         agent jones
          we could have a problem


int  main deck

neo looks at morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
sweat

                         neo
          what are they doing to him

                         tank
          theyre hacking his mind

                         neo
          how

                         tank
          they inject viruslike serums to
          attack the neurosystems  its like
          cracking a computer  all it takes
          is time

                         neo
          how much time

                         tank
          depends on the mind  but
          eventually it will crack and his
          alpha pattern will change from this
          to this

tank punches several commands on morpheus personal unit
the monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
ordered symmetrical one

                         tank
          when it does morpheus will tell
          them anything they want to know

                         neo
          what do they want

                         tank
          every leader of every ship is given
          the codes to zions mainframe
          computer which can be accessed only
          through the matrix  they are used
          only in emergencies  if an agent
          had those codes and got inside
          zions mainframe they could disable
          the entire defense system  it would
          be the end of everything

he looks up at trinity who is pacing relentlessly

                         tank
          we cant let that happen trinity
          zion has to be protected


int  government building

morpheus is fighting to hold his mind together  the
agents stand over him

                         agent smith
          never send a human to do a machines
          job

                         agent brown
          if indeed reagan had failed they
          will sever the connection as soon as
          possible unless 

                         agent jones
          they are dead  in either case 

                         agent smith
          we have no choice but to continue as
          planned  deploy the sentinels
          immediately


int  main deck

trinity sees cyphers dead body  rage overtakes her and
she kicks him

                         trinity
          goddamnit  goddamnit

                         neo
          there has to be something that we
          can do

                         tank
          there is  we have to pull the plug

                         trinity
          youre going to kill him  kill
          morpheus

                         tank
          trinity we dont have any other
          choice

neo suddenly sees it perfectly clear fate rushing at him
like an oncoming train

tank kneels beside morpheus body

                         tank
          morpheus you were more than our
          leader  you were our father  we
          will miss you always

trinity cant bear to watch  as she closes her eyes her
tears slip free

tank takes hold of the plug

neo is paralyzed his whole life is suddenly suspended by
the finality of this moment hurling at him with the speed
of a bullet

tank closes his eyes 

                         neo
          stop

they both look at him

                         neo
          goddamnit  i dont believe this is
          happening

                         tank
          neo this has to be done

                         neo
          does it  i dont know  this cant
          be just coincidence  it cant be
          can it

                         tank
          what are you talking about

                         neo
          the oracle  she told me this would
          happen  she told me

neo stops his stare fixed on morpheus

                         neo
          that i would have to make a
          choice

                         trinity
          what choice

he makes his choice  turning he walks to his chair

                         trinity
          what are you doing

                         neo
          im going in after him

                         trinity
          you cant

                         neo
          i have to

                         trinity
          morpheus sacrificed himself so we
          could get you out  theres no way
          youre going back in

                         neo
          morpheus did what he did because he
          believed that im something im not

                         trinity
          what

                         neo
          im not the one trinity  the
          oracle hit me with that too

trinity is stunned

                         trinity
          no you have to be

                         neo
          im sorry im not  im just
          another guy  morpheus is the one
          that matters

                         trinity
          no neo  thats not true  it cant
          be true

                         neo
          why

                         trinity
          because

uncertainty swallows her words and she is unable to tell
him what she wants to

                         tank
          neo this is loco  theyve got
          morpheus in a militarycontrolled
          building  even if you somehow got
          inside those are agents holding
          him  three of them  i want
          morpheus back too but what you are
          talking about is suicide

                         neo
          i know thats what it looks like
          but its not  i cant logically
          explain to you why its not
          morpheus believed something and he
          was ready to give his life for what
          he believed  i understand that now
          thats why i have to go

                         tank
          why

                         neo
          because i believe in something

                         trinity
          what

                         neo
          i believe i can bring him back

trinity stares at him hovering on the edge that he just
jumped off  her jaw sets and she starts climbing into the
chair beside him

                         neo
          what are you doing

                         trinity
          im coming with you

                         neo
          no youre not

                         trinity
          no  let me tell you what i believe
          i believe morpheus means more to me
          than he does to you  i believe that
          if you are serious about saving him
          then you are going to need my help
          and since i am the ranking officer
          on this ship if you dont like it
          then i believe that you can go to
          hell because you arent going
          anywhere else

there is nothing more to say except 

                         trinity
          tank load us up


int  executive office  day

agent smith sits casually across from morpheus who is
hunched over his body leaking and twitching

                         agent smith
          id like to share a revelation that
          ive had during my time here  it
          came to me when i tried to classify
          your species  ive realized that
          you are not actually mammals

the life signs continue their chaotic patterns

                         agent smith
          every mammal on this planet
          instinctively develops a natural
          equilibrium with the surrounding
          environment  but you humans do not
          you move to an area and you multiply
          and multiply until every natural
          resource is consumed and the only
          way you can survive is to spread to
          another area

he leans forward

                         agent smith
          there is another organism on this
          planet that follows the same
          pattern  do you know what it is  a
          virus

he smiles

                         agent smith
          human beings are a disease a cancer
          of this planet  you are a plague
          and we are the cure


int  main deck

trinity and neo hang motionless in the suspension unit
tank is at the operations station

                         tank
          okay  stores open  what do you
          need  besides a miracle

                         neo vo
          guns  lots of guns


int  construct

racks of weapons appear and they begin to arm themselves

                         trinity
          no one has ever done anything like
          this

                         neo
          yeah

he snap cocks an uzi

                         neo
          thats why its going to work


int  executive office  day

agent smith is again at the window

                         agent smith
          why isnt the serum working

                         agent brown
          perhaps we are asking the wrong
          questions

agent smith hides his knotting fist  he is becoming
angry  it is something that isnt supposed to happen to
agents

                         agent smith
          leave me with him

agents brown and jones look at each other

                         agent smith
          now

they leave and agent smith sits beside morpheus

                         agent smith
          can you hear me morpheus  im
          going to be honest with you

he removes his earphone letting it dangle over his
shoulder

                         agent smith
          i hate this place  this zoo  this
          prison  this reality whatever you
          want to call it i cant stand it
          any longer  its the smell if
          there is such a thing  i feel
          saturated by it  i can taste your
          stink and every time i do i fear
          that ive somehow been infected by
          it

he wipes sweat from morpheus forehead coating the tips
of his fingers holding them to morpheus nose

                         agent smith
          repulsive isnt it

he lifts morpheus head holding it tightly with both
hands

                         agent smith
          i must get out of here i must get
          free  in this mind is the key  my
          key

morpheus sneers through the pain

                         agent smith
          once zion is destroyed there is no
          need for me to be here  do you
          understand  i need the codes  i
          have to get inside zion  you have
          to tell me how

he begins squeezing his fingers gouging into his flesh

                         agent smith
          you are going to tell me or you are
          going to die


int  main deck

tank sits down beside morpheus whose face is ashen like
someone near death  he takes hold of his hand

                         tank
          hold on morpheus  theyre coming
          for you  theyre coming


ext  government building day

a dark wind blows


int  government building  day

in long black coats trinity and neo push through the
revolving doors

neo is carrying a duffel bag  trinity has a large metal
suitcase  they cut across the lobby to the security
station drawing nervous glances

dark glasses game faces

neo calmly passes through the metal detector which begins
to wail immediately

a security guard moves over toward neo raising his metal
detection wand

                         guard
          would you please remove any metallic
          items you are carrying  keys loose
          change 

neo slowly sets down his duffel bag and throws open his
coat revealing an arsenal of guns knives and grenades
slung from a climbing harness

                         guard
          holy shit 

neo and trinity are a blur of motion  in a split second
three guards are dead before they hit the ground

chaos erupts bystanders run for cover popping caps
echoing in the stark official lobby

a second wave of plainclothes cops and guards try to stop
them  they are met by the muted spit of a silenced gun
and the razored whistle of throwing stars

weapons like extensions of their bodies are used with the
same deadly precision as their feet and their fists

bodies slump down to the marbled floor while neo and
trinity hardly even break their stride


int  executive office

agents jones and brown burst into the room  agent smith
releases morpheus

                         agent brown
          what were you doing

agent smith recovers replacing his earpiece

                         agent jones
          you dont know

                         agent smith
          know what

agent smith listens to his earphone not believing what he
is hearing


int  elevators  day

they get in  trinity immediately drops and opens the
suitcase wiring a plastique and napalm bomb


int  executive office  day

agent jones looks at morpheus

                         agent jones
          i think theyre trying to save him


int  elevator shaft  day

neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable  both
of them lock on  he looks up the long dark throat of the
building and takes a deep breath

                         neo
          there is no spoon

neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable lower
than they attached themselves

boom  the cable snaps

the counterweights plummet yanking trinity and neo up
through the shaft as 

the elevator falls away beneath them distending space
filling it with the sound of whistling metal as they sear
to the top


int  lobby  day

the elevator hits the bottom

baboom

the massive explosion blows open the doors fire clouds
engulfing the elevator section of the lobby


int  executive office  day

the agents hear the blast of fire alarms

                         agent jones
          lower level 

                         agent brown
          they are actually attacking

another enormous explosion thunders above them shaking
the building  the alarm sounds emergency sprinklers
begin showering the room

agent smith smashes a table

                         agent smith
          find them and destroy them

agent jones nods and touches his earpiece


ext  roof  day

the roofaccess tower is now engulfed in flames as neo and
trinity stand amongst a pile of their fallen enemies

across the roof the pilot inside the army helicopter
watches the last of their ferocious onslaught

                         pilot
          i repeat we are under attack

suddenly his face his whole body dissolves consumed by
spreading locustlike swarm of static as 

agent jones emerges

just as she drops the final marine trinity sees whats
coming

neo sees her the fear in her face and he knows what is
behind him

screaming he whirls guns filling his hands with thought
speed

fingers pumping shells ejecting dancing up and away we
look through the sights and gunsmoke at 

the agent blurred with motion 

until the hammers click against the empty metal

                         neo
          trinity

agent jones charges

                         neo
           help

his gun booms as we enter the liquid space of 

bullettime

the air sizzles with wads of lead like angry flies as neo
twists bends ducks just between them

agent jones still running narrows the gap the bullets
coming faster until 

neo bent impossibly back one hand on the ground as a
spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder

he starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh

he has only time to look up to see agent jones standing
over him raising his gun a final time

                         agent jones
          only human

suddenly agent jones stops  he hears a sharp metal click

immediately he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of trinitys 45 

jammed tight to his head

                         trinity
          dodge this mutherfucker

boom  boom  boom  the body flies back with a flash of
mercurial light and when it hits the ground 

it is the pilot

trinity helps neo up

                         trinity
          neo how did you do that

                         neo
          do what

                         trinity
          you moved like they moved  ive
          never seen anyone move that fast

                         neo
          it wasnt fast enough

he checks his shoulder wound

                         trinity
          are you all right

                         neo
          im fine  come on we have to keep
          moving

neo sees the helicopter

                         neo
          can you fly that thing

                         trinity
          not yet

she pulls out the cellular phone


int  hovercraft

tank is back at the controls

                         tank
          operator

                         trinity vo
          tank i need a pilot program for a
          military m109 helicopter

tank is immediately searching the disk drawers

                         trinity vo
          hurry

his fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks finding
one that he feeds into trinitys supplement drive punching
the load commands on her keyboard


ext  roof  day

trinitys eyes flutter as information surges into her
brain all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
at lightspeed

                         trinity
          lets go


int  hall  day

marines trying to communicate with the men on the roof
are beginning to panic when agent jones comes around the
corner

                         sergeant
          sir  sir  there was gunfire 
          weve lost communication with the
          roof

                         agent jones
          remain at your posts

                         sergeant
          but sir  the fire  we should
          evacuate

                         agent jones
          you will do as you are ordered


int  executive office  day

agent jones throws open the door and enters walking
through the puddles pooling in the carpet

over the rushing water and the alarms agent smith hears a
sound and understands the seriousness of the attack

he turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
into view 

neo is in the back bay aiming the mounted 50 machine
gun

                         agent smith
          no

the gun jumps and bullets explode through the window in a
cacophony of crashing glass 

as the agents go for their weapons

but neo is too close the 50 caliber too fast and bullets
are everywhere perforating the room

agent smith is hit first his body jackknifing back
blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light 

then agent brown his gun still firing as his body falls

and finally agent jones

neo stares at morpheus trying to will him into action

                         neo
          get up morpheus  get up

neo grabs the climbing rope and attaches one end to his
harness


int  hall  day

just outside the executive office three marines blister
with snowstatic


int  executive office  day

slowly morpheus lifts his face into the rooms rain
when he finally opens his eyes they are again dark and
flashing with fire

he rises from the chair snapping his handcuffs just as
the agents enter the adjoining room

agent smith stops and sees morpheus run past the open
door

                         agent smith
          nooo

he fires sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect
line

for an instant we see the bullets shred puncturing the
wall searing through the wet air with jet trails of
chalk

and as morpheus starts his dive for the window a bullet
buries itself in his leg 

knocking him off balance

                         neo
          he wont make it

morpheus lunges out of control 

as neo spins every move a whip crack snapping the other
ropeend on to a bolted bar as 

morpheus begins to fall when neo hurls himself into the
wide blue empty space 

flying for a moment

the rope snaking out behind him an umbilical cord
attached to a machine

as their two bodies set in motion rushing at each other
on a seemingly magnetic course until 

they collide

almost bouncing free of each other arms legs scrambling
hands searching in furious desperation finding hold and
clinging

until the line ends snapping taut cracking their fragile
embrace  morpheus tumbles legs flipping over falling
down 

the ground deliriously distant 

as neo snatches hold of his mentors still handcuffed
wrist

                         neo
          gotcha


int  main deck

tank stares at the screen his mouth agape

                         tank
          he is the one  hes gotta be but
          why  hes gotta be


ext  government building

trinity is already pulling the copter up and away

anger boils up into agent smith and he points his gun
targeting the helicopter  hell bring them all down

the helicopter crabs through the canyon of skyscrapers and
just as agent smith fires 

it disappears behind a building agent smiths bullets
fracturing the huge panes of skyscraper glass

                         agent smith
          find them  track them


ext  rooftop  day

the helicopter touches down on the skyscraper in a swirl
of dust and gravel  neo has an arm around morpheus
holding him up

                         trinity
          morpheus

she runs at him slamming her arms around him

                         morpheus
          do you believe it now trinity

trinity looks at neo

                         neo
          morpheus the oracle she told
          me 

                         morpheus
          she told you exactly what you needed
          to hear  thats all  sooner or
          later neo youre going to realize
          just like i did the difference
          between knowing the path and walking
          the path


int  main deck

the phone rings

                         morpheus vo
          tank

                         tank

          and balbo

                         morpheus vo
          were on our way 


ext  rooftop  day

we rush at the roof access door as it suddenly slams open
and the three agents charge out

but neo trinity and morpheus are already gone

                         agent smith
          damnit

                         agent brown
          the trace was completed

                         agent jones
          we have their position

                         agent brown
          the extermination unit is in place

                         agent jones
          order the strike

agent smith cant stand listening to them  he moves to
the edge of the building looking out at the surrounding
city

                         agent smith
          theyre not out yet


int  subway station  day

an old man sits hunched in the far corner of the station
shadows gathered around him like blankets  mumbling he
nurses from a bottle of thunderbird when 

a phone begins to ring

neo leads trinity and morpheus bounding over a set of
turnstiles towards the ringing phone inside a graffiti
covered booth

                         neo
          lets go  you first morpheus

morpheus gets in and answers the phone

lost in the shadow the old man watches as morpheus
disappears the phone dropping dangling by its cord  his
eyes grow wide glowing white in the dark


ext  rooftop  day

agent smith stares his face twisted with hate  he will
never be free of the matrix

he starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
suddenly hears it his head whipping around staring 


int  subway  old mans pov  day

through the old mans eyes as the world begins to rumble


trinity

hangs up the phone then turns to neo

                         trinity
          neo i have to tell you something
          i dont know what it means or even
          if it matters but i feel i have to
          say it

the rumble grows the ground beginning to shake

                         trinity
          ive never told anyone this before
          i think ive been afraid to

behind her the phone begins to ring

                         trinity
          when i went to the oracle she told
          me she told me that i would meet
          a man  and that i would fall in
          love

the rumble rises drowning her voice  neo is drawn
towards her their lips close enough to kiss when a train
blasts into the station

for a moment they are frozen by the strobing lights of
the train until neo whispers in her ear

                         neo
          promise me youll tell me the rest

she nods as he closes the booth  the phone rings once
more before she lifts the receiver when 

in the darkness of the far corner neo sees the old man in
the flashing trainlight as he becomes 

agent smith raising a fistful of black gunmetal

                         neo
          no

the gun fires the bullet flying at her bursting through
the plastic window just as 

trinity disappears

the headset hanging in the air as the bullet hits
shattering the earpiece


int  hovercraft

trinity blinks shivering as her conscious exits the
construct

                         trinity
          neo

                         tank
          what the hell just happened

                         trinity
          an agent  you have to send me back

                         tank
          i cant


int  subway station  day

the destroyed phone dangles in the empty booth  neo turns
to agent smith whose gun stares at him like a third eye

                         agent smith
          mr anderson


int  main deck

morpheus and trinity stand behind tank riveted to the
scrolling code

                         trinity
          run neo  run


int  subway station  day

neo looks at the dead escalator that rises up behind him
slowly he turns back and in his eyes we sees something
different something fixed and hard like a gunfighters
resolve

there is no past or future in these eyes  there is only
what is


int  main deck

trinity is unable to understand

                         trinity
          what is he doing

                         morpheus
          hes beginning to believe


int  subway station  day

neo whipdraws his gun flashpoint speed of lightning as 

smith opens fire

gun report thunders through the underground both men
blasting moving at impossible speed

for a blinking moment we enter bullettime

gun flash tongues curl from neos gun bullets float
forward like a plane moving across the sky cartridges
cartwheel into space

an instant later they are nearly on top of each other
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other 

each jamming their gun tight to the others head

they freeze in a kind of embrace neo sweating panting
agent smith machinecalm

agent smith smiles

                         agent smith
          youre empty

neo pulls the trigger  click

                         neo
          so are you

the smile falls  agent smith yanks his trigger

click

agent smiths face warps with rage and he attacks fists
flying at furious speed blows and counters neo
retreating as 

a knifehand opens his forearm and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column

stunned he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
the beam steel chunks exploding like shrapnel

behind him neo leaps into the air delivering a neck
snapping reverse roundhouse  agent smiths glasses fly
off and he glares at neo his eyes ice blue

                         agent smith
          im going to enjoy watching you die
          mr anderson

agent smith attacks with unrelenting fury fists pounding
neo like jackhammers


int  hovercraft

trinity watches neo as his body jerks mouth coughing
blood his life signs going wild

                         trinity
          jesus hes killing him


int  subway station  day

agent smith grabs hold of him lifting him into the air
hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel
where he falls inches from the electrified thirdrail

the agent is about to jump down and press his attack when
he hears something  from deep in the tunnel like an
animal cry a burst of highspeed metal grinding against
metal

the sound of an oncoming train

neo tries to get up  agent smith jumps down onto the
tracks and dropkicks him in the face

the world again begins to shake rumbling as the train
nears

                         agent smith
          do you hear that mr anderson

agent smith grabs neo in a chokehold forcing him to look
down the tracks the trains headlight burning a hole in
the darkness

                         agent smith
          that is the sound of inevitability

neo sees it coming and he starts to fight

                         agent smith
          it is the sound of your death

there is another metal screech much louder closer as
agent smith tightens his hold  neo is unable to breathe

                         agent smith
          goodbye mr anderson

the train roars at them swallowing agent smiths words
the veins bulge in neos head as he grits through the
pain

he is not ready to die

                         neo
          my name is neo

impossibly he hurls himself straight up smashing smith
against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel

they fall as the sound and fury of the train explodes into
the station

neo backflips up off the tracks just as 

the train barrels over agent smith

neo stands knees shaking when the train slams on its
emergency brake  with an earsplitting shriek of tortured
rails the train slows part of it still in the station

neo turns limping starting to run racing for the
escalator 

as the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car
open agent smith bursts out in furious pursuit his
glasses again intact


int  hovercraft

tank searches the matrix

                         trinity
          what just happened

                         tank
          i dont know  i lost him

                         morpheus
          hes on the run 

suddenly a siren sounds

                         tank
          oh shit

morpheus bolts to the ladder


int  cockpit

morpheus climbs into the cockpit  on the hologram radar
he sees the sentinels

                         trinity
          oh no

trinity is behind him

                         trinity
          how long

                         morpheus

                         tank vo

                         morpheus
          i know trinity  dont worry  hes
          going to make it


ext  city street  day

a businessman walks along the sidewalk wheeling and
dealing into his cell phone when it disappears snatched
by neo as he flashes by

                         man
          what the shit  my phone

the man turns to call for help and when he turns back it
is agent smith

neo is in a full out sprint spinning and weaving away
from every pedestrian every potential agent

he flips open the cell phone and dials long distance


int  hovercraft

tank answers

                         tank
          operator

                         neo vo
          mr wizard get me the fuck out of
          here


ext  city street  day

a pickup truck swerves onto the sidewalk behind him
driven by agent jones

                         neo
          hurry tank  i got some serious
          pursuit

neo dodges down an alley


int  hovercraft

the keyboard clicking tank searches for an exit  trinity
screams into the headset

                         trinity
          neo you better get your ass back
          here


ext  alley

neo burns down the alley the pickup fishtailing behind
him gaining fast

                         neo
          im trying trinity  im trying

he runs feet digging legs pumping and just before the
truck buries him 

he dives into a gangway at the last second


int  main deck

tank speedreads the reams of matrix code

                         tank
          i got a patch on an old exit
          wabash and lake  a hotel  room
          303


ext  city street

neo springs from the gangway head swiveling in all
directions

                         neo
          which way  which way

                         tank vo
          duck

he ducks as a swarm of bullets chew into the brick wall
behind him and spring full bore down the street agent
smith right behind him

                         tank vo
          go straight

neo hauls ass juking ducking and diving feet hardly
touching the ground

                         tank vo
          watch for those girl scouts

agent jones emerges from a bus full of girl scouts that
are unloading on his right

neo veers left as agent brown rises from behind a
newspaper up ahead

                         tank vo
          left  take a left

he does finding himself in an open market 

that teems with people

neo screams and kamikazes his way down the little avenues
lined with vendors and shops

he careens through the labyrinth out of control  and at
every turn there is an agent appearing from crowds
behind fish counters tent flaps and crates

neo spins  he cant shake them  they are everywhere

he dives from the maze down a service alley


int  main deck

tank reaches out to the monitor

                         tank
          no  not down there


ext  alley

it is a dead end

neo turns back as the agents emerge from the market

                         neo
          uh help  need a little help


int  main deck

tank frantically scans the monitor like a road map

                         tank
          that door on your left


ext  alley

neo dives for it but 

                         neo
          its locked

                         tank vo
          kick it in  kick it in

peeling back neo almost kicks the door from its hinges
lunging from the agents bullets


int  apartment building

neo springs up the old crooked apartment building stairs

                         tank vo
          now down that hall

he is halfway down the hall running in sharp long strides
when a door explodes open at the end

                         tank
          shit  the door on your left

neo lurches kicking in an apartment door

                         tank
          no  other left

he whirls back to his other left battering through the
door which splinters perforated by bullets

tank barks directions in neos ear guiding him zigzag
through the apartment

                         tank vo
          right  straight then right

an old woman watches tv as neo blurs past her and into her
kitchen where another woman is chopping vegetables

                         tank vo
          that window

neo throws it open leaping for the fire escape just as a
knife buries itself in the window casing

                         tank
          down  down

tumbling down the rattling fire escape neo leaps the last
ten feet into the alley below with agent brown right
behind him


int  main deck

finger on the monitor tank traces neos path

                         tank
          thats it  youre almost there
          that fire escape at the end of the
          alley


ext  alley

neo scrapes himself to his feet broken and bleeding
charging for the end of the alley

agent smith suddenly pauses as if recognizing something
the faded neon buzzes  chase hotel


int  hovercraft

tank loads the exit

                         tank
          im going to make the call

                         morpheus
          do it

suddenly the lights go red

                         trinity
          no

morpheus looks up

                         morpheus
          here they come


ext  sewer main

the sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as
they attack slamming down onto the nebuchadnezzar


int  hovercraft

the hovercraft booms down as they hit  morpheus opens the
lock on the emp detonator

trinity watches him

                         morpheus
          hes going to make it


ext  alley  day

neo scrambles up the fire escape as bullets spark and
ricochet around him

on the third floor he kicks in the window jumping into
the hall  the doors count backwards  310 309


int  main deck

another systems alarm sounds

                         tank
          theyve burned through the outer
          shields

                         trinity
          hurry neo


int  hall  day

neo can hear the phone ringing

305 304

agent brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
neo grabs the handle to 303 throwing open the door to
find 

agent smith waiting 45 cocked

neo cant move  cant think 

boom


int  main deck

neos body jerks and everyone hears it as the life
monitors snap flatline

trinity screams  morpheus stumbles back in disbelief

                         morpheus
          no it cant be  it cant be

lasers suddenly sear through the main deck as the
sentinels slice open the hull


int  hall  day

three holes in his chest neo falls to the blue shag
carpeting blood smearing down the wall paper  agent
smith stands over him still aiming taking no chances

                         agent smith
          check him


int  main deck

amid the destruction raining around her trinity takes
hold of neos body

                         trinity
          neo


int  hall  day

kneeling beside him agent brown checks his vital signs

                         agent brown
          hes gone

agent smith smiles standing over him

                         agent smith
          goodbye mr anderson


int  main deck

in tears morpheus takes hold of the emp switch

trinity whispers in neos ear

                         trinity
          neo please listen to me  i
          promised to tell you the rest  the
          oracle she told me that id fall in
          love and that man the man i loved
          would be the one  you see  you
          cant be dead neo you cant be
          because i love you  you hear me  i
          love you

her eyes close and she kisses him believing in all her
heart that he will feel her lips and know that they speak
the truth


int  hotel hall  day

he does  and they do

his eyes snap open


int  main deck

trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life  tank
and morpheus look at each other

it is a miracle

                         trinity
          now get up


int  hall  day

holding his chest neo struggles to get up  at the end of
the hall the agents wait for the elevator when agent
smith glances back  he rips off his sunglasses looking at
neo as if he were looking at a ghost

neo gets to his feet all three agents grabbing for their
guns  as one they fire

                         neo
          no

neo raises his hands and the bullets like a cloud of
obedient bees slow and come to a stop  they hang frozen
in space fixed like stainless steel stars

the agents are unable to absorb what they are seeing

neo plucks one of the bullets from the air  we see him
and the hall reflected in the bright casing  we move
closer until the bullet fills our vision and the distorted
reflection morphs becoming the real image

he drops the bullet and the others fall to the floor

neo looks out now able to see through the curtain of the
matrix  for a moment the walls the floor even the
agents become a rushing stream of code


int  main deck

all three stare transfixed with awe as the scrolling code
accelerates faster and faster as if the machine language
was unable to keep up or perhaps describe what is
happening

they begin to blur with brilliant saturated color images
of neo standing in the hall

                         tank
          how

                         morpheus
          he is the one  he is the one

an explosion shakes the entire ship


int  hall

agent smith screams his calm machinelike expression
shredding with pure rage

he rushes neo  his attack is ferocious but neo blocks
each blow easily  then with one quick strike to the chest
he sends agent smith flying backwards

for the first time since their inception the agents know
fear

agent smith gets up and attacks again but as he lunges
neo disappears

spinning around he looks to the others and feels
something like a tremor before a quake something deep
something that is going to change everything

suddenly a searing sound stabs through his earpiece as his
chest begins to swell then balloon as 

neo bursts up out of him  agent smith screams fighting
what seems inevitable as neo absorbs and envelops him
overtaking smith as if he were now an agent until 

only neo is left

neo faces the remaining agents  they look at each other
the same idea striking simultaneously 

they run


int  main deck

sentinels are everywhere destroying the ship  a laser
cuts its way towards morpheus who stands at the emp
detonator

                         trinity
          neo


int  hall

again he hears her  he reacts to the ringing phone
rushing towards it even as 


int  main deck

the lasers burn towards morpheus  on the screen we see
neo dive for the phone as 

the laser hits

                         trinity
          now

morpheus turns the key


int  overflow pit

a blinding shock of white light floods the chamber
sentinels blink and fall instantly dead filling the pit
with their cold metal carcasses


int  hovercraft

in the still darkness only the humans are alive

                         trinity
          neo

his eyes open  tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
reaches up to touch her

and she kisses him it seems like it might last forever

                                            fade to black

fade in

close on computer screen

as in the opening  the cursor beating steadily waiting

a phone begins to ring

it is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
trace program  after a long beat we recognize neos
voice

                         neo vo
          hi  its me  i know youre out
          there  i can feel you now

we close in on the racing columns of numbers shimmering
across the screen

                         neo vo
          i imagine you can also feel me

we dive through the numbers surging up through the
darkness sucked towards a tight constellation of stars

                         neo vo
          i know youre real proud of this
          world youve built the way it
          works all the nice little rules and
          such but ive got some bad news

we realize that the constellation is actually the holes in
the mouthpiece of a phone  seen from inside

                         neo vo
          ive decided to make a few changes

we shoot through the holes as neo hangs up the phone

he steps out of the phone booth and slides on a pair of
sunglasses  he looks up and we rise

higher

 and higher until the city is miles below

after a moment neo blasts by us his long black coat
billowing like a black leather cape as he flies faster
then a speeding bullet

                                            fade out

                         the end
