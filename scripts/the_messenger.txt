fade in

ext  church  domremy  day

fade up on ripples on the surface of a puddle  slow pan
up  the water becomes placid and in it we see the
reflection of an inverted cross on the top of a small
church  we move across the little churchyard and in
through the open doors


int  church  domremy  day

utter simplicity  stone walls roughhewn wooden
benches primitive saints in the stainedglass windows 
chickens peck among the straw that covers the earthen
floor


int  confessional box  church  day

a little wooden grill slides open and the friendly face of
the village priest peers at us  he glances about
perplexed

					priest
		is anybody there

a small hand appears  then the face of a girl aged about
10 peering up at him through the grill  the priest
smiles a trifle wearily

					priest
		you know im always happy to see
		you jeanne but to keep coming here
		twice three times a day

					jeanne
		i need to confess

					priest
		but you already confessed this
		morning

					jeanne
		i need to confess again

					priest
		so alright  what terrible sin
		have you committed since then that
		cant wait till tomorrow to be
		forgiven

jeanne climbs up on the prayerstool to be tall enough to
look the priest in the eye

					jeanne
		i saw a poor monk without shoes so i
		gave him some

					priest
		theres no sin in charity jeanne

					jeanne
		they werent my shoes  mine were
		too small

					priest
		whose were they

					jeanne
		my fathers

					priest
		im sure hell forgive you

					jeanne
		he already did but i want god to
		forgive me too

					priest
		jeanne  if we were to ask
		forgiveness all the time wed spend
		our whole life in church

					jeanne
		is that bad

					priest
			   perplexed
		well no but jeanne are you
		happy at home

					jeanne
		oh yes very

					priest
		and your mother  everythings fine
		with her

					jeanne
		oh yes shes wonderful

flash  we see jeannes peasant mother sitting by the
fire sewing  their home is little more than a hovel  a
low dark cave of a place traversed by a huge beam

					priest
		good good  and your sister
		catherine  shes still your best
		friend

					jeanne
		oh yes my sisters just shes
		wonderful

flash  jeannes sister catherine 18 sits near her
mother spinning wool

					priest
		and what about your other friends
		you dont like playing with them

					jeanne
		oh yes i play with them lots

flash  jeanne is battling against some reeds with a
wooden stick under a full noonday sun  not far away a
group of kids are in the shadow of a huge tree playing
one of them watches jeanne in the distance

					kid 1
		whats she doing

					kid 2
		playing

resume on the priest

					priest
		so everything sounds
		wonderful

					jeanne
		yes it is

					priest
		then why are you here so often

					jeanne
		i feel safe here  and its where i
		can talk to him

					priest
		him

					jeanne
		well i try and talk to him but
		mostly hes the one who does the
		talking

					priest
		who is this he

					jeanne
		he never says his name

					priest
		what does he look like

flash  a little boy of 8 sitting on a throne in a
clearing in a wood

					jeanne
		beautiful

					priest
		and what does he say to you

flash  the boy points solemnly at us but says nothing

					jeanne
		he says he says i must be good
		and help everyone and take care
		of myself  do you think hes coming
		from the sky

					priest
		perhaps but wherever he comes
		from i think you should listen to
		him because it sounds like hes
		giving you very good advice

the priest smiles and jeanne beams back at him  he
blesses her

					priest
		ego te absolvo in nomine patris et
		filii et spiritus sancti amen


ext  church  stream  day

jeanne runs from the little church the weight of her sins
now happily off her shoulders  her reflection skips
across a little stream then on through a meadow of
cowslips and buttercups and up the sloping hillside
beyond


ext  meadow  wood  dusk

a hazy summer dusk  pollen floating in the shimmering
air jeanne swirls between the high elms happy and
carefree  its all a little surreal  are those church
bells in the distance  or cow bells  or merely the sound
of insects

jeanne swings round faster and faster then tumbles over
laughing and lies on her back  shes dizzy and out of
breath  above her the clouds seeming to swirl as though
she were still spinning round

the sound of the bells slows down deepening her face
moves into shadow  although not distinguishable as words
at this stage theres an urgent whisper in the wind a
strange echo that will eventually resolve into a call
jeanne

presently jeanne turns and sees something glinting in the
long grass  a sword  the background sound of the bells
grows ominous  a shooting star silently flashes across
the sky  then scores of them  she gets to her feet and
picks up the heavy sword  its growing darker  colder
 the leaves have turned to autumn brown now blown about
by a gust of wind

presently she sees a wolf approaching slowly but straight
toward her  then two three  finally the whole pack
she grips the sword but cant use it  too heavy too
frightened  as the wolves approach she closes her
eyes

the wolves pass either side of her as though oblivious to
her presence  when she opens her eyes they have passed
and are now heading along the forest track


ext  forest  night

jeanne follows the wolves along the track  theyre
heading toward a red glow visible beyond the trees  the
wolves disappear over a ridge though all we can see for
the moment is the red sky beyond  but as jeanne reaches
the edge we move up with her to see

 her village in the valley below ablaze


ext  domremy village  night

panic  screams  crashing timbers  animals stampeding
 wolves drag corpses from gutted buildings  and
through the midst of the tumult tears jeanne still
dragging the sword she found  she runs inside a farm
cottage


int  jeannes home  night

the low dark building we saw earlier  now empty lit by
the fires of the houses on the far side of the street
jeanne runs in searching about 

					jeanne
		mother

no response  she begins to panic  runs through into a
smaller room beyond calling out 

					jeanne
		catherine

suddenly a door swings open and a hand reaches out 
jeanne screams then turns to see her elder sister
catherine whos been hiding in a cupboard

					catherine
		jeanne

catherine embraces her hugging her in relief 

					catherine
		are you alright  did they hurt you

					jeanne
		no no im fine really

					catherine
		i was so worried  weve all been
		looking for you  the english are
		everywhere  o thank you lord

she hugs her again  then freezes hearing the sound of
horses the clanking of armor  but jeanne hasnt heard

					jeanne
		i was in church

catherine glances about ears tuned

					catherine
		really

					jeanne
		i was talking to the priest and do
		you know what he said to me

catherine puts her hand across jeannes mouth 

					catherine
		shhh tell me later

she hears the drunken laughter getting closer

					catherine
		quick  hide in here

					jeanne
		what about you

					catherine
		dont worry about me  just stay in
		here and dont move

					jeanne
		but where are you going to be

					catherine
		ill be right here i promise

catherine quickly lifts jeanne inside the cupboard locks
the door then turns to confront three hefty ruffians
calling themselves soldiers  the biggest and ugliest has
a jet black beard

					blackbeard
		now thats what i call booty

blackbeard turns back to his comrades who are sharing out
a roast chicken between them  catherine picks up the
sword dropped by jeanne as blackbeard swaggers up to
her

					blackbeard
		a woman with a sword
			   to his comrades
		hey take a look at this 
		frenchmen are such cowards that
		theyve left all the fighting to
		women

					catherine
		if thats gods will then so be it

blackbeards comrades start tucking into their food
leaving blackbeard to his pleasure

					blackbeard
		fine with me  i love women

he undoes his buckle  from her pov behind the cupboard
door jeanne can just about see blackbeards face through
a crack  catherine raises the heavy sword as blackbeard
advances then brings it sweeping down  but he intercepts
it effortlessly grasping the blade as though it were a
twig

					blackbeard
		oh now youve hurt my feeling

he puts his hand around her throat rips off her little
wooden cross pins her against the door then with a
lecherous roar plunges his face on her

jeanne is terrified  blackbeard has his tunic down and is
attempting to gain entry  catherine tries to scream 
he slams his hand over her mouth  she bites it 
blackbeard howls with laughter  now his juices are
really moving  catherine squirms against the door
twisting and turning 

					blackbeard
		hold still bitch  how can i do it
		if you keep wriggling about

he picks her up by the throat lifts her clear off the
floor by several inches then rams the sword clean through
her gut and the door behind her the blade just missing
jeanne

					blackbeard
		there thats better

with a grin at his comrades blackbeard resumes his
intercourse with the lifeless catherine  behind the door
jeanne is suffocating with terror

the little wooden necklace lies on the floor in fg as
blackbeard pulls up his pants and turns to his comrades 

					blackbeard
		your turn


ext  churchyard  village  day

the little village church is no more than a smoldering
pile of rubble  among it the twisted stainedglass of
an angel  corpses are piled up alongside a warren of
shallow graves awaiting committal  the priest passes by
each grave in turn administering hasty last rites then
moving onto the next while a harassed gravedigger fills
in the last

jeanne stands by a shallow grave now wearing her sisters
wooden cross and grazing fixedly at her body wrapped in
linen and awaiting interment  her parents and other
adults stand nearby but at jeannes level we only see
them from the waist down

					man 1 os
		we shouldnt be doing this by
		daylight its too dangerous

					man 2 os
		youre right  the english are
		still around  i can smell them

					man 3 os
		when is the king going to do
		something

					man 1 os
		hes good for nothing

					man 2 os
		yeah we cant even be sure he
		really is a king
			   whispering
		i heard someone say hes a
		bastard

					man 1 os
		with a mother like that  i wouldnt
		be surprised shes such a
		whore

					woman os
		can you show some respect  were
		burying our children  you should be
		praying instead of cursing

					man 2 os
		thats just about all we can do

					woman os
		yes because only god can help us

now the priest scurries over hurriedly mumbles the last
rites in latin then moves on to the next grave  jeannes
family have their eyes closed in prayer and it is only
jeanne who sees the gravedigger nudge the corpse into the
shallow grave with his foot  he shovels in the earth
then moves on  the father puts his hand on her shoulder

					father
		listen jeanne your uncle and
		aunt are taking you to their house
		for a few weeks just to give us
		time to rebuild what we can

jeanne looks at him blankly her thoughts too deep for
tears


ext  village  road  day

jeanne sits on the back of a small haywagon  her uncle
and aunt are up front eyes on the barren devastated
countryside ahead while jeanne gazes fixedly on the road
behind  from her pov  the receding figures of her
parents gradually merging with the dusty landscape


int  daxarts house  night

a large low room almost identical to jeannes house  a
bare earthen floor with chickens running about and a
huge cave of a fireplace  the aunt doles out soup from a
cauldron  first to her husband then to jeanne

					daxart
		lord we give thanks for the food
		you have given us  teach us always
		to love this land and to save it
		from those who seek to destroy it
		amen

jeanne says nothing  noted by daxart  his wife nudges
him with a gesture to let her be


int  daxart attic  night

daxart opens the door to an attic room his wife standing
behind him with jeanne  she wanders into the room tidy
but sparse and sits on the edge of the bed  daxart looks
a little put out

					daxart
		so good night then

the aunt understands jeanne better than her husband and
leads him from the room


int  sleeping quarters  night

the daxarts share the communal sleeping area with a couple
of goats and a mangy dog  daxart is settling down to
sleep but his wife lies awake

					aunt
		whats going to happen to her

					daxart
		shell be fine  shell grow up
		find a good man make him some
		children  dont worry  shes been
		hurt but shell survive  tomorrow
		shell be as right as rain youll
		see


int  daxart attic  day

daxart opens the door to the attic  jeanne has not moved
shes still sitting on the bed like the day before

					jeanne
		i want to see a priest


int  village church  day

christ crucified in stained glass  a silver cup is
raised in blessing

the local priest much older than the one at domremy
lowers the cup filled with wine in preparation for the
mass  the daxarts enter the church at the far end with
jeanne between them  the priest is expecting her


int  confessional box  day

jeanne sits in the shielded darkness of the confessional
box  she clutches at her little wooden cross and at last
begins to cry

					priest
		i heard about your sister and i
		understand your pain

					jeanne
		why did she have to die

					priest
		only god knows the answer to that

					jeanne
		i know jesus says to love our
		enemies but i cant  i just want
		the english to burn in hell for ever
		and ever

					priest
		i realize your anger jeanne but we
		must learn to forgive  its hard
		but revenge will never bring about
		peace

					jeanne
		then what will  and what will bring
		her back  and why did she have to
		die in the first place instead of
		me  why didnt he take my life
		instead of hers  it was my fault 
		i was late  she gave me her hiding
		place

					priest
		jeanne calm down  calm down
		jeanne

jeanne breaks off trembling tears pouring down her
cheeks

					priest
		i dont pretend to know gods will
		but i am sure of one thing  the
		lord always has a good reason
		perhaps he saved you because he
		needs you for some higher
		calling  so as long as you
		answer that call your sister will
		not have died in vain

jeanne clams down  she stares at the priest for a long
moment and her look becomes very deep and intense

					jeanne
		i dont want to wait for his call

					priest
		jeanne be patient

					jeanne
		i want to be with him always

					priest
		soon youll be able to take the holy
		mass and as you eat of his flesh
		and drink of his blood you will be
		at one with him

					jeanne
		i want to be at one with him now


ext  country road  day

on the open road with jeanne sitting on the back of
daxarts wagon  its a grey lowering dismal sort of
day  the daxarts are up front talking in low voices

					daxart
		what did he say

					aunt
		he says we must bring her to church
		whenever she wants

					daxart
		hmmm easy for him  hes not the
		one that has to do the bringing

behind them the wagon is empty  jeanne is long gone


ext  countryside  day

the rain pours down in torrents  jeanne runs


ext  village  day

 down the deserted road  into the church


int  village church  day

 and up the aisle to the altar  she grabs a jug of
wine pours some into the chalice  holds it up high as
the priest did then gulps it down  the wine cascades
from her mouth like blood as she gazes up at the stained
glass image 

					jeanne
		i want to be with you now


int  daxart house  dawn

daxart sits bolt upright awaking from a nightmare  its
early morning his wife still asleep beyond him


int ext  daxart atticpov of field  dawn

daxart opens the door to jeannes room  empty the bed
unslept in  he walks in  hears something  looking out
of the window he sees 

jeanne in the distance playing be herself  daxart
smiles


ext  house  field  dawn

jeanne pauses her stick poised in midair 


subliminal flash 

 a real sword impales a soldier through the stomach 
another sword slices through chainmail  and a severed
head encased in metal spins lose from armored shoulders


ext  house  field  dawn

jeanne looks at daxart

					jeanne
		im playing

once again jeanne raises her sticksword  the head of a
sunflower is violently decapitated 


int  chinon  state room  day

 and a sword swishes down trying to hack someone in the
leg  but it is only a wooden sword and its wielder a
mere boy of five  this is young prince louis practicing
his nascent swordsmanship on the castle guards

voices and approaching footsteps alert the guards who
quickly stand to attention as a door is swung open

					guard
		the dauphin

louis takes advantage of the guards forced immobility and
jabs one of them in the leg he lets out a muffled ow

the dauphin charles vii enters followed by his courtiers
they include the bloated regnault archbishop of rheims
and georges de la tremoille  a sly and devious diplomat

					charles
		louis shouldnt you be learning
		your lessons

					louis
		i dont want to learn i want to
		fight

					charles
		you will you will  but for now
		you must learn at least to wipe
		your nose

charles who speaks with a slight stutter affectionately
wipes his sons nose with a corner of his shirt  beyond
them a young soldier jean daulon arrives with a
scroll

					aulon
		a letter for his majesty

tremoille takes it opens the seal and begins to read
charles hands over louis to a courtier

					tremoille
		another one from this girl calling
		herself the maiden of lorraine

charles snatches it somewhat testily from tremoille

					charles
		i can read for myself you know

while charles reads tremoille turns aside to regnault 

					tremoille
		she pretends shes been sent by god
		these charlatans  its a pity
		there isnt enough wood to burn them
		all

					charles
		she says shell be here tomorrow

					tremoille
		you mustnt see her my lord  we
		know nothing about her we dont
		even know if she is from lorraine

					charles
		what difference does it make where
		she comes from

					tremoille
		if she comes from burgundy it makes
		a difference  it might be a trap
			   takes back letter
		look signed x  what sort of
		name is x  or must we conclude
		that a messenger of god cant even
		write her own name

					regnault
		my lord tremoille is correct  she
		says she hears voices she may be
		a sorceress a witch

					charles
			   snatching back
			    letter
		regnault  you see witches
		everywhere  shes just a peasant
		a peasant who cares for her king
		look all she wants is to help me
		win my crown and permission to
		fight for me

					tremoille
		not exactly
			   takes back letter
		she wants you to give her an army 
		at your expanse  bearing in mind
		that your mother stole every last
		piece of gold in the treasury i
		fail to see how you can afford such
		an adventure

					charles
			   snatches back
			    letter
		i can see her if i want to  i mean
		with half of france in the hands of
		the english what have i got to
		lose

					tremoille
		the other half

					regnault
		you mustnt see her my lord  she
		may be an instrument of the devil

					yolande os
		well i think you should

all eyes turn to the window where yolande has been
standing with her back to the room reading a little book
her rightarm is standing beside her  richmond his face
hideously disfigured by battle scars

					charles
		ah yolande and what makes you
		think the exact opposite of my two
		most trusted advisors

yolande smiles though hardly a devoted smile  mild
contempt would be more accurate

					yolande
		because i care about you  come here

charles walks over  he has his shirt undone  yolande
buttons it back up

					yolande
		your health and happiness has always
		been my first concern charles
		ever since you were a little boy 
		and i think i know you better than
		your own mother

					charles
		you think

					yolande
		mmmm  yes  i know for example the
		sickness that plagues your heart  i
		know how painful it is for you to
		have loved a father without ever
		knowing if he really was yours

					charles
		wwwhat has that got to do with
		this maiden

					yolande
		who better than a messenger from god
		to give answers to your questions

					charles
		you really think shes been sent
		by god

					yolande
		youre a fine judge of character
		charles  itll take you less than
		five minutes to expose her if shes
		a fake  but if shes not  then
		she will give you your answers
		and place the crown on your head

charles shines at the prospect but tremoille and regnault
look less than happy

					tremoille
		with respect my lady i think its
		going to take more than just a
		simple peasant girl to

					yolande
		im not interested in what you
		think tremoille  or even what i
		think  its what simple people
		think that matters and the fact is
		that simple people up and down the
		country are already talking about
		her  now you know what simple
		people are like always ready to
		believe any old prophecy like
		this one about a virgin from
		lorraine saving france
			   hands tremoille the
			    book
		and now this girl comes along 
		from lorraine  and suddenly
		theres a spark of hope in their
		simple minds  we shouldnt
		disappoint them  if they believe in
		her  if she can put back the fire
		in our army  then i believe in her
		too


ext  chinon  long shot  night

moving torches gallop toward us  a flame flares through
foreground with a whoosh panning round as soldiers ride
toward the distant castle of chinon  a gloomy great
silhouette rising against a bloody sunset


int  chinon  great hall  night

celebrations after a hunt  troubadours play  a whole
tree trunk is burning in the vast chimney  a page comes
running into the big room and hurries excitedly over to
charles

					page
		shes coming your majesty with
		an armed escort

					charles
		alright alright  calm yourself

					tremoille
		your majesty i urge you not to see
		this woman  it all reeks of a
		burgundian trap

					charles
		my astrologers assure me that the
		hour is pppropitious  leo with
		virgo rising  have you ever noticed
		on the astrological chart how the
		virgin is next to the lion

					tremoille
		supposing shes an assassin

					charles
		tremoille im not even king yet
		whod want to assassinate me

looking around at his courtiers  they all would


ext  chinon courtyard  night

a flame swirls in the darkness  the urgent clatter of
horses hooves  steaming breath in the cold night air 
the sound of festivities coming from the castle walls
beyond  the horses are reined  one whinnies as
soldiers jump down onto the cobbles  a dark cape wraps
about a figure


int  chinon  great hall  night

another page boy bursts in 

					page 2
		shes arrived my lord  shes in
		the guards room

					charles
		so i suppose id better make a
		decision

charles glances between tremoille regnault and yolande
but  either by accident of will  none are looking his
way  he sighs deeply to the dashing openfaced young
soldier we saw earlier jean daulon

					charles
		oh dear why is life so complicated
		sometimes i really wish i could be
		someone else

					aulon
		thats a good idea sire

					charles
		what do you mean

					aulon
		let someone else pretend to be you
		and see if

					charles
		 if she can find me  thats a
		brilliant idea  if shes really
		been sent by god shell discover the
		trap and if shes an assassin
		shell kill the wrong man
			   to the page
		bring her up

charles turns to a coterie of army captains standing
aside and aloof from the courtiers whom they evidently
despise

					charles
		my dear captains ive had a
		brilliant idea  were going to have
		a little game  now lets pretend
		my throne is empty  who wants to be
		the king

they all put up their hands

					charles
		now theres a heartwarming sight
		so lets see which one of you
		could possibly pass as king

he turns to the duke of alencon 25 strikingly handsome
in his bright gilded armor

					charles
		ah alencon my noble duke my royal
		cousin  so fine so brave so rich
		 so very rich  so fartoorich
		to be the king of france  everyone
		knows im the poorest man in my
		kingdom

he turns to gilles de rais  a dark glamorous seducer
dressed in black armor with a ring through one ear

					charles
		gilles de rais marshal of
		france formidable to men
		fascinating to women feared by all
		youd be perfect to sit on my
		throne so perfect that you might
		like it too much for my own piece of
		mind

charles turns to the bearded la hire

					charles
		ah la hire  my angry captain
		the bravest in france  scarred by
		a dozen wars but with heart and
		stomach for a dozen more  you could
		pass for the king

					la hire
		damn bloody right i could

					charles
		 until you opened your mouth  no
		one with a tongue like yours could
		pass as the king of france

the other captains laugh heartily

					charles
		ah well it looks as though its
		going to have to be me after all
		but wait a minute

charles spots the shy jean daulon  unlike the other
court toadies aulon is a quiet honorable man

					charles
		why not you  jean daulon  the
		only man whos poorer than i am and
		so the only man i can trust
		dignified honorable wise what
		more could we ask of a king

					aulon
		my lord im not sure that

charles takes his coat and puts it around aulons
shoulders

					charles
		my dear aulon to you it shall
		befall the honor of impersonating
		the royal blood

					aulon
		majesty i cant

					charles
		why are you not ready to die for
		your king

					aulon
		of course i am its just that

					charles
		good  until then feel free to live
		like a king

laughter  then the sound of approaching excitement

					charles
		hurry hurry  on the throne


int  corridor  chinon  night

armored feet clank along a stone corridor 


int  great hall  chinon  night

charles unceremoniously dumps aulon on the throne

					aulon
		sire you know how bad i am at this
		sort of game

					charles
		so pretend its not a game

charles abandons aulon and disappears among his courtiers
a pair of page boys swing open the doors  the courtiers
turn expectantly aulon tries to pose as the king

from the courts pov a girl of 17 enters the great hall
dressed in a grubby tunic with long hair tied back
beneath a hood  there could not be a more striking
contrast than the sophisticated opulent yet cowardly
courtiers and this naive rough girl almost childlike in
her simplicity and yet so focused so confident so
secure in her mission with a courage that radiates
conviction and is contagious

the courtiers step back to form a narrow channel as she
moves into the great hall  yolande marks the effect her
presence has on the court smiling at their bemused gazes

jeanne passes the archbishop who defends himself by
sprinkling holy water in her path  tremoille oils his way
toward her with a canihelp ingratiating smile

					jeanne
		i have come to see the dauphin

tremoille nods obsequiously ushering her toward aulon
who is now visibly uneasy  jeanne stops in front of him
aulon gazes at her  jeanne scans him a couple of times
looks at him stonily  then smiles  aulon melts his
cheeks blushing hot  jeanne cocks her head like an
inquisitive child

					jeanne
		who are you

aulon stammers in response

					aulon
		im im im

					tremoille
		 his most gracious majesty
		charles de valois dauphin of
		france

she gives aulon another smile

					jeanne
		i can see you are a good man but
		youre not the dauphin
			   to tremoille
		im sorry to insist but we have no
		time to lose  i must see the
		dauphin  where is he

					tremoille
		hes here
			   a gracious gesture
		find him yourself

a brief pause then jeanne takes up the challenge  she
moves on examining the faces acutely  although a few of
the wimpoled ladies find her simple peasant dress amusing
most are caught like moths in her flame  she notices the
three captains la hire alencon and gilles de rais
edging closer together as though shielding someone
beyond

jeanne approaches them  they draw closer together but
now we can see charles overtly curious yet anxious to
remain hidden  his inquisitiveness wins  but as jeanne
walks up to him the three captains spring in front of
her swords drawn the tips pressing at her throat

					jeanne
		theres no need to be afraid sire

					charles
		im im not the king

					jeanne
		i know youre not yet  but you
		will be soon

charles makes a gesture and the soldiers cautiously
sheath their swords

					charles
		hhhow did you know who i am

					alencon
		her voices of course

					gilles
		thats him they said the one
		with the big nose and bags under his
		eyes

they laugh  whereupon jeanne rushes at charles and
flings herself on her knees embracing him round the
ankles

charles screams  the 3 captains redraw their swords 
the court gasps  then charles gestures the captains to
back off

					jeanne
		my gentle dauphin i bring you good
		news

charles puts out his hand to her allowing her to rise
she draws close to him whispering

					jeanne
		it is a message from the king of
		heaven  for you  and you only

jeanne speaks with such conviction that it seems
unnecessary to doubt her  her mesmeric effect on charles
is being noticed by his courtiers  he hesitates a moment
then 

					charles
		follow me

he leads her from the room  tremoille hurriedly follows
them  charles turns round in the doorway barring him
further access

					tremoille
		your majesty i really think you

					charles
		my dear loyal tremoille i know i
		can count on you

					tremoille
		 as always majesty

					charles
		 to ensure our privacy  i need
		to talk to her  alone

tremoille looks nonplussed

					tremoille
		as you wish majesty

charles disappears with jeanne

tremoille ire at being barred is mollified by blocking the
path of yolande

					tremoille
		he needs to talk to her  alone


int  castle  kings chamber  day

jeanne is seated facing charles in front of a huge fire
as the scene unfolds their faces draw closer and closer
her voice is soft and sweet but her conviction is
absolute

					jeanne
		i was about eight years old  it was
		a beautiful spring day  i was in
		the forest taking a short cut home
		when the wind started blowing in the
		trees  such a strange sound 
		almost like words  as if someone
		was calling

flash  the little boy seen earlier is seated on his chair
in the middle of the field pointing his finger at us 


int  castle  kings chamber  day

charles is intrigued

					jeanne
		the second time was many years
		later  it was autumn and i was
		coming back from church when
		suddenly the same violent wind
		started to blow again


ext  field  sfx  day

flash  the wind lifts jeanne 17 from the ground spins
her forward and flattens her on her back her arms
outstretched her face gazing upward at the sky

					jeanne os
		everything was moving so fast  the
		wind  the clouds  i couldnt
		move  then suddenly a shape
		appeared in the middle of the sky

the fastmoving clouds resolve themselves into the shape
of a face the face of an old man  he opens his mouth
wide radiating a shaft of sunlight that strikes jeanne
still lying in the field  the old mans mouth seems to
form the word jeanne but the sound that emanates is so
vast that we cant be sure

suddenly the mouth snaps shut releasing a huge flash of
light 


int  castle  kings chamber  day

 charles jumps back startled yet totally absorbed
jeannes eyes sparkle with tears 

					jeanne
		i was so frightened he was so 
		so here

flash  the boy is still sitting in his forest seat but
now he is a beautiful young man pointing his finger at
jeanne 

					jeanne os
		i realized then that he had chosen
		me but i didnt understand what it
		was i had to do

jeannes eyes sparkle with intensity

					jeanne
		what was my mission  to help my
		country  but how could i do that
		i was only a poor girl who knew
		nothing about riding or making
		war so i decided to wait and not
		to speak to anyone about it

					charles
		you did well

					jeanne
		i didnt wait long  one day i was
		going to mass like i do every day
		when the same strange wind started
		blowing again


int ext  church  sfx

the double doors of a church are blown open by wind coming
from inside  right in front of jeanne  surreal shafts
of light crisscross the interior from the stainedglass
windows illuminating jeanne in myriad hues and colors

she sways uneasily as the central stainedglass window
above the altar starts to warp and undulate like heat
waves creating a mirage  the image of a beautiful
archangel slowly comes to life stepping out from the
window frame then moving toward jeanne

					jeanne
		everything was suddenly made clear
		to me  god was finally calling me
		he had a mission for me  a message
		to deliver

the archangel opens his arms to jeanne as though to
embrace her  she drops to her knees opening her arms and
 flash 


int  castle  kings chamber  day

charles is in suspense his face sweating

					charles
		 and what what did he say

					jeanne
		he said that i have to save france
		from her enemies and give her back
		to god and he told me that i 
		jeanne  will lead you to the altar
		at rheims to be crowned king of
		france

charles slowly releases the breath hes been holding 
and the brimming tears run down his cheeks  jeanne takes
his hand and places it on her own damp cheek

					jeanne
		all you have to do now is put your
		trust in me

jeanne kisses his hands and charles is almost overcome
with emotion  he seems for the first time utterly
defenseless like the little hurt boy that he is

					charles
		i trust you jeanne  i do  and
		i envy your certainty but how can i
		be certain that i have the right to
		call myself king when i dont even
		know who my father is  my mother
		cant even remember i  i need
		to know

jeanne gazes at him a moment then places her hands either
side of his head and draws him slowly forward until both
their foreheads are touching

flashes

a series of tooperfect images

1  a bell comes crashing down on top of us 

2  the royal banner flies triumphantly in the wind 

3  english captains throw down their weapons and kneel in
    submission before charles 

4  huge city gates swing open releasing a jubilant crowd
    who welcome the king in triumph 

5  charles kneels in rheims cathedral 

6  bejeweled hands place the crown of france on his
    head 


int  chinon  kings chamber  day

jeannes hands hold charles head as though she has just
crowned him  for charles the fantasy has become reality

					jeanne
		do you really believe that god would
		let all this happen if you were
		not the true king of france


int  castle  great hall  day

the courtiers talk among themselves nervously awaiting
charles to rejoin them  presently the door opens and
charles emerges followed by jeanne  he is a man
transfigured  tremoille looks anxious  charles glances
at them their expectant eyes awaiting his verdict  he
leads jeanne across to aulon

					charles
		jeanne this is  in fact  my
		loyal friend and finest archer jean
		daulon  jean i place her in
		your care  find her suitable
		lodgings  here  in the castle
		and guard her with your life

					aulon
		yes my lord

					jeanne
		i dont need lodgings if were to be
		marching on orleans

					charles
		orleans has held out for six months
		i dont suppose a few days will make
		much difference  take some rest

jeanne follows jean daulon from the great hall watched
in silence by his courtiers  as soon as shes gone the
whole room is filled with the myriad buzz of opinion
gilles gives charles the eye

					gilles
		she certainly cast a spell on you

charles draws his three captains aside

					charles
		shell cast her spell on everyone if
		shes given half a chance and we
		must ensure that she gets that
		chance

the captains look astonished

					charles
		can you imagine the effect it will
		have on the english  to see a girl
		riding at the head of our army

					la hire
		yes  theyll bleeding wet
		themselves  laughing

					gilles
		were not your favorite captains
		anymore

					charles
		no  i mean yes  of course

					alencon
		charles you want to give the
		command of our army to a  woman

					charles
		of course not  youre the ones in
		command as always but if she can
		put back the fire in our soldiers
		then maybe you my dear captains
		will be able to raise the siege of
		orleans  what do you think

					gilles
		brilliant idea but to be really
		effective why not send a whole army
		of virgins

					la hire
		thatll put fire in my soldiers

the captains laugh  at charles expense

					charles
		please my friends you know me
		you know how certain i am about
		everything but  maybe for the
		first time in my life i  i dont
		know why  but i feel i have to
		trust her and now im asking you
		 im begging you  to trust me


int  room  chinon castle  day

jeanne blows the dust from a wooden crucifix then
replaces it above a bed  jean daulon has brought her to
a small room in one of the castles turrets  clean
plainly furnished but hardly hospitable  jeanne inspects
the room while aulon stands by the door

					aulon
		listen please accept my apologies
		for you know me pretending to be
		the well it wasnt really my
		idea well yes it was my idea
		but

					jeanne
		do you think i could have some
		water

jeanne smiles sweetly catching aulon off guard

					aulon
		yes of course water anything
		else

two page boys run into the room carrying luggage water
washing bowl and some food  they are louis and raymond
both 13 as inseparable as they are loyal  jeanne looks
up then sits on the bed testing the horsehair mattress

					jeanne
		i would like some fresh straw

					aulon
		louis water and fresh straw

louis goes running off

					jeanne
		and i would like to see a priest

					aulon
		now

					jeanne
		yes  i didnt confess today

					aulon
		right
			   to raymond
		raymond a priest

raymond goes running off

					jeanne
		i shall also be needing a war horse
		 mine is too slow  and armor 
		and a good sword  and an artist to
		make me a banner

					aulon
		now

					jeanne
		better today than tomorrow

					aulon
		well uh  this might take a
		little time  but let me see what i
		can do

hes about to leave when jeanne adds 

					jeanne
		i also need someone who can read and
		write

					aulon
		this i can do
			   jeanne looks
			    surprised
		i was studying at the university of
		paris  till the english invaded
		it

					jeanne
		i thought you were an archer

					aulon
		yes i am  im an archer who can
		read and write  who do you want to
		write to

					jeanne
		the king of england  i want to give
		them the chance to leave orleans in
		peace before i get there

aulon just stares at her


int  guard house  chinon  dawn

raymond hands a rolled parchment to a rider already
mounted and waiting


ext  chinon castle  meadow  dawn

the rider gallops over the drawbridge and away


ext  chinon  terrace  day

tremoille stands on a terrace before chinon watching the
rider heading down the dusty highway

					tremoille
		i cant believe you let her send
		such a letter

charles is a short distance away watching jeanne in a
meadow below the castle swishing a stick from side to
side

					charles
		shes going to do it

tremoille exchanges a worried glance with archbishop
regnault who is standing behind charles

					regnault
		sire its going to take more than a
		letter to drive out the english

					tremoille
		an army for instance

					charles
		my captains have sworn their
		support

					tremoille
		no doubt your captains will fight
		for your fine cause  but what
		about the ordinary soldier  they
		dont fight for causes these days
		they fight for money  whos going
		to pay them

					yolande os
		i am

yolande moves forward accompanied by her daughter mary
charles wife and grandson young louis

					charles
		you will

					yolande
		for the sake of france charles
		and for the sake of my grandson

she pats louis on the head

					tremoille
		with respect my lady  the
		archbishop and i have begun delicate
		negotiations with the burgundians
		if we can bring them over to our
		side

					yolande
		negotiate by all means but from a
		position of strength  if the
		english take orleans therell be
		nothing left to negotiate  the
		rest of the country will be theirs

					tremoille
		my lady it would be the height of
		folly to let this child lead
		our army in the kings name without
		first verifying her true motives

					regnault
		tremoille is right  this girl must
		be subjected to a rigorous
		examination by the doctors of the
		church at poitiers  we need to be
		absolutely certain that she is not
		an instrument of the devil

					charles
		how can anyone be absolutely certain
		about anything  our intuitions are
		sometimes our best counselors

					regnault
		we must listen to mother holy church
		before listening to our intuitions

					tremoille
		wait she claims to be a virgin
		well thats something we can examine
		 and be absolutely certain about

charles hesitates  turns to yolande who looks somewhat
uneasy at the suggestion

					yolande
		why not

charles looks across to jeanne in the distance still
playing with her stick  suddenly she swipes at a bulrush
violently decapitating its head  charles looks worried

					charles
		lets find out


int  poitiers university  room  night

a big spacious room into which files a procession of ten
doctors of theology and ten notables walking twobytwo
they divide either side of camera then halt and about
turn facing inward with military precision  two page
boys set up screens in front of the two rows preventing
them from viewing jeanne who is standing on a low table
between the rows wearing a lacedup robe

now a procession of nuns form up behind the table  two of
them step forward on cue then proceed to loosen the
laces of jeannes robe and roll up the hem  meanwhile an
old hag is washing her hands

with jeanne suitably prepared the old hag stands in front
of her  two little girls slip in a special stool and the
old hag squats down enabling her to look between jeannes
legs  only women are privy to this ritualistic
inspection the men remain standing behind the screens

yolande waits with the disfigured richmond near a window
the old hag is certainly taking her time and yolande is
getting decidedly nervous

					richmond
			   whispering
		what if shes not

					yolande
		ill kill her myself

a few tense moments  then the ancient hag announces with
great solemnity

					hag
		there is no sign of corruption or
		violation  she is intact

 to yolandes visible relief


int  council room  poitiers university  day

a dark musty council room where theologians and learned
doctors of the church sit in wooden tiers examining
jeanne  archbishop regnault is among them  so too is
jean daulon  but he as a silent albeit supportive
observer

jeanne stands in the center of the room hands folded as
though on trial  shes evidently been here many hours

					inquisitor 1
		and what exactly was this 
		vision  wearing

					jeanne
		i dont remember

					inquisitor 2
		was it wearing a crown

					jeanne
		i saw no crown

					inquisitor 3
		well was it naked

the court have a good chuckle

					jeanne
		do you think that god cant afford
		to give him clothes

an audible reaction somewhere between amusement and
admiration  a deadpan scribe carefully writes down both
questions and answers in a large vellumbound book

					inquisitor 1
		did this  vision  give you
		anything  an object like a ring
		or a rosary or anything  by which
		we can verify your claim

					jeanne
		he gave me good advice

					inquisitor 4
		during your childhood did you have
		any sort of military experience

					jeanne
		no

					inquisitor
		are you practiced in the skills of
		swordsmanship

					jeanne
		no  but im good with a stick

a murmur of laughter though not from us

					inquisitor 4
		do you know what a dijon culverin
		is

					jeanne
		no

					inquisitor 4
		its an item of artillery  how do
		you expect to raise the siege of
		orleans if you are ignorant about
		modern artillery

					jeanne
		the road to orleans is long and i
		have good captains with me  i will
		learn fast believe me

the inquisitor and his colleagues whisper in a huddle
regnault remains unconvinced and indicates his strong
reservations  finally the chief inquisitor addresses
jeanne

					chief inquisitor
		we would like to believe you jeanne
		but we feel that if god were to want
		us to believe in you he would have
		sent you with a sign as proof that
		we should believe in you  we cannot
		advise the king to entrust you with
		the army merely on your assertion
		cant you do something  or show us
		something  some sign to prove that
		you are sent by god

					jeanne
		sire i did not come here to preform
		tricks  you are all much cleverer
		than i am  me i dont know a from
		b  but this much i do know  that
		while the people of france lie
		bleeding you sit around in your
		fine clothes trying to deceive me 
		yet all youre doing is deceiving
		yourselves  you say you are men of
		god yet you cant see his hand in
		having guided me safely through
		five hundred leagues of enemy
		country to bring you his help  is
		that not proof enough  or do you
		want still more signs  give me
		command of an army take me to
		orleans and there you will see the
		sign i was sent to make

aulon can barely restrain himself from applauding  the
chief inquisitor reaches his decision raises his gavel
and 


ext  les tourelles  orleans  day

 down comes a mallet slamming out a safety wedge which
releases a catapult  and a huge boulder flies across the
river in the direction of orleans


ext  battlements  orleans  day

a lookout spots the incoming missile  yells out 

					gamache
		45er nornorwest  straight at
		us


int  dunois hq  orleans  day

dunois is alone writing a letter at a small table 

					dunois
		which sides that

					gamache os
		window side

dunois realizes hes near the window and dives for cover
just as the massive boulder plummets through the ceiling
demolishing the table where hed been sitting seconds
before and leaving a huge hole in the wall

dunois emerges from under a large table dusting himself
he looks thin haggard and exhausted after six months of
siege

suddenly a young soldier  poton de xaintrailles  comes
bursting in ignoring the mess

					xaintrailles
		my lord dunois i have wonderful
		news  finally  hes sending
		her to us  thanks be to god 
		were saved  its wonderful

					dunois
		calm yourself xaintrailles  now
		slowly  who has finally done what

					xaintrailles
		the dauphin  hes sending us food
		 and supplies  and an army 
		led by jeanne  the maiden from
		lorraine  isnt it wonderful

					dunois
			   deadpan
		yes its a miracle

					xaintrailles
		and its not the first one  they
		say she saved a little boy who was
		dying of

					dunois
		xaintrailles  dont talk to me
		about miracles
			   pointing to hole in
			    floor
		if i was still sitting there waiting
		for a miracle id be dead now
		anyway

dunois looks up at the sky now visible through a hole in
the roof

					xaintrailles
		but dont you think we should at
		least go and welcome her

					dunois
			   sighs
		as long as she brings food and
		supplies shell be welcome


ext  river bank  pov of orleans  day

the walled city of orleans stands in the distance on the
far side of the river loire  camera cranes down to find
dunois xaintrailles and a small escort of soldiers
waiting atop a ridge where theyre evidently been for some
time

					gamache
		i cant believe theyre sending a
		woman

					dunois
		maybe they never sent anyone

traveling shot  horses hooves galloping

					gamache
		i wonder what color dress shell be
		wearing

traveling shot  horses breath steaming

					gamache
		ill wager red  how about you

					dunois
		blue

traveling shot  stirrups press into the horses flanks

					dunois
		 with a blue ribbon in her hair
		to tie up talbot

traveling shot  the horses eyes wild and dilated

					dunois
		does anyone know if she even knows
		how to ride a horse

traveling shot  horses legs at the triple gallop

					xaintrailles
		she knows

their pov  a white banner sweeps into shot  then a
knight clad in shinning white armor  the knight raises
his visor to reveal  jeanne her face gleaming with
sweat eyes blazing  dunois is speechless

					jeanne
		were you sent by lord dunois

					dunois
		yes they were

					jeanne
		good  where are the english

					dunois
		everywhere  where is the food

					jeanne
		its coming  i rode on ahead  i
		have to speak with the captain of
		the english army his names
		talbot

					dunois
		i know

					jeanne
		good  can you bring me to him

					dunois
		hes on the other side of the river

now la hire and gilles de rais ride into view

					jeanne
		so who gave the order to bring me to
		this side of the river

					la hire
			   calling to dunois
		hey my friend  im glad to see
		your ugly damn face again

					jeanne
		la hire im warning you  dont
		swear

					la hire
		sorry jeanne
			   to dunois
		did you both meet already

					dunois
		well sort of

					gilles
			   to dunois smiling
		shes quite something huh

					la hire
		jeanne let me introduce the kings
		half brother the dogged lord
		dunois

					jeanne
		then lord dunois show me the way
		to the other side of the river

she starts to move as jean daulon rides up 

					dunois
		wait wait

					jeanne
		for what

					dunois
		because because  i mean  the
		english have a broad sense of humor
		but i mean you dont
		understand to them youre a
		witch working for the devil  what
		makes you think theyll listen to
		you

					jeanne
		because if they dont ill raise
		such a warcry against them that
		they will remember us forever

					dunois
		well  id love to see that but
		after taking counsel with my
		captains i felt it would be better
		to first bring the food into the
		city then wait till alencon arrives
		with reinforcements before doing
		anything

					jeanne
		you may have been with your counsel
		but ive been with mine and im
		telling you gods counsel is wiser
		than yours and hes telling me to
		speak to the english  now

					dunois
			   matching her anger
		fine  go now if you want but not
		with me  you may have a duty to god
		but i have a duty to my people and
		my people are starving  so right
		now im going to take the food back
		to the city and if you can please
		calm down and let me accompany you
		to orleans it will be my honor to
		welcome you

gilles smiles at jeannes evident frustration


ext  east gate  street  square  orleans  dusk

the battered east gate of orleans swings open and a
convoy of wagons enter the town guarded by soldiers
jeanne and the captains are on horseback the remainder on
foot

a group of hungry children spot the arrival their eyes
widening at the sight of the food  beef mutton
chickens sacks of grain barrels of salted fish

but most of the citizens are too starved and too weary to
show much excitement holloweyed and emaciated they have
the expressionless faces of concentration camp inmates
la hire is sickened at the sight

					la hire
		jesus christ the goddamn english
		will pay for this

					jeanne
		they will  and so will you if you
		go on swearing like that

by the time the little procession has reached the main
square a crowd has gathered  sluggishly they make way
for jeanne and dunois to ride between them

now the interest in jeanne begins to warm up  the crowd
press in on her  slowly at first but with increasing
fervor the pressure builds as the crowd  try to touch
her

					crowd
		bless us jeanne  save us


ext  jeannes house  orleans  night

soldiers push back the crowd allowing jeanne to reach a
large gabled house  as she dismounts a woman runs
forward 

					woman
		jeanne  bless her  touch her

the woman holds up her baby for jeanne to touch

					jeanne
		touch her yourself your touch is
		just as good as mine

					woman
		but youve been sent by god

					jeanne
		so has everyone

jeanne turns sharply away and walks inside the house
followed by aulon and the others


int  hq  orleans house  night

a frustrated jeanne marches into dunois new warroom
dunois enters followed by his captains and is happy to
see a model of orleans

					dunois
		la hire gilles  let me show you
		something

the captains go into a huddle leaving jeanne smarting
she looks out of the window where the crowd is still
trying to catch a glimpse of her

					jeanne
		who do they think i am

					aulon
		jeanne calm down  you cant blame
		the people  theyve been hearing
		all about you for weeks

					jeanne
		theres nothing to hear  i havent
		done anything  and why havent i
		done anything
			   turning to the
			    captains
		because none of you will listen to
		me

she shouts in frustration and dunois and the other
captains swing round  dunois waits for the echo to die
away

					dunois
		would you like to join us  were
		about to discuss the campaign

jeanne walks over still vexed  using the model dunois
continues his situation briefing

					dunois
		from here talbot has spread his
		forces between these forts up here
		but in the last few days it seems 
		according to our scouts  that some
		troops have been deployed to this
		fort here  which makes me think
		that this is where theyll be
		launching their attack from

dunois points to st loup  a smaller fort to the east

					gilles
		i would have thought theyd have
		attacked from here where talbot is

					dunois
		i doubt it  from here they wont be
		able to utilize the river whereas
		over here the current will be with
		them

					la hire
		what about this huge pile down here

					dunois
		thats the tourelles  the english
		were planning to launch an attack
		from it but then we broke down the
		bridge which should keep them quiet
		for a while  my hunch is the
		attack will come from st loup

he pauses then turns to jeanne somewhat apprehensively

					gilles
		and what does jeanne think

					jeanne
		i dont think  i leave that to god
		im nothing in all this im just
		the messenger

					dunois
		so what is the message

					jeanne
		we offer the english a last chance
		to return home in peace  if they
		refuse we recross the river and
		attack them here  at the
		tourelles

they all look astonished  gilles grins

					dunois
		jeanne that really makes no sense
		at all  the tourelles is virtually
		impregnable besides if were on
		the other side of the river
		attacking the tourelles whats to
		stop talbot attacking the city from
		the north

					jeanne
		god

					gilles
		god why of course  wed
		forgotten about him  strange i
		dont seem to remember seeing him at
		agincourt

					la hire
		damn right

					gilles
		oh but i forgot  it was a
		sunday that explains it  gods
		day off

they all laugh apart from aulon and the page boys

					jeanne
		you know i feel a great sorrow for
		you because youre laughing now
		but by tomorrow night some of you
		will be dead and having to repeat
		your jokes in front of god

					dunois
		jeanne with respect  we cant
		just attack the tourelles like that
		 its a very complicated matter
		and

					jeanne
		what complicated about it  all you
		have to do is do what youre told 
		what could be simpler than that
		im the drum on which god is beating
		out his message  beating so loudly
		its bursting my ears  but youre
		all so full of your own voices
		youre deaf to his

					aulon
		jeanne be patient

jeanne turns on him 

					jeanne
		be patient be patient is that
		the only advice you can ever come up
		with  ive shown more patience
		than a dozen saints

					dunois
		jeanne you have to understand 
		its not easy for us  i mean for
		our pride  to suddenly be usurped
		by a  well with all due respect
		by a girl

					jeanne
		ah so thats it  to you im just a
		girl

					dunois
		jeanne put yourself in my shoes for
		a moment  how would you feel if
		you were me

					jeanne
		knowing what i know  enormous
		gratitude

jeanne turns and heads for the door  la hire nudges
gilles as she approaches 

					la hire
		one hell of a girl huh

as she passes jeanne slaps la hire right across the
face 

					jeanne
		i warned you

 and walk out slamming the door behind her  the others
stare after her while la hire nurses his cheek

					gilles
			   to la hire
		i do love her when her fire gets
		well and truly stoked

					la hire
		me too

a pause then the door at the other end of the room bursts
open and in walks the expansive duke of alencon

					alencon
		hello my friends  what a journey
		but we made it  back together
		again lets have some fun

he rubs his hands in anticipation then notes his
comrades expressions still recovering from jeannes
outburst

					alencon
		did i miss something


int  jeannes bedroom  orleans house  night

jeanne draws her sword with a terrifying scrape as though
about to kill someone slices something in fg  and a
chunk of black hair falls to the ground

					jeanne
		so what if im a girl
			   cuts another chunk
		you need to look like a man to drive
		out the english
			   and another
		fine lets look like a man

aulon grabs her by the wrist to take the sword from her 

					aulon
		jeanne stop it

					jeanne
		how dare you stop me doing gods
		will

aulon wrestles to get the sword from her 

					aulon
		he didnt tell you to cut all your
		hair off

					jeanne
		how dare you tell me what god tells
		me to do

					aulon
		alright whatever  but since hes
		not going to come down and cut it
		himself at least let someone cut it
		properly

he finally manages to grab the sword from her

					aulon
		raymond  bring me scissors
		louis  fetch that mirror

the two page boys hop to it but when louis brings the
mirror jeanne slaps it from his hand

					aulon
		jeanne stop getting so angry about
		everything  calm down

jeanne stares at him

					jeanne
		i am calm  its god whos angry  i
		need to send a letter  now

aulon looks at her


int  hq  orleans house  night

dunois reads the parchment that aulon hands to him

					jeanne vo
		to you henry king of england and
		to you duke of bedford who call
		yourself regent of france obey the
		king of heaven and abandon your
		siege

dunois can scarcely believe it  he hands it to alencon

					jeanne vo
		 give back the keys to the other
		towns you have taken and go back
		home to your island

equally bemused alencon hands it to la hire

					jeanne vo
		to you lord talbot i beg you as
		humbly as i can beg you for the
		sake of the lives of your soldiers
		do not bring about your own
		destruction

la hire whistles with admiration and hands it to gilles

					jeanne vo
		surrender to me jeanne the maiden
		who is sent here by god and she
		will make peace with you

gilles grins and hands back to aulon who looks to dunois
for an answer  dunois gives a vague nod of the head


ext  broken bridge  orleans  night

as jeannes letter continues aulon walks across the
broken stone bridge that once connected the city to the
south bank of the loire  twothirds the way across the
bridge ends abruptly leaving a yawning gap between us and
the fortress of the tourelles

					jeanne vo
		 but if you do not heed my
		warning then we shall raise such a
		battlecry as there has not been
		heard in france for a thousand
		years   

aulon takes the arrow to which jeannes letter is already
tied places it in the bow  takes aim and fires


ext  tourelles  roofcourtyard  night

the arrow lands in wooden planking  an english soldier
with a flaming red beard yanks it out gives it a cursory
glance grins then clambers down to the courtyard below
where soldiers are busily trimming the branches from
freshlyfelled trees  redbeard hands the letter to an
english captain glasdale

					jeanne vo
		this is the third and last time i
		will write to you

glasdale reads it and gives his response


ext  broken bridge  orleans  night

aulon is still waiting at the end of the broken bridge

					jeanne vo
		if you are still here at noon i
		warn you that you will hear from me
		to your very great destruction
		please give me your answer speedily

redbeard yells out from the top of the tourelles

					redbeard
		go fuck yourself


int  jeannes bedroom  orleans house  night

aulon hesitates then softly opens the door  he tiptoes
into the room looks at jeanne then at louis who has
fallen asleep with the scissors still clasped somewhat
dangerously to his chest  aulon gently removes them  as
he places them on the table jeanne murmurs in her sleep
but without opening her eyes

					jeanne
		what did they say

					aulon
		uh they said they will think
		about it

					jeanne
		good

					aulon
		but to be honest i dont think
		theyll leave tomorrow

jeanne is almost asleep again

					jeanne
		i cant wait for tomorrow

aulon sits in a chair nearby gazing at jeanne who now
looks even younger with her hair shorn short like a boy


ext  battlefield  st loup  dawn

smash cut into the fury of battle  swords hacking
through armor whirling maces smashing visors blood
spurting from severed limbs among the combatants
dunois alencon la hire and gilles


int  jeannes bedroom  orleans house  dawn

jeanne suddenly sits bolt upright eyes wide  aulon is
still asleep in his chair where we last saw him

					jeanne
		french blood is spilling

aulon awakes as she leaps to her feet strapping on her
breast plate and gauntlets

					aulon
		whats going on

					jeanne
		theyve started the battle without
		me

she tips the two page boys onto the floor

					jeanne
		oh my boys  why didnt you wake
		me up  come on hurry up 
		raymond saddle my horse  theres
		a battle to fight and a war to be
		won

raymond runs off and aulon takes his place helping louis
to buckle on jeannes armor  she rushes off leaving
louis to assist aulon with his own armor


ext  house  street  orleans  dawn

jeanne runs out of the house to where raymond is standing
with her horse  she mounts it and canters off


int  jeannes bedroom  orleans  dawn

still buckling on his own armor aulon spots jeannes
furled white banner leaning against the wall


ext  house  street  orleans  dawn

jeanne suddenly remembers shes forgotten her banner  she
turns her horse about and canters back screaming out 

					jeanne
		my banner  i forgot my banner

aulon appears at the window holding her banner 

					aulon
		jeanne here

jeanne circles about and canters forward

					jeanne
		throw it

aulon throws it down to her  she catches it with one
hand turns and gallops off down the street the white
banner streaming out behind her


ext  east gate  orleans  dawn

the guard above the main gate sees the french army
approaching in full retreat  he calls down

					guard
		open the gates


ext  streets  orleans  dawn

sparks fly as the hooves of jeannes horse strike the
flint cobblestones swift and clean


ext  st loup valley  orleans  dawn

 unlike the hundreds of hooves pounding through mud and
mire in the opposite direction


ext  east gate  orleans  dawn

jeanne reaches the gates as they are swung open and the
first of the retreating troops make it back to the city 
among them la hire and gilles de rais

					jeanne
		what happened  who gave the order
		to attack

					la hire
		god knows but it was a bad idea

					jeanne
			   to gilles
		were the men confessed  where are
		the priests

					gilles
			   out of breath
		we didnt take them we wanted to
		be fast wanted to make a surprise
		attack

dunois rides up and jeanne assails him 

					jeanne
		dunois was it you who ordered the
		attack  answer me

					dunois
		can we  uh  discuss this later

					jeanne
		sooner is better than later

jeanne charges forward into the confused ranks of
retreating french soldiers  dunois thinks shes gone
crazy 

					dunois
		come back youll be killed

but jeannes not listening  shes been waiting long
enough for this moment and now she has it theres no
going back  she stands in her stirrups and shouts out 

					jeanne
		follow me and i will give you
		victory

la hire is the first to change his mind riding up behind
jeanne like attila the hun as she gallops forward into the
path of the retreating french  now the duke of alencon
joins them and soon the whole army has turned about  an
immense tidal wave of energy rolling back across the
valley


ext  st loup fortifications  orleans  day

 toward the astonished english  one moment they were
pursuing their hapless enemies but now an avenging angel
bears down on them sunlight glinting off her armor  they
start racing back toward their own fortifications  the
bastille st loup  a great fortress amid a network of
trenches and tunnels

the french army is finally behaving as a single organism
whereas the english cohesion fragments into shards of
individual panic  every man for himself  they regard
jeanne as a sorceress and terror spreads like cancer
among their ranks  they turn and flee back to their own
lines only to be bombarded by a fusillade of their own
missiles poorly aimed at the french

soon the st loup tower is ablaze the english are forced
to abandon their fortress and the french finally get to
celebrate their first victory within living memory

jeanne has become an object of worship and veneration and
the soldiers crowd about her cheering her as their
savior  presently dunois rides up with his captains

					dunois
		its a great victory jeanne your
		victory  but we must follow it
		through and pursue the english back
		to talbots camp unless of course
		you have another good idea

jeanne closes her eyes a moment then smiles at dunois

					jeanne
		we return to orleans across the
		bridge at the tourelles

					gilles
		but the bridge has been pulled down

					jeanne
		the english are rebuilding it

					dunois
		how do you know

forest  from her pov she notices hundreds of fresh
treesstumps

					jeanne
		you have been with your counsel and
		i have been with mine


ext  tourelles complex  orleans  day

the english are moving up the stripped trees we saw
earlier from the tourelles courtyard toward the broken
bridge  glasdale surveys the operation with satisfaction


ext  tourelles  pov from roof  day

la hire alencon gilles aulon xaintrailles  they halt
in front of a ruined monastery to the south of the
tourelles  jeanne gives instructions for the placement of
artillery

					jeanne
		position the longbows over there

ext  tourelles  battery  day

the english take up their positions along the ramparts of
the battery  a massive square fortification surrounded
by a deep empty moat

jeanne rides forward to the edge of the dry moat her
banner billowing in the breeze and addresses the
english

					jeanne
		glasdale can you hear me  you who
		call me a whore i pity your soul
		and the souls of your men  yield
		now to the king of heaven and go
		back to your island

					glasdale
		and you go back to hell

jeanne turns and gallops back to the french soldiers as
glasdale turns coolly to redbeard 

					glasdale
		dont kill her till ive had my fill
		of her

 and walks back to the tourelles

the french have established a temporary headquarters
dunois is drawing a map in the dirt and is preparing a
battle plan with his captains

					dunois
		lets plan this attack a little more
		carefully than this morning

					gilles
		good idea

					jeanne os
			   calling
		my fine soldiers

dunois turns to see jeanne standing before the army

					jeanne
		this morning god gave us our first
		victory but that was nothing
		compared to what he is ready to give
		us now  i know you are tired and
		hungry but i swear to you in the
		name of the king of heaven that even
		if these english were hanging from
		the clouds by their fingertips we
		shall tear them down before
		nightfall  now my brave
		soldiers let those who love me
		follow me

with a valiant cry a thousand soldiers tear forward
behind jeanne  dunois is speechless  gilles lays a
sympathetic hand on his shoulder

					gilles
		you were saying

jeanne rides at full tilt down into the dry moat and for
the next few minutes the air is thick with the tumult of
battle  as each successive wave swarms across the moat
so they are met by a fusillade of english flame and steel
from the battery above  but the french respond with equal
fervor  the dijon culverins deployed by jeanne now rain
an aerial bombardment of boulders down upon the english
while their arrows darken the sky above

jeanne reaches the base of the battery  she leaps down
from her horse and starts to climb one of the ladders
being thrown up against the wall but is suddenly struck
by an arrow from the rampart above  she reels  the
ladder sways  and aulon catches her in his arms as she
falls back to earth  redbeard is jokingly furious 

					redbeard
		hey you just killed my woman

the english laugh and jeer but the french are in dismay
at the sight of their jeanne unconscious lying in
aulons arms with the arrow wedged deep above her breast


ext  monastery behind tourelles  day

aulon la hire and xaintrailles carry her to the ruined
monastery while the two page boys follow anxiously behind


int  st augustine monastery  day

they enter the shellshattered sanctuary of a gothic
chapel where aulon directs them to lay jeanne against the
wall  in the distance we can hear the muffled sounds of
war but in here it is strangely quiet

the great warlords stand in a semicircle pathetically
wringing their hands like the seven dwarves bereaving the
stricken snow white  the sight of tears trickling down la
hires scarred cheeks is as touching as it is pathetic
aulon wipes her brow leaning in very close to feel her
pulse and whether her mouth exhales breath  he turns to
raymond who stands close by with louis 

					aulon
		go and find the physician i saw
		him with the supplies

raymond races off

					gilles
		we have to take out the arrow now

					aulon
		its in so deep  im afraid shell
		bleed to death if we pull it out

					la hire
		there must be something we can do
		for her for chrissakes

					gilles
			   sarcastic
		yes  we can pray

					la hire
		good idea

la hire turns and directs his pledge to the broken
stainedglass image of christ above the trashed altar

					la hire
		i swear ill never swear again in my
		life if you save her life  but im
		warning you if you let her die
		then youre the biggest

					jeanne
		dont swear

jeanne stirs her eyes beginning to open

					la hire
		he heard me

					aulon
		jeanne we thought wed lost you

					jeanne
		not so easily  why arent you
		fighting  go on were almost
		there

					aulon
		jeanne youve been badly wounded

					jeanne
		no its its nothing its

speaking provokes a sudden stab of pain  she tries to
clutch the arrow but aulon stops her  he peels back her
shirt exposing the bloody wound above her pale breast

					gilles
		its an arrow and its in deep

					aulon
		you must stay still till the
		physician arrives

					la hire
		physicians are a waste of time
		youll have more luck with this
		charm of mine it saved my life at
		agincourt

					jeanne
		id sooner die than use magic

					aulon
		jeanne you will die if that arrow
		stays in you much longer

jeanne suddenly seizes the arrow and yanks it out of her
body  blood spurts  the suddenness and violence of her
action catches the men unaware and its a moment before
aulon can stem the flow with his hand  jeanne looks at
the arrow before throwing it aside

					jeanne
		at least this one wont bother us
		any more  now lets get back to the
		fight

she tries to get up and collapses grabbing aulon

					aulon
		jeanne please you must stay
		calm you must rest please

he lays her back down  jeanne whispers to him
intimately

					jeanne
		alright i promise to rest if you
		promise to go back to the battle

					aulon
		i promise

jeanne smiles  then suddenly collapses

					la hire
		oh shit  jeanne dont die

la hire breaks off as raymond arrives back with the
physician

					aulon
		quickly do something

the physician kneels beside her and listens for any sound
of life  all the captains crowd closer and closer and as
we too move closer we hear the sound of deep breathing
almost a snore

					physician
		shes sleeping  like a baby

la hire and the others sigh with relief


ext  tourelles  battery  dusk

dunois surveys his armys attempt to storm the english
battery  it is now dusk and without jeanne the battle
has become a halfhearted affair  he turns to a trumpeter
as aulon comes running up

					aulon
		jeannes alive

					dunois
		good

					aulon
		we have to press home the attack

					dunois
			   to the trumpeter
		sound the retreat

					aulon
		but i promised jeanne wed fight on

					dunois
		i made no such promise  sound the
		retreat for the night

					aulon
		but that was her order

					dunois
		im fed up with taking her orders
		she swore shed defeat the english
		before nightfall instead of which
		she goes and plays the fool and gets
		herself nearly killed  look at the
		mess were in  thats her mess not
		mine  were worse off then if
		shed never come at all
			   to the trumpeter
		 now do as i say and sound the
		retreat

the trumpeter obeys and signals the evening wrap  the
english jeer and whistle from their impregnable battery as
the french head back up the sloping sides of the moat


int  st augustine monastery  dusk

jeanne lies asleep inside the ruined church guarded by
her two page boys  a small fire burns nearby to keep her
warm but she is shivering


ext  orleans  jeannes nightmare  night

she suddenly awakes with a start then gets up and goes to
the fire  she kneels down puts her hands in the
flames and scoops up a handful of ash  she paints her
face with the black ash like a native warrior then
stands back up turning to face a small army

					jeanne
		my brave soldiers do you believe in
		god

the army cries out yeesssss

					jeanne
		then let gods punishment be done
		eye for eye

 and a sudden flash of lightning transforms some of her
men into skeletons

					jeanne
		 tooth for tooth
			   another flash
		 burn for burn
			   another flash
		 life for a life

 a final flash and her whole army is now a seething
swarm of skeletons  with a curdling cry of vengeance they
race forward passing either side of her

jeanne turns to see the skeleton army heading across a
bizarre bridge and onto the moonlit battery flowing
either side of the 8 yearold boy she saw in the woods as
a child  intrigued jeanne follows him but by the time
she reaches him the boy has disappeared  the skeletons
have also vanished to be replaced by an army of little
english boys in mansized armor heading toward a distant
figure

the boysoldiers are being welcomed by the beautiful man
jeanne saw earlier  he smiles at her extending his arms
in a christlike gesture of embrace

as jeanne approaches him others turn to welcome her 
aulon dunois alencon finally la hire holding out his
arms 

					la hire
		jeanne come here my friend my
		soldier in my arms

la hire scoops her up into his bearlike arms and swings
her round suddenly over his shoulder she spots a
familiar figure  her dead sister

					jeanne
		catherine

she breaks from la hire and runs to catherine throwing
her arms around her and sobbing with joy

					jeanne
		catherine oh catherine  i knew
		you wouldnt leave me

they stand for a moment embracing each other while la
hire and the other captains applaud jeannes victory  the
beautiful young man approaches them but we now see that
he has a sword clasped behind his back

catherines face contorts in pain  she slumps forward
the sword in her back  beyond her the beautiful man has
transformed into the grotesque blackbeard who roars with
laughter as jeanne holds her dying sister

					catherine
		avenge me avenge me

a circle of fire forms around them with skeleton soldiers
dancing in the flames

blackbeards echoing laugh is gradually superimposed by
real laughter and a familiar voice

					redbeard os
		hey frenchies what happened to
		your precious angel huh


ext  tourelles  french camp  dawn

through the mist from the raised drawbridge spanning the

he backs away as the machine reaches the lip  suddenly it
topples forward crashing down on top of the raised
drawbridge and demolishing it beneath its enormous
weight

from his elevated viewpoint glasdale watches in horror as
aulon leads the french cavalry across the siege machine

message that reaches the gatekeeper who promptly starts

soldiers turn tail and race back toward the second

grab the lip of the bridge and scramble over

his comrades are less fortunate and are slaughtered by

jeanne urges her troops forward her white banner
billowing in the breeze but with the drawbridge raised
there is no way for them to enter the tourelles  the
english hurl fresh insults  and bombards  from the
battlements above and the french are forced to take cover
behind two ruined buildings on the battery

jeanne rides across to a ruined barn where several carts
are stacked with felled treetrunks  she spots la hire

					jeanne
		prepare these as batteringrams

					la hire
		whats the use  the drawbridge is
		up

					jeanne
		not for long

under a hail of english arrows jeanne rides back across

up his shield  the arrow strikes it  and jeanne turns

into the river and hauled back up  the bucket rushed up

back on the battlements the bucket of water is passed up
to the soldier who tries to pour it over the edge and
onto the blazing beam  aulon spots him from below and
fires a flaming arrow  it pierces the soldier who pours
the water on himself extinguishing the flames

the drawbridge comes crashing down  beyond it is a
portcullis but to la hires exuberant volunteers this is
no barrier  carrying buckets of flaming oil they charge
forward

 but as they race across the drawbridge a sudden
volley of highvelocity arrows discharge from the lower
apertures of the portcullis felling them before they even
get halfway across the bridge

the english cackle with delight at the sight of the dying
french writhing in the flaming oil  redbeard  in charge
of the multiple balista  orders the device to be

		when you see my banner touch the

 and away she rides across the drawbridge still piled
with the slaughtered men from the first attack

another volley of arrows discharges from the portcullis
and jeannes horse collapses  the english cheer

banner through

crumples to the ground wedged between the base of the
portcullis and the balista


ext  tourelles  battery  day

jeanne runs back across the drawbridge crying out

					jeanne
		the place is ours


ext  tourelles  complex  day

inside the tourelles the english try to operate the
reloaded balista  but redbeards corpse is wedged so
tightly that they cant move it


ext  tourelles  battery  day

jeanne moves aside as la hire and his men heave the carts
laden with treetrunk batteringrams across the bridge


int  tourelles  turret  day

glasdale has seen enough


int  tourelles  day

 he tears down into the courtyard mustering soldiers
as he goes 

					glasdale
		to arms  to arms

with a triumphant battlecry the french charge their
batteringram into the portcullis


ext  tourelles  complex  day

 demolishing it like matchwood then storm inside the
fortress  glasdale cries out to his troops 

					glasdale
		soldiers in the name of the king
		i want you to kill these french dogs
		until theres none left

the english troops swarm either side of the broken
portcullis forcing most of the french back onto the
battery


ext  tourelles  battery  day

la hire lets out a bloodcurdling primeval warcry and
charges forward to meet the english wave head on  jeanne
is caught in the middle buffeted from side to side by a
sea of heaving sweating bleeding bodies

in this melee it is impossible to know who is friend or
foe and the images become so blurred that we and jeanne
are soon lost in a mist of dust and noise


ext  tourelles  dream  day

flash  our eyes are momentarily blinded by the sun and
when we return we find jeanne in the middle of the
battery but now totally alone weaving her sword through
the air in slow motion as she once did with her stick


ext  field  dream  daynight

flash  jeanne is still weaving the air with her sword
but she is now a little girl of eight playing in the
field we first saw her in  the small boy looks at her
smiling

flash  jeanne continues to play but is now 17 and the
boy is now a young man still smiling  he calls out to
her

					man
		jeanne what are you doing

					jeanne
		playing

she sweeps her sword and decapitates a flower  blood
flows from the stalk jeanne looks at it more in
childish curiosity than astonishment or horror  she
looks at the sword the blade now streaked with blood

					man
		jeanne what are you doing

jeanne pauses looks at him steadily and suddenly
notices that blood is trickling down his face  a shaft of
light blazes wind billows and suddenly its winter
the trees naked heavy with snow

					man
		what have you done to me jeanne

jeanne looks horrified  the man puts his hands to her
face gazing deep into her eyes

					man
		what have you done to me

					jeanne
		i  i  i


ext  tourelles  courtyard  day

jeanne is screaming at aulon who is gripping her blood
splattered face as the man did

					aulon
		jeanne calm down do you hear me
		are you alright

					jeanne
		yes

					aulon
		its over jeanne  we won just as
		you said

jeanne looks about her in a daze  la hire strides over
arms extended extravagant as always 

					la hire
		jeanne come here my friend my
		soldier in my arms

jeanne starts laughing  she cant believe it

					jeanne
		we won

					la hire
		won  such a small word will never
		do  this is victory jeanne this
		is glory

he scoops her up in his bearlike arms like an ebullient
lover both laughing in the moment  he slowly turns her
around breathing in a great lungful of air and savoring
the smell of what jeanne now sees over his shoulder  the
entire courtyard kneedeep in bodies and bits of bodies
 including the gallant xaintrailles

jeanne too can smell the reek of fresh warm gore  her
laugh turns to a cry of anguish  la hire sets her back
down

					la hire
		jeanne  whats the matter

jeanne is utterly horrified her legs tremble amber
liquid trickles down her armor

					jeanne
		you call this glory  all
		this this blood this smell
		of

					la hire
		 the smell of victory jeanne
		mmmmmmm  i love it

					jeanne
		its not possible

jeanne sees a french soldier of meager wit hauling a
dying english soldier onto his knees for some obscure
purpose

					gilles
		you look disappointed isnt this
		what you wanted

					jeanne
		no not like this

					gilles
		for weeks youve been asking for
		this well now you have it

the soldier is about to smash the englishmans mouth with
a mace  jeanne snaps out of her momentary stupor and
races across stumbling over the dead bodies

					jeanne
		stop it  what are you doing

					soldier
		nothing just taking his teeth

					jeanne
		but you cant just kill a man for
		his teeth

					soldier
		why not  he has good teeth

					jeanne
		because because you just cant

					gilles
		eye for an eye tooth for a tooth

jeanne ignores the laconic gilles

					soldier
		besides what about these

					jeanne
		thats different i mean we
		were fighting for a for a cause

gilles grins but la hire looks genuinely bemused at
jeannes behavior  the soldier shrugs unimpressed

					soldier
		not me  hes my prisoner i can
		take his teeth if i want to

he is about to smash the teeth

					jeanne
		no

she throws herself in front of the startled frenchman

					jeanne
		take mine instead  here  smash
		mine first

					la hire
		jeanne get up this is
		ridiculous

					jeanne
		if you kill him you kill me

					gilles
		jeanne let him do it  one more
		dead bodys not going to make any
		difference so who cares

					jeanne
		i care  and i care because god
		cares  all life is precious to god
		 even his  even yours and
		mine

					la hire
		jeanne the man hasnt been paid
		for six months  thats his only
		reward  let him take a few teeth

					jeanne
		a few teeth thats the price of
		his life

					soldier
		yeah

					jeanne
		here  take this instead

she wrenches a ring from her finger and flings it at the
soldier

					jeanne
		hes mine now

jeanne cuts the englishmans bonds

					jeanne
		now you get out

the english soldier doesnt wait for further prompting
gilles claps

					gilles
		bravo  what about all the other
		hundreds of prisoners  do we let
		them go too

					jeanne
		maybe i dont know but first
		we have to confess


int  augustine monastery  day

jeanne marches her bloodsplattered captains into the
church and up the aisle toward the rubblestrewn altar
she sees a terrified franciscan priest and grabs hold of
him

					jeanne
		please we have to be confessed
		all of us now  i know its not
		normal custom but sometimes you
		know we have to make an exception
		and and today is an exception

the priest looks confounded  jeanne turns to the
captains

					jeanne
		hes going to confess us  kneel

all but la hire kneel although their armor is stiff at
the joints

					la hire
		jeanne if you dont mind ill
		stay standing this armor its
		a nightmare to get back up

					jeanne
		i said kneel

jeanne raises her sword and brings the flat blade whacking
against the back of his legs  la hire crumples and
jeanne turns to the priest

					jeanne
		please were ready begin

the priest is totally lost he begins to mumble a few
words in latin just as a soldier burst in 

					soldier
			   breathless
		the english theyre forming up
		thousands of them on the far side
		of the river

the captains look anxiously at jeanne  she hesitates a
moment then gazes up at the battered crucifix on the
altar and closes her eyes in prayer


ext  north plateau  orleans  dawn

jeanne opens her eyes  it is dawn and two silent armies
are drawn up facing one another  four thousand englishmen
on the left two thousand frenchmen on the right  they
have barely had time to recover from the tourelles and
the lust for battle is gone  we sense that this is going
to be a blood bath that nobody wants

franciscan monks move among them sprinkling them with
holy water in final absolution  the battle lines are too
far apart for the english to see any details but the
sight of massed soldiers kneeling before an invisible god
is an awesome spectacle

jeanne and the captains are mounted facing the english

					dunois
		well  shall we go

					jeanne
		not yet

					dunois
		the english wont wait

jeanne hesitates

					jeanne
		ill go

					aulon
		jeanne no

but dunois silences him indicating to gilles that he
should accompany her

					jeanne
		alone

dunois is again obliged to comply and gilles hangs back

from the english lines we see a small solitary figure
emerge from the massed ranks of french soldiers

jeanne moves halfway between the two armies  the english
soldiers watch her mesmerized while their captains
remain motionless

in the middle of the field jeanne halts  from the french
pov she looks dangerously vulnerable  the english
commander  talbot  draws up alongside his captains
watching her with grey eyes and an expression of stone
only we see that jeanne is crying  she rubs the tears
away

					jeanne
		i have a message for your king
		henry  it is a message from god

the english stand silent

					jeanne
		go home go now in peace  if you
		dont go now you will be buried in
		this field  ive seen enough blood
		for today but if you want more i
		cant stop you  i can only warn you
		that it will be your blood not
		ours

talbot whispers something to one of his captains  he
withdraws to pass the message on  jeanne  and her
french captains  try to gauge the english mood

					jeanne
		im waiting for your answer

now the english captains start moving along their flanks
somethings about to happen  dunois and the french watch
in dismay as the english flanks move aside exposing their
dreaded archers  jeanne closes her eyes tears brimming

					jeanne
		please lord dont dont let
		this happen dont leave me

the english archers take a step back their cavalry move
slowly forward then turn to their right the men letting
them through  dunois turns to la hire

					dunois
		never wait for miracles  stand by
		to attack

the serried ranks of english infantry close in then halt
were ready for the worst and it takes jeanne  and us
 a full twenty seconds to realize what is happening
the english are leaving  first the cavalry then the
infantry finally the archers themselves

jeanne cannot believe her eyes  she burst out laughing
and crying at the same time  the french captains gape in
astonishment  finally la hire can contain himself no
longer 

					la hire
		by god and all the saints now
		thats what i call a bloody miracle

the french burst into jubilation


int  chinon castle  day

as the cheering builds we see a messenger race along a
corridor and burst into the throne room  charles slowly
rises on hearing the joyous news clapping his hands in
delight  not least at the discomfort of tremoille and
regnault  but yolande shares his enthusiasm although we
sense that the news comes as no great surprise


int  rouen castle  day

the cheering continues as another messenger races along a
similar stone corridor and bursts in on the haggard duke
of bedford  he is the english regent and is in council
with several others including the bishop of beauvais 
one pierre cauchon  as bedford hears the news the
cheering fades  he rises from his chair

					bedford
		i want that girl  i want her
		burned


ext  street  rheims  day

the crowd goes wild as jeanne rides through the streets of
rheims carrying her banner in triumph  she is followed
by aulon and her two page boys and is accompanied by
soldiers who do their best to hold the ecstatic crowd at
bay  at the far end of the street  a magnificent
cathedral


int  vestry  rheims cathedral  day

backstage pandemonium as charles is readied for his
imminent coronation  a glamorous gilles tries to help him
into his ermine robe tremoille stands with archbishop
regnault adjusting his goldtrimmed cloak  an ancient
bishop  palsied and pushing 80  stands by hands
atrembling

					charles
		its too tight  wheres the
		seamstress  and that
			   pointing to crown
		 thats meant to be a crown
		dont you have something more 
		more regal

a young priest is holding the dowdy crown

					priest
		the english took the real one

					charles
		i asked for a grandiose coronation
		and this is what you give me  this
		whole things going to be a complete
		fiasco

					bishop
		sire we were only given three days
		to prepare  three days  why
		your fathers coronation took three
		months

charles turns to tremoille 

					charles
		hes probably right  lets call a
		delay

					tremoille
		theres no time sire  we cant
		hold up the ceremony theres no
		telling when the english might come
		back theyre only ten leagues
		away

					charles
		let them come  let them see whos
		the true king of france

further away dunois is examining himself in a looking
glass  he is standing with gilles de rais both
resplendent in their armor now cleaned and polished

					dunois
		its been muddy for so long i
		forgot how good it looked when
		cleaned up

					la hire
		did you remember to clean up whats
		inside as well

dunois ribs him with his elbow both laughing  in another
corner alencon is fast asleep

charles is still grumbling

					charles
		those damn english we should be
		doing this in paris in notre dame
		 much more prestigious  and
		twice as big as this one

yolande who has been standing quietly in the shadows with
richmond steps forward

					yolande
		it is the sacred place that matters
		charles  not the size  am i
		correct bishop

					bishop
		oh yes my lady  all true kings of
		france must first be anointed in our
		great cathedral of rheims with
		the holy oil of clovis for it was
		within these very walls that saint
		remy received the sacred oil from
		heaven brought to him by a white
		dove for the anointing of king
		clovis

					tremoille
		yes yes  well lets just get on
		with it shall we

					gilles
		 before the english turn up and
		spoil everything

					charles
		they wouldnt dare

					gilles
		i wouldnt be so sure  it only
		takes one of them  in disguise 

gilles pulls a sharp dagger  charles looks petrified

					gilles
		 with a good dagger thats all
		it takes

gilles lifts the dagger and snips a loose thread from
charless shoulder

					gilles
		 to ruin the whole thing

gilles sheaths his dagger but charles is now panicking
he glances at those around him as though one of them might
be a spy  gilles moves away and charles turns to his
pages 

					charles
		hurry up

further away the bishops assistant canon hurries in
holding a small jar 

					canon
		your grace there can be no
		anointing

					bishop
		what in heavens name are you
		talking about

					canon
		the holy oil of clovis  its all
		gone

the ancient archbishop can scarcely believe his ears  he
peers inside the little jar just as yolande arrives with
richmond

					bishop
		gone  but thats impossible 
		its magic oil i mean miraculous
		oil  it can never be exhausted

					canon
		look for yourself

the canon offers it to the bishop but yolande
intervenes

					yolande
		problem

he hands her the little jar

					bishop
		i dont understand the holy oil
		of clovis it was quite full the
		last time i saw it

					yolande
		and when was that

					bishop
		well at the coronation of king
		charles vi

					yolande
		thirty years ago  im not surprised
		its gone

					bishop
		no no you dont understand  this
		is no ordinary oil  this is
		miraculous this oil was brought
		from heaven by a white dove to crown
		king clovis in this very
		cathedral

yolande has moved away to be replaced by the hideously
scarred richmond  the bishops voice trails as he sees
yolande beyond him taking an oil lamp from the wall and
pouring a little oil into the jar

					bishop
		wwwhat are you doing

					yolande
		performing a miracle

richmond curtails any protest with a toothy grin

theres a growing sound of excitement coming from beyond
finally jeanne appears in the doorway carrying her banner
and followed by her faithful page boys louis and raymond
la hire nudges alencon awake as she passes giving an
admiring whistle

					charles
		ah jeanne come here  this
		whole coronation idea of yours is a
		fiasco nothing is ready

					jeanne
		 you look wonderful

					charles
		 and my crown doesnt fit and
			   breaking off
		really

she looks up and down appraising him

					jeanne
		you look like a king

charles melts  trumpets sound from the great cathedral
beyond


int  rheims cathedral  day

two tiers of boys sing in plainsong as charles enters
through a small door and into the vastness of the crowded
cathedral  it is filled to capacity with jeannes
comradesinarms filling the front pews like eager fans
straining for a glimpse of her

tremoille waddles behind charles with regnault yolande
and richmond in tow  next the two page boys  and then
at last the main attraction as far as this congregation is
concerned  the crowd lets out an audible gasp as jeanne
enters in her white armor carrying her proud warscarred
banner and escorted by jean daulon

la hire is so moved at the sight that he has to wipe away
big soppy tears for sentimentality was ever the flipside
of cruelty  alencon and dunois likewise gaze at their
adored one though gilles is perhaps more taken with the
cherubic choir boys

jeanne trembles with emotion  this is the peak of her
career and she knows it and shes making the most of it
as the little procession reaches the nave all but charles
filter aside  he walks forward alone to where archbishop
regnault is standing  a few paces  then stops turns
 and holds out his hands to jeanne

the crowd gasp with approval at the unprecedented
gesture la hire briefly claps before being dug in the
ribs by gilles but the kingly act provokes jealous
looks from regnault and tremoille

jeanne hesitates then is almost willed on by the crowd
into joining charles  she stands a little aside as he
kneels  regnault sprinkles the holy oil on his
sovereigns head

					regnault
		with this sacred oil blessed by the
		hand of god the father almighty we
		do anoint thee charles valois

regnault breaks off  theres a commotion at the back of
the cathedral  charles looks around  anxious faces turn
 soldiers draw their swords  is it the english

bored by the ceremony young louis has been kicking legs
again and one of the guards is nursing a bruised shin
with all eyes suddenly upon him louis flushes  and is
quickly taken in hand by yolande  after the brief
interruption regnault continues

					regnault
		 we do anoint thee charles
		valois sovereign lord and king of
		this great kingdom of france
		charging that ye defend the faith of
		our mother holy church so long as ye
		shall live

it could almost be the marriage ceremony  jeanne watches
in tears trembling with emotion as the archbishop takes
the crown and holds it above charles head then slowly
slowly lowers it

as he does so an eerie sound like a bullet in slow
motion coming straight at us followed by a cry from
jeanne


ext  paris walls  st denis  day

jeanne gasps  sways

torrential rain sweeping across the grey mudfilled moat
in great curtains  shes standing on the bank above the
moat looking across at the massive city walls where
ladders have been set up  aulon catches up with her

					aulon
		jeanne  are you alright

					jeanne
		yes  yes im fine
			   yelling out
		we need more brushwood
			   to aulon
		why are you staring at me like that

					aulon
		because theres an arrow in your leg

she looks down and there it is poking out her leg  an
arrow has penetrated her armor

					jeanne
		so there is

she hadnt realized  and doesnt seem that bothered

					jeanne
		 but thats no reason for you to
		stop  you can still climb a ladder
		cant you  so go on then climb

aulon looks across at the endless ladders disappearing
into the mist and smoke at the top of the gigantic wall
jeanne calls out to her page raymond 

					jeanne
		raymond  over here

raymond hurries over

					jeanne
		pull it out

raymond looks terrified 

					jeanne
		pull it out

raymond grips the arrow while jeanne gazes across at one
of the ladders laden with frenchmen  as he pulls it out
the ladder falls back plunging the soldiers to their
deaths  jeanne gasps in pain

la hire and gilles are further along the bank

					gilles
		this is no good

					la hire
		no good  this is a disaster

gilles stumbles along the bank to jeanne

					gilles
		jeanne the men are exhausted

					jeanne
		i know but so is the enemy 
		theyre falling back  paris is
		ours

					gilles
		jeanne were not enough

					jeanne
		so bring up the reinforcements

					gilles
		reinforcements  where

jeanne waves vaguely behind her 

					jeanne
		right behind us  dunois with
		another then thousand men

					gilles
		jeanne look behind you

					jeanne
		never look behind  only ahead

gilles grips her by the shoulders forcing her to turn and
look behind  at most a hundred bedraggled soldiers
limping amid the carnage in the moat  jeanne stares at
them

					gilles
		do you know how to count

					jeanne
		of course i do  bring them up

					gilles
		jeanne that is not ten thousand
		reinforcements  that is one
		hundred very loyal but very tired
		soldiers

					jeanne
		but where is dunois where are
		the men the king promised me

					gilles
		he never sent them dont you
		understand  he doesnt want this
		war anymore he has his crown now
		thats all he ever wanted

					jeanne
		but my voices they promised me

					gilles
		to hell with your voices  its
		time to face facts  we have nothing
		to do here none of us not even
		you  you should go home jeanne

jeanne stares at them in shock

					jeanne
		you dont believe me anymore

					la hire
		we still believe in you jeanne  if
		it were up to me id chase every
		goddamn englishman into the ocean
		but its not up to us anymore 
		its up to the king

jeanne looks at him suddenly furious 


int  chinon castle  corridors  day

 jeanne storms along a corridor her two page boys doing
their best to catch up with her


int  chinon castle  chamber  day

she bursts in on charles who is cavorting in a bathtub
with a few frivolous females

					charles
		well this is an unexpected
		pleasure  ladies let me introduce
		you to the celebrated jeanne

the damsels titter

					jeanne
		get them out of here

					charles
		now hold on  youre not captain
		here on the battlefield perhaps
		but not in the royal bedchamber

					jeanne
		why did you betray me  paris was
		ours for the taking  all i needed
		was another few hundred men why
		did you take back the army you gave
		me

					charles
		gave you  well now i wouldnt
		quite put it like that

					jeanne
			   bluntly
		so how would you put it

					charles
		well we are of course
		enormously grateful for your past
		efforts but your task is done  now
		its time for negotiation and
		after many months of skillful work
		our dear tremoille is about to seal
		a treaty with our burgundian friends
		who will no longer lend their
		support to the english  you see my
		dear jeanne as it is written in
		the bible to everything there is a
		season  a time for war and a time
		for peace

					jeanne
		peace will only be got from the
		english at the end of a lance

					charles
		why do you have to be so
		bloodthirsty  do you enjoy it  all
		that blood and noise and pain
		diplomacy is far more civilized
		far safer and far cheaper

jeanne angrily holds out a fistful of letters 

					jeanne
		i have letters here from towns under
		siege  compiegne provins melin
		 where the people are starving
		begging god on their knees to help
		them and im here to answer their
		prayers  and you want to stop me
		france does not belong to you
		charles  she belongs to god  and
		if you wont help me save her i
		shall do it alone

jeanne slings the letters in his face and marches out of
the room  charles turns to the girls with a weary sigh

					charles
		if only she would just go home


int  corridor  chinon  day

aulon reaches the door to a chapel to find it guarded by
louis and raymond

					raymond
		you cant go in

					aulon
		get out


int  chapel  chinon  day

aulon enters to find jeanne crumpled by the altar  he
kneels beside her

					aulon
		jeanne the king has ordered us
		not to ride with you anymore

					jeanne
		so what am i supposed to do now

aulon hesitates

					aulon
		what do your voices say

jeanne pauses a long moment whether or not to confide
finally and with a bleakness not sensed in her before

					jeanne
		theyve abandoned me like
		everyone

					aulon
		what what do you mean

					jeanne
		its been weeks since they spoke to
		me  since the coronation no
		signs nothing

					aulon
		maybe their silence is a sign
		maybe its a sign to go home

					jeanne
		its not time yet  my mission is
		not over yet  there is still more i
		must do before i can really 
		finally  go home

					aulon
		but how do you know that these 
		these voices arent really just 
		well you

jeanne stares at him in bemusement  then suddenly
laughs

					jeanne
		well of course theyre me  thats
		how god talks to me  if you listen
		hard enough even you can hear him
		everyone can hear him

					aulon
		but i hear so many voices one
		voice saying one thing another
		voice saying the opposite  love
		your enemy kill your enemy  what
		is good what is evil

					jeanne
		all you have to do is stop talking
		and just listen

					aulon
		but how do you know what you hear is
		the truth

					jeanne
		i dont know it  i feel it

					aulon
		you make it sound so simple

					jeanne
		the truth is always simple its
		you jean whos making things
		complicated

					aulon
		me  its not me its god who
		makes everything complicated  if
		hes allpowerful why not let the
		english stay on their island in the
		first place  and why let this war
		go on for a hundred years  and why
		send you out to fight when a girl
		like you should be at home with your
		family  why why

					jeanne
		so even you dont believe in me
		anymore

					aulon
		jeanne i believe in you more
		than anyone

aulons hand touches jeannes hair  he leans forward as
though being drawn by her eyes and mouth

					aulon
		i i just wish i could i want
		to to help you

the moment is a little too intense  they gaze at each
other then jeanne suddenly pulls away

					jeanne
		if you really want to help me
		theres one thing you can do

					aulon
		tell me

					jeanne
		tell the king to give me more men

jeanne goes leaving aulon alone deliberating


ext  chinon  day

jeanne and her pages mount their horses and ride off


int  chambers  chinon  day

aulon walks through a small antechamber and is about to
knock at a door when he pauses hearing familiar voices

					tremoille os
		we have to stop her your majesty
		if she raises her own army and
		attacks the burgundians at
		compiegne all my months of painful
		negotiations will have been in vain

aulon draws closer shocked at what he hears

					regnault os
		tremoille is right  she behaves as
		though she were god  its high time
		she found out whos really in
		command


int  kings chambers  chinon  day

regnault tremoille and yolande coil about charles like
serpents  charles looks at them all

					charles
		its true  theres only one king
		people need to be reminded of that
		nevertheless jeanne has done so
		much for us

					yolande
		i assure you charles the maiden
		has no greater admirer than myself
		but whatever our personal feelings
		we cannot allow her to conduct her
		own private war  for the sake of
		the kingdom it is imperative that
		you stop her going to compiegne

					charles
		i i cant stop her

					tremoille
		well if you dont im sure the
		burgundians will be happy to oblige
		if they capture her at compiegne

					regnault
		 no one can blame us

					charles
		i i dont know itll sound
		like we betrayed her

					tremoille
		noooo

					regnault
		good heavens no

					tremoille
		never

					yolande
		dont worry charles  if god is
		still with her she will be
		victorious  were not her judges
		were just spectators  let her go
		to compiegne as you let her go to
		orleans and let god decide her
		fate

					charles
		but her armys so small now

					yolande
		then her faith will have to be
		bigger

yolande gives richmond a significant look


int  chambers  chinon  day

aulon can scarcely believe what he has heard


int  aulons room  chinon castle  day

a table smashes against a stone wall a chair splinters
in fragments  aulon is in a frenzy smashing up
furniture


ext  chinon castle  day

aulon rides out from the castle


ext  forest clearing  day

jeanne and her meager band of soldiers have paused for
food  aulon makes his way through the trees  and finds
jeanne a little apart from the others with her two page
boys

					aulon
		jeanne i need to speak to you
			   pointedly
		alone

jeanne glances at him a moment then nods for louis and
raymond to leave

					jeanne
		did the king listen to you

aulon blushes clears his throat

					aulon
		jeanne i i love you jeanne  i
		love you and i want to marry you

jeanne is a little taken aback but is genuinely touched

					jeanne
		thats not what i asked why do
		you want to marry me

					aulon
		you listen to your voices i listen
		to my heart

jeanne looks at him a beat

					jeanne
		what did the king say

					aulon
		he said that hes making a treaty
		with the duke of burgundy and

					jeanne
		its a trap  theyre buying time
		till they can bring over more
		soldiers from england

					aulon
		did your voices tell you that  you
		told me you hadnt heard them for
		months

					jeanne
		no but

					aulon
		or maybe its jeanne whos in a trap
		 her own trap  a downward spiral
		that she cant stop

					jeanne
		did you come back to marry me or to
		insult me

					aulon
		to marry you

a beat then she looks away

					jeanne
		i will ask my voices if they come
		back one day  meanwhile im
		going to compiegne

					aulon
		jeanne i have been hearing voices
		 and believe me those voices left
		me in no doubt that you must not go
		to compiegne

she looks at him a moment knowing that he speaks the
truth

					aulon
		jeanne i believe in you  but
		can you believe in me for once
		dont go even if you dont want
		to marry me

					jeanne
		i would like to marry you  but i
		have already promised myself to
		god

					aulon
		but youve done so much for god
		as it is cant you do something
		for yourself for once  for jeanne

					jeanne
		but it is what i want

					aulon
		to be killed in battle

					jeanne
		if god wants me to win he will find
		a way  and if he wants me to die
		if he wants me back then thats
		fine too  then ill be with him
		forever

she has a dreamy faraway look  one with which aulon
cannot compete

					aulon
		will you at least let me stay with
		you

					jeanne
		it would not be the same without
		you


ext  compiegne  battlefield  day

sharp cut to a man being felled by a cudgel  we are in
the middle of the battle and things are not going well
for the french  the citizens and their mayor watch
anxiously from the drawbridge and the town walls  nearby
stands a familiar face  the battlescarred richmond  the
mayor and richmond exchange a glance that chills

jeanne is struggling to keep her banner aloft then a
cry from close by and to her horror she sees raymond
collapse with an arrow in his breast  his faithful
companion louis races to his side throwing his arms
around him

jeanne jumps down from her horse but by the time she
reaches him his eyes are closed  louis looks up at her
tears brimming  aulon rides up alongside jeanne

					aulon
		we must sound the retreat

					jeanne
		not yet

with the enemy bearing down theres no time to pause


ext  compiegne  walls  pov of battlefield  day

from high on the town walls the mayor surveys the distant
battle  richmond is standing a short distance away  he
gives him a sign  the mayor turns to a guard

					mayor
		i cant risk the towns safety
		raise the drawbridge


ext  compiegne  battlefield  day

as jeanne rides back with aulon she spots richmond beyond
the drawbridge inside the town  theres a brief exchange
between them a locking of eyes  jeanne turns to aulon

					jeanne
		get back inside the town and see if
		the english are attacking from the
		other side

					aulon
		but why whats the point

					jeanne
		do as i say

					aulon
		i want to stay with you

					jeanne
		thats an order

aulon looks almost shocked  he backs away then turns his
horse about and rides back across the drawbridge and into
the town  seconds later the drawbridge begins to rise
and jeanne is trapped

she tries to fight her way clear of the advancing english
but they encircle her  she lashes out with the flat of
her sword trying to keep their swords and lances at bay
the noose tightens  her horse starts to panic but
strangely theres a smile on her face as though she sees
the end coming this end that she so desires  to die on a
battlefield in penance for the blood shed in her name

suddenly a bolt slices through bone 

 and jeannes horse collapses from under her  she rolls
to the ground springing back to her feet as the english
close in  again she flays the air with her sword but it
becomes heavier and heavier as her energy finally begins
to drain

a huge iron ball smashes her sword in two  now she has
no weapon but her fists  yet still she lashes out like
a fox cornered by hounds  another blow  she falls to
the ground her face gazing up  her eyes soften and
again that smile 

her pov  high above the dust and smoke and flame of
battle  a little patch of blue


ext  field  summer  day

 and jeanne falls into the field of her childhood

					jeanne
		my lord

 the sky brightens  the sun dazzles  spacetime
dilates with her arms wide open jeanne offers herself
to the skies 

					jeanne
		take me

nature starts to consume her integrating her as a part of
the whole clouds seasons and wind become one in an
apocalyptic ballet grass flowers and roots consume
her the camera suddenly pulls back so fast and far that
within seconds the earth has become a revolving sphere in
the darkness of space

flash  the sphere now becomes a fourdimensional torus a
fluid dynamic ring evolving in and out of space

flash  the torus blinks and the dark center becomes a
blue eye the same diameter as jeannes  overwhelmed by
this vision  a shadow of a man clutching a mace is
reflected in the blueness

sharp cut to the man as he slams her wham

black  then a zillion stars evolve from the darkness
slowly rotating inversely toward a central point as though
returning to the origin of spacetime in one single
dimensionless point of light  which then suddenly
explodes

at the same moment a huge eye blinks open  the eye of
jeanne


int  compiegne  prison  night

jeannes eyes search a darkness that gradually resolves
into the grim dank confines of a dungeon  she sits bolt
upright as though awakening from a nightmare

she is on a wooden bed her face bruised and tumefied  a
few inches away is a man one side of his shaved head
catching a sliver of light  hes laughing at her

					man
		i cant believe it your romantic
		vision of death with all that grass
		growing everywhere i must admit
		you have a great imagination  or
		maybe not great enough  death is
		much more simple

flash  a dead body lying in the silent forest a trickle
of blood running from his mouth

					man
		 after a few months it gets more
		interesting

flash  same shot only now the body is wriggling

flash  the body is now reduced to skin and bones

					man
		 then  after a year  it
		finally becomes romantic

flash  the same spot in the forest but now there is no
sign of the body

jeanne shakes her head

					jeanne
		who who are you

					man
		i am that i am
			   beat
		you dont like my face
			   evidently not
		maybe you prefer this one

his face melts into the little boy sitting on a throne in
the middle of the wood  she gazes at him in
bewilderment 

					man
		too young maybe  how about this one

the boy becomes the young man she saw in the forest
jeanne is breathless  the man is invading her most secret
memories

					man
		better no  but incomplete

suddenly his face is flooded with blood like the image of
the man she saw during the battle of orleans

jeanne screams covering her face

					jeanne
		get thee behind me  satan

the man smiles unaffected by her outburst

					man
		who are you to even think you can
		know the difference between good and
		evil  are you god

					jeanne
		no no im just a messenger
		he needs me a higher calling

suddenly the man starts to bellow  the walls tremble 
the bellow becomes a roar clouds boil behind his
head

					man
		how can you begin to imagine that
		god the creator of heaven and
		earth the source of all life could
		possibly need  you

jeanne can no longer stop her tears

					jeanne
		i dont know i thought

					man
		you think god isnt big enough to
		deliver his own messages

					jeanne
		i dont know please tell me
		im dead

					man
		who are you to decide if you should
		live or die

					jeanne
		i dont know what do you want
		from me

					man
		nothing  im here to set you
		free

the man holds up his hand as though in judgment 

a hand slams across her face 

 and she wakes up nursing her hot cheek  in front of
her  the rough english guard who just struck her

					guard
			   angrily
		i said smile  you have visitors

the door opens and a smart delegation arrives in her
cell led by a thin reed of a man the duke of burgundy
and his rightarm dijon

					guard
		his grace the duke of burgundy

jeanne stares at him confused

					burgundy
		so here is the famous jeanne
		savior of orleans terror of the
		english  you look pretty ordinary
		to me

					jeanne
		am i am i dead

					burgundy
		dead youre worthless darling

					jeanne
		where where am i

					burgundy
		guess

she looks about her dismal confines

					jeanne
		my king will pay any ransom you ask

					burgundy
		your king  ah yes of course
		whats he going to pay me with
		cows  chickens  i prefer gold and
		the english have plenty  i wonder
		how much theyll pay to have the
		witch of orleans in their clutches
		those english are so arrogant they
		cant accept the idea of being
		defeated by a peasant girl it has
		to have been the devils work

					jeanne
		god defeated the english not me

					burgundy
		and god who allowed you to be
		caught

jeanne hadnt thought about that before

					burgundy
		personally i dont believe in god
		and i dont believe in the devil
		either  thats why im never
		disappointed
			   to dijon
		sell her


int  chinon castle  day

aulon goes to see the king in his chamber and hands him a
heavy sack  tremoille and regnault are present as
always

					aulon
		here to help pay jeannes ransom
		all the captains gave what they
		could as well as the citizens of
		orleans and the other towns she
		saved

					charles
		very generous of you all  how much

					aulon
		10000 gold crowns

from their expressions this is clearly an enormous
amount

					charles
		10000 thats a lot but i fear
		not enough  but it will be my
		pleasure to make up the difference
			   to archbishop
			    regnault
		your grace i place you in charge
		of this sensitive negotiation


int  office  duke of burgundys castle  day

burgundys rightarm  dijon  turns to his assistant

					dijon
		they send a bishop to negotiate
		thats a good sign  let him in

it is not archbishop regnault who enters but another
ecclesiastic swaddled in the rich robes of his office
the bishop of beauvais one pierre cauchon

					cauchon
		good day sir  i trust my honorable
		duke of burgundy is feeling well

					dijon
		hes feeling wonderful

					cauchon
		thanks be to god

					dijon
		and your duke  the duke of bedford

					cauchon
		not so well i regret to say  this
		business with the maiden its
		caused him endless grief and
		torment  thats why hes entrusted
		me with the task of shall we
		say

					dijon
		buying her

					cauchon
		this word is  regrettably
		appropriate for the situation  in
		fact what we  the church  wish
		to do is determine whether or not
		this girl is sent by god as she
		claims  you understand that we
		cannot allow just anybody to abuse
		gods name in this manner

					dijon
		i understand  how much

it is that other man of the cloth regnault who answers

					regnault
		5000 gold crowns

					dijon
		thats not a lot

					regnault
		it is all his majesty can afford
		he has even donated his very own
		personal savings  his majesty will
		greatly appreciate a gesture of good
		will in this delicate negotiation
		between our two families

					dijon
		i know but the english want her
		very badly and i have to tell you
		that they are proving much more
		generous

					regnault
		may i without offending you
		inquire how generous

					dijon
		20000 gold crowns

regnaults rival cleric cauchon looks aghast

					cauchon
		20000  but i heard king
		charles was financially
		embarrassed

					dijon
		dont look at the cost look at what
		it brings  what is your last offer

					regnault
		8000  we cant raise more we
		can only place ourselves at the
		mercy of your generosity

					dijon
		i must offer to the duke  i will
		give you his answer tomorrow


int  prison cell  beaurevoir  day

a burgundian soldier shakes jeanne to wake her up

					soldier
		hey wake up get yourself
		ready youre leaving

jeanne opens her eyes as cauchon enters her cell dressed
in ecclesiastical robes  he stands in front of her
flanked by two monks  at the sigh of the churchmen she
brightens

					jeanne
		oh thank you lord
			   to cauchon
		im so glad to see you  i need to
		confess i havent been confessed
		since easter or been to mass
		will you hear me now

					cauchon
		i will hear you but not now not
		here

					jeanne
		who are you

					cauchon
		pierre cauchon bishop of beauvais
		as you were captured in my diocese
		the duty of conducting the trial
		falls upon me

					jeanne
		trial  what trial

					cauchon
		your trial jeanne  on a charge of
		heresy

					jeanne
		but the king  my king  didnt
		he pay my ransom

					cauchon
		it seems that the english care more
		about you than the french

					jeanne
		the english

					cauchon
		yes  they paid your ransom
		tomorrow you will be transferred to
		their great castle at rouen

the door slams shut and she is left alone  jeanne is
utterly distraught  she looks round the bleak cell then
moves over to a small window just wide enough for her
to squeeze through


ext  ledge  beaurevoir  night

jeanne clambers out onto a narrow ledge high above the
frozen moat below  only a fool  or one bent on suicide
 would hazard such a leap

					voice os
		need some help

the man we saw after compiegne is once again behind her

					jeanne
		what are you doing out here

					man
		i might ask you the same question

					jeanne
		i im leaving i cant take
		anymore

					man
		and what exactly is it that you
		cant take anymore of

					jeanne
		everything  prison  humiliation
		 being abandoned and betrayed by
		everyone  i cant stand it anymore
		 id rather die

					man
		youll be dead soon enough anyway
		so why be in such a hurry  why not
		face up to your lies  its your
		lies you cant stand anymore

					jeanne
		i i never lied

					man
		if you were true to yourself if
		your faith was firm you wouldnt
		need to run away from yourself like
		this

					jeanne
		i am true  to my lord the king of
		heaven  he knows how much i love
		him  thats all that matters to
		me

					man
		how can you pretend that you love
		god when youre about to throw away
		the most precious thing he gave you
		life is a gift you should know that
		by now jeanne  a gift from god
		you know what hed say to you if he
		was here  what are you doing to
		me jeanne

jeanne is lost exhausted numbed  she gazes into the
void contemplating the fall

					jeanne
		youre right i shouldnt do that

the man suddenly pushes her so that she nearly falls

					man
		thats too easy  one minute you
		want to die the next you want to
		live
			   again pushes her
		do you think that life is a toy that
		can be played with and then broken
		when you dont want it anymore

					jeanne
		no no im just so tired and
		lost and i didnt realize what i
		was doing

he pushes her again

					man
		oh  and just because you realize
		now everybody else should forgive
		you

					jeanne
		i dont know  i dont care anymore
		 i just want to be at peace

					man
		oh so you dont want war anymore
		you want to be at peace  you want
		to be able to change your mind
		anytime you feel like it and expect
		everyone to go along with it

					jeanne
		i dont understand  what do you
		want from me

					man
		i told you already im here to
		set you free

again the man pushes her  this time she loses her
balance and with a startled cry falls from the ledge 
plunging down down  and crashing into the frozen
moat

two castle guards on watch are alerted by the sound of
splintering ice

jeanne is drowning barely able to cling to the broken ice
around her  the first guard to reach the moat tests the
surface with his foot

					guard 2
		dont try  youll fall through

the first guard lies flat to spread his weight then
crawls toward jeanne

					guard 1
		good god its the prisoner

the second guard glances up at the tower ledge far
above

					guard 2
		if she jumped from up there shes
		dead for sure  forget it

the first guard reaches the edge of the hole just as
jeanne disappears beneath the water  he plunges in his
hand and grabs her hair pulling her head back above the
water


int  corridor  chinon castle  dawn

aulon races along castle corridors until he reaches a
door guarded by two burly guards

					guard
		the king is occupied

					aulon
		out of my way


int  throne room  chinon castle  day

aulon bursts into the room to find charles regnault and
tremoille in conversation

					charles
		my dear aulon
			   dismissing guards
		thats fine

					aulon
		jeannes been badly injured  she
		jumped from the top of a tower into
		a frozen moat

charles shivers at the thought

					charles
		its a miracle shes not dead

					aulon
		we have to do something before she
		tries it again  i beg of you my
		lord dont let her down let me
		organize an escape

					charles
		jean its its not so easy

					aulon
		but not impossible gilles and la
		hire are ready to risk everything to
		save her

					charles
		jean me dear loyal jean why
		do you want to oppose the will of
		god  jeanne wanted to go to
		compiegne  we let her  she got
		caught  then on my personal
		orders regnault proposed 30000
		crowns for her ransom and once
		again the answer was no  and now
		you say she tried to escape and the
		answer is still no  jean open your
		eyes  cant you see the hand of
		god in all this

					aulon
		no  i see the hand of tremoille
		and regnault and yolande and
		you and they are dirty hands

					regnault
		how can you speak such treachery
		when his majesty has done everything
		to try and save her

					aulon
		because i was at this door when you
		planned to betray her and i was
		at compiegne when she was betrayed

charles tremoille and regnault are speechless  tremoille
breaks the silence 

					tremoille
		guards  arrest this traitor

the two guards turn on aulon who readily dispatches them
with his sword  tremoille hides behind charles just as
aulon pins the king with the tip of his sword against his
windpipe  it would now be an easy matter for tremoille to
push charles onto the tip of aulons sword

					aulon
		what do you fear most now my
		sword
			   eyeing tremoille
		 or his hands

					charles
		tremoille dont  please

tremoille hesitates a beat  still holding the tip of his
sword at charles throat aulon motions to tremoille

					aulon
		my sword is long enough for both of
		you

sweating now tremoille eases himself from behind the
kings back  charles exhales with relief

					aulon
		i have always been loyal and true to
		you but my allegiance is now at an
		end  from now on my loyalty
		belongs to jeanne

 and aulon runs from the room leaving charles
tremoille and regnault in a state of shock


ext  chinon castle  day

aulon gallops away from the castle


ext  rouen castle  dusk

the great castle of rouen vast and bleak silhouetted
against the dusk


int  rouen castle  corridor  dusk

a guard leads a group of wealthylooking visitors along a
dank dark corridor

					guard
		 so dont say i didnt warn you
		dont touch her whatever you do 
		dont even stretch out your hand or
		shell have one of your fingers off
		sooner than spit at you

					woman 1
		as savage as that is she

					guard
		savage  shes a monster  at
		orleans they say she drank her
		victims blood

					woman 2
		oh its too horrible

the womans escort takes advantage of the situation

					male
		dont worry my sweet  ill have
		my sword at the ready

they reach the door and the guard fumbles for the right
key  the duke of bedford brings up the rear escorting
his wife anne who is visibly pregnant

					duchess
		dont you think this visit is a
		little inappropriate

					bedford
		my dear its our duty shes our
		guest

the guard unlocks the door and the group cautiously
enter


int  jeannes cell  rouen castle  night

the visitors glance about but the cell appears empty 
until they look up  an iron cage is hanging from the
middle of the ceiling  in the center of the cage is a
body dressed in rags and curled up like a wounded animal

					bedford
		wake her up so we can see her face

the guard takes his cudgel and pokes her through the bars

					guard
		hey wake up we got noble guests
		 dont disappoint them  turn
		round

he prods her in the ribs and she turns to avoid further
pain  her face is swollen her mouth parched her eyes
full of grief  the duchess is stunned

					guard
		now shes sleepy but you wait and
		see  any moment now and shell
		start speaking to her devils and
		then shell get to yelping like a
		wolf in heat  the other night she
		made her cage spin round so fast we
		thought she was going to fly away

					woman
		oooo she gives me creeps

					guard
		do you want her to stand up so you
		can get a better look

					duchess
		no  but get her out of this cage
		and give her a decent bed

the guard looks stunned  the duchess turns to her
husband

					duchess
		im sorry but this child is being
		treated like an animal  dont you
		think that whatever her crimes may
		be she deserves a little more of
		our charity

					bedford
			   whispering lightly
		shes not a child my dear  shes
		a witch


int  courtroom  rouen  day

cauchon enters a large gloomy courtroom and sits down
surrounded by clerics assessors doctors of theology and
other churchmen

					cauchon
		let the prisoner be brought in

the door opens and jeanne is led in her wrists and ankles
fettered her face pale and drawn  she stands in the
center of the room isolated alone  a scribe dips his
quill in the ink and prepares to write on a blank sheet of
parchment

					cauchon
		our most serene and christian king
		henry the sixth king of england and
		france has handed this girl over to
		us accused of a number of heretical
		deeds to be tried in a matter of
		faith

jeanne is hustled closer to cauchon who leans forward
peering at her intently

					cauchon
		take the holy gospels in your hand
		and swear to tell the whole truth
		concerning everything you will be
		asked

					jeanne
		i dont know what youre going to
		ask me questions about  you may ask
		things that i wont want to answer

jeannes boldness takes everyone somewhat by surprise

					cauchon
		you will swear to tell the truth
		about whatever you are asked

					jeanne
		i will willingly swear to tell the
		truth about earthly things but as
		for my revelations ive never told
		anyone except my king charles the
		seventh the one and only king of
		france

there is murmured dissension among the judges  we now see
that the duke of bedford is also in the room together
with a small coterie of english observers  cauchon is
impatient

					cauchon
		you must take the oath  not even a
		king would refuse to take an oath
		to tell the truth in a matter of
		faith

					jeanne
		i will willingly swear to tell you
		what i am allowed to tell you but
		as to the rest even if you threaten
		to cut off my head i still wont
		tell you

cauchon looks confused  and aware that his authority is
slipping  the judges and theologians are getting
agitated

					cauchon
		so begin by telling us your name
		 assuming youre allowed to tell
		us that much

					jeanne
		my name is jeanne  my little cross
		i had round my neck was taken away
		from me  i would like to have it
		back

the duchess touches the gold cross she has around her
neck

					cauchon
		show us a little more cooperation
		first  where were you born

					jeanne
		in a village called domremy

					cauchon
		how old are you

					cauchon
		nineteen or thereabouts

					cauchon
		were you baptized

					jeanne
		yes  in the church at domremy

					cauchon
		recite the lords prayer

					jeanne
		not unless you hear my confession

cauchon is getting impatient

					cauchon
		jeanne listen to me very carefully
		we are all men of faith and we
		shall earnestly strive for the
		salvation of both your soul and body
		as though it were our own  we do so
		in the name of our holy mother
		church who never closes her arms to
		those who would return to her  but
		we cannot help you unless you submit
		to our learned judgment and
		authority  take heed of this
		charitable admonition for if you
		persist in refusing our help then
		we shall have no choice but to
		abandon you to the secular powers
		and i think you know well enough the
		punishment that would await you  so
		now will you please recite our
		lords prayer

					jeanne
		not unless you hear my confession

the clerks and judges grow agitated though we sense a few
are already beginning to warm to her not least the
duchess

					cauchon
		jeanne  be careful  youre not
		helping yourself by refusing to
		submit to our judgment

					jeanne
		and you be careful you who claim to
		be my judges for you too will be
		judged one day

the court explodes in protest with cries of blasphemy
shes possessed  an infected limb  sorceress
cauchon hammers on the table to restore order calling
out 

					cauchon
		guards  take the prisoner away
		clear the room

armed guards hustle the clerics from the room while jeanne
is led away watched by the duke and duchess of bedford

bedford turns to his aide buck 

					bedford
		i count on you to have it done

					buck
		uh to have what done

					bedford
		i want her burned

					buck
		as you say sir


int  antechamber  rouen castle  day

the assessors look extremely uncomfortable not least
pierre cauchon who does his best to conceal it

					cauchon
		well in the future i think we
		should conduct our enquiries in
		private  away from public pressure
		 so we can all be more level
		headed

					assessor 1
		i think the church should wash its
		hands of this whole business

					assessor 2
		let the english burn her if they
		want to why does it have to
		involve us

buck enters the room as an old priest walks over

					cauchon
		because its its our clear duty
		to root out heresy wherever it
		occurs
			   to the old priest
		father vincente you are the most
		venerable among us what do you
		think

					old priest
		i think this trial is a masquerade
		and i wont be part of it anymore
		i am willing to be her judge but
		not her executioner  this young
		girl seems courageous and pious
		she deserves to be well judged

the old priest walks toward the door

					cauchon
		thats what im trying to ensure

					old priest
		the verdict comes at the end of a
		trial cauchon not at the
		beginning  i am going back to rome
		to give me report to our holy father
		the pope

					cauchon
		this is ridiculous  now im the one
		whos on trial and being judged

					old priest
		yes exactly as jeanne predicted

the old priest heads for the door followed by the other
two  buck calls out to the guards

					buck
		arrest them

					cauchon
		what are you doing  this is an
		ecclesiastical court  you have no
		right to do this

					buck
		rouen is in english territory  i
		have the right to do anything i
		like
			   to guards
		take them away

ignoring their protestations the guards hustle them away
leaving the others in a state of high anxiety


int  cell  rouen castle  night

jeanne is in her cell facing the wall and frantically
scratching it with her nails  she is engraving a cross
and her nails are covered with blood

she is now kneeling in front of her cross racing through
the lords prayer as though on the run from the devil

					jeanne
		our father who is in heaven hallowed
		be thy name thy kingdom come in
		earth as it is in heaven forgive
		them that lead forgive us that
		lead them as we forgive them
		that oh god dont cut yourself
		off from me like this i dont
		know what im meant to say or not
		say anymore i dont even know
		what to think oh god im so
		lost dont abandon me like
		everyone else please i beg of
		you at least say you can hear
		me  tell me you hear me  why
		wont you answer me  please i beg
		of you  answer me

suddenly the man comes out of the wall kneeling in
front of her and violently hitting his forehead against
hers 

					man
		why were you yelling like that

					jeanne
		what are you doing here
			   urgently
		please leave you cant stay
		here

					man
		why  are you waiting for someone
		else

					jeanne
		yes

					man
		who

jeanne hesitates

					jeanne
		my visions

					man
		theyre going to come and visit you
		in here

					jeanne
		yes thats what i pray for

					man
		i want to see that  do you mind if
		i stay on the side  i wont
		bother you

					jeanne
		no no  you cant stay or they
		wont come

					man
		why not

					jeanne
		because i have to be alone

he smiles regretfully

					man
		they wont come anyway

					jeanne
		what do you mean they wont come

					man
		why would they

					jeanne
		because  because ive always been
		faithful to god and ive followed
		everything he said and ive done
		everything he asked me

					man
		god asked you to do something

					jeanne
		yes lots of things

					man
		you mean god said i need you
		jeanne

					jeanne
		no but he sent me so many signs

					man
		what signs

					jeanne
		like like the wind and the
		clouds and the bells and
		what about that sword lying in the
		field that was a sign

					man
		no  that was a sword in a field

					jeanne
		but it didnt just get there by
		itself

					man
		true  every event has an infinite
		number of causes  but why pick one
		rather than another  there are many
		ways a sword might find itself in a
		field

flash  a group of soldiers on horseback trot across the
field of jeannes childhood  the last soldiers sword is
coming loose and ends up falling into the long grass

					man
		seems a perfectly valid
		explanation but how about this
		one

flash  two young children are hurrying with the sword
when an old man calls them from far away 

					old man
		hey you little devils  come back

the two children drop the sword in the long grass in the
same spot as before and run off

					man
		but then again there are other
		possibilities

flash  a man is being chased across the field by a couple
of english soldiers out looting  his heavy sword is
slowing him down  he flings it into the long grass

					man
		 or even faster

flash  the same man running across the field is suddenly
hit by an arrow from nowhere  he drops the sword in the
long grass but manages to stagger off into the forest

					man
		 and thats without counting the
		inexplicable

flash  a man crosses the field  for no apparent reason
whatsoever he drops the sword and keeps on walking

					man
		yet from an infinite number of
		possibilities you had to pick this
		one

flash  a peel of thunder  clouds swirl  a familiar
wind stirs the long grass  a fabulous shaft of light
illuminates the patch  the sword slowly descends from
the heavens and lands gently in the grass  mission
accomplished the shaft of heavenly light disappears

jeanne is bewildered

					man
		you didnt see what was jeanne
		you saw what you wanted to see

 speechless


int  small courtroom  rouen castle  day

we are now in a smaller more intimate courtroom  the
duchess of bedford is at the back shielded behind the
theologians and doctors of the church  beaupere is
questioning jeanne  a cooler man than cauchon

					beaupere
		this voice that you say appears
		to you is it an angel  or a
		saint  or does it come from god

jeanne is still in shock from her encounter with the man

					jeanne
		i wont tell you more about that
		im more afraid of displeasing him
		than not answering you

					beaupere
		youre afraid of displeasing god
		when telling the truth

					jeanne
		no

					beaupere
		did god forbid you to tell the
		truth

					jeanne
		no  but my revelations were for the
		king of france not for you

					destivet
		when you saw your king for the first
		time was there an angel over his
		head

					jeanne
		if there was i didnt see it

					destivet
		then why did your king believe in
		you without any proof

					jeanne
		go and ask him yourself

					cauchon
		jeanne you are not helping
		yourself  if you dont answer our
		questions properly your refusal
		will be taken into account

					jeanne
		these questions have nothing to do
		with your trial

					cauchon
		i assure you they do  so answer
		me when was the last time you
		heard this voice

					jeanne
		not long ago

					cauchon
		when exactly  a day a week 
		when

					jeanne
		last night

this takes the assessors by surprise  cauchon leans
forward

					cauchon
		what were you doing when the voice
		came

					jeanne
		praying

					cauchon
		the voice was in your cell

					jeanne
		yes

					cauchon
		what did it tell you

					jeanne
		many things

					cauchon
		did it give you advice
			   jeanne hesitates
		good advice

jeanne hesitates

					jeanne
		go onto the next question

					beaupere
		good advice for the french not for
		the english  do you think god hates
		the english

					jeanne
		i dont know but youre all men of
		the church why not ask him
		yourself

cauchon tries to continue but another theologian  jean
midi  gets in first

					jean midi
		do you consider yourself to be in a
		state of grace

jeanne looks perplexed a beat

					jeanne
		go on to the next question

cauchon seizes his opportunity

					cauchon
		tell us jeanne do you often hear
		this voice

					jeanne
		yes

					cauchon
		is it here  now  in this room

jeanne slowly looks at the assessors staring at each in
turn  they all look acutely uneasy holding there
breath

					jeanne
		no

relief from the assessors but buck is far from happy


int  antechamber  rouen castle  day

buck paces in front of cauchon and a dozen clerics

					buck
		whos running this trial you or
		her  i cant believe it  this
		wretched girl  how dare she speak
		to us like that

					cauchon
		shes loyal to her king its only
		to be expected that she

buck explodes with fury 

					buck
		there is only one king of france and
		thats our liege lord henry the
		sixth  it is written in black and
		white in the treaty of troyes 
		that you french bastards signed

buck presses a digit against cauchons sweaty forehead

					cauchon
		i understand your impatience but if
		you want this trial to be
		acknowledged as legal we must follow
		correct procedure and

					buck
		to hell with procedure  we paid a
		bloody fortune for this slut and we
		can do whatever the hell we like
		with her whether the church likes
		it or not  is that clear

					cauchon
		but if this trial seems fixed i
		fear youll have the very opposite
		result to the one you want

					buck
		we want her burned as a witch

					cauchon
		but in order to do so the church
		must first prove her heresy or else
		youll be burning a martyr

					buck
		well then  start proving or else
		the church will have another martyr

buck storms out slamming the door behind him


int  small courtroom  rouen castle  day

instruments of torture are brought into court by the
executioner who lays them out with due ceremony

					destivet
		you told us about the appearance of
		this voice  what exactly did you
		see  part of it or all of it

					jeanne
		his face

					destivet
		does he have hair

					jeanne
		yes

					destivet
		is it long and hanging down

					jeanne
		im more interested in what he says
		not what he looks like

					destivet
		but if the devil were to take on the
		physical appearance of a saint or an
		angel or a man how would you
		recognize him  by what he said

					jeanne
		go on to the next question

					destivet
		thats enough  you will answer the
		question or face the
		consequences

a beat the executioner readies

					jeanne
		if you were to tear me limb from
		limb and make my soul leave my body
		i would tell you nothing more  and
		if i did say anything then
		afterward i would simply say that
		you dragged it out of me by force
		now please go onto the next
		question


int  small courtroom  rouen castle  day

cut to another session

					jean le maistre
		who told you to wear mens clothes

					jeanne
		the clothes are not important

					jean le maistre
		you also cut your hair short like a
		man and in the bible it clearly
		states that it is an abomination for
		a woman to pretend to be a man  it
		proves your desire to deceive

					jeanne
		it was just more convenient as i
		was among soldiers

					jean le maistre
		so you think you did well to cut
		your hair and dress as a man

					jeanne
		i submit to our lord

					jean le maistre
		but will you also submit to the
		decision of the church

					jeanne
		it seems to me that the church and
		our lord are one and the same  why
		must you complicate what is so
		simple

jean le maistre looks at cauchon for help

					cauchon
		let me clarify things for you
		jeanne  on the one hand there is
		the church triumphant that is to
		say god his saints and the souls
		that are saved  and then there is
		the church militant that is to say
		our holy father the pope the
		cardinals the prelates of the
		church the clergy and all good
		catholic christians  moreover this
		church when assembled is guided by
		the holy spirit and therefore cannot
		be in error  that is why we ask you
		to submit to the church militant
		that is to say us

					jeanne
		so it is the church militant that
		refuses to confess me and so
		prevents me from being a good
		christian

cauchon bridles his temper

					cauchon
		it is for us to determine whether
		you are a good christian not you

					jeanne
		i am sent by god and i submit all
		my words and deeds to his judgment
		or do you think that you are better
		judges than he is


int  small courtroom  rouen castle  day

 and another session

					maitre maurice
		when you were taken prisoner at
		compiegne did you have a horse

					jeanne
		yes a halfsteed white

					maitre maurice
		who gave you that horse

					jeanne
		my king

					maitre maurice
		how many did he give you

					jeanne
		five steeds and a few hackneys

					maitre maurice
		as much as for a lord  what an
		honor  did your king give you other
		wealth apart from horses

					jeanne
		no

					maitre maurice
		what about all those dresses you
		were given silk dresses werent
		they

					jeanne
		yes i was given a few but i never
		had time to wear them

					maitre maurice
		still pretty wealthy for a peasant
		girl wouldnt you say

					jeanne
		and you look pretty wealthy for a
		servant of god wouldnt you say

maitre maurice looks uncomfortably about him  shes
right

					beaupere
		is it true that you launched an
		attack on paris

					jeanne
		i tried to

					beaupere
		it was on a sunday wasnt it

					jeanne
		i dont remember  maybe

					beaupere
		do you think is was a good idea to
		launch an attack on a holy day

					jeanne
		i dont know

					beaupere
		and didnt you order the citizens of
		paris to surrender the city in the
		name of the king of heaven

					jeanne
		no i said surrender in the name
		of the king of france

					beaupere
		that is not what is written in the
		evidence look for yourself

beaupere thrusts a document in her face

					jeanne
		i cant read

					beaupere
		ah yes i forgot god sent us an
		illiterate peasant to carry out such
		an important mission  do you think
		that god made the right decision to
		take an ignorant girl to save the
		kingdom of france

					jeanne
		i leave the answer to god

beaupere is exasperated  a slylooking theologian speaks
up

					jean midi
		tell us jeanne why did you jump
		from the tower at beaurevoir

					jeanne
		i had been sold to the english  id
		rather die than fall into their
		hands

					jean midi
		did your voice tell you to jump

					jeanne
		no

					jean midi
		so when you jumped you wanted to
		kill yourself

					jeanne
		no

					jean midi
		how can you deny it when you just
		said id rather die than fall into
		the hands of the english

					jeanne
		thats now what i meant

					jean midi
		do you not know that suicide is a
		very grievous sin  no one is
		allowed to destroy the life that god
		created

					jeanne
		i know but thats not the way
		things happened

					jean midi
		you mean it was not of your own free
		will that you were on the ledge

					jeanne
		yes but

					jean midi
		and you didnt jump of your free
		will

					jeanne
		no

					jean midi
			   making fun of her
		oh  perhaps someone pushed you
		then

they laugh  jeanne lowers her head


int  small courtroom  rouen castle  day

yet another weary session

					beaupere
		do you have a sword

					jeanne
		quite a few

					beaupere
		didnt you also carry a banner

					jeanne
		yes

					beaupere
		which did you prefer your banner or
		your sword

					jeanne
		i was forty times more fond of my
		banner than my sword

					beaupere
		and why was that  did it have some
		particular value or power

					jeanne
		no its just a sword is a
		weapon

					beaupere
		and

					jeanne
		and so i i prefer my banner

					beaupere
		why

					jeanne
		to avoid killing anyone

					beaupere
		are you saying that if you had not
		been carrying your banner youd have
		killed more people

jeanne is losing her confidence

					jeanne
		no of course not i never killed
		anyone

					beaupere
		then perhaps the temptation to kill
		would have been stronger too
		strong perhaps

					jeanne
		no  i warned the english to go back
		home  i begged them not to force
		us to fight  they knew the defeat
		i would bring on them why didnt
		they listen to me

					beaupere
		we have numerous witnesses who can
		confirm that you were not always
		carrying your banner

					jeanne
		yes probably maybe

					beaupere
		so sometimes you were carrying just
		your sword

					jeanne
		yes but

					beaupere
		did you use the sword that you held
		in your hand

					jeanne
		no i i held it up to

					beaupere
		you held up your sword and
		flourished it about in the air
		like this

					jeanne
		yes maybe i dont remember

					beaupere
		 so you were in the middle of the
		battlefield with your sword in your
		hand waving it above your head
		charging against the enemy
		screaming and yelling fighting
		for your life and you want us to
		believe that in the middle of all
		this excitement you never killed
		anyone

					jeanne
		no i i never killed anyone

					man os
		i cant believe you can lie like
		that


int  jeannes cell  rouen castle  night

jeannes fetter is once again attached to her chain and
shes walking in circles trying to escape the man

					jeanne
		im not lying i i cant
		remember leave me alone

					man
		oh  you cant remember  let me
		help your memory

flash  an englishman is skewed during the battle of
orleans

					jeanne
		no  i dont want to know anymore
		leave me alone  i didnt kill that
		man

					man
		oh no  how about this one

flash  another english soldier is killed

					man
		or this one

flash   and another

					jeanne
		stop stop i cant remember  the
		battles were all so confusing
		there was so much smoke dust
		noise i was being attacked on all
		sides so maybe perhaps i
		fought back but it was only to
		defend myself

					man
		so your memorys coming back

					jeanne
		yes yes  and now you tell me
		why god let all these battles happen
		in the first place if hes so
		powerful he said hes the
		creator of heaven and earth the
		source of all life he could have
		easily stopped all this blood and
		misery  why didnt he

					man
		is he the one who spread all this
		blood and misery

					jeanne
		no but why didnt he stop it
		or did he get pleasure watching us
		killing each other in his name

					man
		in his name

					jeanne
		yes  we fought and killed in his
		name the king of heaven

					man
		really

flash  jeanne is seated in her saddle before orleans
raising her standard with the cry 

					jeanne
		let all who love me follow me

back in jeannes cell

					man
		let all who love me follow me
		where does god get mentioned
			   jeanne is cornered
		come on jeanne be honest  you
		fought for yourself in your name

					jeanne
		i i was defending myself as best
		i could  everyone has the right to
		defend themselves dont they  or
		should i have let myself be killed

					man
		no no you did fine  id even say
		well done  besides most of the
		ones you killed probably deserved
		it dont you think

					jeanne
		no i do not think so  i dont
		think that killing each other will
		ever bring peace

					man
		i agree

flashback  jeanne telling charles 

					jeanne
		peace will only be got from the
		english at the end of a lance

the man looks at jeanne who is becoming unnerved

					man
		i dont agree  why do you have to
		keep changing your mind all the
		time

					jeanne
		why are you doing this to me  do
		you get pleasure from hurting me

					man
		ah pleasure thats a difficult
		word to define  when does the pain
		end and the pleasure begin
		when did your pleasure begin with
		that sword in your hand

					jeanne
		i never took pleasure in hurting
		anyone

					man
		really

flash  in extreme slow motion jeannes face contorts 
a look of madness as she sweeps a sword across the
screen

					jeanne
		nnnnooooooooo

jeanne covers her face with her hands sobbing in despair

					jeanne
		help me please set me free

the man seems genuinely compassionate

					man
		you will be jeanne  you will be


int  hallway  rouen castle  day

a hooded priest moves along the hallway stopping in front
of the guard  he shows him his pass  a heavy seal
the priest is aulon in disguise  the guard looks at the
seal

					aulon
		im replacing father demaury  hes
		become very sick

					guard
		its amazing how many people have
		become suddenly very sick since the
		beginning of this trial it must
		be this witch casting spells on
		them  burn her

no doubt aulon would like to stab the guard right there
but thinks better of it

					aulon
		ill do my best

aulon enters the court room


int  courtroom  rouen castle  day

 and sits on a bench doing his best to look
inconspicuous  he guardedly glances at jeanne who seems
to be asleep on her feet  beaupere is whispering to
cauchon document in hand  beaupere beckons to the
guard

					beaupere
		wake her up

the guard pokes jeanne in the ribs  she seems almost used
to this kind of treatment but is weaker  aulon seethes
with impotent rage hidden behind his hood

					jean midi
		so let us summarize your
		situation  you refuse to submit to
		the authority of the church militant
		by taking an oath you made an
		assault on paris on a sunday you
		hurled yourself down from the tower
		at beaurevoir and you persist in
		wearing male dress i ask you
		again  do you believe that you are
		in a state of grace

jeanne takes a deep breath

					jeanne
		if i am not may god bring me there
		if i am may he keep me there

the admiration of the assessors is almost tangible


int  antechamber  rouen castle  day

buck sweeps everything off the table in a fit of anger
alone with him cauchon looks troubled

					cauchon
		calm down my lord i beg you

					buck
		how can i calm down when im made
		the laughingstock of the whole
		court  ive had enough

					cauchon
		be patient my lord youve seen
		how it is  this girl has a way with
		people but everyday were making
		progress

					buck
		so long as this bitch remains alive
		our armies refuse to fight  dont
		you understand  they want proof
		that god is on their side and the
		only way theyre going to believe
		that is when they see her being
		burnt as a witch

buck takes a mug and pours himself some wine but the
carafe is empty

					cauchon
		it is not for us to burn her my
		lord  that is your prerogative

					buck
		 and your prerogative is to find
		her guilty

					cauchon
		but we cant do that unless she
		admits to blasphemy

					buck
		well what are you waiting for
		youve got a castle full of racks
		and ropes and pulleys  go and
		torture the bitch

cauchon takes out his own personal hipflask his hand
visibly trembling as he pours buck some liquor

					cauchon
		you wont be able to drag anything
		from her that way  you also must
		realize that many of my colleagues
		are well scared

					buck
		scared of a girl

					cauchon
		scared to make a mistake  supposing
		shes right supposing she really
		has been sent by god

buck narrows his eyes

					buck
		whose side are you on cauchon

					cauchon
		im on the side of our mother holy
		church  besides a confession under
		torture will never convince anyone
		of her guilt

					buck
		well find some other way  be
		creative  tell them she fucks the
		devil hmm not a bad idea why
		cant you say that  sounds good to
		me and who can prove she doesnt

buck drains the liquor

					cauchon
		one small problem my lord  the
		girl is a virgin

buck has a horrible glint in his eye

					buck
		that is a very small problem


int ext  jeannes cellcourtyard  rouen  day

jeanne is smoothing food into the cross she scratched into
the wall  she does it with great care as though
painting  the man appears in the background watching
her

					man
		what are you doing

jeanne is delighted and relieved to see him

					jeanne
		i  i cleaned up my room look
		and i said my prayers all of
		them and

					man
		what are you doing on the wall

					jeanne
		im trying to make my cross look
		more beautiful

					man
		what for

					jeanne
		because because i dont know what
		else to do to please him

					man
		do you think this cross will protect
		you

					jeanne
		no i

jeanne looks helpless  the man smiles turns and looks
out of the window

					man
		look at them with their beautiful
		cross

far below in the courtyard a priest is blessing a dozen
soldiers and their wooden cross

					man
		 the sight of priests blessing
		entire armies before they go off to
		kill each other never ceases to
		amaze me  and that these massacres
		should be recorded as acts of faith
		in gods name
			   no reaction from
			    jeanne
		and they think that making a
		beautiful cross or building a
		cathedral will wash away their
		sins ridiculous  just like that
		priest who accused you of fighting
		on a sunday  did god give
		permission to kill each other for
		the rest of the week

in the courtyard the soldiers mount their horses

					jeanne
		love your enemies

					man
			   a satisfied smile
		good  but love your enemies
		body and soul

jeanne nods knowing the truth but still not prepared to
admit it

					jeanne
		my voices my voices do you
		think they will ever come back

					man
		i dont think so

					jeanne
		are you going to leave me too

					man
		yes of course when you dont
		need me anymore

					jeanne
		are you sent by god

flash  to jeanne at orleans

					woman
		but youve been sent by god

					jeanne
		so has everyone

back to the man

					man
		so has everyone

jeanne looks at him  then at her cross  then back at
the soldiers in the courtyard below  with a lusty cry
they set off at a gallop blessed and ready for battle

					jeanne
		theres nothing for me to do here
		anymore i dont belong here i
		want to be with him now

					man
		do you think you are ready

jeanne stands up comes and kneels before him kissing
his hands

					jeanne
		yes i am

					man
		are you willing to follow all his
		commandments

					jeanne
		yes

					man
		 to love your enemy as much as
		you love yourself

jeanne hesitates a moment  a short amount of time but
enough for a lie to slip in

					jeanne
		yes  im ready now

the man smiles

					man
		lets see

she hears approaching footsteps the sound of keys
jangling a lock turns 

 and the three soldiers walk into the room  the first
one has a familiar black beard

					blackbeard
		now thats what i call booty

he is none other than her sisters rapist and murderer
jeanne reacts in terror

					jeanne
		oh no

					blackbeard
			   undoing his belt
		we thought you must be pretty bored
		in here so weve come to liven you
		up a bit right lads

					jeanne
		please  dont do it  dont hurt
		me 

					blackbeard
		of course not sweetheart if you
		promise to do as i say

blackbeard caresses her cheek and tries to force her legs
apart but she resists  whispers imploringly

					jeanne
		where are you  dont leave me
		please

					blackbeard
		hey come on open up

his two comrades egg him on  jeanne struggles even
harder and blackbeard suddenly becomes violent  he grabs
her by the throat thrusts her against the bed and tears
off her clothes  jeanne suddenly goes berserk yelling
and thrashing like a cornered animal

					blackbeard
		stop screaming like that  youll
		wake up the whole bleedin castle

blackbeard clamps his hand over her mouth whereupon
jeanne summons hidden reserves of strength and in a
sudden surge manages to clamp her chains around
blackbeards neck she presses down on the chains
choking him strangling him

the two other soldiers come to blackbeards rescue and
manage to haul her off  blackbeard gropes his throat
then belts her across the face

					blackbeard
		ah so you want to play it rough
		good i like it better that way

he pulls out a knife and starts to tear at her clothes
while the two others hold her down  jeanne struggles for
her life  yelling spitting biting scratching 

blackbeard is too excited to pay any attention  nor does
he notice the door open and the duchess enter with the
guard

					duchess
		stop that at once  thats an order

but to blackbeard it could be jeanne speaking  the
duchess in her nightgown grabs blackbeard by the
shoulders

					duchess
		i command you to stop in the name
		of the king

the mention of the king jolts blackbeard to attention

					duchess
		leave her alone do you hear  come
		on get out

the three soldiers back sheepishly away

					blackbeard
		we were just having a little fun
		thats all keeping her company

					duchess
		men like you are the cause of our
		countrys dishonor

					blackbeard
		we were serving our country just
		obeying orders maam

the duchess doesnt want to hear more

					duchess
		go on get out of here

the guards hustle the three soldiers from the room but
not before blackbeard has mumbled 

					blackbeard
		see you later angel

the soldiers leave and the guard bolts the door behind
them  jeanne curls up on her bed destroyed humiliated
lost  the duchess caresses her face and doesnt know what
to do to comfort her  the guard brings a blanket 
probably his

					jeanne
		thank you

she wraps the blanket round jeanne and presses the little
cross back in her hand

					duchess
		this wont happen again i give you
		my word


int  room  rouen castle  day

the duchess storms into a room where cauchon is talking
with bedford and buck  she walks up to him

					bedford
		and what a pleasant surprise

 and slaps him across the face as he has never been
slapped before

					duchess
		you should know that each
		humiliation you inflict on this
		woman you inflict on all women
		including yours my lord

					bedford
		wha what on earth are you talking
		about

					duchess
		if you send anymore of your soldiers
		to jeannes cell i will kill them
		myself

the duchess turns and sweeps past cauchon leaving bedford
staring at buck who looks decidedly embarrassed  bedford
turns to cauchon

					bedford
		im giving you one more day

then he turns and leaves


ext  cemetery of st ouen  day

a masked executioner stands beside a stake piled high
with faggots  jeanne her hands bound stands nearby
facing a podium filled with the usual assembly of priests
and prelates headed by cauchon  he rises to address
jeanne

					cauchon
		jeanne my very dear friend in
		christ we your judges and
		assessors desirous of reaching a
		true and lawful verdict submitted a
		transcript of your trial to the
		university of paris in order to
		obtain their opinion  after careful
		consideration the learned scholars
		have concluded with us that you have
		committed many grievous sins and i
		ask you to listen most carefully to
		their opinion as contained in these
		articles

cauchon hands a manuscript to one of the assessors canon
pierre maurice then resumes his seat  among the monks we
spot aulon who slowly tries to make his way toward
jeanne

					maurice
		article one  you have said that
		from an early age you have had
		revelations from the blessed saints
		and angels that you have seen them
		with your own eyes and that they
		speak to you  as to this article
		the learned scholars have declared
		that these claims are untrue
		pernicious and evil and that all
		such revelations are superstitious
		and proceed from the devil

the duke of bedford and his english peers are in a
separate stand guarded by english soldiers  the cemetery
walls and the branches of trees beyond are crowded with
spectators

the english are impatient to carry out sentence but
maurice is not a man to be intimidated  jeanne seems
hardly aware of what is being said

					maurice
		article two  you said that by gods
		command you have continually worn
		mens clothes and that you have
		also worn your hair short without
		nothing

from jeannes pov maurices drone fades and the crowd
seems to disappear  she whispers in agony

					jeanne
		my lord dont abandon me where
		are you  is this what you want
		you want me to burn  to burn
		without being confessed  ill do
		anything you want but dont leave
		me

jeanne is completely alone in the middle of the cemetery
only the graves the stakes and the moaning wind

					jeanne
		dont leave me here please
		dont leave me alone

suddenly the crowd is back with maurice droning on

					maurice
		finally article twelve  you have
		said that you are not willing to
		submit yourself to the judgment of
		the church militant but only to
		god  as to this article the
		scholars say that you have no
		comprehension of the authority of
		the church that you have
		perniciously erred in the faith of
		god and that you are a child of
		superstition a wanderer from the
		faith an invoker of demons a
		sorceress an idolater and a
		heretic

maurice resumes his seat while chatillon approaches
jeanne

					chatillon
		jeanne we once again admonish beg
		and exhort you to cast out and
		recant your erroneous beliefs and
		return into the way of truth by
		submitting yourself to the authority
		of our mother holy church by signing
		this recantation

jeanne looks at the parchment in confusion

					jeanne
		if the church wants me to say that
		my visions are evil then i dont
		believe in this church and i submit
		myself to the judgment of god

chatillon throws up his hands in despair  bedford is
brimming with anticipation  he calls out to the
executioner

					bedford
		perform your office

the executioner turns to jeanne but before he can take
hold of her cauchon strides over 

					cauchon
		wait   

cauchon grabs the document from chatillon and holds it up
to jeanne

					cauchon
		jeanne i beg of you sign
			   jeanne looks dazed
		in gods name dont you understand
		im trying to save you  if you
		dont sign the english will burn
		you to death  is that what you
		want

					jeanne
		no i want to be confessed

cauchon hands her a quill  the english are getting
agitated heckling cauchon to hand her over but the
spectators in the trees and on the wall are urging her
escape the pyre by signing  jeanne begins to waver

					cauchon
		sign this and i will confess you
		myself if you want

					jeanne
		and may i go to mass

					cauchon
		as often as you like  now please
		 for the love of god  sign

again jeanne looks about for the man but sees only the
executioner waiting to conduct her to the stake

					cauchon
		sign and youll be free from your
		chains free from the fire
		jeanne now sign

the crowd begins to chant sign sign sign  aulon who
has managed to get closer joins them

					aulon
		sign jeanne  sign

bedford is in a panic as jeanne takes the quill and makes
her mark  a wavering cross at the bottom of the
parchment  the crowd cheers aulon is ecstatic but
their voices go silent as the man once again appears from
behind cauchon

					man
		you know what you just signed
		jeanne  you just signed away my
		existence for you im a lie an
		illusion
			   jeanne is horrified
		you see  in the end you were the
		one who abandoned me

					jeanne
		no

 the man a smile of faint regret and disappears
jeanne turns to cauchon

					jeanne
		please may i have it back

					cauchon
		you have nothing to regret

she tries to grab it from cauchon but soldiers pinion
her

					jeanne
		i didnt mean it  i didnt know
		what i was signing  you tricked
		me

					cauchon
		silence her
			   soldier clamps hand
			    over her mouth
		take her away

the soldiers hustle her away as cauchon walks back to the
podium  aulon is relieved and yet strangely
apprehensive  cauchon hands the duke the document signed
by jeanne

					cauchon
		there she has recanted and we
		accept her repentance for the
		church never closes her arms to
		those who return to the fold  shes
		yours to do whatever you want with
		her but the church has nothing to
		do with it anymore  shes your
		prisoner  your martyr  not ours

bedford cant answer as the duchess is next to him


int  dungeon  rouen castle  night

jeanne is flung into a filthy dungeon  buck appears in
the doorway and flings male clothes in her face

					buck
		here in case you want to get
		dressed  try these for size

					jeanne
		he promised id be confessed and
		go to mass and be free from these
		chains

					buck
		we never promised you anything  but
		this much i can promise you that
		you wont be leaving this dungeon
		till the day you die

the guards laugh slamming and bolting the door behind
her  jeanne sinks to her knees in grief and anguish


ext  rouen castle  dawn

dawn is breaking beyond the distant castle


int  church  day

cauchon is alone lost in his thoughts  a young monk runs
in out of breath

					monk
		my lord bishop come quickly


ext  courtyard  rouen castle  day

cauchon and the monk hurry across the castle courtyard
aulon sees them pass anxious at their apparent concern


int  dungeon  rouen castle  day

cauchon arrives in jeannes dungeon out of breath  it is
full of people  bedford his aide priests and soldiers

					bedford
		ah cauchon come to see for
		yourself  well take a look

beyond them stands jeanne her back to us dressed as a
man

					bedford
		you see  dressed as a man again
		her touching repentance didnt last
		very long did it  the bishop of
		senlis was passing by and was on
		hand to witness her very evident
		relapse

					cauchon
		and by what miracle did these
		clothes find their way in here

					bedford
		not a miracle my dear cauchon an
		evil spell  this girl is a witch
		and tomorrow she will burn for it
			   to buck
		have the stake prepared in the
		market place

jeanne doesnt say a word  she stands with her back to
us gazing up at the dim crack of light bleeding in
through the high windowslit  bedford exits with the
others leaving cauchon alone with jeanne

					cauchon
		i dont understand jeanne why
		did you do it  why

					jeanne
		and you  why did you lie  you
		promised i could be confessed

					cauchon
		i know jeanne it was the only
		way to save you from the fire

					jeanne
		its not my body i want to save
		its my soul

jeanne turns round and we see that she is strangely calm
as though a great weight had been lifted from her  she
kneels before cauchon

					jeanne
		i ask only one thing to hear me
		in confession

					cauchon
		i  i cant jeanne i cant hear
		your confession im sorry

he hurries out of the cell  a guard locks the door behind
him and jeanne is alone  but not for long  the man
materializes and sits next to her

					man
		do you really want to confess
		jeanne
			   jeanne nods
		im listening

he turns his back as the priest did in the confessional

					jeanne
		i have committed sins my lord  so
		many sins  as a child the only way
		i could help my people was to pray
		so i prayed to god and his saints
		i prayed more and more and gave god
		all my love but isnt it said
		that god helps them who help
		themselves  so i helped myself
		and i saw signs the ones i wanted
		to see  and i fought out of
		revenge and despair  yes i was
		proud  stubborn  selfish  and
		cruel i was all the things that
		humans believe they are allowed to
		be when theyre fighting for a
		cause

the man smiles a little satisfied sigh

					man
		you think you are ready now

					jeanne
		yes my lord

					man
		lets see

as he disappears she hears a noise turns round and
sees a guard in the doorway

a beat then the guard topples forward to the floor blood
oozing from his mouth  behind him stands a priest  he
pulls a sword from the guards body then throws back his
hood  it is aulon  he runs to jeanne and takes her in
his arms   

					aulon
		jeanne thank god

he quickly sets about removing her chains from her
ankle

					aulon
		we must hurry  i took care of the
		guard but others are coming

jeanne gently caresses his hand

					jeanne
		i am ready now

					aulon
		just give me a moment and then
		youll be free

					jeanne
		im already free

					aulon
			   preoccupied
		yes yes any moment youre
		always so impatient

jeanne puts her hand on his to stop him wasting his time

					jeanne
		my gentle captain im staying

					aulon
		i  i dont understand

					jeanne
		one day you will

					aulon
		you dont know what youre saying
		youre going to leave this place
		jeanne  youre going home  or
		whatever you want  youre going to
		be happy and have children and

she caresses his face with both hands smiling at him
gently  aulon continues to talk but his eyes are
beginning to brim with tears he knows its useless
that jeanne has made her decision

					aulon
		 and maybe the king will give you
		some money and a little land and a
		title even
			   smiling through his
			    tears
		 wouldnt that be a fine thing
		you a lady of title

					jeanne
		im staying jean

					aulon
		no you must come jeanne  we need
		you  so much has happened since
		you left i have a new horse now
		a white one just like yours and
		la hire hardly swears at all
		anymore
			   crying
		you cant stay  theyll burn you

					jeanne
		im not afraid of the fire anymore
		it will purify me

					aulon
		jeanne you cant leave us like
		this

jeanne smiles at him

					jeanne
		i am at peace now my gentle
		friend at peace with myself

she speaks gently but with resolution  there is no going
back and aulon knows it  he hears the distant sound of
soldiers approaching

aulon takes jeannes face in his hands and kisses her on
the lips  a full kiss the only one and the last one one
which jeanne neither encourages nor resists

					jeanne
		you must go

she says it gently but urgently  with tears welling
aulon tears himself from her sight and disappears  jeanne
is left alone strangely calm and serene  slowly she
raises her fingertips to her lips touches them
softly

the man emerges from the darkness carrying an ornate
cross on a long pole bearing an effigy of the crucified
christ

					man
		ego te absolvo in nomine patris et
		filii et spiritus sancti amen

he stands in front of her raising the cross above


ext  rouen market place  day

 jeanne who looks up to see the crucifix rising
against a clear blue sky now held aloft by a priest  she
is bound to the stake her head shaved  at the base of
the pyre the executioner sprinkles the faggots with
oil

					executioner
		dont worry its going to be
		fast i used plenty of dry wood so
		therell be lots of smoke but
		dont forget to breath fast and
		youll be dizzy before the flames
		even get to you

a great crowd has assembled in the market place  on a
podium is the duke of bedford trying to remain impassive
beside him the duchess can barely contain her emotions
further along stands cauchon his eyes lowered not
wanting to see

still disguised as a monk aulon stands close to the pyre
tormented and torn between revenge and despair

bedford makes a sign to the executioner who then takes a
torch and sets fire to the brushwood  flames erupt and
jeannes breathing quickens  as thick smoke rises the
priest begins to cough his eyes water and he can no
longer hold up the cross to jeannes sight  she begins to
panic her eyes wildly searching

					jeanne
		 the cross show me the
		cross please

the priest struggles to hold it up but the choking smoke
drives him back

					jeanne
		where where are you

jeanne is filled with panic the priest is bent double
with coughing and can get no closer

					jeanne
		 please the cross

suddenly aulon rushes forward grabs the cross from the
priest and boldly defies the smoke and flames risking his
life as he holds it high for jeanne

finally the cross is visible to her rising above the
flames into a clear blue sky  her anxiety melts her eyes
fill with tears of hope as she gazes up at the cross

as her eyes close the image of the cross becomes engulfed
with flames until the smoke finally fills the screen
plunging it into darkness

								    cut to black
