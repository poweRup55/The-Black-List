               the african continent a golden papyrus map of ancient egypt 
               rises up we push in on it towards a city along the nile 
               its name written in hierarchic we keep pushing in until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves

                         risk life itself

               and we realize that the narrator is actually imhotep himself 
               on the otherside of the curtains the bald priests rush 
               over and close the doors but just as they do the doors 
               suddenly burst open pharaoh angrily strides in looks at 
               the priests the following dialogue is in ancient egyptian

               behind him ancksunamun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back

               pharaoh screams imhotep raises pharaohs sword the hideous 
               bald priests slam the doors and bolt them tight through the 
               curtains they see the shadows of ancksunamun and imhotep

                         pharaohs bodyguards

               imhotep tries to break free but ancksunamun rips pharaohs 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony

                                     ancksunamun
                         you must go save yourself only you 
                         can resurrect me

               imhoteps face fills with despair the doors explode open

               men with bluetinted skin and strange puzzletattoos over 
               their bodies stride in armed to the teeth these are the 
               mumia the priests hustle imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the mumia rip through the curtains

               ancksunamun points at pharaoh and hisses 

                                     ancksunamun
                         my body is no longer his temple

               she plunges the sword into her own heart out on the balcony 
               imhoteps mouth opens into a horrible silent scream

                                     narratorimhotep
                         for murdering pharaoh ancksunamuns 
                         body was to be cursed and it was i 
                         the high priest whose duty it was 
                         to curse it

               ext sand dunes  night

               imhotep leadsa torchlit procession across the dunes anck
               sunamuns mummy is carried by nubian slaves they put her 
               down in the sand along with five jewel encrusted jars

                                     imhotep
                         her body was mummified her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars

               imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of 
               pure gold this is the book of the living

                                     imhotep
                         the book of the living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld

               strange light suddenly flashes across the faces of the slaves 
               and the egyptian soldiers suddenly everyones fearfilled 
               eyes all rise as if watching ancksunamuns body rising

               then one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind 
               and its over ancksunamuns body now lies twisted on the 
               ground

               imhoteps priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus

               the nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand 
               imhotep then signals to the soldiers who throw their spears 
               at the nubians killing them

                                     imhotep
                         the slaves were killed

               imhoteps knifewielding priests attack the now unarmed 
               soldiers hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               imhotep and the mumia solemnly watches

                                     imhotep
                         and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site

               the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one the 
               priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto ancksunamuns 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands

               ext sahara desert  night

               chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the 
               way a hearse carries ancksunamuns mummy the map of 
               ancient egypt fades up the chariots race across the map

                                     imhotep
                         but there was another book the book 
                         of the dead which was never to be 
                         opened never to be read for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing

               the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic 
               they race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates

               superimposed across the screen are the words

                              hamunaptra  city of the dead

                                     imhotep
                         it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
                         the dead inside the statue of anubis 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace egypt

               ext hamunaptra  anubis site  night

               imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment 
               inside the giant statue of anubis he opens the chest and 
               lifts out the book of the dead made of black stone

                                     imhotep
                         but for my love of ancksunamun i 
                         was willing to defy the gods

               int underground necropolis  night

               big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large scary underground cemetery

               a detritus moat surrounds the cemetery  muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains skulls bob in the goop the 
               priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures

               in the middle of the circle is a strange twisted altar

               imhotep has unwrapped ancksunamuns gorgeous lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her

                                     imhotep
                         ancksunamuns vital organs were 
                         still fresh so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made

               as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large 
               swirling hole starts to open in the detritus bog several 
               priests look over at it frightened then quickly look back 
               down and resume chanting a strange mist wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through them 
               and into ancksunamuns body one of the jars shudders the 
               heart inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling 
               hole wafting mist beating heart and imhoteps readings are 
               reaching a crescendo ancksunamuns eyes suddenly fly open

                                     imhotep
                         ancksunamun soul had come back 
                         from the dead now all that was 
                         needed was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body

               imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above ancksunamuns 
               breast about to plunge it down the chanting swirling and 
               beating heart climax and thats when the mumia burst in and 
               storm through the startled priests the head mumia smashes 
               the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks 
               back out of ancksunamuns body and implodes back into the 
               swirling hole

               ancksunamuns eyes close dying once again imhotep screams 
               in rage the mumia grab him and his priests

                                     imhotep
                         my priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive

               int embalming chamber necropolis revamp  night

               inside a torchlit chamber imhotep is held by anubisheaded 
               embalmers he cringes at the flickering impressionistic 
               glimpses of his priests being embalmed and mummified alive

               the horridlooking embalmers using knives needles and 
               thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
               priests who are going insane from the procedure

               a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals

               a priests head is wedged between two strong boards his 
               eyes widen in terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose

               but just before he does we quickly cut to imhoteps face 
               horrified as off camera the priest screams

               we go wide on the chamber all twentyone of imhoteps priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees

               his arms are held back his mouth is pried open

                                     imhotep
                         as for me i was condemned to endure 
                         the homdai the worst of all ancient 
                         curses one so horrible it had never 
                         before been bestowed

               using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls imhoteps 
               tongue out of his mouth then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it we go tight on imhoteps eyes as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out the embalmer flings imhoteps tongue 
               onto the floor the mumias dogs attack and quickly eat it

               imhotep is wrapped alive only his mouth nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to imhoteps wrappings as he squirms

               hes then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone sarcophagus

               an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin

               imhoteps wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the 
               bucket over imhoteps chest dozens of scarabs disgusting 
               dung beetles they scurry across imhoteps screaming face

               some vanish into his tongueless mouth and up his nostrils

                                     imhotep
                         by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever and 
                         by eating me they were cursed just 
                         the same

               the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
               foursided key the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight

               the heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud whoosh seals itself airtight once again the head mumia 
               uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid tight

                                     imhotep
                         i was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus the undead for all of 
                         eternity

               the blueskinned strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key  turning it into a little puzzle 
               box

                                     imhotep
                         they would never allow me to be 
                         released for i would arise a walking 
                         disease a plague upon mankind an 
                         unholy flesheater with the strength 
                         of ages power over the sands and 
                         the glory of invincibility

               imhoteps sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the 
               disgusting muck splashes up drools down its sides and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into its seams vanishing clean

               looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of anubis 
               the jackalheaded god of death it stares at us then begins 
               to decay before our very eyes aging 4159 years in only 
               seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit half
               buried statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert

               horde of warriors the sound of charging horses is deafening

               oconnell gives beni a big cheesy smile

                                     oconnell
                         i was just looking for a good time

               and thats when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly 
               panics cuts and runs oconnell instantly stiffens

                                     oconnell

               gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde 
               hoofs pounding the sand several more legionnaires take off

                                     oconnell
                         steady

               screams more legionnaires haulass beni is one of them

                                     oconnell
                         steady
                              to himself
                         what the hell am i doin

               the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim oconnell steels 
               himself cocks and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps he spits it into the sand another beat and then 

                                     oconnell
                         fire

               the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with 
               a crash the blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts the prone legionnaires quickly begin to reload

                                     oconnell
                         fire

               the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand

               the remaining warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the 
               hot air a third of the legionnaires are killed instantly

                                     oconnell
                         fire

               the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the legionnaires

               oconnell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts clubbing 
               riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed

               beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand 
               whimpering in full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him he crawls through the front gate

               oconnell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he 
               crossdraws gun in each hand starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts

               beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway 
               amongst the rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him oconnells guns go empty

                                     oconnell
                         sonofabitch

               he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate

               four tuareg warriors on massive arabians haulass after him

               oconnell hurdles a stone column hits the ground running

               he spots beni inside the temple doorway trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door

                                     oconnell
                         hey beni wait up

               beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder

                                     oconnell
                         what are ya doing wait up

               oconnell runs faster beni pushes harder the four horsemen 
               leap the big column and charge after him hoofs pounding

                                     oconnell
                         dont you close that door dont you 
                         close that door

               beni closes the door just as oconnell reaches it oconnell 
               slams his body into the door it doesnt budge

                                     oconnell
                         im gonna get you for this

               he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his 
               life weaving through the ruins the arabians getting closer 
               and closer the pounding hoofs getting louder and louder

               oconnell finally spins around and faces his attackers the 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him the 
               vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off

               oconnell just stands there exhausted and beaten then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird

               and thats when the horses go apeshit all four of them 
               rear up two of the riders are thrown to the ground the 
               horses screech and bellow and snort in fear then buck like 
               fury and haulass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts

               oconnell just stands there stunned then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger and then he feels the 
               evil himself and turns around  the shattered decrepit 
               statue of anubis stares back at him

               suddenly the sand begins to shift under oconnells feet

               he starts to back away keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it forming lines and shapes  drawing a picture

               oconnell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins the 
               sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the 
               sand is a picture of imhoteps screaming face

               ext ridge  day

               up on a ridge a group of riders watch oconnell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city oconnell feels their presence 
               and looks up very different from the tuaregs they have 
               blue tinted skin and faces covered in strange puzzletattoos

               the mumia still watching imhoteps grave after all this 
               time

               the mumia leader is a huge fierce man in black robes with 
               dual scimitars across his waist his face is both handsome 
               and horrible blue and tattooed meet ardeth ray his dark 
               eyes watch oconnell stagger off into the open desert

               int cairo museum of antiquities  day

               deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves filled with literature on the 
               antiquities standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves 
               is a rather uninteresting british girl eyeglasses hairin

               her

               evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows 
               the dust off it then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter o then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title

                                     evelyn
                         tuthmosis now how did you get up 
                         here

               carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her where all the titles 
               begin with the letter t then she looks down its a long 
               way to the bottom evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the tuthmosis book its a little too 
               far so she stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips shes almost got it closer now closer

               and thats when the ladder pulls away from the shelf evelyn 
               yelps flings the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder which stands straight up evelyn holds her breath 
               swaying precariously a long beat and then she loses her 
               balance the ladder swings around and evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle

                                     evelyn

               the ladder crosses the aisle does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came evelyn clings to the top struggling 
               for balance the ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed evelyn screams as it does a 180 spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily

               and thats when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes 
               into the next bookshelf

               evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor she 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicksin each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next and onward it goes bookshelf after 
               bookshelf thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor it finally ends as the last 
               shelf crashes into a wall evelyns eyes are closed she 
               opens one eye looks left then right then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess

                                     evelyn

                         mess

               the curator storms out evelyn just stands there steaming

               and then she hears a noise and quickly turns around a beat

                                     evelyn
                         hello

               quiet eerie and then she hears it again like feet slowly 
               shuffling across the floor coming from a nearby gallery

                                     evelyn
                         abdul mohammed bob

               evelyn walks through the stacks and enters 

               int the ramesseum

               filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom 
               its very dark and quiet in here the only light is from 
               flickering torches at either end of the spooky gallery

               the noise again from the far side of the room feet slowly 
               shuffling plodding across the floor evelyn grabs a torch

               looks around at a statue of anubis another of horus they 
               stare down at evelyn who is starting to get scared now she 
               walks down the aisle past a closed sarcophagus past cases 
               of ancient artifacts past another sarcophagus  only this 
               one is open evelyn freezes swallows hard nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch and peers inside

                a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her

               evelyn screams drops the torch and backs away scared out 
               of her wits and then coming from inside the sarcophagus 
               she hears a man laughing her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the mummy laughing his ass off half 
               drunk

                                     evelyn

               evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummys mouth

               he grins drunkenly evelyn punches him hard in the chest

                                     evelyn

                                     jonathan

                         my career is on a high note

               he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb

                                     evelyn
                         high note ha for five years youve 
                         been scrounging around egypt and 
                         what have you to show for it nothing

               jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket

                                     jonathan
                         oh yes i do i have something right

                         jonathan if i bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the curator to try and 
                         sell for you

               jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key 
               to imhoteps sarcophagus and coffin evelyn is instantly 
               curious she grabs the box out of his hand

                                     evelyn
                         where did you get this

               jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile

                                     jonathan
                         on a dig down in thebes

               evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it

               jonathan licks his lips in anticipation

                                     jonathan
                         my whole life ive never found 
                         anything evy tell me ive found 
                         something

               evelyns fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box shifting them this way and that way its like a puzzle 
               box then suddenly it unfolds itself almostmechanically 
               turning itself into the key sitting inside the open keybox 
               is a folded piece of golden papyrus an ancient map

                                     evelyn
                         jonathan

               int curators office  day

               the curator sits at his desk staring through a jewelers 
               eyepiece at the keybox evelyn hovers behind him excited

                                     evelyn

               jonathan leans in from across the desk

                                     jonathan

                         kingdom said to be the wealthiest 
                         pharaoh of them all

                                     jonathan

                         this fellow like him very much

               the curator picks up the map its actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie

                                     evelyn
                         ive already dated it this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old and 
                         the hieratics over here
                              inhales deeply
                         its hamunaptra

               the curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he recovers

                                     curator
                         my dear girl dont be ridiculous 
                         we are scholars not treasure hunters

                                     jonathan
                         are we talking about the hamunaptra

                                     evelyn
                         yes the city of the dead where the 
                         early pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of egypt

                                     jonathan
                         right right in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber everybody knows 
                         the story the entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand on 
                         pharaohs command a flick of the 
                         switch and the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes

                                     evelyn
                         all we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2134 
                         bc

               the curator holds the map closer to the burning candlelamp

                                     curator
                         as the americans would say its all 
                         fairy tales and hokum

               the map accidentally catches on fire the curator throws 
               it to the floor jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out lifts it up the left third of the map is now 
               missing

                                     jonathan
                         you burned it you burned off the 
                         part with the lost city

                                     curator
                         its for the best im sure many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of hamunaptra no 
                         one has ever found it most have 
                         never returned

                                     jonathan
                              devastated

                         surprised at you miss carnarvon to

               the curator reaches for the keybox evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry suspicious look

               onto a balcony above the gallows the prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her like jackals staring at fresh

               he finds his wallet and relaxes directly above him on the 
               bow of the barge burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni

                                     burns
                         youre sure hamunaptra is out there

                                     beni
                         along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison sahib

               and thats when beni spots oconnell beni shakes his head 
               as if seeing a mirage then starts backing away from the 
               men

                                     beni
                         a thousand pardons my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done

               beni quickly scurries off vanishing down into the hold

               back down with evelyn recovering she clears her throat

                                     evelyn
                         mister oconnell can you look me in 
                         the eye and guarantee me this is

                         if it is im warning you 

               oconnell steps up close to evelyn invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye evelyn doesnt back away

                                     oconnell
                         all i can tell you miss is that my 
                         colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much that without 
                         orders we marched halfway across 
                         libya and into egypt to find that 
                         city like i told ya all i saw was 
                         sand everybody else was wiped out 
                         by tuareg warriors ill take your 
                         bags

               oconnell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on

               evelyns eyes follow him a bit wistfully jonathan sees it

                                     jonathan
                         yes yes youre right filthy rude 
                         a complete scoundrel nothing to 
                         like there at all

               evelyn gives him a look jonathan just grins and thats 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past tipping his raggedy 
               hat

                                     warden

               and up the plank he goes evelyn and jonathan share a look

               we go wide again as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               nile we tilt up to the sun which then dissolves into

                                     oconnell

               oconnell reaches into the gunnysack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite

                                     evelyn

                                     evelyn

                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there

                         a lifes pursuit

                                     oconnell
                         and the fact that they say its made 
                         out of pure gold makes no nevermind 
                         to you right

                         you know your history

                                     oconnell
                         i know my treasure

               evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
               back to oconnell and as matteroffact as possible says

                                     evelyn
                         by the way why did you kiss me

               oconnell cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders

                                     oconnell
                         i was about to be hanged seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time

               evelyns eyes widen furious she turns and storms off

               oconnell looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed

                                     oconnell
                         what whad i say

               then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
               reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up its beni

                                     beni

               oconnell sticks a knife under benis throat beni swallows 
               hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin

                                     beni
                         you never were any good with the

                                     beni

                                     beni

               they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
               horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
               backs away oconnell grins as evelyn flees down the deck

                                     oconnell
                         the girl saved my life figured it

                         you always did have more balls than 
                         brains

               oconnells eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni

                                     oconnell
                         lets make us even shall we

               oconnell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge

               beni splashes into the river oconnell takes his gunnysack 
               and starts walking off down the deck

                                     beni os

                                     oconnell
                         sounds familiar

               and thats when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck

               oconnell quickly looks around immediately on the alert

               int evelyns cabin  night

               evelyn wearing a nightgown stands in front of a mirror

               she gives her head a good shake letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders then she turns around right there 
               is one of the hideous mumia its hook he slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook ready to strike

                                     hook
                         where is the map

               evelyns terrified eyes glance down hook looks over sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table

                                     hook
                         and the key where is the key

               evelyns eyes look confused she shakes her head hook grins

                         then ill find it myself

               he cocks his hook about to kill her and thats when the 
               door is kicked open oconnell bursts in gun in each hand

               hook spins evelyn around and holds her out in front of him

               oconnell looks at her

                                     oconnell
                         friend of yours

               evelyns eyes widen and thats when the candle on the table 
               flickers everything happens at once read fast oconnell 
               spins around just as a window bursts open a mumia leans in

               head he returns fire kills the mumia the mumia falls back

               splashes across the wall bursts into flames evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and jams it back over her shoulder 
               right into hooks eye he screeches in pain and lets her go

               oconnell grabs her and yanks her out of the flaming room

               hallway  night

               oconnell pulls evelyn down the hall she tries to jerk free

                                     evelyn

               bends over to have a look his ass hits something he yelps 
               and backs away its the decrepit face of anubis

                                     jonathan

                                     evelyn
                         according to bembridge scholars 
                         inside the statue of anubis was a 
                         secret compartment perhaps containing 
                         the book of the living

                                     oconnell
                         what are those mirrors for

                                     evelyn
                         ancient egyptian trick youll see

               oconnell shrugs then rappels down into the crevice

               int embalmers chamber  day

               oconnell waves a torch as jonathan evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him evelyn peers into the spooky darkness

                                     evelyn
                         do you realize we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years

                                     warden
                         who cares i dont see no treasure

                                     oconnell
                         youre welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs

                                     jonathan
                         and it stinks to high heaven in here

               evelyn just rolls her eyes

                                     evelyn
                         cretins

               jonathan sniffs the foul air then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from he stops 
               sniffing

               evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall 
               then repositions it on its pedestal aiming it at a ray of 
               light shining in from the outer mirrors  the ray of light 
               hits the disk and quickly shoots around the room from one 
               disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up light 
               rays shoot off down the passageways its the embalmers 
               chamber

                                     oconnell
                         that is a neat trick

                                     evelyn
                         oh my god its a preparation room

                                     oconnell
                         preparation for what

                                     evelyn
                         for entering the afterlife

               oconnell quickly draws his gun jonathan gently nudges him

                                     jonathan
                         mummies my good son this is where 
                         they made the mummies

               evelyn heads down a narrow passageway the others follow

               int labyrinth  day

               oconnell evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow cobweb infested labyrinth the short squat 
               warden can stand straight up then they hear something and 
               freeze it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls

               they share looks then slowly move forward getting darker 
               and darker as they go the strange sound getting louder and 
               louder and then it stops evelyn holds her breath jonathan 
               licks his lips oconnell cocks his pistol the warden farts

               oconnell jonathan and evelyn glare at him

               anubis chamber  day

               they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous halfburied statue the lower half of anubis

               then they hear the sound again coming closer now from the 
               other side of the statue and closer oconnell pulls evelyn 
               behind him and closer oconnell raises his gun and closer

               oconnell leaps out  three horrible sweaty faces lunge at 
               him oconnell reacts but doesnt pull the trigger because 
               its just the americans their guns are up cocked and aimed

                                     henderson
                         ya scared the bejeezus out of us 
                         oconnell

                                     oconnell
                         likewise

               but nobody lowers their guns daniels grins the tough one

                                     daniels
                         this here is our statue friend

                                     oconnell
                         dont see your name on it pal

               and thats when beni five diggers and the egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows  all holding guns aimed at oconnell

                                     beni
                         ten to one oconnell your odds are 
                         nosogood

                                     oconnell
                         ive had worse

               jonathan clenches a tiny derringer

                                     jonathan
                         yes me too

               oconnell gives him a sideways glance beni cocks his gun 
               grinning he wants it to happen the tension thickens then 
               evelyn gently takes oconnells gun hand and pulls it down

                                     evelyn
                         lets be nice children if were 
                         going to play together we must learn 
                         to share

               evelyn pulls oconnell away jonathan and the warden follow

               beni and the americans slowly lower their guns laughing

               the egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs

               int imhoteps chamber  day

               oconnell and jonathan are using sledgehammers against the 
               ceiling evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel

                                     evelyn
                         according to my calculations we 
                         should be right under the statue 
                         well come up right between his legs
                              she blushes and laughs

                                     jonathan
                         and when those dirty yanks go to 
                         sleep 
                              looks at oconnell
                         no offense

                                     oconnell
                         none taken

                                     jonathan
                         well sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them

                                     oconnell
                         and youre sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment

                                     evelyn
                         yes if their egyptologist hasnt 
                         already found it

               jonathan looks around

                                     jonathan
                         i say whats our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to

               int scarab chamber  day

               the warden crawls into a dark chamber and lights a torch

               a mural wall comes alive embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst scarabs glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles awestruck the warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs

               int anubis chamber  day

               beni and the americans hover around the egyptologist whos 
               found the secret compartment inside anubis the egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam  the egyptologist quickly stops him

                                     egyptologist
                         seti was no fool

               henderson sees the intense look in the egyptologists eyes

                                     henderson
                         yeah sure

               he looks back at the native diggers

                                     henderson
                         well let him open it

               the egyptologist nods then yells in egyptian at the diggers

               the diggers hesitate filled with fear daniels pulls out 
               his gun aims it at three of the diggers the three diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams the other diggers back away scared shitless

               beni and the americans exchange looks and then they back 
               away as well

               int imhoteps chamber  day

               three heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     oconnell
                         lemme get this straight they stuck 
                         a sharp red hot poker up your nose 
                         cut your brain into small pieces 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils

                                     jonathan
                         owch thats really got to hurt

                                     evelyn
                         its called mummification youre 
                         dead when they do this

                                     jonathan
                         still

                                     oconnell
                         yeah thatd bring you back to life

                                     evelyn
                         you two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys

               and thats when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly gives out

               oconnell grabs evelyn and jerks her clear jonathan dives 
               for the far wall a massive stone casement drops out of the 
               ceiling and crashes to the floor dust flies fills the room

               int anubis chamber

               having heard the crash beni and the americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor the egyptologist could care less 
               he looks at the diggers gripping their crowbars and yells 

                                     egyptologist
                         feni

               the three diggers pull hard the ancient seams start to give 
               the egyptologist yells again the diggers pull harder the 
               compartment starts to loosen again he yells the diggers 
               give one final pull and 

                an intense burst of liquid sprays out of the seam hits 
               the three diggers melts their skin clean off they scream

               dying horribly half skeletal by the time they hit the 
               ground

               int imhoteps chamber  day

               the dust is starting to clear oconnell evelyn and jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement

               we immediately recognize it as imhoteps sarcophagus

                                     evelyn
                         oh my god it looks like it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus

                                     oconnell
                         why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling

                                     evelyn
                         they didnt they buried him at the 
                         foot of anubis he was either someone 
                         of great importance or he did 
                         something very naughty

               int scarab chamber  day

               the warden drops an amethystscarab into his pouch then 
               greedily starts prying away at another it rips off he drops 
               it into his pouch  only he misses and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing

               close on the scarab on the floor it begins to transform

               the amethyst starts to glow something inside starts to 
               wiggle as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon

               then it splits open and a real live hideous scarab beetle 
               scurries out it races over to the wardens shoe quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside

               the wardens eyes fly open he starts to scream drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large hideous lump burrowing under his skin it burrows 
               its way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest the 
               warden claws and scratches at it trying to stop it the 
               lump burrows up his neck the warden starts gagging and 
               coughing

               and then the scarablump vanishes into his head

               int imhoteps chamber  day

               our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus 
               revealing a single ominous hieroglyph evelyn stares at it 
               jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid

                                     jonathan
                         well who is it

               evelyn stares at the hieroglyph confused and concerned

                                     evelyn
                         he that shall not be named

               oconnell dusts off the huge lock

                                     oconnell
                         theres some sort of lock here you 
                         say these things are made of granite

                                     evelyn
                         quarried granite with a cobalt lining

                                     jonathan

               evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on jonathans back

                                     evelyn
                         the man on the barge the one with 
                         the hook he was looking for a key

               evelyn pulls out the keybox jonathan tries to take it back

                                     jonathan
                         hey thats mine

               evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box  its 
               now shaped exactly like the locks keyhole evelyn smiles

               and thats when they hear the wardens screams echoing through 
               the labyrinth all three of them turn and takeoff running

               int labyrinth  day

               the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head

               oconnell evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden 
               starts ripping his own hair out of his head oconnell and 
               jonathan grab at the wardens hands but hes far too crazed 
               he shoves them aside runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and slams his head straight into a rock wall the 
               warden drops to the ground dead as lead eyes wide open

               oconnell evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring 
               breathing hard wideeyed themselves

               ext base camp  night

               evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire

                                     evelyn

               oconnell comes up over some rocks

                                     oconnell
                         seems the americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today 
                         three of their diggers were killed

                                     evelyn

                         some sort of ancient boobytrap

                                     jonathan
                         maybe this place really is cursed

               a gust of wind blows through the camp

               the campfire flickers oconnell and jonathan share a nervous 
               look evelyn laughs

                                     evelyn

                         can touch it then its real thats

               oconnell cocks his rifle kachank gives her a big grin

                                     oconnell

               jonathan opens the wardens pouch the one that held the 
               scarabs he reaches in starts scrounging around we slowly 
               push in waiting for the attack the music builds and then 
               jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the 
               pouch oconnell and evelyn both jump

                                     oconnellevelyn
                         what what is it

               jonathan sucks his finger then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a liquor bottle the top has been chipped off

                                     jonathan
                         seagrams

               jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it nothing but sand is inside it

                                     jonathan
                         well he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow but he had good taste

               jonathan takes a swig oconnell and evelyn laugh guiltily 
               and then oconnell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand evelyn and jonathan watch him a beat and then 
               a barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp

               oconnell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn

                                     oconnell
                         stay here

               he takes off running through the ruins evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him jonathan grabs a gun holds the 
               bottle of seagrams tight and dashes after her

                                     jonathan

               oconnell races through the ruins and slams right into beni 
               who is obviously trying to hightailit out of there

                                     oconnell

                         wanted to be with my friend

               oconnell drags him back towards the american camp

                                     oconnell

                         cause i look good doin it

               ardeth ray gallops through the camp cutting diggers down 
               with his scimitar oconnell runs up on top of some rocks 
               leaps out and tackles him off his horse the two men slam to 
               the ground oconnell spins up onto one knee and fires point 
               blank blows the scimitar out of ardeth rays hand oconnell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them

               a scimitar swoops down almost takes oconnells head off 
               misses him by an inch oconnell leaps up and blows the rider 
               off his mount the horse bolts  but ardeth ray is gone

               evelyn hides behind some rocks watching the scene suddenly 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around

               a vicious tattooed mumia rider races at her evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks terrified the mumia rider raises 
               his scimitar about to strike

               evelyn screams trips over a rock and fires the elephant 
               gun  blam blows the rider off his mount and catapults 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins

               at the same time the kick blows evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge she flails through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune

               jonathan and some diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door four riders come charging right at them

               jonathan takes a swig off the seagrams

                                     jonathan
                         let em have it boys

               jonathan and the diggers open fire when the smoke clears 
               the riders are either dead or gone jonathan grins

                                     jonathan
                         i say bloody good show

               and then several more mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them jonathan and the remaining diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in handtohand combat

               oconnell is quickly loading his pistol he hears something 
               thundering up behind him he spins around just as ardeth ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar oconnell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face the scimitar strikes

               hits his gun  ching oconnells gun flips away disarmed 
               oconnell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand he shoves the fuse into a fire it 
               ignites he faces ardeth ray towering above him the two 
               men lock eyes the fuse continues to burn down ardeth ray 
               points his scimitar at oconnells head

                                     ardeth ray
                         leave this place leave this place 
                         or die

               ardeth ray gallops off the remaining mumia riders race after 
               him vanishing into the night oconnell watches them leave 
               then turns to the burning fuse and blows it out evelyn 
               staggers up looking very shaken oconnell gently takes her 
               and holds her close

                                     oconnell
                         you alright

               evelyn looks up into his strong eyes its the first time 
               hes shown genuine concern for her and she likes it hes 
               also holding her a little too close and she likes that too

                                     evelyn
                         yes fine thank you

               beni crawls out from under some pillars as henderson and 
               burns help daniels to his feet

                         treasure down there

               oconnell looks up into the surrounding ridges unsatisfied

                                     oconnell
                         these men are a desert people they 
                         value water not gold

               evelyn looks at oconnell suddenly very worried

                                     evelyn

               jonathan falls into frame hits the ground eyes wide open

               mouth agape clearly dead a beat and then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile shitfaced drunk

               oconnell and evelyn laugh both halfinthebag themselves 
               the bottle of seagrams is almost gone oconnell offers the 
               bottle to evelyn she waves it away slurring badly

                         best time you ever had

               oconnell gives her a big cheesy smile evelyns face drops 
               appalled and embarrassed and thats when the lid falls off 
               and loudly crashes to the ground all three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and moan

               int anubis chamber  day

               several fearfilled sweatyfaced diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment henderson and burns hold guns on them

               daniels has his arm in a sling the diggers slowly pull out 
               the ornate chest they set the chest down on the sandy floor

               beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics

                                     egyptologist
                         there is a curse upon this chest

                                     daniels
                         curse my ass

                                     henderson
                         yeah who cares

               the egyptologist gives them the evileye

                                     egyptologist
                         in these hallowed grounds that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times is 
                         as strong today as it was then

                                     henderson
                         yeah yeah okay whats it 

               the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription

                                     egyptologist
                         death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest

               a gust of wind blows through the chamber torches flicker 
               all the diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming

               the americans look at each other suddenly very nervous

                                     egyptologist
                         it says there is one the undead 
                         who if brought back to life is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse

                                     henderson
                         yeah well lets just make sure we 
                         dont bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then huh

               the three americans laugh

                                     egyptologist
                         he will kill all who open this 
                         chest and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids

                                     daniels

                                     egyptologist
                         and in so doing he will regenerate 
                         and no longer be the undead but a 
                         plague upon this earth

               the wind whistles torches flicker very spooky beni and 
               the egyptologist share a fearfilled look henderson just 
               shrugs

                                     henderson

               beni starts backing away filled with fear sweating buckets

                         and look at this

               oconnell points at the inside of the coffin lid where there 
               are fingernail scratches and dried blood all over the inside

                                     evelyn

                         and he left a message

               we push in on a grouping of hieratics written in blood

                                     evelyn
                         it says death is only the 
                         beginning

               jonathan shivers oconnell looks around

               at the chest the egyptologist slowly steps up reaches 
               inside and lifts out a heavy burlap bag everyones eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black book of the dead the same book 
               imhotep used in his attempt to bring ancksunamun back to 
               life

                                     egyptologist

               pile of big dusty bug skeletons onto the ground

                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse or in this case

               she shrugs then looks at the roasting meat

                         when they planted him

                                     oconnell

                         all ancient egyptian curses one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers in all of my research 
                         ive never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed

                         yes they never used it because they 
                         feared it so its written that if 
                         a victim of the homdai should ever 
                         arise he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of egypt

                                     oconnell

               the book of the dead laying loose under the other evelyn 
               stares at the book nervously biting her lip then she sneaks 
               over carefully steals it and quickly tiptoes away

               lying on some blankets by the campfire oconnell rolls over 
               and sees evelyn sitting wideeyed staring at the book

               chamber and slowly push in on his sarcophagus we push in 
               over the lip of the coffin then closer and closer towards 
               imhoteps rotten twisted head until his putrid face fills 
               frame  and then suddenly his crusty eyelids pop open

               his prey the sand around him swirls and dances burns starts 
               to crawl away whimpering as he goes imhotep suddenly stops 
               and unhinges his skeletal jaw his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size and he lets out a horrific primordial 
               shriek

               away and opens fire six gunshots perforate imhotep but 
               have no effect except to splatter molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall beni retreats into a corner scared shitless

               imhotep moves forward his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side beni drops his gun and grabs at the chains around his 
               neck religious symbols and icons dangle from each chain

               beni holds the first one up a christian crucifix he quickly 
               makes the sign ofthe cross and blesses himself in english

                                     beni
                         may the good lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock and may satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever

               it has no effect on imhotep who continues forward beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons holding them 
               out towards imhotep one after the other trying to slow his 
               progress an islamic sword and crescent moon necklace a 
               hindu brahma medallion a small buddhist bodhisattva statue

               all while blessing himself in arabic hindi chinese and

               benis throat tears run down benis cheeks hes so freaked

               and thats when he holds up the star of david and blesses 
               himself in hebrew imhotep stops in his tracks his hand 
               lowers his grotesque new eyeballs stare at beni

                         the language of the slaves

               looks at him quizzically imhotep takes a step back

                         rewards will be great

               imhotep reaches into his tattered robe and then holds out 
               his fetid hand filled with squirming maggots beni cringes 
               about to throw up but then the maggots part  revealing a 
               tiny pile of little jewels benis eyes widen imhotep raises 
               his other hand it holds ancksunamuns broken canopic jar

               who is running out screaming they skid to a stop as they 
               spot burns or whats left of him lying dead on the floor  
               his body is shriveled to half its size

               drained of all organs and liquids oconnell and evelyn are 
               shocked then they hear a loud moan and notice imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room oconnell draws his 
               gun

               imhotep is regenerating a thick skin forms over powerful 
               new musculature his tendons ripple his bones bulge and 
               reform his mouth opens to an inhuman size as he moans and 
               cries out in severe pain and then its over and he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular corpselike vision from hell

               the terminator mummy oconnell and evelyn are stunned

                                     oconnell
                         we are in serious trouble

               imhotep starts to move towards them staring at evelyn

                                     oconnell
                         back off creep

               imhotep keeps coming oconnell opens fire blasting imhotep 
               bullets rip through his body imhotep doesnt seem to mind

               jonathan henderson and daniels run into the room theyre 
               all stunned at the sight of imhotep

               oconnell steps forward throws a right hook punches imhotep 
               in the face  his fist goes through imhoteps skull and 
               gets stuck deep inside his head oconnell stares at it 
               shocked then quickly yanks his fist back out the area of 
               imhoteps face that came into contact with oconnells fist 
               quickly degenerates and decays right down to the bone as 
               if oconnells hand instantly infected it

               imhotep angrily turns grabs oconnell and with no effort 
               throws him across the room and into jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down imhotep looks at his hand the one that 
               just grabbed oconnell  it starts to shrivel and decay

               he quickly turns to evelyn evelyn backs away into a wall 
               terrorized imhotep steps up to her

                                     imhotep
                         you saved me from the undead for 
                         this i shall make you immortal

               he leans in about to kiss her with his decayed face

               and thats when a white cat jumps onto the piano hissing

               imhotep shrieks the balcony doors blow open imhotep spins 
               into a blast of wind and sand and swirls out the doors gone

               oconnell evelyn jonathan and daniels stand transfixed

               henderson kneels next to burns shriveled body horrified

                                     henderson

                                     oconnell
                         try me

               int ramesseum  moments later

               everyone is assembled around the tomb display of seti the 
               first

               we recognize his chariot and sword the curator sits on setis 
               throne

                                     curator
                         we are part of an ancient secret 
                         society the cultofthemumia and 
                         we have a sacred mission passed 
                         down through thirtynine generations 
                         for over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded the city of the dead we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the high priest 
                         imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world

                                     ardeth ray

                              appalled
                         and you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people

                                     curator
                         to have stopped this creature yes

                                     curator
                         according to the ancients cats are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated and 
                         then he will fear nothing

               daniels is totally wiggedout he looks at oconnell

                                     daniels
                         right and ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated by killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry thats how

                                     curator
                         yes the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years

                                     evelyn
                         ancksunamun

               the curator and ardeth ray look at evelyn thunderstruck

                                     evelyn

                         alive walking he called me anck
                         sunamun and then in mister burns 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me

                                     curator
                         it is because it was you who read 
                         from the book he has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of ancksunamun

               jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol

                                     jonathan

                                     jonathan
                         and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         egypt

                         the fort before the creature can 
                         get to him

               down in the bazaar people are screaming and quickly backing 
               away from the shriveled corpse of the egyptologist

               a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the egyptologists shriveled hand its 
               imhotep having regenerated even further he looks up and 
               catches eyes with oconnell imhotep grins then unhinges 
               his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman size and then a 
               huge swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at oconnell and jonathan they both slam the shutters

               the flies slam into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar sending people screaming and running

               egyptologists office  day for night

               oconnell and jonathan look at each other panicked

               daniels stares out a window watching the british guards at 
               the front gate more soldiers march the encircling parapet

                                     soldier
                         ten oclock all is well

               the lights and music from the casbah come up from below

               int evelyns foyer  night

               daniels turns from the window henderson sits in a chair 
               next to evelyns door chain smoking both look wired with 
               fear

                                     daniels

                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser

               daniels nods and heads out henderson just sits there alone 
               smoking he reaches into his jacket pocket pulls out his 
               sacred canopic jar and fondles it a breeze suddenly comes 
               in through the open window the curtains flutter henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it he looks out the window

               the camera races over the compound into the window and hits 
               henderson square in the face just as hes about to scream

               henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of swirling sand

               his body twists and turns and slowly shrivels as the life is 
               sucked out of him

               then he collapses to the floor on the wall above him the 
               shadow of the swirling sand condenses forming a shadow of a 
               human body the shadow convulses as the body regenerates

               and then its over

               imhotep steps into view hes regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now his face no longer decayed he steps 
               over hendersons shriveled body and up to evelyns door 
               rattles the knob its locked imhotep grins

               evelyns room  night

               evelyn is asleep in her bed as sand begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole pouring onto the floor forming a large 
               mound evelyn starts to toss and turn we pan back over to 
               the door the mound of sand is gone and in its place is 
               imhotep

               int foyer  night

               oconnell and jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see hendersons shriveled body on the floor

               oconnell runs up to evelyns door and rattles the knob 
               still locked he bends down and looks in through the keyhole

               evelyns room  night

               imhotep leans down towards evelyn about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps the door starts to crash and bang from oconnell

               imhotep ignores it and kisses evelyn his lips and mouth 
               instantly start to degenerate and decay right down to the 
               bone the door bursts open evelyn wakes up sees imhoteps 
               rotted mouth kissing her she screams and shoves him away

               imhoteps putrid mouth grimaces in sadness

                                     oconnell
                         get your hands off my girl pal

               imhoteps sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               oconnell imhotep licks his fetid lips oconnell smirks

                                     oconnell
                         nice lips

               imhotep starts to move for oconnell

                                     oconnell

                         brought a friend

               he throws the white cat at imhotep imhotep instinctively 
               catches it

               he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window  which suddenly blows open imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand

               everybody covers their eyes the imhotepsanddevil explodes 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound

               jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly

               oconnell hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust

               daniels walks in looks at hendersons shriveled body on the 
               floor and drops the martini glasses

               int 1923 convertible dussenberg  night

               jonathan races his big convertible through the streets 
               honking constantly evelyn sits between him and oconnell 
               looking scared and nervous then she gives oconnell a look

                                     evelyn

                         that guys face

               daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear

                                     daniels
                         shutup just shutup we gotta do

               they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities

               ext cairo bazaar  night

               a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling 
               with activity suddenly a breeze kicksin green mist begins 
               to swirl down the street and through the stalls the people 
               begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness  its already too late

               imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half rotted 
               off his deformed mouth grinning happily beni is at his 
               side looking very nervous

               and then onebyone the people silently begin to follow 
               imhotep their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous boils 
               and sores

               int museum of antiquities  night

               oconnell jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth ray 
               follow evelyn as she strides through the museum

                                     evelyn
                         last month i came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned the book 
                         of the dead

                                     daniels
                         that book we found at hamunaptra

                                     evelyn
                         yes i dismissed it because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead a notion i was unwilling to 
                         believe

                                     oconnell
                         believe it sister thats what 
                         brought our buddy back to life

                                     jonathan
                         and now hes going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ardeth ray
                         and if he succeeds the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse

               the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs everyone else in hot pursuit

                                     the curator
                         the plagues we have seen so far are 
                         merely imhotep flexing his muscles 
                         only at the moment of ancksunamuns 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible

               they reach the display cases evelyn quickly opens them

                                     evelyn
                         im thinking that if the black book 
                         of the dead can bring people back to 
                         life 

                                     curator
                          then perhaps the golden book of 
                         the living can return them to the 
                         underworld

                                     evelyn
                         exactly 

                                     oconnell
                         so your sayin if we find the book 
                         made outta gold 

                                     curator
                          and read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it

                                     oconnell
                         you think itll send this guy back 
                         to hell

                                     curator
                         correct and thats when 

               loud chanting is heard coming from outside they all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down  outside a large 
               crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores comes chanting 
               up the driveway ancksunamun ancksunamun

                                     ardeth ray
                         it has begun the beginning of the 
                         end

                                     evelyn
                         not quite yet it hasnt cmon

               evelyn dashes back to the display cases everyone follows

               ext museum  night

               the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are 
               locked they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while 
               chanting constantly imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway

               int museum of antiquities  upper balcony  night

               the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
               curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets

               the others watch evelyn pulls out a large piece

                                     evelyn
                         got it

               the banging gets louder multiple windows shatter evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet

                                     evelyn
                         since the black book of the dead was 
                         found inside the statue of anubis 
                         then according to this the golden 
                         book of the living should be inside

               evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles

                                     oconnell

                                     evelyn

                         which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the anubis statue

                                     oconnell

               imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible peels out oconnell points 
               a finger at beni as they race past him

                                     oconnell

               imhotep unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size he lets out one of his horrific primordial shrieks

               his diseaseridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car

               ext bazaar  night

               the convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street

               crazies start jumping out of stalls and leaping onto the 
               car oconnell and the others fight them off throwing them 
               overboard more people jump on jonathan swerves the car 
               crashes through some stalls knocking them off but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and yank daniels out he 
               tumbles across the pavement gets up shooting backs into a 
               corner firing his pistol into the hideous rabble killing 
               several keeping them at bay his gun goes empty click 
               click click but the mob stays back looking at him like 
               rabid vultures daniels eyes them filled with fear

               the mob parts like the red sea as imhotep walks through them 
               and up to daniels daniels whimpers in fear tears pour down 
               his cheeks then he gets an idea reaches into his pocket 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted sacred canopic jar he 
               holds it out for imhotep imhotep takes it and grins through 
               his tears daniels grins back hopeful that hell be spared

               we cut wide somewhere in the middle of the crazed diseased 
               mob we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream

               intext convertible  streets  night

               the convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys we 
               dolly across the hood of the car from jonathan to evelyn to 
               oconnell ardeth ray and the curator are still in the back

               all of them staring out the front windshield freakedout

               then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls crashes through the 
               windshield everybody screams jonathan hits the gas loses 
               control the car slams into a wall oconnell grabs evelyn

                         cmon cmon lets go lets go

               they all leap out of the car but the angry festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them oconnell quickly reaches into his 
               gunnysack pulls out a stick of dynamite then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match he looks around for a way 
               to light it then reaches over and strikes it across ardeth 
               rays stubbly face ardeth ray yelps oconnell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse

               the crazed chanting mob gives oconnell a wide berth staring 
               at him and the others with insane bloodshot eyes

               and then imhotep steps through  having fully regenerated 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive evelyn stares at him

                                     evelyn

               yelps and throws it down grabs another match and strikes it 
               across ardeth rays face again ardeth ray yelps and gives 
               oconnell a look to kill the curator shakes his head

                         he has consummated the curse now 
                         all he need do is raise ancksunamun 
                         from the dead then it will be the 
                         end of us and the beginning for 
                         them

               imhotep moves forward heading right for them oconnell 
               lights the fuse imhotep steps up to oconnell and stops 
               watching the fuse burn down its a game of chicken the 
               tension mounts the lit fuse is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite blowing it up  when evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out oconnell exhales but keeps his eyes on 
               imhotep who extends his hand to evelyn

               crowd surrounding them holding axes picks and scimitars 
               waiting to pounce then she looks at imhotep confident

                         stop him yet

               the crowd parts for imhotep and evelyn and then imhotep 
               stops and looks back at oconnell

                                     imhotep

               his hand he looks at the scarab in his palm it starts to 
               glow and then something inside it starts to wiggle

                         say gents you should come have a 
                         look at this

               scarab breaks out of its cocoon and instantly burrows into 
               jonathans palm jonathan starts to freak out and scream

               oconnell runs up and rips the arm off jonathans shirt the 
               scarab is now burrowing up jonathans arm oconnell whips 
               out his butterflyknife snaps it open and grabs jonathans 
               arm jonathans eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face jonathan screams louder obviously being 
               cut open oconnells hand flicks something away

               the scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying

               ago imhotep tried to bring ancksunamun back to life

               imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a canopic 
               jar he pulls out the crusted remains of ancksunamuns 
               heart crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from the book of the dead then he blows the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall  the wall starts to come alive

               ardeth ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway they all hit the deck the dynamite explodes

               ripping apart the creatures causing a cavein and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt now theres only one way 
               out  another dark creepy passageway

               int cemetery

               chained tight to the top of the altar evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself she stops as priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to chant  which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues jaws and mouths 
               in the room

               imhotep steps up carrying the black book of the dead his 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses ancksunamuns decayed 
               cheek

               int horus chamber  day

               oconnell and jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment it starts to give and thats when ardeth 
               ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway heading right for them oconnell looks up

                                     oconnell
                         these guys just dont quit

               ardeth ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies

                                     ardeth ray
                         keep digging

               oconnell and jonathan redouble their efforts pulling harder 
               on the seam the compartment starts to loosen about to give

               the last time this happened salt acid sprayed out remember

               our heroes keep tugging the tension mounts

               and thats when a skeletal hand bursts up out of the ground 
               and grabs oconnells ankle several more moldy hands burst 
               up out of the ground oconnell and jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor

               one of the mummies violently shoves oconnell away another 
               grabs jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him a 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard

               an intense burst of acid sprays out of the seam and hits all 
               three of the mummies the one strangling jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him all three mummies melt horribly

               int cemetery

               imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead

               a large swirling hole starts to open in the detritus bog

               evelyns eyes widen in amazement and horror

               int horus chamber  day

               ardeth ray blasts away at the oncoming mummies over at the 
               base of the statue oconnell and jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment oconnell rips off the 
               lid reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag

               he and jonathan exchange nervous excited looks then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the solid gold 
               book of the living  golden light reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder

               the elephant gun goes empty ardeth ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging

                                     ardeth ray
                         save the girl kill the creature

               the mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart

               oconnell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall he and jonathan hit the deck

                                     oconnell
                         thats the last one we better get 
                         lucky

               the wall blows debris collapses  but now heres a hole 
               for them to get out oconnell and jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber

               ext hamunaptra ruins  day

               outside beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure he throws it over the rear of a camel

               starts to climb up hesitates looks back at the temple door

               licks his lips and then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door

               int cemetery  day

               imhotep reads from the book the rotten priestmummies rock 
               back and forth chanting evelyn struggles

               then suddenly the strange mist wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars it passes through them and 
               into evelyn evelyn jerks as though shes been electrified

               the mist passes through her and into ancksunamuns body

               the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist and 
               imhoteps readings reach a crescendo ancksunamuns crusty 
               eyelids suddenly pop open evelyn stares at her in disbelief

               ancksunamuns rotted head turns and looks at evelyn with 
               empty sockets evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly then 
               she notices imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife

                                     imhotep
                         with your death my love and i will 
                         be invincible

               he raises it up over evelyns chest about to plunge it down

               evelyns eyes widen in horror and thats when oconnell and 
               jonathan burst in imhotep spins around and faces them

               jonathan beams as he holds up the golden book of the living

               oconnell grabs an ancient sword out of a statues hand 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the priests

               the priestmummies stop chanting the mist vanishes

               imhotep steps forward oconnell strikes the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand imhotep bellows a command the priests

               sword down at evelyn  clang one chain breaks free

               jonathan spots a series of solid gold foursided locks along 
               the binder it hits him like lightning 

                                     jonathan

               imhotep grins then grabs the keybox hanging from a chain 
               around his neck rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               he picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for jonathan

                                     jonathan

               jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription 
               but his ancient egyptian is clearly awful

               jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery clutching 
               the golden book wideeyed as imhotep moves in on him

                                     jonathan

               through the wall  shades of ray harryhausen only better

               ancient egyptian commands him to attack anubis moves for 
               oconnell stomping over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way oconnell quickly backs away

                         hootash im ahmenophus

               and petrifies its off balance starts to fall oconnell 
               slides free of its talons evelyn shoves ancksunamun away 
               ancksunamun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as anubis crashes down on top of her smashing her to 
               powder and driving her into the ground

               imhotep shrieks in rage and horror then turns and angrily 
               heads for jonathan jonathan sitting on his ass quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels

                         okay pal lets see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm

               imhotep grabs oconnell with his left arm and throws him 
               half way across the cemetery oconnell slams into a 
               gravestone bounces off and crashes to the ground he shakes 
               it off

                                     oconnell

               evelyn runs for jonathan

               oconnell swings his sword and cleaves a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of imhoteps stomach on the outside imhotep 
               looks human but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy

               imhotep backhands oconnell knocks him twenty feet back

               oconnell staggers to his feet imhotep is right there clubs 
               him hard with his left arm oconnell spins through the air

               slams into the side of a mausoleum imhotep approaches rage 
               in his eyes oconnell gets up quickly pivots and hacks 
               into imhoteps head imhotep grins and punches oconnell in 
               the face oconnell is thrown back pulling his sword with 
               him

               he bounces hard off the mausoleum lands on his feet

               totally beattoshit knees buckling he can barely stand

               jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book  imhoteps severed 
               hand still clings to it jonathan cringes in disgust evelyn 
               yanks it off throws it away then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks unlocking each of them

               imhotep strides forward oconnell backs into the mausoleum 
               swings the sword imhotep tries to catch it  it cleaves 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm

               no matter imhotep rips the sword away from oconnell and 
               casually flings it away

               the golden book of the living opens with a hiss jonathan 
               holds it tight as evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something

               oconnell turns to run but imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet oconnell hangs there a dazed 
               mess imhotep grins says something in ancient egyptian 
               then starts to strangle oconnell oconnell chokes about 
               to die

               evelyn turns and faces imhotep and reads an inscription

                                     evelyn
                         kadeesh mal kadeesh mal pared oos 
                         pared oos

               imhotep pivots and looks at evelyn a look of sheer terror 
               on his face then he looks over at the detritus bog which 
               starts to bubble and shift the swirling hole begins to open

               and then suddenly the spirits of the egyptian gods waft out 
               of the black bog and swirl around the priestmummies the 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust and then the spirits 
               attack imhotep lifting him and oconnell up into the air

               imhotep lets go of oconnell who falls to the ground

               evelyn and jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits 
               jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws the book of 
               the living into the detritus bog evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence jonathan looks like 
               hes about to cry

               ten feet off the ground the spirits swirl around imhoteps 
               body twisting it and turning it and slowly shriveling it

               accompanied by the same strange flashing light we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when ancksunamun was cursed one 
               last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor he staggers to his feet 
               he looks perfectly normal his body is completely intact

               oconnell swings his sword imhotep jerks back the sword 
               scrapes imhoteps chest  a swath of blood appears across 
               imhoteps chest where the sword hit him imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest amazed and horrified hes mortal

               oconnell runs imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog the sword still in his stomach

               evelyn and jonathan run up next to oconnell they watch as 
               imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp slowly dying and 
               then just before his head goes under imhotep looks up at 
               them grins broadly and says something in ancient egyptian

               evelyn translates

                                     evelyn
                         death is only the beginning

               imhoteps grinning face vanishes under the black bile

               staff chamber  day

               beni staggers across a chamber straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure he spots a large 
               ornate staff sticking out of a wall he throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall exhausted

               a beat and then the weight of the treasure pulls the staff 
               down which starts a massive aural chainreaction

               benibacks away from the wall wideeyed filled with fear

               all the walls start to sink into the ground driven by tons 
               of pouring sand beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber

               cemetery  day

               oconnell evelyn and jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to descend oconnell grabs evelyns hand

                                     oconnell
                         cmon

               he pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars they duck as they run into a descending doorway

               int passageway  day

               beni scampers down a passageway the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch and then he has to stick 
               the torch between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees

               int treasure chamber  day

               oconnell evelyn and jonathan crouchrun into the treasure 
               chamber evelyn skids to a stop looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure sand rains down on them oconnell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a sinking doorway on the far side of the room the sound of 
               the sinking walls is deafening

               beni crouchruns into the treasure chamber oconnell evelyn 
               and jonathan race past him he joins them as they run up a 
               staircase heading for a descending doorway which is already 
               half gone its now only four feet high  now three feet 
               high  now two feet jonathan dives through the narrow gap

               then oconnell dives through he spins around evelyn dives 
               but gets stuck in the middle about to get cut in half

               oconnell grabs her arm and yanks her through in the nick of 
               time beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand 

                                     beni
                         oconnell

               oconnell grabs it but its too late beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door crashes to the floor

               sealing him in beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling slams down behind him he stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch

               all the doorways finish closing theres no way out hes 
               trapped and then he hears something and turns around over 
               in the corner a scarabbeetle stares at him chittering

               beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away

                                     beni
                         go away

               he stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him

               beni is absolutely terrified the scarabs start to move in

               and thats when benis torch goes out pitch black a beat

               and then we hear beni start screaming in horror and pain

               and the scarabs chittering hungrily

               ext hamunaptra  day

               the temple collapses as oconnell evelyn jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins a sinking crevice 
               drops out right behind them chasing them out through the 
               front gates the whole place rumbles ominously

               they make it down the ramp as more ruins crash down behind 
               them a massive cloud of sand and dust billows out over the 
               wall and into the air our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert

                                                          slow dissolve to

               around his neck and kisses him oconnell returns it

               jonathan just rolls his eyes snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel

               when the kiss is over oconnell and evelyn share a smile 
               then oconnell leaps up into the saddle reaches down grabs

               behind evelyn hidden under the closed back flap  we can 
               see that its filled with benis stolen treasure
