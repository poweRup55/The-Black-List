the black recedes and we find danny roman sitting in a
dilapidated hallway eating a hot dog  hes a black man in his 40s with a streetwise and wary intelligence behind his dark brown eyes
danny continues talking casually to someone offscreen in the bg the sound of a sarking dog

danny

the boa had to go no way my wife was
gonna have a snake crawlin around her
livingroom gettin up into ther things
slidin into bed with her at night  one
