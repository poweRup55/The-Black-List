     fade in



     prologue

     close on

     an oldfashioned calendar

     the kind that used to hang in offices in the forties  each day
     is a tearoff page  the dates are printed in bold black
     lettering

     the pages of days of the year zip off  at a rate faster than
     the eye can really register  the impression should be of time
     whizzing by

     over this santa claus narrates

                                 santa vo
               twas a long time ago quite a bit to be fair
                 in a place that im sure you are quite unaware

               for our story that you are about to be told
                 began in the holiday worlds of old

               without holidays goodness how dull life would be
                 without their distraction and pleasure and glee

     the calendar makes a sudden stop at

     christmas

     the calendar page peels back to reveal the first hint of color in
     the black and white of the year  smoke curls up from the chimney
     of a snowcovered cottage in a clearing of a snowcovered pine
     forest  the stop is only for a beat

     then the calendar speeds on

                                 santa vo contd
               but our holidays are the result of much fuss
               and hard work for the worlds that must make them for us

     the calendar stops again  this time at

     valentines day

     this stop is short but longer than the last  as each
     subsequent stop will be

     in valentineville fat cupids shoot arrows at distant chocolate
     dripping hearts target practice

                                 santa vo contd
               see each holiday town works all year to create
                 twentyfour special hours fantastically great

     soon the calendar whirls on  next stop is

     easter

     where it is spring  cackling hens sit sidebyside on their long
     row of nests  in unison choreographed like some ballet they
     lay their predecorated eggs

     the eggs then drop down a chute and land on a conveyor belt which
     carries them out ot the henhouse and into waiting easter baskets

                                 santa vo contd
               fleeting twentyfour hours take long to prepare
                 a full year of planning and plenty of care

               but now getting back to the story at hand
                 i should mention this point about holiday lands 

     the calendar flips to the

     fourth of july

     fireworks

      abe lincoln fires a cannon  the cannonball explodes midair
     showering down the word happy

      betsy ross uses a sparkler to write the word fourth

      paul revere sets off the first of six rockets  rocket 1
     erupts into an o  2 traces an f  together they read of
     rocket 3 wont light  neither will 4 5 or 6  paul revere
     panicks

     but paul reveres horse saves the day  he kicks off his
     horseshoes  shooting them at the side of a wooden fence  as
     they hit the boards each becomes a letter j u l y

                                 santa vo contd
               for each one way back when was alas unaware
               of the others existence now ive said it  so there

     the calendar pages tear on slowing at october 29 slowing more
     at and stopping at the 31st

                                 santa vo contd
               but once there occurred a calamity so great
                 when two of the worlds did collide by mistake

     the october 31st page peels back to nothing  to black  we
     fall in or perhaps it should feel more like were swallowed up

     title sequence

     carved jack olanterns come at us in the long tunnel of darkness
     collision seems inevitable but in the instant before we would
     slam into them the jack olanterns veer off turning to display
     the various credits on their uncarved backsides

     when the last jack olantern zooms toward us it doesnt veer
     off  it keeps coming and fast  rather than collide with it
     though  we fall straight into one of the pumpkinheads carved
     out triangular eyes into the further black there and out

     a crypt door

     which opens onto the

     ext halloweenland cemetery night

     the bloated orange disk of the moon illuminates halloweenlands
     delicately decrepit graveyard

     reverse on pumpkinhead

     giant jack olantern head now set on the squat vines of his many
     leafy legs  he looks more like a spider than like anything else
     as he scuttles across the cemetery toward the big pumpkin patch

                      wouldnt you like to see something strange
                      come with us and you will see
                      this our town of halloweenpumpkinhead has reached the

     pumpkin patch

     where he drops down among his fellow pumpkins  who all wake up
     at once  sudden jack olantern mouths and eyes glowing wide for
     the chorus

     hanging tree

     a gigantic oak with several hanged men dangling from its broad
     outspread branches

     tortuously windy street  this is sally  for now we see only
     her backside her waistlength hair

     behind her and closer to us a ghoul tips into view to
     demonstrate his particular talent

     continues on her way  we follow her

     in a moment a second ghoul sets upon her  this one more
     gruesome than the last

                                 second ghouli am the who when you call this ghoul is closer louder and sally does turn around now 
     revealing that shes a crudely stitched together bride of
     frankenstein rag doll  her balance is precarious  her arms
     flop  her mouth is a tragic slash  she has a quavering little
     voice

                                 sally whos therebut the second ghoul has disappeared before she sees him  only
     his voice remains

     eagerness that she looks around for whomever is responsible for

     a third ghoul

     springs into view then bounces skyward  with a very
     disappointed sally shes sorry hes leaving we watch him go up
     into

     as he hits the ground the third ghoul shatters breaking apart
     into several pieces  globular and doughy gelatinous lumps each
     a separate little creature  when they sing they have very high
     voices

                          echoes
                      an inspiration

                                 corpse
                      it was our most horrific
                      halloween ever

     sally sighs and starts to drift irresistibly toward jack
     throughout rag doll sally gains substance as she gains
     conviction  this is her first baby step toward that not even
     perceptible but in any case rudely interrupted by 

     the evil scientist

     who created her  he takes ahold of her by one of her stitched
     together arms

                                 evil scientist
                      the deadly nightshade you
                      slipped me wore off sally
                      i thought id find you here

                                 sally
                      no

     sally pulls back trying to wriggle free of the scientists
     grasp

                                 sally
                      let go

     but he doesnt

                                 sally
                      have it then if you must

     with her other hand she quickly and deftly rips out the stitches
     that attach her arm to the rest of her  then rips the arm
     clear out of its socket

     she leaves the doctor holding it while she runs off into the the
     crowd determined to elude the evil scientist  she disappears
     into the gloom in the direction of the cemetery

     shaking her tornoff arm the evil scientist calls after her

                                 evil scientist
                      youll be back  sooner or
                      later youll need this

     jack

     continues to congratulate and be congratulated by the various
     citizens of halloweenland  the mayor interjects looking for
     attention

     blocked by a couple of adorably hideous kid monsters

     jack rattles his bones once more for the kids  they shriek a
     gleeful shriek and scamper off

     at the corner of the town square

     jack passes a street band  fellow skeletons down on their luck
     an accordion player a sax player and a violinist  he tosses a
     coin into their hat  playing they nod their thanks

     utterly dejected sally crouches behind a tombstone  she hugs
     herself with her remaining arm

     the sudden sound of someone approaching os

     makes her freeze  she dares to peek over the top of the
     tombstone to see who it is 

     its jack

     the sight of him immediately comforts her

                                 sally
                      oh its jack  look at him
                       hes so alive so happy
                      hes so filled with confidence
                      he could teach the wolves to
                      howl

     sally lets out a little whimper of selfpity and collapses out of
     sight behind the tombstone to feel sorry for herself

                                 sally
                      hell never notice me  why
                      would he  why should he

     sally hugs herself again  as best she can with her one arm

     jack

     makes his way past the markers and mausoleums  he looks around
     and since sally is hidden behind the tombstone he doesnt see
     anyone  he starts the long climb up cemetery ridge as he sings

                when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
                      i excel without ever even trying

            with the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
                      i have seen grown men give out a shriek
             with the wave of my hand and a wellplaced moan
                      i have swept the very bravest off their feetjack pauses a moment as if letting these facts settle in then
     heaves a huge sigh and sags miserably

     jack and circles around him  trying to comfort his beloved
     master he drapes himself over jacks shoulder and lays a
     sympathetic head on him

     hill

                      and i grow so weary of the sound of screams
              and i jack the pumpkin king

     his master  only his shiny little jack olantern nose on the
     end of his pointy snout sticks up

     jack tragically reaches the crest of the long hill  zero
     follows dragging along the ground after him

                     an emptiness began to grow
               theres something out there far from my home
                     a longing that ive never known

     behind her tombstone

     sally cant believe what shes hearing  she peeks but hides
     again  she listens breathlessly as

     jack continues his soulsearching

                                 jackim a master of fright and a demon of light
                      and ill scare you right out of your pants boy

                      and im known throughout england and france boy

                and since i am dead i can take off my head
                      to recite shakespearian quotations
                no animal or man can scream like i can
                      with the fury of my recitations

                but who here would ever understand
                      that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin
                would tire of his crown  if they only understood
                      he would give it all up if he only could
                                           if he only couldsallys

     heart goes out to jack  she had no idea he felt this way no
     idea of his tragic side  she wants to show him that hes not as
     alone as he thinks that she understands him  but shes timid 
     should she come out from behind the tombstone  dare she dare
     should she  shouldnt she

                                 jackoh theres an empty place in my bones
                     that calls out for something unknown
              the fame and praise come year after year
                     does nothing for these empty tears

     heads off with zero staggering away blind in his misery
     while

     sally

     still crouched behind the tombstone continues to debate with
     herself

     jack has left the cemetery and disappeared from sight when she
     finally screws up her courage and pops up full of determination
     and shouts

                                 sally
                      jack  i know you hardly know
                      me but 

     he isnt there to hear her  shocked and disappointed sallys
     rag doll body goes floppy again

     her voice gets high and tiny then trails off almost
     tearfully

                       i feel the same way you
                      do

     sally stares sadly into the empty spot jack so recently occupied
     then turns and hobbles limply away  she stops at a

     weedchoked and desiccated little herb garden

     set beside a cluster of tombstones at the edge of the graveyard
     the herbs growing there are labelled henbane witch hazel
     deadly night shade

     as best she can with her single arm sally gathers fresh sprigs
     of deadly night shade

     alarmed sally screws the lid back on  as quickly as she can
     with only one arm  and hides the jar at the back of a cabinet

     the evil scientist

     is a twisted silhouette in the doorway behind sally

     needle threaded with a long strand of thread

     he makes way for sally

     after a beat sally nods  resigned she trudges past him

     he jauntily follows her

     the evil scientist carefully sews sallys arm back on  evenso
     the stitches are crude and the fit awkward  the expression on
     her face is more tragic than ever

                      might get the wrong idea and

     as anxious as she is to be away from here sally cant bear the
     thought of hurting anybody and instinctively tries to make him
     feel better

                      restless  i cant help it

     the scientist smiles feeling sally under his sway again  he
     pats her consolingly then finishes sewing on her arm and makes
     an elaborate knot at the end of his stitches  he snips the
     thread and puts away his sewing kit

                                 evil scientist

     across the street

     sally peers out of an upperstorey window  expression eager and
     despairing at once

     int forest dusk

     it is just before night  jack strides forward toward a

     distant pumpkin shape

     that seems to be carved out of the dark and outlined by glowing
     light

     jack cant wait to find out what it means but zero warier than
     his master and far less enthusiastic about this adventure lags
     behind

     arriving at the pumpkin shape jack eagerly reaches out to it
     when he touches it it gives  creaking open to more woods
     beyond  its a door

     zero hurries to catch up as jack steps through the pumpkinshaped
     door and out into a

     clearing

     in this next forest  awed jack stops dead in the middle of the
     clearing and gapes at what he sees  there are

     more doorways

     etched into the trunks of the trees that ring the clearing  to
     us these doorways make sense  one is shaped like an easter
     egg another like a firecracker another like a valentine
     another like a shamrock and another like a christmas tree  to
     jack whos never heard of the other holidays these doorways are
     a total mystery

     he is especially transfixed by the

     christmas treeshaped door

     it rattles invitingly on its hinges  gusts of cold air blow out
     from behind it  snow oozes out beneath  the drama of it draws
     jack closer

     zero hesitates in the pumpkinshaped doorway uneasy about
     crossing through it to the other side  but the sight of jack
     striding resolutely toward the christmas treeshaped door makes
     him swoop quickly after

     using all his strength jack wrenches open the christmas tree
     shaped door  there is a moments delay  darkness stillness
     silence  then the instantaneous fury of a

     howling blizzard

     a quick blast of snow knocks zero clear back through the pumpkin
     shaped doorway

     the whipping winter wind curls around jacks frail bones and
     sucks him in through the open door  jack disappears  the
     christmas treeshaped door slams shut

     after a beat

     zero pokes his head up over the lintel of the pumpkinshaped
     doorway and sees that jack has vanished  panicstricken he
     streaks across the clearing to the closed christmas tree door

     crying he scratches on the door tries to squeeze under it his
     vaporous body is easy but his head and jack olantern nose are
     another matter circles the tree investigates for another
     entrance above below every which way  he tries everything in
     his ghostdog powers to get in  but all in vain  he has no
     choice but to wait  ears cocked he settles down to stare and
     stare at the strange door that swallowed his master

     outside the alarms wail in the distance while inside sally
     speedily whips up a pot of sleepingpotion soup

     she keeps looking out the window hoping for a hint of whats
     going on but nothing  not a clue  eager to find out she
     hurries the soup along

     various spice jars are out on the counter  among them the one
     labelled deadly night shade the entire contents of which she
     dumps into the pot

                                 sally

                      dose of deadly night shade

                      frogs breath will overpower
                      any smell

     she opens the jar  recoiling from the odor she turns aside
     trying to escape the fumes as she pours some of the frogs breath
     into the soup  but it starts to overwhelm her anyway  she
     swoons  her knees buckle

     in her swoon she fumbles blindly among the other jars

                                 sally
                           choking

                      sweet pea  too bitter
                      too bitter

     her hand finally locates the jar labelled sweet pea

     the evil scientist calls from another room

                      wheres my soup

     sally finally gets the jar open  as fast as she can she empties
     it into the soup and hovers above the pot  in a moment the
     sweet pea takes effect and sallys strength begins to return

                                 sally
                           gasps

     still a bit shaky sally reaches for one more jar  the label on
     this one reads worms wart

     soup

                      like a lobster huge and red
                      and sets out to slay with his raingear on

                      grown up and need to find my
                      own life now  i hope you will

     she adds some xs and os to the bottom of the letter then sets
     it on the pillow of her bed where the doctor will be sure to find
     it

     she takes a needle and spool of thread out of her drawer stuffs
     them into her dress then without warning

     jumps out her window

     with suicidal abandon

     sally lands on the street outside  sprawled torn apart
     stuffing flowing out stitches burst

     in a moment she flops upright  she pulls out the needle the
     thread threads the needle and glancing every so often over her
     shoulder at the evil scientists house hurriedly proceeds to sew
     herself back together again

     the job done  she stashes the needle and thread and wobbly her
     stitches are looser than the doctors gets to her feet to go 
     only shes sewed one of her legs on backwards  so that when she
     takes a step her legs walk in opposite directions and she falls
     right over

     she lets out a little moan of frustration  swivelling she looks
     back at the house afraid of getting caught

     she works even faster now ripping out the stitches on the leg
     she replaced backwards and basting it back on facing forwards

     these stitches are really huge and ungainly  still theyre
     substantial enough to allow her to get to her feet and totter
     away though limping rather badly

     jack has worked through the night and continues to work
     concentrated intent doing his methodical best to study
     christmas

      he stares at an image of sandy claws hes drawn on the
     chalkboard  with giant red lobster hand and elaborate
     raingear  then erases it

      he leafs back and forth through the christmas books every so
     often stopping briefly on an image  rudolf the rednosed
     reindeer or frosty the snowman or an annotated illustration of
     the stockings are hung by the chimney with care

      he scrapes a little bit of the shininess off a christmas tree
     ball  with a mortar and pestle he grinds the flake of shininess
     to a sparkling powder then sprinkles the powder over himself as
     if it were fairy dust  he strikes a pose and waits  but no
     transformation occurs  in another beat he turns back to his
     work table freshly determined

      he studies a strand of tinsel under the microscope  it
     reflects his own hollow eye socket back to him

     cars pass him

     he looks up at the odd scraping sound of sallys food basket

     at the window

     he unhooks the basket and lifts it in  inside is dinner
     lovingly wrapped in a napkin  a skeleton chicken a couple of

     jack leans

     out the window

     to see who sent this to him  his gaze locks with sallys  far
     below  a beat  he nods his thanks  she waves  slowly in
     tragic sympathy  he pulls back into his tower

                      will it let me be  i cannot tell

                      when i think ive got it then at last
                      through my bony fingers it does slip

                      though i try i keep forgetting
                      like a memory long since past
                      here in an instant gone in a flash
                      what does it mean  what does it mean

                      in these little bricabrac
                      a secret waiting to be cracked
                      these dolls and toys confuse me so
                      confound it all  i love it though

                      simple objects nothing more
                      but somethings hidden through the door
                      though i do not have the key

                      ive read these christmas books so many times
                      i know the stories and i know the rhymes
                      i know the christmas carols all by heart
                      my skulls so full its tearing me apart

                      invisible but everywhere
                      just because i cannot see it

                        its not as tricky as it seems
                      and why should they have all the fun

     to one side of him is his christmas treasure trunk filled to the

     on the other side the mayor sits at a table  before him is an
     open scroll  a long list  with his raven feather pen the
     mayor enthusiastically marks off items and occasionally scribbles
     notes forging ahead with the making of christmas he and jack
     are giving out assignments to the citizens of halloweenland

     at the moment jack discusses dollmaking with a couple of large
     vampires  one of the vampires cradles an example of a babydoll
     in the palm of his hand  as he rocks it its eyes close if its
     lying down but open when its brought upright  the doll also
     cries  bleating sadly

     the vampires make a face at one another

                      what kind of noise is that for
                      a baby to make

                           almost inaudibly
                      jack you must let go of this
                      insanity  this is a
                      mistake

     behind her the furry behemoth waits patiently

     jack

     works with the street band  demonstrating he shakes a harness
     piece studded with sleigh bells  the bells jingle cheerfully

                                 jack
                      okay  now you

     the members of the band rattle their bones in response  shaking
     legs and arms echoing the jingle of the bells but with their
     own distinctive hollow clank

     jack laughs enormously pleased

                                 jack
                      perfect  now lets try
                      this

     using various jingling bells jack shakes out the tune to jingle
     bells

     the band clanks the tune right back  phrase for phrase

     sally

     watches with an increasing sense of doom as her turn with jack
     nears

     jack heartily shakes hands and backslaps the three members of
     the street band  they head off practicing

                                 jack
                           calls after

                      best

     he turns to sally  who stands frozen wideeyed her heart a
     wild bird trapped in the cage of her chest  he smiles
     encouragingly at her

                                 jack
                      hi  ive saved a really
                      special job for you

     he gestures for her to step closer

     stiffly she does

                                 jack
                           confidentially
                      i want you to be the one who
                      makes my sandy claws outfit

     she looks stunned  jack nods eagerly and pats her mistaking her
     silence for awe at the responsibility

                                 jack
                      i know you can do it

     he enthusiastically proceeds to describe the costume

                                 jack
                      its bright red the reddest
                      red you can imagine  both the
                      jacket and the pair of pants
                      the boots are black  theres a
                      big black belt that goes around

                      white trim on the cuffs and
                      collar

     swallowing hard sally looks up at him her wide eyes moist  her
     voice is tiny

                                 sally
                      are you sure jack

     jack suddenly looks confused  he stops midgesture 

                                 jack
                      am i sure

     brow furrowing he stares at the ceiling and thinks

     sally holds her breath hoping

     finally jack shrugs

                                 jack
                      well the trim is
                      traditionally white from
                      everything ive studied but if
                      you think green would give it
                      more dash  i trust your

     him hoping to be understood

     santa looks around to see where he has been brought  he gapes in
     horror at the christmas decorations everywhere at the coffin
     sleigh at the reindeer at the staring residents of
     halloweenland at jack before him in what looks very much like a
     deflated version of his own outfit  the shock renders him
     speechless

     the words that could conceivably express the depths of his
     feelings

     crawl through the bars and into the cell with him

     his insides escape into the dark  with the sounds of wings
     flapping and feet skittering  and in the end all thats left

             but after that night things were never the same
               each holiday now knew the other ones name

             and so when their long isolation had ended
               they cautiously reached out and slowly befriended

             and each shared a bit of the things that they had
               with each other and found out it wasnt so bad 

             they had snowflakes in halloween those we could spare
               and we here in christmas enjoyed a few scares

             the fireworks gave the easter bunnies a thrill
               and st patricks day cherishes easter eggs still

             and though that one christmas things got out of hand
               im still rather fond of that skeleton man

             though misguided i think his intentions were good
               he was just a poor skeleton misunderstood

             so many years later i thought id drop in
               and there was old jack still looking quite thin

             with four or five skeleton children at hand
               playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band

             and i asked old jack do you remember the night
               when the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright

             when a million small children pretending to sleep
               nearly didnt have christmas at all so to speak

             and would if you could turn that mighty clock back
               to that long fateful night  now think carefully jack

             would you do the whole thing all over again
               knowing what you know now knowing what you knew then

             and he smiled like the old pumpkin king that i knew
               then turned and asked softly of me wouldnt you







                                 the end
