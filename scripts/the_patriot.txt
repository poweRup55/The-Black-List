fade in

ext  the swamps of south carolina  night

dark  ominous  kudzu hangs from the swamps maples  a
dark and forbidding place  a bird cries eerily in the
darkness  insects hum ominously

superimposition

		    french and indian war

a detachment of french soldiers with several wagons makes
its way along a muddy road cut through the swamp  the
soldiers are wary scanning the underbrush weapons ready

in the swamp parallel to the road shadowed figures
hidden among the brush silently track the french
soldiers

as the lead wagon rolls over a muddy puddle straddling
it a mudcovered figure reaches up grabs the wagons
undercarriage pulls itself up and clings unseen to the
underside of the wagon  the figure obscured by the mud
barely looks human

as the other wagons roll over other muddy depressions in
the road three more mudcovered figures reach up grab
and cling to the underside of other wagons

fort charles

the gates are opened  the relieved french soldiers
quicken their pace and hurry into the relative safety of
the fort  in the fort yard the weary detachment
disperses

under the lead wagon

the first dark mudcovered figure silently drops to the
ground and draws a distinctive tomahawk from his belt as
the other figures drop from the other wagons

the figures crawl through the shadows toward the sentries
who are closing the main gates  they spring the lead
figure dashes forward raises his tomahawk and hacks down
at a terrified french sentry

the other muddy figures join the attack stifling the
screams of the french soldiers with vicious knife
slashes gaining precious seconds

a french soldier cries out sounding the alarm other
french soldiers come running out of the darkness

the four muddy figures make a stand at the gate brutally
killing the french soldiers as they come holding the
gates open as

dozens of other muddy figures race out of the surrounding
swamp tearing through the fort gates joining the
slaughter

the lead figure hacks again and again with his
tomahawk

blood and flesh cover his arm as the vicious blade rises
and falls amid the screams in the darkness

						    dissolve to

ext  south carolina countryside  day

beautiful sunlight  aerial shot of a post rider galloping
along a road through peaceful untamed woodlands  soaring
oldgrowth elms arch over riverside maples along the
shores of the gently curving deepwater santee river

superimposition

			  south carolina
			    april 1776

the post rider rides along a raised swamp road  on either
side of the road gorgeous shafts of sunlight pierce the
canopy falling onto soft swaying ferns that cover the
high grounds  hundreds of birds sing  the water is
clear with fields of floating lily pads each with a
stark white flower rising from it

ext  fresh water plantation  day

the post rider approaches a plantation built between the
banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps
passing acres of perfectly tended rice paddies  two
sturdy brothers nathan 13 and samuel 12 work alongside
three adult male african freedmen joshua jonah mica
planting rice  they look up from their work as the rider
passes  nathan and samuel take off running after the post
rider

the house

the post rider approaches the house built of native
brick wellconstructed and wellmaintained  theres a
barn a workshop and a forge  it is a home of substance
rather than wealth  on the front porch margaret 11
pumps a butter churn while her brother william 6
watches  they see the post rider  margaret excitedly
runs off toward the workshop while william stares at the
approaching rider who is trailed by nathan and samuel

int  workshop  day

a perfect colonial workshop fastidiously arranged with
every conceivable tool of the period  a footpowered
lathe  a dropforge  a lifting saw  racks of tools
planes hammers augers drills blocks all hanging in
their places  all very wellworn

benjamin martin methodically works his lathe turning a
piece of hardwood shaving off tiny curls of wood with a
razorsharp chisel  hes in his lateforties strong and
weathered  his hands though big and callused handle the
chisel with a surgeons precision  selfeducated and
selfsufficient he has built himself as he built his
farm brick by brick from the coarse clay of the earth

a finelymade rocking chair missing only the dowel on
which martin is working sits on the work table  the
chair is a work of art thin and light a spiderweb of
perfectly turned wood no nails no glue  sitting on the
woodpile susan 4 a silent stoneface wisp of a child
watches her father  margaret races in

			margaret
	father  a post rider

martin pointedly continues his work without looking up

			martin
	very well

margaret waits then seeing that her father isnt going
to come she turns and races out

ext  fresh water plantation  day

the post rider rides up to the house  abigale and abner
a middleaged african couple step out  abigale calls out
to nathan and samuel as they run up breathlessly

			abigale
	you go tell your father there a
	post rider

they race toward the workshop passing an excited
margaret

int  workshop  day

martin calmly takes the piece of wood out of the lathe
carefully fits it into the chair inserts a peg and taps
it into place  then he steps back and appraises his
handiwork  he picks up the chair and hooks the top rail
to a scale countering with a threepound weight  the
chair floats  martin blows softly on the weight which
sinks  susan nods so far so good  nathan and samuel
burst into the room

			nathan
	father  father

			samuel
	a post rider  mail

martin nods keeping his attention on the chair

			martin
	very well

the boys wait for more  nothing  they race out

ext  fresh water plantation  day

gabriel 18 strong and handsome walks out of the woods
with a musket in his hand and a dozen gamebirds over his
shoulder  at his side walks thomas 14 also carrying a
musket  they see the post rider giving the mail to
abigale with the other children excitedly watch  thomas
runs over  gabriel restrains himself and strides toward
the workshop

int  workshop  day

martin takes the chair off the scale and puts it on the
floor  he walks slowly around it checking every angle
he takes a deep breath and starts to sit down but stops as
gabriel enters

			gabriel
	father a post rider

			martin
	i know

gabriel waits for martin to share his excitement  he
doesnt

			gabriel
	may i bring it to you

martin pointedly keeps his attention on the chair

			martin
	no

			gabriel
	may i open it

martin turns with a surprised and authoritarian glare

			gabriel
	uh i can wait

gabriel leaves  martin exchanges a look with susan then
turns back to the chair  he takes a deep breath and
lowers himself onto the seat gingerly adding an ounce at
a time  not a creak  he smiles and sits back with a
sigh

crack  the chair splinters under martins weight dumping
him on his ass on a pile of broken wood

			martin
	damnation

he picks up some of the wood about to fling it across the
room but stops as susan shoots him a disapproving look
he calms himself

			martin
	sorry

susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of
the chair in the fireplace  martin steps over to his wood
rack and extracts a fresh dowel  as susan climbs back up
to her perch martin fits the dowel into the lathe and
starts it up

the mail sits unopened on the hall table  margaret
william nathan samuel thomas and gabriel hover
abigale bustles in and shoos them away

			abigale
	you get away from there now
	thats not your mail  you wash up
	for supper you leave that
	alone

the children reluctantly follow her orders leaving the
unopened mail on the table

ext  hilltop  fresh water farm  sunset

the loveliest spot on the farm  a beautiful view of the
house barns river fields and hills beyond  a
gravestone stands in the shade of a soaring oak tree
covered with spanish moss  it reads

	elizabeth putnam martin    17381773

above her name is a carving of the night sky at the
center of which is the north star steady and guiding

martin approaches  he gives himself a moment to look at
the grave  a soft wind blows some dry leaves along the
ground  martin turns his head as if listening to spoken
words  push in on the north star on the gravestone

			margaret vo
	thats her the north star

						    dissolve to

int  girls bedroom  night

martin stands in the doorway unobserved while margaret
and susan look out the window at the night sky

			margaret
	 you start from the front two
	stars of the big dipper and count up
	five fingers lengths thats
	right there

susan gazes up at the north star  the girls notice martin
and climb into bed  he puts a chair against susans bed
and kisses her  he pulls a blanket up around margaret
who whispers

			margaret
	it helps her to know mothers there

martin nods with a thin smile kisses margaret picks up
his candle and walks out

int  boys bedroom  night

martin enters finding william asleep on the floor and
nathan and samuel both asleep in their beds  he lifts
william into bed takes a slingshot from nathans hand
samuel looks up threequarters asleep murmuring

			samuel
	mail papa

			martin
	i know

he tucks in samuel and walks out

int  foyer  martins house  night

gabriel hovers near the still unopened mail  thomas lies
on the floor deploying squadrons of lead soldiers
martin walks in and pours a drink

			martin
	very well  open it

thomas and gabriel leap for the mail battling tearing
into it  martin steps to the window with his drink
looking out into the night  gabriel scans thomas reads
more slowly

	anything about the convention in
	philadelphia

			gabriel
	poor richard says theyll make a
	declaration of independence by july

martin extracts a delicate pair of reading glasses from a
wooden pocketbox and motions for gabriel to hand him some
of the newspapers and pamphlets  gabriel does so  martin
sits down and begins reading

			gabriel
	scott higgins joined the militia

martin doesnt respond  thomas looks up from his lead
soldiers

			gabriel
	hes seventeen  a year younger than
	i

gabriel and thomas wait for a reaction  none  gabriel
sighs and sits down to open more mail  martins eyes
drift from the page to gabriel  suddenly gabriel starts

			gabriel
	father  the assemblys been
	convened  youre called to
	charleston

martin nods not pleased not surprised

			martin
	well leave in the morning

ext  swamp road  day

the martins drive on a beautiful swamp road  the arching
maples and willows form a tunnel of green  the children
excitedly chatter and sing  martin driving one of the
wagons is troubled  gabriel driving the other is as
excited as his siblings but he restrains himself

ext  bennington overlook  day

the two carriages pass a view of their entire valley
scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields and
rice paddies surround the town of bennington

ext  santee road  day

passing through rolling farmland the martins head toward
the coast  they pass a large contingent of south carolina
militia drilling in a field  the children particularly
gabriel watch avidly

through the busy streets  the children watch wideeyed
seeing taverns a public gallows drunkards street
entertainers welldressed ladies attended by their maids

int  charlottes house  charleston  day

charlotte selton midthirties beautiful with a deep
sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can runs down
the grand staircase of her mansion  she stops in front of
a mirror and quickly primps then hurries out the front
door

ext  charlottes house  charleston  day

the children leap from the carriages and swarm around
charlotte embracing her smothering her with kisses

			the children
	aunt charlotte  aunt charlotte

			charlotte

			the children
		   simultaneous all
		    except susan
	presents  for me  what do you

			charlotte
	inside inside

the children race through the door forcing martin and
charlotte together  they stand awkwardly their bodies
close as the children pass  after the children go
martin and charlotte stand for an extra instant then turn
and see susan standing staring

			charlotte
	you too susan  theres something
	for you

martin and charlotte watch susan walk inside

			charlotte
	she still hasnt started talking

martin shakes his head  they sigh and head inside
together

ext  charleston square  night

chaos  a yelling crowd of sons of liberty is massed
around a liberty tree from which hang dozens of glowing
lanterns  gabriel walks through the crowd drinking it all
in turning his head this way and that seeing

drunk men  vendors selling rum ale food and banners
emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend dont
tread on me  scores of onlookers including respectable
people as well as street urchins whores and drunkards
watch the proceedings

gabriel moves through the crowd excited by the madness of
the scene listening in to bits of conversation as he
goes

gabriel stops noticing peter howard a onelegged
middleaged man about martins age standing with his
family on the edge of the crowd  howards daughter anne
very attractive around fifteen stands a bit apart from
her parents

gabriel makes his way over and stands next to anne  they
exchange a look  she turns back to watch the crowd
gabriel clears his throat and speaks with earnest adult
politeness

			gabriel
	miss howard isnt it

she speaks without looking at him

			anne
	you know who i am gabriel martin
	the last time you saw me i was nine
	and you put ink in my tea

gabriel straightens up and speaks officiously trying to
appear a man above such childish pranks

			gabriel
	i believe that was one of my younger
	brothers perhaps samuel or
	nathan

			anne
	it was you and it turned my teeth
	black for a month

			gabriel
	i uh

the crowd cheers as several sons of liberty string up
effigies of king george iii and governor wilmington  as
they light the effigies on fire annes father notices
anne talking to gabriel  he motions for her to join him
at his side  anne nods to gabriel taking her leave

gabriel watches her go  with extreme effort she keeps
herself from glancing back at him  gabriel turns his
attention back to the crowd  seeing a small knot of
affluent men gathered in conversation gabriel walks over
and stands just outside their circle listening avidly

ext  charlottes balcony  night

martin his children and charlotte watch the mob in the
square below the children are transfixed  martin is
troubled  charlotte looks closely at martin gauging his
expression

			thomas
	look  theres gabriel

they see gabriel making his way through the crowd  he
sees them and waves then enters the house  a moment
later gabriel breathlessly steps onto the balcony

			gabriel
	its coming

			thomas
	war  war

			gabriel
	harry lee is here from virginia
	recruiting for a continental army
	he seeks a levy of troops and money
	the governor has vowed that if the
	assembly votes a single shilling to
	lee hell dissolve the body

			charlotte
	which would force our delegates in
	philadelphia to vote for
	independence

			martin
	and send us to war alongside
	massachusetts

gabriel nods enthusiastically  martin shoots him a
sidelong glance troubled by the prospect  charlotte
notices

in the square a pair of drunk sons of liberty pull down
one of the smoldering effigies cut off its head and
start hacking at its groin with a sword

martin sees his younger childrens expressions as they
watch

			martin
	inside all of you right now

they start to protest but a look at their fathers face
convinces them otherwise  they file into the house
gabriel assumes the order doesnt apply to him but a stern
look from martin sends him reluctantly inside leaving
charlotte and martin alone on the balcony

			charlotte
	lee will be counting on your vote
	hell expect you to be the first to
	enlist

martin looks down at the mob without responding  the
flames of the burning effigies light his face

ext  assembly hall  charleston  day

the capital building of south carolina  a large crowd of
lowerclass men and women is massed in front of the
assembly hall  as welldressed assemblymen walk into the
building the crowd yells words of encouragement to some
and berates others

in the square in front of the assembly hall a squadron of
blueuniformed american continental soldiers drills  a
recruiting table is being set up by a continental captain
and several military clerks

int  assembly hall  day

two dozen angry yelling men of property  among them are
robinson hamill and johnson who are patriots  opposed
to them are simms withington and baldridge who are
loyalists  as martin makes his way to his seat the
speaker of the assembly pounds his gavel

			speaker
	order  order

slowly the room quiets down

			speaker
	our first order of business

			simms
	and our last if we vote a levy

the room erupts

			speaker
	order  order  mr simms you do
	not have the floor

the room settles down

			speaker
	our first order of business is an
	address by colonel harry lee of the
	continental army

an imposing figure makes his way to the front of the
assembly colonel harry lee about martins age and cut
from the same cloth  strong weathered with a powerful
bearing  lee sees martin and offers a familiar nod which
martin returns stonefaced  at the dais lee pauses then
speaks simply

			lee
	you all know why i am here  i am
	not an orator and i will not try to
	convince you of the worthiness of
	our cause  i am a soldier and we
	are at war and with the declaration
	of independence we all expect from
	philadelphia it will soon be a
	formal state of war  in preparation
	for that eight of the thirteen
	colonies have levied money in
	support of a continental army  i
	ask south carolina to be the ninth

in the balcony gabriel nods in agreement  simms rises

			simms
	colonel lee massachusetts may be at
	war along with new hampshire and
	rhode island and virginia but south
	carolina is not at war

			lee
	massachusetts and new hampshire are
	not as far from south carolina as
	you might think and the war theyre
	fighting is not for independence of
	one or two colonies  its for the
	independence of one nation

			withington
	and what nation is that

robinson one of the patriots stands up

			robinson
	an american nation  colonel lee
	with your permission

lee nods

			robinson
	those of us who call ourselves
	patriots are not seeking to give
	birth to an american nation but to
	protect one that already exists  it
	was born a hundredandseventy years
	ago at jamestown and has grown
	stronger and more mature with every
	generation reared and with every
	crop sown and harvested  we are one
	nation and our rights as citizens of
	that nation are threatened by a
	tyrant three thousand miles away

			lee
	were i an orator those are the
	exact words i would have spoken

laughter  martin rises

			martin
	mister robinson tell me why should
	i trade one tyrant three thousand
	miles away for three thousand
	tyrants one mile away

laughter from the loyalists  surprise from lee and the
patriots  in the gallery gabriel winces

			robinson
	sir

			martin
	an elected legislature can trample a
	mans rights just as easily as a
	king can

			lee
	captain martin i understood you to
	be a patriot

			martin
	if you mean by a patriot am i angry
	at the townsend acts and the stamp
	act  then im a patriot  and what
	of the navigation act  should i be
	permitted to sell my rice to the
	french traders on martinique  yes
	and its an intrusion into my
	affairs that i cant legally

laughter

			martin
	and what of the greedy selfserving
	bastards who sit as magistrates on
	the admiralty court and have fined
	nearly every man in this room
	should they be boxed about the ears
	and thrown onto the first ship back
	to england  ill do it myself
		   beat
	and do i believe that the american
	colonies should stand as a separate
	independent nation free from the
	reins of king and parliament  i do
	and if that makes a patriot then
	im a patriot

martin grows more serious

			martin
	but if youre asking whether im
	willing to go to war with england
	the answer is no  ive been to war
	and i have no desire to do so again

the room is quiet the assemblymen having been thrown off
balance  gabriel is disappointed by his fathers speech

			robinson
	this from the same captain benjamin
	martin whose anger was so famous
	during the wilderness campaign

martin glares at robinson then smiles

			martin
	i was intemperate in my youth  my
	departed wife god bless her soul
	dampened that intemperance with the
	mantle of responsibility

robinson looks derisively at martin

			robinson
	temperance can be a convenient
	disguise for fear

martin bristles but before he can answer lee steps in

			lee
	mister robinson i fought with
	captain martin in the french and
	indian war including the wilderness
	campaign  we served as scouts under
	washington  theres not a man in
	this room or anywhere for that
	matter to whom i would more
	willingly trust my life

			robinson
	i stand corrected

			lee
	but damn it benjamin  you live in
	a cave if you think well get
	independence without war

			martin
	wasnt it a union jack we fought
	under

			lee
	a long time ago

			martin
	thirteen years

			lee
	thats a damn long time

the speaker pounds his gavel again

			speaker
	gentlemen  please  this is not a
	tavern

martin and lee ignore the speaker

			martin
	you were an englishman then

			lee
	i was an american i just didnt
	know it yet

the assemblymen and even the speaker turn their heads in
simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder

			martin
	we dont have to go to war to gain
	independence

			lee
	balderdash

			martin
	there are a thousand avenues other
	than war at our disposal

martin speaks slowly and firmly

			martin
	we do not have to go to war to gain
	independence

lee says nothing for a moment then he speaks more
seriously quietly grimly

			lee
	benjamin i was at bunker hill  it
	was as bad as anything you and i saw
	on the frontier  worse than the
	slaughter at the ashuelot river
	the british advanced three times and
	we killed over seven hundred of them
	at point blank range  if your
	principles dictate independence
	then war is the only way  it has
	come to that

martin is silent for a long moment  he softens and grows
unsteady speaking far more honestly than he ever wanted
to

			martin
	i have seven children  my wife is
	dead  whos to care for them if i
	go to war

lee is stunned by martins honesty and his show of
weakness  at first lee has no answer then

			lee
	wars are not fought only by
	childless men  a man must weigh his
	personal responsibilities against
	his principles

			martin
	thats what im doing  i will not
	fight and because i wont i will
	not cast a vote that will send
	others to fight in my stead

			lee
	and your principles

			martin
	im a parent i dont have the
	luxury of principles

the other assemblymen both patriots and loyalists stare
at him appalled  martin feeling weak sits down  lee
looks at his friend with more sympathy than
disappointment  in the gallery gabriel turns and walks
out

ext  assembly hall  day

the crowd waits  the doors open and a page boy dashes out
and runs to the continental captain at the recruiting
table

			page boy
	twentyeight to twelve the levy
	passed

the continental captain motions to an assembled squadron
they raise their muskets and fire a volley into the air
other soldiers strike up a martial air on fifes and
drums  volunteers crowd around the recruiting table
yelling and jostling for position

the delegates walk out  both patriots and loyalists give
martin a wide berth

martin sees gabriel standing near the crowd at the
recruiting table  martin walks up to him

			gabriel
	father ive lost respect for you
	i thought you were a man of
	principle

			martin
	when you have children i hope
	youll understand

			gabriel
	when i have children i hope i dont
	hide behind them

martin looks closely at gabriel

			martin
	do you intend to enlist without my
	permission

			gabriel
	yes

they lock eyes for a moment then gabriel turns from his
father and walks away joining the crush around the
recruiting table  martin stands alone in the middle of
the chaos  the fifes and drums continue to play  martin
doesnt hear them

			lee os
	is he as imprudent as his father was
	at his age

martin turns and sees lee standing next to him looking at
gabriel

			martin
	unfortunately so  in other
	measures he is his mothers son but
	in prudence or lack thereof he is
	his fathers

			lee
	ill see to it that he serves under
	me  ill make him clerk or a
	quartermaster something of that
	sort

			martin
	good luck

they shake hands  then lee walks over to the soldiers
camera cranes up as martin takes a last look at gabriel
then heads off through the crowded square moving against
the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table

crane up ends on tableau of the sunlit city of charleston
bustling streets filled with civilians patriots streaming
into the assembly square and fluttering flags  the south
carolina state flag and numerous dont tread on me
flags

						    dissolve to

ext  charleston  day

the same view of the city which has radically changed

superimposition

			  two years later

the sky is cloudfilled and dark  the flags have all been
replaced by union jacks  redcoats march in lockstep
unison where excited patriots and civilians ran  a fleet
of british ships is visible in the harbor  defensive
emplacements bristling with cannons surround the city

			gabriel vo
	 and i apologize for not having
	written in such a long time

ext  charleston street  day

a detachment of redcoats marches past coldly staring
american civilians

			gabriel vo
	as you must know the fall of
	charleston has been a severe blow to
	our cause

ext  charleston square  day

lord general cornwallis haughtily turns from american
general lincoln forcing lincoln to present his sword of
surrender to one of cornwallis subordinates

			gabriel vo
	with the sting of that loss made all
	the worse by cornwallis humiliation
	of our general lincoln at the
	surrender ceremony

ext  charlottes house  charleston  day

charlotte supervises her slaves as they pack a line of
wagons

			gabriel vo
	a letter from aunt charlotte
	informed me that she closed her home
	in charleston before the city
	fell

ext  charlottes plantation  day

a backcountry plantation  more substantial than martins
but not opulent  charlotte her hands dirty tends a
vegetable garden with a pair of female slaves while
several male slaves harvest rice in the paddies beyond

			gabriel vo
	 and moved to her plantation near
	you on the santee

ext  slight rise  fresh water plantation  later

martin stands at his wifes grave finishing reading the
letter

			gabriel vo
	what little news we get from the
	north is disheartening offering us
	little solace in these dark times
	i pray for a turn of fortune for our
	cause  then as now your loving
	son gabriel

a soft wind blows  martin turns his head listening for a
faint voice but hears nothing  he folds the letter
takes off his glasses boxes them and heads down the hill
toward the lights and laughter coming from the house
below

int  martins bedroom  dusk

a trunk lid opens  camera pulls back to reveal thomas in
martins closet  he lifts out some blankets uncovering a
trove of martins old military gear  a worn battle coat
a box of medals a military sword rusted into its
scabbard and the tomahawk seen in the opening sequence

thomas puts on the coat which hangs off his narrow
shoulders  he stands in front of a mirror appraising
himself  he picks up the tomahawk and hefts it
footsteps

martin steps into the room and stops  thomas grimaces
expecting him to be angry but martin simply shakes his
head takes the tomahawk and gently removes the battle
coat

			martin
	not yet thomas

			thomas
	when

martin looks closely at his son giving him the courtesy
of really thinking about the answer

			martin
	seventeen

			thomas
	but its already been two years and
	thats two more years  the war
	could be over by then

			martin
	god willing

			thomas
	alright  seventeen

martin offers his hand  they shake  martin puts the coat
and the tomahawk back in the trunk and closes the lid

int  fresh water plantation  dawn

all is quiet  a dawn mist hovers close over the ground
some sparrows feed at the base of the oak tree near the
gravesite  distant thunder  low and rolling  the birds
fly away

int  martins bedroom  dawn

another roll of the distant thunder  martin awakes  he
gets out of bed and pulls on his clothes

ext  front porch  martins house  dawn

martin steps out to his front porch and listens  he knows
the sound the distant staccato booms of cannon and the
pattering wave of thousands of muskets firing

one by one he is joined by his children  thomas nathan
and samuel listen analytically  margaret and susan press
close against their father

abigale and abner join the family on the porch  abigale
gathers susan and william to her skirts  joshua jonah
and mica step out of the slave quarters and listen

william looks curiously at the cloudless sky

			william
	is it going to rain

			thomas
	thats not thunder

the sound becomes deeper more ominous  they all notice

			nathan
	father

			martin
	sixpounders  lots of them

			thomas
	how far away

			martin
	four five miles

			samuel
	waxhaus

			martin
	just east of it

			margaret
	we could go stay at aunt
	charlottes  shes west

			martin
	no therell be skirmishers on the
	roads  were safer here

thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets  he
gives one to nathan and offers the other to his father

			martin
	put those away

			thomas
	but father they might come this
	way

			martin
	put those things away

int  workshop  day

martin works the lathe trying to concentrate  susan
watches from her perch on the woodpile  a distracted
martin slips cutting his finger  the blood landing on
the spinning dowel makes a quick bright red circle
around the wood  martin continues working

ext  barn  day

the sound of a crash  a horse runs out of the barn
dragging a tenacious samuel who is holding onto the
horses neck  joshua and jonah step out of the barn
admiring the boys grit  samuels grip fails and he lands
in the dirt  seeing that hes unhurt joshua and jonah
laugh lightly as the horse runs off down the hill toward
the river  joshua stands samuel up and brushes him off

			joshua
	you go on and get him there boy

samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the
horse

on the riverbank

as samuel approaches the horse he see it skittishly
approaching then retreating from the water  then he sees
the cause  the water in the river has a pale pink hue
samuel stares at it trying to figure out what it is

on the porch

abigale sees samuel beyond the yard wall and snaps at
margaret

			abigale
	look where your brother is your
	papa said you stay close by this
	house you bring him up here
	right now

margaret heads after samuel  abigale reenters the house

			margaret
	samuel

he doesnt respond  william trails after margaret

			margaret
	samuel get up to the house
	papas gonna be mad

then she sees it too  the pale pink is turning redder
and redder  and then the bodies  first one then more
many more  torn apart  missing limbs  those with wide
open wounds are already drained of blood  others are
still seeping leaving trails of deep red in the paler red
of the surrounding water

samuel margaret and william stand frozen appalled and
fascinated

martin steps out of the workshop and sees the children at
the river  he cant see what theyre looking at
irritated he walks toward them

then as he nears the river he sees the color of the
water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children
he quickens his stride speaking calmly but firmly
careful not to frighten them

			martin
	up to the house now  all of you
	come on  now

ext  martins house  night

quiet  dark  martin stands on the front porch looking
out into the night listening hearing nothing  he
glances up at the north star

behind the house a figure in the darkness carrying a
musket moves from shadow to shadow

int  kitchen  night

margaret and samuel and william talk their voices low

			samuel
	theyre going to come

			margaret
	quiet

			samuel
	were going to have to fight them
	off

			william
	father will do that

			samuel
	theyll probably kill us men and do
	lord knows what to you women

			margaret
	samuel

a sound  they all stop  something moved behind the
kitchen  margaret silently eases the others out of the
room

suddenly in front of them a bloody figure

big  hulking  in uniform  margaret screams  william
and samuel cry out  the figure moves toward them

martin on the porch hears the scream races into the
house sees the figure martin reaches under his vest
and draws a heretofore unseen pistol cocks and aims in
a fast practiced motion hes just about to fire
when

the figure moves into the light martin sees

			martin
	gabriel

gabriel is wounded battered and dirty carrying a musket
and a dispatch case  he sways  martin catches him and
eases him to a seat  abigale frantically looks at his
wounds

			thomas
	the battle were you there

			martin
	abigale get bandages and water
	thomas the porch

they hurry off  martin checks gabriels wounds

			gabriel
	have you seen any redcoats

			martin
	not yet  what happened

abigale brings water and linen to martin who expertly
cleans gabriels wounds and applies fielddressings as
they talk

			gabriel
	it wasnt like saratoga  there we
	stayed in the trees but this time
	gates marched us straight at the
	redcoats  they fired two volleys
	into us and we broke like straw  i
	was given these dispatches i saw
	virginia regulars surrender as
	they laid down their weapons the
	british green dragoons rode into
	them and hacked them to bits
	killed them all over two hundred
	men

martins appalled

			martin
	they had surrendered

gabriel nods  martins stunned  gabriel tries to rise

			gabriel
	i have to get these dispatches to
	hillsboro

			martin
	youre in no condition to ride

			gabriel
	i cant stay here its not safe
	for any of you and i must get to
	i

gabriel passes out  martin catches him and carries him to
a daybed  they hear heavy musket fire very close

martin hurries to the door and looks out into the night
the children cluster around him seeing a strange sight

a skirmish in the field below the house

pitch black  then a musket fires creating a flash of
light that illuminates a tableau of soldiers about three
dozen redcoats and as many patriots

the strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an
ensuing volley of shots in every direction  then
darkness punctuated by screams of pain confused
hollering and the rustling of armed men in movement

then the pattern repeats itself  a musket fires
illuminating a tableau of targets for another murderous
volley of shots

			martin
	margaret take william and susan
	down to the root cellar  thomas go
	to the back porch  nathan and
	samuel the side windows  keep out
	of sight

they hurry off  martin steps into the house and opens his
gun cabinet  he extracts two pistols and a pair of
muskets  then he steps back to the front door  he waits
and watches

ext  lower field  fresh water plantation  dawn

first light  the morning mist lies low over the field
martin warily approaches the scene of the battle  he
carries a pennsylvania rifle has another slung over his
shoulder and has a pair of pistols in his belt

as martin nears the field he sees appearing out of the
mist a nightmarish vision  young redcoats and
continentals are scattered on the ground dead and
wounded  many have been hideously torn apart by the
massive musket balls  blood is everywhere  martin
hurries back toward the house

ext  martins house  fresh water plantation  day

the porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital
there are about two dozen wounded a few more patriots
than redcoats  joshua jonah and mica unload the last
wagonload of injured men  abigale thomas nathan
samuel and margaret help martin tend the soldiers
william and susan watch from inside  abner stands on the
edge of the yard as lookout

gabriel stronger though still weakened by his wounds
helps treating a patriots arm wound retying a
tourniquet stanching an ugly flow of blood  thomas sees
and swoons then grows embarrassed when gabriel notices

ext  martins house  afternoon

triage completed  margaret and samuel give water and
food  martin kneels next to a continental sergeant and a
couple of privates who are less severely wounded than the
others

			continental sergeant
	thank you

martin nods uncomfortable with the thanks

			martin
	sergeant there are seventeen
	wounded men here  seven redcoats
	and ten patriots counting my son
	that puts me in a difficult
	position

the continental sergeant knows whats coming  the
privates and martins younger children dont  a troubled
gabriel overhearing does know

			martin
	you three are the least severely
	wounded  i have to ask you to leave
	and find care elsewhere

the privates are stunned at the request  the sergeant
looks at martins children and nods

			sergeant
	i understand

he struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two
privates to do the same

			sergeant
	come on boys

nathan samuel and margaret are confused

			thomas
	father

			nathan
	but theyre wounded

			martin
	there are rules even in war

martins children are not convinced  gabriel steps over
in front of martin as the sergeant and the two privates
gather themselves to leave

			gabriel
	father no

			martin
	well be safe this way

			gabriel
	even now you wont pick a side

martin glances at his younger children then turns back to
gabriel

			martin
	i have

gabriel points to the more seriously wounded of the
privates

			gabriel
	you stay ill go

			martin
	no  his wound is less severe than
	yours

gabriel hesitates  the private tentatively steps up

			private
	hes right  ill go

gabriel backs down  martin hides his relief and turns to
the sergeant and the privates

			martin
	your best chance is in bennington
	seven miles east along the river
	road

the wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road

			martin
	thank you

martin gabriel and his children watch them go  a
troubled gabriel heads over to help the remaining wounded

ext  fresh water road  day

a dirt road runs along the edge of the swamps  beautiful
country  peaceful  the ground begins to shake  a
thunderous sound rises louder and louder  horses hooves
from around a bend a detachment of cavalry gallops

british green dragoons  the finest light calvary in the
world  hard strong men  excellent horsemen  their
mounts are powerful muscled and perfectly cared for  the
dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans marked with
the blood and dirt of a recent battle  tired and
vigorous

armed to the teeth each with a flintlock carbine a brace
of pistols and a sword  some carry lances  flags
flutter

and at their head the most imposing man of all lt
colonel william tavington  the butcher  aristocratic
strong  dark  a powerful horseman on the best mount of
the entire troop  decorated  imperious  no temper just
hard cold authority  his men struggle to keep up with
him

behind them two dozen loyalist militia calvary  nasty
local men  civilian clothes  riding at their head amos
gaskins grizzled lowerclass wearing illfitting
patricians clothing

around a bend

the three wounded patriots who just left martins farm
hear the horses coming stand on the side of the road
raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender

the green dragoons rein in  tavington stops in front of
the three men  he motions for one of his men to lower his
weapon  then he speaks calmly quietly to the wounded
men

			tavington
	youre surrendering

			continental sergeant
	yes sir

			tavington
	what unit

			continental sergeant
	first virginia regulars under
	colonel hamilton

			tavington
	who cared for your wounds

they hesitate

			continental sergeant
	we did

			tavington
	with a lace table cloth

tavington turns to his secondincommand major wilkins

			tavington
	kill them

tavington rides off  wilkins and several other dragoons
calmly fire their pistols killing the three patriots
the troops ride off thundering past the bodies

ext  fresh water plantation  day

martin his family and freedmen continue tending the
wounded  redcoat infantry appear out of the woods
heading toward the house  three dozen men  scouts and
flank units covering the main body  martin gathers his
family around him stands and waits

joshua jonah and mica stand among the wounded  abigale
makes her way to martin and the children gathering the
younger ones closer to her

the redcoats warily eye the wounded and martins family
a young redcoat lieutenant motions his men to check out
the house and barn then does a silent count of the
wounded

			redcoat lieutenant
	these men are of my regiment  thank
	you

martin nods  one of the redcoats emerges from the house
carrying gabriels dispatch case

			redcoat
	rebel dispatches sir

gabriel steps up

			gabriel
	i carried those  i was wounded
	these people gave me care they have
	nothing to do with the dispatches

			redcoat lieutenant
	i understand

the sound of horses hooves  all turn and see

tavington and the green dragoons thundering down the road
toward the house  its an impressive frightening sight
they rein in their horses stopping in the yard enveloped
by their trailing cloud of dust

tavington surveys the scene then speaks to the young
redcoat lieutenant

			tavington
	lieutenant have a detachment take
	our wounded to our surgeons at
	camden crossing  use whatever
	horses and wagons you can find here

			redcoat lieutenant
	yes sir

he hands the dispatch case to tavington

			redcoat lieutenant
	we found this sir

tavington opens it and quickly scans the contents

			tavington
	who carried this

			gabriel
	i did

			tavington
		   to lt re gabriel
	take this one to camden hes a spy
	he will be hung

martin quickly steps between tavington and gabriel

			martin
	colonel hes a dispatch rider and
	thats a marked dispatch case

tavington ignores martin and continues speaking to the
lieutenant

			tavington
	fire the house and barns  send the
	slaves to acworth enlist the
	young ones  leave the rest of the
	goods

abigale is appalled  joshua steps up

			joshua
	were not slaves were freedmen

			tavington
	then youre freedmen who will enlist
	in the kings army

martin grows distraught

			martin
	colonel

			redcoat lieutenant
	and the rebel wounded

			tavington
	kill them

the redcoat lieutenant and several of his men are shocked
by the order  martin is also but hes more concerned
with gabriel  he pushes past some redcoats and stands at
tavingtons mount looking up

			martin
	a dispatch rider with a marked case
	cannot be held for spying

tavington finally pays attention to martin  he looks down
at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles

			tavington
	were not going to hold him were
	going to hang him

			martin
	but

tavington draws his pistol and points it at martin
gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly
redcoat corporal

			gabriel
	father

			tavington
	oh hes your son  you should have
	taught him about loyalty

			martin
	colonel i beg you please
	reconsider  by the rules of war a
	dispatch rider with a marked case

tavington controls his shifting mount keeping his pistol
trained on martins face

			tavington
	would you like a lesson in the rules
	of war

martin doesnt answer  he looks up at tavington coldly
taking his measure waiting to see if hes going to pull
the trigger

tavington walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his
aim pointing the pistol among martins children

			tavington
	perhaps your children would

the children are terrified  thomas is more angry than
frightened  martin quickly steps between the pistol and
his children and speaks quietly to tavington

			martin
	no lesson is necessary

tavington sees the terrified expressions on the faces of
martins children  he smiles at the effect  then he
holsters his pistol

martin and his children watch as one of the redcoats ties
gabriels hands  thomas is beside himself

			thomas
	father do something

thomas grows increasingly agitated  he sees that his
father is going to do nothing  he gauges the distance
between gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods

then suddenly thomas springs  he runs throwing himself
into the two redcoats holding gabriel knocking them down

			thomas
	gabriel  run

gabriel is too shocked to take flight  a few of the
redcoats including one of the ones knocked down shake
their heads with sad laughter at thomas ineffectual
gesture  one of them grabs thomas by the scruff of the
neck and yanks him to his feet

tavington sees the commotion  without pausing he draws
his pistol and fires hitting thomas in the back

thomas is thrown to his knees by the shot  stunned
confused he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in
his chest

martin horrified catches thomas as he falls easing him
to the ground

gabriel cries out  the other children are stunned to
silence  abigale sobs

the redcoats are frozen in place  tavingtons green
dragoons are impassive having seen worse

martin holds his son looking at the huge
incomprehensible wound  he knows that thomas is already
dead though his body still moves

martins stunned agony turns to fury  he rises his eyes
trained on tavington then stops as

tavington raises a second loaded pistol and a dozen green
dragoons raise pistols and carbines aiming them at
martin gabriel and the other children

martin freezes torn between his fury and fear for his
children  he locks his eyes on tavington

tavington calmly baths in martins anger  then with a
hard yank of the reins he jerks his horses head around
and utters a sharp command to wilkins

			tavington
	major

tavington spurs his horse and rides off without looking
back  his green dragoons thunder after him

martins children begin to cry  margaret tries to revive
thomas lifeless body gently caressing his cheek

			margaret
	thomas please thomas

a sobbing abigale tries to pull her from thomas body

			abigale
	come child come

the redcoats watch in silence  martin looks to gabriel
who is stunned torn between shock and overwhelming guilt
martin turns to the redcoat lieutenant

			martin
	lieutenant please

the lieutenant wavers but a look after the departing
tavington stiffens his resolve

			redcoat lieutenant
	i have my orders  sergeant

the redcoat infantrymen scatter some to get horses and
wagons from the barn others to torch the buildings

martin stands among the children all of whom look to
martin with pleading eyes waiting for him to do
something

			margaret
	papa look what they did to
	thomas

			nathan
	father theyre going to take
	gabriel

with stonefaced fury martin watches the redcoats do
their work

with leveled muskets redcoats motion joshua jonah mica
and abner off  as they turn to abigale she rises up
protectively putting herself in front of the family

			abigale
	im not leaving these children
	you can shoot me you damned
	things

one coarselooking redcoat raises his musket to oblige
martin intercedes with icy silence motioning for abigale
to go  reluctantly she moves away from the children at
gunpoint

from the barns they hear the sounds of muskets firing and
the squeals of the livestock being killed

other redcoats torch the house barn and outbuildings
the flames rise

the redcoats bring out martins wagons and carriages and
begin loading the redcoat wounded

the redcoat lieutenant and several of his men walk among
the patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet
begging for mercy  the redcoats quickly open fire as if
to get it over with

the wounded patriots cry out  more shots  then silence

gabriel his hands bound behind him looks to his father
with a combination of resoluteness and fear

			nathan
	father you cant let them take
	him

			martin
	quiet

martin and the children watch as a detachment of redcoat
infantry forms up and move out leading gabriel on a
tether  gabriel looks back but a hard jerk on the rope by
one of the redcoats turns him around

the remaining redcoats cavalry finish firing the
buildings mount up and head off upriver with the
freedmen in the wagons

the instant the redcoats are out of sight martin speaks
firmly to his weeping children

			martin
	dont move

martin strides to his front door and enters the burning
house

inside fire everywhere  picking a route between the
flames martin walks to his bedroom gun cabinet  he opens
it and pulls out weapons  a pennsylvania rifle two
muskets two pistols a longbladed knife

then he ducks into the closet opens the trunk and takes
out the tomahawk

martin carries it the guns powder horns and ammunition
pouches back toward the door

martin walks out of the burning house  without breaking
stride he throws muskets to

			martin
	nathan samuel

they catch the weapons

			martin
	margaret take william and susan to
	the river shed  hide there  if
	were not back by dawn go upriver
	to the richardsons house  theyll
	take you to your aunt charlottes
	nathan samuel and i are going to
	get gabriel

			margaret
	but what about thomas

			martin
	leave him  take care of william and
	susan

martin runs off toward the woods nathan and samuel
follow  margaret hesitates then herds william and susan
toward the river  the house is enveloped in flames

ext  wooded path  afternoon

martin runs breathing hard keeping a punishing steady
pace  nathan and samuel run behind less winded than
their father  martin makes up with cold fury what he
lacks in youth

ext  wooded hillside  afternoon

martin runs up to the crest of a wooded hill  slows
crawls the last few feet  nathan and samuel just behind
him  looks over the hillside

a path runs through a glen about fifty feet below
martins eyes dart absorbing the terrain looking for
advantage  he points

			martin
	nathan there  samuel there

the boys go where theyre told

			martin
	ill fire first  then nathan kill
	whoever is standing closest to
	gabriel  samuel kill the last man
	in the line

they stagger under the weight of the orders  martin
notices but continues

			martin
	after that samuel load for nathan
	if something happens to me put down
	your weapons and run as fast as you
	can that way downhill  hide in
	the brush by the river then make
	your way home get the others and go
	to aunt charlottes

the boys hesitate  martin looks at them firmly

			martin
	boys steady

			nathan  samuel
	yes father

martin disappears into the underbrush

down the path

the dozen redcoats approach  leading gabriel on the rope

ahead of them

martin waits in the thick undergrowth

on the hillside nathan and samuel grip their muskets and
exchange a frightened troubled look

the redcoats enter the glen

martin waits and waits  then picking his moment he
fires killing the redcoat lieutenant with a shot to the
chest

nathan and samuel instantly fire dropping the last
redcoat in the line and the one holding gabriels rope

the redcoats stop in confusion

gabriel kneels out of the line of fire

the redcoat sergeant takes command

			redcoat sergeant
	form by twos  backtoback lines

martin kills the sergeant with a shot to the throat

samuel finishes reloading swaps muskets with nathan who
fires dropping another redcoat

			redcoat corporal
	ready

martin fires killing the corporal the last man of
rank

martin ducks to the side as a volley of redcoat musket
fire tears into the spot marked by martins rifle smoke

from this moment on martin never stops moving  he
strides rather than runs staying just inside the brush
offering only glimpses of himself  he changes his pace
and direction repeatedly ducking and weaving firing and
loading while moving  he never gives the redcoats a
stationary target especially one marked by billowing
smoke from his flintlock  its an indian tactic and it
works

the redcoats track him with their barrels about to
fire martin suddenly stops dead reverses direction
several redcoats fire and miss

six redcoats left  some primed some reloading  a
redcoat draws a bead on martin who drops to the ground and
fires killing him

another redcoat aims at martin  gabriel bulls into him
causing his shot to go awry

as the redcoat turns on gabriel martin kills him with
another shot

samuel weeping as he loads hands a primed musket to
nathan who fires

the redcoats turn their attention to the spot marked by
nathans smoke

martin sees the redcoats aiming toward the boys  he
instantly strides out into the open drawing the redcoats
attention from his sons

martin fires both his pistols killing two redcoats

one redcoat finishes reloading martin rushes him
shoves aside the barrel and slams him in the face with the
butt of the musket

this is a vicious savage martin killing with the same
stunning brutality seen in the opening sequence

martin drops his own expended rifle and catches the
redcoats loaded musket before it hits the ground shoves
that musket into another redcoats belly and fires

two redcoats left neither finished loading

martin charges drawing his tomahawk ignores a glancing
bayonet wound to the neck hacks a redcoat open

splattering himself with blood

the final redcoat an athletic but cherubicface young
man tries to duck into the woods but martin leaps in
front of him blocking his path

martins sons all with spent weapons watch as the
redcoat grabs a dropped sword and squares off with martin
who is armed only with the tomahawk

the redcoat slashes martin dodges the blow ducks under
another slash and in an unusual but practiced motion
strikes upward with the tomahawk nearly severing the
redcoats arm

then without pausing to offer quarter martin raises the
tomahawk and butchers the redcoat with a quick series of
hacking blows

martins sons are stunned at their fathers savagery

samuel weeps  martin battlefocused checks the redcoats
bodies unaware of his sons eyes on him

ext  fresh water plantation  day

camera tracks past the smoldering remains of martins
house to a close shot of several of thomas lead soldiers
lying in the dirt  martins hand reaches into frame and
picks up the soldiers  widen to reveal martin picking up
thomas body  martins children watch as he carries
thomas off

ext  hilltop  fresh water plantation  day

martin puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on thomas grave
near tears and unsure of what to do next he turns to
elizabeths gravestone  the soft wind blows

he turns and sees his children looking up at him  with an
extreme effort of will he holds in his own tears gathers
the children around him allowing them to cry

ext  bennington overlook  day

martin and his children walking from their home stop at
the overlook seeing the santee river valley spread out
before them  the smoke from two dozen farms rises

			gabriel
	the morgans the halseys williams
	stantons

the smoke from the separate fires joins together high in
the sky forming what looks like stormclouds  they walk
on

ext  charlottes farm  night

martin and his children wait in the cover of the woods
they see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them
from the house gabriel and charlotte

bloodstreaked hand  martin sighs and tucks him in

int  charlottes living room  night

close shot  a drink is poured  pull back to reveal
martin downing the drink pouring and drinking another
behind him charlotte prepares water and bandages at a
washbasin

the sound of horsemen  gabriel walks in tired  he
fights tears

			gabriel
	i never should have come  its why
	hes dead its my fault

gabriel turns to martin as if waiting for reassurance
martin lost in his own grief and guilt says nothing
they stand in silence for a long moment then gabriel
speaks softly

			gabriel
	gates is at hillsboro with the
	continental army  ill leave in the
	morning to join him

martin nods  gabriel leaves martin alone with charlotte
she pours water into the washbowl and motions for martin
to sit  she begins cleaning away the blood and tending
his wounds  she looks after gabriel

			charlotte
	that poor boy

			martin
	how did i let this happen

			charlotte
	neither you nor gabriel could have

the horse out to

ext  barn yard  charlottes plantation  morning

a surprised gabriel sees martin standing next to a
saddled horse with charlotte and the other children
nearby

			gabriel
	where are you going

			martin
	we have some dispatches to deliver

gabriel simply nods already carrying too much weight to
respond strongly  martin turns for goodbyes  he embraces
nathan and samuel then margaret william and susan

			william

			martin
	i dont know william

			william

martin winces  margaret puts her arm around william

martin kisses them both then moves on to susan trying to
coax a word out of the silent fouryearold

			martin
	goodbye

she just looks at him

			martin
	just one word  goodbye  thats all

and yanks restraining him

	no its too late

gabriel struggles with his mount but martin holds fast
gabriel stops turning to the scene unfolding before them

at this distance the moving slashes of color are
beautiful  the slash of red stops  martin and gabriel
hear only a gentle wind and some nearby songbirds  then
from a black mass on the side of the red slash a silent
eruption of white smoke

ext  camden battlefield  day

the noise of cannonfire and screams is deafening as dozens
of cannonballs hurtle through the continental lines

each eighteen pound steel ball cuts it own insane path
through the walls of blueuniformed men leaving a trail
of screaming men severed limbs torn flesh and blood

one cannonball  crushes a skull cuts three men nearly
in half smashes straight through a wagon slams into a
tree killing four more men with a shower of splinters

another cannonball fired low bounces along the ground
shattering leg after leg after leg after leg

another cannonball careens madly changing direction with
each bounce passing harmlessly past scores of terrified
men miraculously touching none

then something hideous  a cannon fires chain shot a
pair of cannonballs linked by chain cutting a sixfoot
wide path of bloody and mutilated men through the ranks

a bank of cannons fire the roar of the cannons is
drowned out by the screams

ext  camden hillside  day

martin and gabriel see the blue slash silently quiver  a
moment later the sound of the cannons rumbles up the
hill

the red slash stops moving  it darkens as thousands of
redcoats raise their muskets and the front rank kneels
into firing position

martins eyes dart  he knows whats coming

			martin
	break for the trees break for the
	trees

a massive eruption of white smoke billows from the red
slash

ext  camden battlefield  day

every single man in the patriot front rank takes a massive
musket ball into or through his body

those in the second rank who are not killed by the balls
passing through the men in front are blinded by a shower
of blood flesh and shards of shattered bone

chaos no advance no retreat nothing to do but
die

ext  camden hillside  day

martin and gabriel see the blue line start to break up
the sound of the british muskets reaches them like the
pattering of rain  the smoke of ineffective scattered
volleys erupts from the patriot lines  the red line holds
firm

			martin
	send them to cover  goddamn you

but the blue line stays in the open field

ext  redcoat command position  day

cornwallis his eyes scanning taking in every detail of
the battle sits on horseback with his staff officers
including tavington  with speed efficiency and
surprising calmness he gives orders to waiting riders

			cornwallis
	second foot wheel right advance
	quick step

cornwallis points  the riders gallop off to deliver the
order

			cornwallis
	second brigade horse charge at
	will
		   another rider goes
	colonel tavington have at their
	militia

			tavington
	with pleasure sir

tavington smiles grimly and gallops off to join his men

ext  camden hillside  day

martin and gabriel watch as fast moving green and red
masses move quickly onto the battlefield  cavalry

			gabriel
	father we have to do something

martin shakes his head still holding gabriels reins
tightly

ext  camden battlefield  day

the british cavalry thunders into whats left of the
patriot lines  redcoats and green dragoons armed with
sabers hack and slash at the wounded disoriented
continentals

one patriot dismounts a redcoat only to have another
redcoat cut him open from behind

behind the cavalry redcoat infantry including a brigade
of african redcoats advancing at a run bayonets
leveled

one after another patriot is knocked to the ground and
trampled by the cavalry  the screams continue

ext  camden hillside  day

martin and gabriel see tiny bits of blue moving in every
direction away from the masses of red and green

			gabriel
	father

			martin
	its already over

martin turns his horse and heads down the hill toward the
rear of the patriot lines  behind them the colors swirl
and dance silently on the distant field

ext  american encampment  night

a nightmare  screams of agony  a few hundred battered
patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move
out

martin and gabriel ride into camp passing nervous
sentries  they dismount and walk past a field surgery
which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs
and arms

gabriel notices something stops and picks up a tattered
flag old glory covered with blood and mud and nearly
torn to bits  a battered wounded continental limps by
seeing gabriel trying to piece the flag together

			wounded continental
	dont bother its a lost cause

gabriel considers the words then sees martin near harry
lee who is at a makeshift command post barking orders
trying to pull things together  gabriel stuffs the flag
into his haversack and hurries over

			lee
	lieutenant detail men for
	outriders  we move out as soon as
	the wounded are ready

			lieutenant
	yes sir

the lieutenant rushes off  lee notices martin and
gabriel  he jerks his head for them to follow him into

lees command tent

dark  once out of sight of the men lee loses his command
bearing  exhausted he leans on his campaign table

			martin
	im sorry i wasnt here for this

			lee
	theres nothing you could have done
	gates is a damned fool

			martin
	we saw

			lee
	i begged him to stay in the cover of
	the trees but he insisted the only
	way to break cornwallis was muzzle
	tomuzzle  too many years in the
	british army

			martin
	where is he now

			lee
	last anyone saw riding hard
	northeast his staff a hundred yards
	behind trying to catch up

			martin
	whos in command

			lee
	i am i think

			martin
	what are my orders

lee gives martin a tired smile

			lee
	why the change of heart

			martin
	green dragoons came to my home
	killed my son thomas  it was
	tavington himself

lee winces and looks at martin with silent sympathy
then taking his cue from martins hard expression lee
steps over to his campaign table and rolls out a map

			lee
	were a breath away from losing this
	war  in the north washington is
	reeling from valley forge running
	and hiding from clinton and twelve
	thousand redcoats
		   pointing
	here in the south cornwallis has
	broken our back  he captured over
	five thousand of our troops when he
	took charleston and today he
	destroyed the only army that stood
	between him and new york

			martin
	so now cornwallis will head north
	link up with clinton and finish off
	washington

			lee
	unless we can keep cornwallis in the
	south until the french arrive a
	fleet and ten thousand troops

			martin
	when

			lee
	fall six months at the earliest

			martin
	and youre sure the french are
	coming

a voice speaks up out a dark corner of the tent

			delancey os
	absolutement

jean delancey steps out of the shadows  hes about
martins age and wears a french majors uniform

			lee
	benjamin martin major jean
	delancey french seventh light foot

delancey nods coolly to martin

			delancey
	i know him by reputation

gabriel notes the comment  martin ignores it  delancey
stabs the map with his finger

			delancey
	the bigger problem is not if or when
	my countrymen will arrive but
	where  our admiral de grasse will
	not sail north of your chesapeake
	bay for fear of early storms
		   shrugs
	navy

			martin
		   to lee
	so youre going to try to keep
	cornwallis in the south until then

			lee
	not me you and major delancey  im
	going north with every continental
	i can find to reinforce washington
	or he wont last six weeks

martin turns to delancey

			martin
	how many men do you have

delancey motions to himself  martin turns back to lee

			martin
	you expect cornwallis to be held
	here by militia

			lee
	held slowed down

			martin
	theyre not soldiers theyre
	farmers  and youre asking them to
	hold a tiger in their backyard
	theyd be better off letting it move
	on

			lee
	theyd be better off but the cause
	wouldnt be

			martin
	how many men does cornwallis have
	under his command

			lee
	four thousand infantry and around
	six hundred cavalry
		   beat
	 including the green dragoons
	under tavington

martin and lee lock eyes  martin nods  lee quickly
writes

			lee

	a colonel

he hands the order to martin

			martin
	id like you to transfer my son
	here into my command

			gabriel
	sir no i

martin and lee simultaneously turn to gabriel with a
doublebarreled glare  gabriel backs down

			gabriel
	yes sir

ext  american encampment  evening

martin gabriel and delancey stand watching lee and his
continental regulars move out  gabriel turns to martin

			gabriel
	ive been doing this for two years
	im the best scout in the
	continental army the best horseman
	the best shot the best scavenger

			martin
	is that so

			gabriel
	yes sir  i could be of better
	service with the regulars

martin looks at gabriel closely  delancey listens

			martin
	whered you learn all those things

			martin
	he teach you humility

			gabriel
	he tried  it didnt take

			martin
	well he did teach you every deer
	path and swamp trail between here
	and charleston which is why he
	asked for your transfer

			gabriel
	not to keep an eye on me

martin mounts up having lost patience with gabriels
personal concerns  he turns to delancey

			martin
	can you ride

delancey looks at martin with a tolerant expression that
says with perfect clarity what the fuck do you think
delancey mounts up  martin shrugs

			martin
	we put out the word  well start
	along the south side of the
	santee

			gabriel
	wed cover more ground if we split
	up

martin holds his temper

			martin
	its safer if we stay together

			gabriel
	so i was right

martin sighs his anger dissipating  he rolls his eyes

			martin
	alright corporal you take
	bennington harrisville acworth and
	the farms along black swamp  major

gabriel bristles

			gabriel
	yes sir

martin shakes his head at gabriels pigheadedness and they
ride off  as they go martin turns to delancey

			martin
	you have children

delancey stonefaced pointedly does not answer  martin
notes that and shuts up  they ride on

ext  british field headquarters  camden  day

a massive british army field encampment  large
detachments of redcoats march through endless rows of
tents  some are battleworn others are fresh troops
moving out

tavington and his green dragoons covered with dirt and
sweat ride in  tavington and wilkins peel off
dismounting in front of an elegant mansion that has been
commandeered for british headquarters  they stride in

int  cornwallis headquarters  camden mansion  day

british officers clerks and aides work  theyre in good
spirits  tavington and wilkins enter  lord cornwallis a
proud man comfortable with command coldly notes one of
his officers slapping tavington on the back

			cornwallis
	gentlemen

tavington rolls out a map for cornwallis  the officers
gather around

			cornwallis
	colonel tavington this is not an
	adequate map

			tavington
	we have better coming on the
	trailing supply convoy from
	charleston

			cornwallis
	a useful place for our maps

tavington swallows his anger

			tavington
	im sorry sir  it wont happen
	again

			cornwallis
	see that it doesnt  gentlemen
	celebration is premature  we have a
	difficult campaign ahead of us  we
	are in predominately hostile country
	and we cannot rely on forage  as we
	move north the bulk of our supplies
	will reach us by sea through
	charleston which will give us a
	long and vulnerable supply line one
	that can only be secured if the
	locals are loyal to the crown

			cornwallis officers
		   multiple
	yes sir

			cornwallis
	nonetheless and i speak
	specifically to you colonel
	tavington we must remember that
	this is a civil war

tavington proudly holds cornwallis look

			cornwallis
	these colonials are our brethren and
	when this conflict is over we will
	be reestablishing commerce with
	them  surrendering troops will be
	given quarter and unwarranted
	assaults on civilians will cease

wilkins shifts uneasily  tavington isnt cowed

			cornwallis
	i expect this war to be fought in a
	vigorous but civilized manner

cornwallis looks at his other officers

			cornwallis
	have i made myself clear gentlemen

			officers
		   multiple
	yes sir

cornwallis shifts his eyes back to tavington who was not
among those who spoke  tavington pointedly pauses a
moment then says

			tavington
	yes sir

cornwallis turns his attention back to the map  his men
gather around  tavington seethes

ext  cornwallis field headquarters  camden  day

tavington and wilkins walk out

			wilkins
	hmmm that was unpleasant

			tavington
	did you know that lord cornwallis
	father was a tenant on the estate of
	my grandfather

wilkins laughs uneasily  tavington rides off  wilkins
follows

int  church  pembroke  day

rev oliver a stern and sturdy man of the cloth
addresses his flock among whom are mr and mrs howard
anne and dan scott and rob fielding decent craftsmen
gabriel slips in and sits in the rear pew

			rev oliver
	 and so those of us who call
	ourselves patriots must ask
	ourselves first how best we might
	serve the lord knowing that service
	to him is rendered here on earth
	ask yourself if it is possible to
	forsake righteousness in the pursuit
	of justice and freedom

gabriel stands

			gabriel
	and end up like those men outside

all eyes turn to gabriel

			gabriel
	your liberty is in jeopardy more
	dire than that which threatens your
	righteousness

hardwick skeptically shakes his head and jerks his head
out toward the hanging bodies

			hardwick
	if king george can hang those men
	out there he can hang any of us

			gabriel
	if enough of you come with me and
	serve in the patriot militia you
	wont have to be afraid of king
	george

			hardwick
	i do fear king george and know of no
	reason why i should test him

a light female voice speaks out

			anne os
	liberty thats the reason

they all turn to see anne  a few of the men roll their
eyes at her earnestness  gabriel looks at her
appreciatively  her father is surprised but guardedly
proud as she continues

			anne
	if we let the redcoats take away our
	godgiven rights then we serve
	neither god nor ourselves we serve
	only king george

silence  rev oliver locks his eyes on anne who withers a
bit

			rev oliver
	anne

			anne
	im sorry reverend

			rev oliver
	dont be  i couldnt have said it
	better myself

rev oliver takes off his clerical robe revealing a south
carolina militia uniform

			rev oliver
	as i was saying we must ask
	ourselves how best we might serve
	here on earth

a moment  dan scott stands  another moment  rob
fielding stands  another moment  hardwick stands
gabriel nods pleased then steals a quick appreciative
glance at anne

ext  bradford crossroads  night

martin and delancey ride slowly into town which is little
more than a crossroads  an inn a trading post a livery
stable and a few shacks and tents  the people they pass
shoot suspicious glares at them  as they stop in front of
the boars head inn and tavern delancey looks around

			delancey
	what sort of recruits will you find
	here

int  boars head tavern  night

dark  smokefilled  ominous  a dozen coarse heavily
armed grizzled men drink at roughhewn tables in the
filthy tavern  among them are brother randolph a native
american danvers a onearmed hardlooking man and
occam a stronglooking gentlyeyed african

martin and delancey walk in and stop at the door met by
cold hard glares from every man in the place  delancey
speaks quietly to martin unheard by the patrons

			delancey
	you are sure this is the right place
	to recruit

martin steps forward and calls out loudly

			martin
	god save king george

every man in the place rises glaring viciously at martin
and delancey  martin turns to delancey

			martin
	were in the right place

int  boars head tavern  later

martin sits at a table writing out enlistment scripts
the rough men are gathered around drinking smoking
watching

			brother joseph
	any bounty

			martin
	no scalp money but you can keep or
	sell back to me the muskets and gear
	of any redcoat you kill  twenty
	shillings a kit

brother joseph nods takes a script  john billings a
big grizzled man about martins age steps up to the
table

			billings
	you expect to hold cornwallis with
	militia

martin looks up with a thin familiar smile

			martin
	john billings been some time

			billings
	trust you and harry lee  remember
	that damned overland you two thought
	up in 62 to hit fort louis

			martin
	it worked

billings nods and takes a drink  he trades bottle for
script with martin who drinks as billings signs  rollins
a huge beast of a man sits with his feral redhaired
frecklefaced sixyearold son at his side  rollins
spits a huge hocker of tobacco juice onto the floor

			rollins
	twenty shillings kit bounty
	thats like to get me near rich
	im in

danvers steps up takes the bottle from martin and drinks

			danvers
	my brother got hanged down to

	cut him down hes all swelled up
		   holds up his stump
	i aint no good to you but you can
	have my negro here fight in my

ext  snows island  santee swamps  night

a cacophony of birds and insects  swamp maples and
willows form a canopy over mosscovered mounds and pools
of plantchoked water  gabriel leads several men riding
along a dry path that snakes through the swamp  they
cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island where
martin and a dozenandahalf coarselooking men are
encamped

close shot  several of thomas brightly painted lead
soldiers melt in a castiron pan

gabriel steps up behind martin and watches as he pours the
lead into a bullet mold

			gabriel
	this war is about more than thomas

			martin
	how many did you get

			gabriel
	twelve

martin glances at the new arrivals as gabriel looks over
at the knot of coarse men martin got  occam sits apart
from the coarse men gripping a bible  gabriel doesnt
notice him

			gabriel
	thats not the sort we need

			martin
	thats just the sort we need

martin closes the lid of the bullet mold and dips it into
a bucket of water which hisses and steams  billings and
delancey listen

			gabriel
	if youre here only for revenge
	youre doing a disservice to thomas
	as well as yourself

			martin
	how old are you

			gabriel
	you know how old i am

			martin
	god help us all when youre forty

martin takes the still hot bullets from the mold and puts
them in a pouch attached to his weapons belt  gabriel
shakes his head and heads off to tend his horse

			billings
	what about me  am i one of that
	sort

			martin
	youre the sort that gives that sort
	a bad name

billings considers that and takes a drink

			martin
	put away the bottle  we move out in
	two hours

ext  swamp road  day

a raised road through the dark swamp  only mottled
sunlight pierces the canopy  insects buzz

a british supply train of several dozen wagons a herd of
horses and accompanying redcoats makes its way down the
road

in the darkness of the swamps on either side of the road
shadowed figures obscured by the mud water and foliage
track them

all is still a bird screeches

both sides of the road erupts in musket fire

perfectly aimed shots fired by unseen men hidden deep
within the swamp

first the redcoat men of rank fall a captain a
lieutenant two sergeants then the corporals

then the slaughter of the privates begins

they try to gather themselves for a volley but the
withering crossfire is relentless

a few redcoats get off shots to no effect and those who
fire are immediately targeted and killed

its a battle with ghosts that cannot be won by the
exposed redcoats

down to a dozen redcoats most with spent muskets

no chance they abandon the wagons and flee back down
the road

only to find their way suddenly blocked by

martin and a phalanx of the roughest of his men standing
directly in their path in the middle of the road

martin raises his tomahawk and charges followed closely
by billings delancey brother randolph and others

they wade into the terrified redcoats firing at point
blank range hacking at them with tomahawk and sword and
knife

at the wagons gabriel rev oliver scott and others
scramble up onto the road

watch stunned at the viciousness with which martin and
his cohort slaughter the redcoats

two redcoats left about to throw down their weapons
delancey and billings race up to them and hack them to
death delancey using his sword billings his massive
hunting knife

gabriel and rev oliver are appalled

			rev oliver
	stop

too late the redcoats fall all dead

silence everyone stops where they stand catching their
breath surveying the scene through a hovering cloud of
musket smoke

			gabriel
	father  those men were about to
	surrender

billings laughs  delancey shrugs

			delancey
	perhaps  we shall never know shall
	we

that angers gabriel rev oliver and the civilized men
near them

			rev oliver
	that was murder

martin looks around at the carnage

			martin
	a delicate distinction

he sees that his brigade has divided into two hostile
groups

			martin
	 but in the future wounded and
	surrendering british soldiers will
	be given quarter

			delancey
	i piss on your delicate
	distinction

the men all stop

			delancey
	a british manofwar made no such
	distinction when it fired on a
	packet carrying my wife and
	daughters

all eyes turn to delancey

			delancey
	i stood on a bark two hundred yards
	off watching as they were burned
	alive

silence

			martin
	you have my sympathy but the order
	stands

			delancey
	piss on your sympathy  who are you
	to give such an order  i know what
	you and your men did at fort charles
	to my countrymen

gabriel notes the comment

			martin
	im the commanding officer of this
	brigade  this is militia not
	regular army  every man here comes
	and goes as he pleases but while
	hes here he follows my orders

delancey calmly leans down and uses the coat of the man he
just killed to wipe the blood from the blade of his sword
he stands

			delancey
	i serve at my pleasure  i do not
	serve under you

he grips his sword  all eyes shift to martin for his
response  martin holding his bloody tomahawk locks eyes
with delancey  a tense moment

a commotion of barking dogs and yelling men draws their
attention  the standoff breaks  delancey nods

			delancey
	and it is my pleasure to give
	quarter to wounded and surrendering
	british soldiers for the time
	being

thats good enough for martin  he strides over toward the
wagons where he finds billings cowering before two huge
great danes standing guard at one of the wagons

			billings
	shoot them  shoot the damn things

rollins prepares to do so

			martin
	put that pistol down

			scott
	they followed us from the bridge
	they wont let anyone near the
	wagon

martin steps forward speaking softly but firmly to the
dogs

			martin
	stay stay stay

the dogs waver between obeying martin and ripping out his
throat

			martin
	dont you growl at me

the dogs decide to obey  martin lets them sniff his hand
then firmly pats them

			martin
	now lets see whats in this wagon

several of the men check out the wagons  billings eases
past the dogs  scott opens a large case and finds it
filled with bottles

			scott
	rum french champagne madeira
	port

			billings
	no wonder they were guarding it

gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered
wigs all perfectly coifed and stored on headshaped wig
stands  rev oliver opens one of several identical cases
and finds it filled with papers

			rev oliver
	my heavens personal correspondence
	of lord cornwallis

martin grabs some papers scans them then finds matching
cases on nearby wagons

			martin
	these four wagons must be his

			gabriel
	and the dogs too ill wager

			billings
	i say we drink the wine shoot the
	dogs and use the papers for musket
	wadding

			martin
	his journals letters maps
	books

scott calls from another wagon

			scott
	colonel we got a wagon full of
	officers uniforms and more powder
	and muskets here

ignoring scott martin grabs another handful of the papers
and starts to read

ext  snows island encampment  night

camera moves through the encampment as martins men take
inventory of the british wagons  the coarse men are
drunkenly celebrating  drinking cornwallis champagne and
fine wine trying on his magnificent dress uniforms
wearing his wigs askew sniffing his perfumes playing
catch with a crystal vase

gabriel sits at a different campfire hamhandedly trying
to repair the tattered old glory with a needle and thread
the civilized men and delancey take inventory casting
sidelong glances at the coarse men  delancey is mostly
interested in the weapons

			delancey
	 twohundredsixtysix brown bess
	muskets fortyone casks of powder
	balls tamping

rev oliver writes it down

			billings
	we have enough arms for an army
	now all we need is an army

rollins clutching a bottle of champagne wearing a
powdered wig askew staggers over jerking his head toward
delancey

			rollins
	thats his job french army
	sometime fore this is all over
	huh

			delancey
	in time trust me in time

martin sits apart from the men at cornwallis ornate
folding campaign desk reading cornwallis journal
surrounded by cornwallis field gear which includes
furniture music boxes oil paintings and an elaborate
folding commode  martins old boots stand empty while he
wears a new distinctive pair apparently from cornwallis
baggage  the two great danes sit nearby eyeing martin
warily

ext  snows island  dawn

the men are beginning to stir gathering around the
campfires cooking using pots pans and other gear from
the stolen british wagons

martin hasnt moved  he still reads cornwallis journal
finally he looks up sees that its dawn stretches and
walks over to a campfire where billings delancey and rev
oliver cook  the dogs follow at a distance

gabriel sews having made a bit but only a bit of
progress with the badly damaged old glory

			billings
	well

			martin
	ive just been inside the mind of a
	genius  lord cornwallis knows more
	about war than i could in a dozen
	lifetimes

			billings
	cheerful news to greet the morn

			martin
	his victories at charleston and
	camden were perfect strategically
	tactically logistically  but he
	has a weakness

they all turn to martin

			martin
	lord cornwallis is brilliant  his
	weakness is that he knows it

			gabriel
	father

			martin
	pride is his weakness

the men consider that

			delancey
	personally id would prefer
	stupidity

			martin
	pride will do

begin montage  series of shots as follows

 a volley of musket fire erupts from some thick
   underbrush cutting down half of a squadron of redcoats
   on the march  the surviving redcoats fire back into
   the trees at unseen targets to little effect

 martin rides with about fifty men

 a british supply convoy makes its way through the
   woods  suddenly martins men appear rising up from
   the ground as if by magic having been camouflaged by
   leaves and brush  they open fire on the convoy escort
   which holds for a moment then flees

 martin rides with about seventyfive men

 cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously
   flings it across the room

 martin rides with about one hundred men

   known as the swamp fox

 snows island  martin and his men do an inventory of a
   large haul of stolen british supply wagons  the booty
   includes dozens of brass musical instruments some of
   which martins men blare in celebration

 a column of wounded redcoats limps into a village past
   the watchful eyes of some townsmen among whom are
   drake and christopher  the two americans exchange a
   look

int  cornwallis personal quarters  evening

a valet scurries  a distressed halfdressed cornwallis
looks at his reflection in a fulllength mirror
tavington watches hiding his amusement  a second valet
hurries in with an elaborate dress coat

			valet 2

ext  camden plantation house  night

cornwallis steps to a curtainedged doorway attended by
his staff officers  he looks out at the ball lit by
hundreds of candles torches and lanterns which bath the
scene in soft golden light

among the guests is a patrician his face unseen standing
casually within earshot looking the other direction
wearing a distinctive pair of boots

two of cornwallis subordinate officers walk by with
lovely colonial women on their arms  both of the officers
wear dress uniforms that put cornwallis slapdash
creation to shame  cornwallis deflates then sees the
ships being unloaded

			cornwallis

	i uh understand and it has the
	loveliest creations for you from the
	finest charleston tailors

			cornwallis
	the finest charleston tailors how
	encouraging

cornwallis notices the braiding on the curtain next to
him  to his horror it matches the braiding on his dress
coat and worse a twofoot portion of the curtains
braiding is missing  cornwallis grimaces and skitters
away from the curtain in as dignified a manner as he can
muster

as he goes he comes facetoface with the patrician who
turns revealing martin  they have an instant of eye
contact before cornwallis moves on  cornwallis senses
something familiar about martins boots and looks back
curiously then continues off

martin steps over to a low balustrade and looks out at the
docks seeing the york tied up on the right side of the
dock  he lifts a lantern and places it on the right side
of column

shadows below the curve of the hull  gabriel takes a leg
up from rev oliver and pulls himself into an open cannon
port  delancey hands him a gunpowder cask  gabriel
disappears inside the ship

ext  camden plantation house  night

cornwallis speaks with some staff officers and loyalist
civilians among whom are simms and the spectacular mrs

a massive explosion lights up the night as the york erupts
in a huge fireball  british officers including
tavington rush over

cornwallis looks out at the fireball with silent fury

ext  camden river  night

martins men row away from the burning ship  a secondary
explosion bursts from the york in the background

ext  camden plantation house  night

more british officers and loyalist civilians crowd the
balustrade watching the york  yes another explosion on
the york sends up a fireball which arches over the docks
and disappears into the open hatch of the bristol  an
instant later the bristol explodes

cornwallis sees that and nearly explodes himself  he
turns to tavington and barks

			cornwallis
	colonel tavington to horse  see if

cornwallis and disappears into the shadows

int  annes bedroom  howard house  night

gabriel lies stiffly on one side of annes bed while her
mother carefully sews him into a bodysized bundling
bag a courtship ritual of the period

with anne looking on embarrassed her mother finishes the
last few stitches completely enclosing gabriel with only
his head sticking out of the heavy canvas bag

annes mother gathers up her sewing kit and joins her
husband who looks on sternly from the doorway

			anne
	you neednt worry father

			mr howard
	i know

			mrs howard
	dear come

annes parents leave them alone taking their candle
plunging the room into near darkness

gabriel stiffly lies back on the bed  anne stiffly lies
next to him  silence  they look at the ceiling  they
both choke back titters of laughter  then the dam breaks
they laugh together at the craziness of the ritual

int  annes parents bedroom  night

dark  annes parents lie in bed listening  through the
wall they can her the murmured jabbering of gabriel and
anne talking and laughing a mile a minute in the adjacent
bedroom  they exchange a look  mr howard is worried

intimately apart from everyone  howard smiles and gives
a little rough laugh

			mr howard
	he reminds me of you before you got
	old and ugly

			martin
	no he takes after his mother

howard is taken aback by the gentleness of martins words

			martin

	her but gabriel spent more time with
	elizabeth she taught him well
	guided him she was his north star
	and mine
		   beat
	 gabriels already a better man
	than i could ever hope to be

			mr howard

martin looks at howard as if he were crazy  then he
shakes himself out of it and adopts a coarse joking tone

			martin
	what do you mean old and ugly

			mr howard
	you got me beat on both accounts

			martin
	the hell i do

martin mount up grateful to leave the sincerity behind
gabriel and anne sees martin and his men starting to ride
off  he grabs anne by the arm pulls her behind a tree
and gives her a goodbye kiss a real kiss

then leaving anne breathless he runs to his horse
mounts with a dramatic leap and gallops off taking his
place at his fathers side

martin looks over  gabriel smiles revealing his
blackened teeth  martin looks at the teeth curiously as
they ride away

anne and the other townspeople watch them go  anne
smiles revealing her own teeth blackened from gabriels
kiss

ext  charleston road  day

martin his men sit on their motionless horses in the
middle of the road  they hear a sound approaching then
see two british wagons round a curve with a guard of only
six redcoats commanded by a redcoat sergeant  the
redcoat sergeant signals stop

			redcoat sergeant
	halt  look alive boys

the young redcoat privates nervously unshoulder their
muskets

			martin
	sergeant this road is closed
	those wagons now belong to the
	continental army

			redcoat sergeant
	ready arms  by twos

martins surprised by the sergeants order

			martin
	sergeant theres no reason for you
	and your men to die  just leave the
	wagons and go

			redcoat sergeant
	steady boys

martin sighs and lets loose with a piercing whistle  the
underbrush parts and more of martins men show themselves
muskets leveled at the outnumbered redcoats

			redcoat sergeant
	this is the kings highway and i
	advise you and your men to make way
		   to his men
	prepare to fire

martin exchanges a look with rev oliver who like martin
doesnt want to kill these men  seeing no other option
martin turns to give the order then stops hearing a
faint barely detectable rumbling sound

a moment later brother joseph hears it as well horses
hooves lots of them growing louder by the second
thundering toward them from the road behind the british
wagons

then the sound of more horses coming in fast on both
flanks

			martin
	its a trap

the canvas sides of the british wagons are thrown up and
dozens of redcoats armed with muskets spill out

martins unmounted men run to their horses leaping into
their saddles

then green dragoons appear galloping down the wooded
slopes on both flanks astonishing horsemen weaving
through the trees without slacking their pace swords
drawn pistols primed

			redcoat sergeant
	fire

a thunderous volley erupts from the redcoat infantry
killing several of martins men

martins men fire back from their bucking mounts most of
their shots going awry

behind the british wagons a huge detachment of green
dragoons appears tavington among them

martin sees the dragoons but not tavington himself

martin and his men spur their mounts taking off down the
road in the opposite direction

the flanking bodies of dragoons gallop out of the woods
joining the main body riding in hard pursuit

ext  wooded road  day

martin and his men gallop down the road  the much larger
body of green dragoons thunder after them

ext  black swamp road  day

martin and his men ride along a raised road that drops off
into black swamp on either side

they round a curve and stop reining back their horses in
confusion as they see

fifty green dragoons heading straight toward them

the dragoons open fire from both directions killing
several more of martins men wounding others

martins men fire back as best they can caught in the
chaos of bucking and falling horses and wounded and
dismounted men

martin and his men head off both sides of the road into
the swamp

on the road a dozenandahalf of martins men are
surrounded by green dragoons they surrender

the rest of the green dragoons including tavington spur
their horses into the swamps racing after martin

ext  black swamp  late afternoon

martin and his men ride hard along a circuitous barely
visible trail that is covered with shallow water  several
of the men are badly wounded barely clinging to their
saddles  other men share mounts

they get to a fork split up  as they disappear into the
swamp the sounds of their horses are swallowed up in the
loud buzzing of swamp insects and the cries of the swamp
birds

a moment later tavington and the vanguard of dragoons
ride up  tavington signals stop at the fork

looks nothing  listens nothing  chooses a path
the one martin took  rides off the dragoons following

ext  swamp morass  evening

tavington and fifteen of his dragoons struggle through a
nearly impassable morass of swampgrass reeds and
swarming mosquitoes

the exhausted dragoons are wet covered with mud and
bleeding from swamp briars  the horses are spent and
foaming

tavington struggles harder than any but finally even he
has had enough  he reins back his horse

			tavington
	halt

tavington glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant
choked water and swamp

			tavington
	enough of this  there are other
	ways to run down a fox

tavington yanks on his reins turns his horse and starts
back the way they came  his grateful men turn their
horses and follow

in the undergrowth martin and about ten of his men calm
their horses  several of the wounded men are on the
ground being tended by gabriel and others

they can hear but not see the dragoons  then through
the thick undergrowth martin catches a glimpse of
tavington

gabriel sees his father lock his eyes on tavington

martin quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one
of the bullets he made from thomas lead soldiers
walking to his horse martin loads

martin mounts scanning the terrain planning a route

			gabriel
	father no

as martin spurs his horse to ride after tavington gabriel
grabs the bridle  he yanks hard stopping martins horse
dead  the horse bucks nearly throwing martin

			martin
	thats him  tavington

martin spurs the horse which tries to respond but is
jerked back again by gabriel  martin angrily turns on his
son

			martin
	damn you  let go

gabriel looks up at his father never loosening his iron
grip on the bridles but speaking softly almost
pleadingly

			gabriel
	father please

martin looks down at gabriel then over at rev oliver and
the wounded men one bleeds from an ugly neck wound
another is unconscious their shared mounts are nearly
spent

martin takes a last look in the direction of the departing
tavington  he drops the reins giving control of the
horse to gabriel and sighs with more anger than
resignation

			martin
	you should have let me kill him

			gabriel
	at the expense of your men  or when
	he killed thomas at the expense of
	your family

			martin
	no

			gabriel
	or perhaps tomorrow at the expense
	of our cause

martin is silent  then he dismounts and heads over to
help the wounded  gabriel watches his father for a
moment then joins him with the wounded

ext  fort carolina  day

a redcoat sentry sees a lone figure on horseback ride out
of distant woods  its martin carrying a white flag and
a dispatch case trailed by the two great danes  the
sentry calls to the commander of the watch

int  cornwallis headquarters  fort carolina  day

a temporary hq has been set up in a grand commandeered
plantation house  cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a
incompetentlooking provincial tailor measures him and
marks alterations on a partially completed uniform  major
halbert enters and hands cornwallis martins dispatch
case

			major halbert
	general a rider is outside  he
	claims to be the commander of the
	rebel militia  he has a pair of
	great danes with him

a surprised cornwallis takes the message and reads it

			cornwallis
	it seems our swamp fox wants to have
	a formal parley

cornwallis smiles confidently

ext  fort carolina  day

the gates are opened and martin rides in trailed by the
great danes flanked by halfadozen redcoat cavalry
redcoats and green dragoons stop in their tracks  all
eyes are on martin as he is escorted to the plantation
house

from the far side of the assembly yard tavington watches
martin curiously not recognizing him

int  cornwallis headquarters  day

major halbert ushers martin in  the great danes follow
sniffing sensing something or someone

			major halbert
	lord cornwallis will be with you
	presently

major halbert gives martin a derisive glance and leaves
martin alone except for the dogs allows himself a
fleeting smile  then he looks around the room  he notes
a rocking chair  curious he hefts it  too heavy  he
puts it down sits and rocks

the dogs walk over to him  one of the dogs lays its head
in martins lap  he scratches it behind the ears  the
other dog wants to play  martin stands  the dog jumps
up putting its front legs on martins shoulders and licks
his face just as cornwallis walks in  cornwallis is taken
aback by the display of affection but overjoyed to see
his dogs

			cornwallis
	jupiter  mars

the dogs just look at cornwallis  he holds out his arms
waiting for them to rush to him  they look up at martin
who nods to them

			martin
	go

the dogs run to cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly
but not enthusiastic manner  cornwallis pats them
vigorously too vigorously for the moderate level of joy
the dogs are showing at their reunion

			cornwallis
	my boys my boys you seem to
	have been well fed  thank you for
	that colonel

			martin
	my pleasure sir

			cornwallis
	please forgive me for keeping you
	waiting

			martin
	apology accepted

			cornwallis
	thank you colonel im afraid i
	dont know your name

			martin
	colonel will do

			cornwallis
	as you wish

tavington enters with four dragoons all armed

martin freezes

martin and tavington lock eyes  martin searches for some
sign that tavington recognizes him  theres none

			cornwallis
	colonel colonel william
	tavington

tavington nods

			tavington
	colonel

martin like ice looks tavington up and down  then he
slowly turns and looks at the four dragoons two on either
side of tavington  martin measures the odds and finds
them wanting

with a supreme effort of will martin forces himself to
turn from tavington to cornwallis and the matter at hand

			martin
	shall we proceed

			cornwallis
	let us  unless you object i would
	like to deem this meeting a formal
	negotiation and as such there are
	certain customary practices
	perhaps i could explain them to
	you

			martin
	im familiar with how a formal
	negotiation is handled

			cornwallis
	oh

			martin
	i served in his majestys army in
	the french and indian war

			cornwallis
	oh  very well then  would you as
	the initiating party like to begin

			martin
	unless you would like to claim
	aggrieved status

cornwallis is surprised  he exchanges a look with
tavington

			cornwallis
	you are familiar with how these
	things are done  in fact i would
	like to claim aggrieved status

			martin
	very well proceed sir

			cornwallis
	first you have in your possession
	certain belongings of mine
	including clothing private papers
	furniture and personal effects of a
	nonmilitary nature which i would
	like to have returned to me

			martin
	i will do so as soon as possible

cornwallis is surprised

			cornwallis
	thank you

			martin
	please accept my apology for not
	having done so sooner

			cornwallis
	apology accepted  now on the
	matter of the specific targeting of
	officers during engagements this is
	absolutely unacceptable

			martin
	that one is a bit more difficult

			cornwallis
	certainly you must know that in
	civilized warfare officers in the
	field must not be accorded
	inappropriate levels of hostile
	attention

			martin
	and what are inappropriate levels of
	hostile attention

			cornwallis
	colonel imagine the utter chaos
	that would result from unled armies
	having at each other  there must be
	gentlemen in command to lead and
	when appropriate restrain their
	men

			martin
	restrain them from the targeting of
	civilians including women and
	children

			cornwallis
	that is a separate issue

			martin
	i consider them linked

			cornwallis
	i beg to differ  one is a command
	decision on your part  the other
	represents nothing more than the
	occasional overexuberance of field
	officers attempting to carry out
	their duty in difficult
	circumstances

			martin
	as long as your soldiers attack
	civilians i will order the shooting
	of your officers at the outset of
	every engagement
		   beat
	and my men are excellent marksmen

cornwallis sighs

			cornwallis
	very well let us move on to

			martin
	prisoner exchange

			cornwallis
	sir

			martin
	you have eighteen of my men  i want
	them back

			cornwallis
	i do have eighteen criminals under
	sentence of death but i hold no
	prisonersofwar

			martin
	if thats your position then
	eighteen of your officers will die
	nineteen if you hang me with my
	men

			cornwallis
	what officers

martin steps to the window checks the view  a wooded
hillside is visible in the distance  martin reaches into
his jacket

the dragoons move on him

martin extracts not a weapon but a spyglass which he
hands to cornwallis

			martin
	in the clearing just down from the
	crest to the left of the dark
	pines

cornwallis looks through the spyglass

view through the spyglass

though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering
haze cornwallis can just make out a row of bound redcoat
officers with patriot soldiers holding muskets at their
heads

cornwallis turns coldly to martin

			cornwallis
	their names ranks and posts

			martin
	they refused to give me their names
	their ranks are nine lieutenants
	five captains three majors and one
	fat colonel who called me a cheeky
	fellow  their posts  we picked
	them up hereandthere last night

cornwallis glares at martin

			cornwallis
	you are not a gentleman

martin cant help but laugh at the insult

			martin
	if your conduct is the measure of a
	gentleman i take that as a
	compliment
		   coldly
	get my men

cornwallis turns to colonel huntington

			cornwallis
	arrange the exchange

colonel huntington leaves to do so

			martin
	thank you general  im sure your
	officers will thank you as well

martin salutes cornwallis who doesnt return the salute

then martin turns to tavington  he walks up to him and
looks him in the eye

			martin
	you dont remember me do you

tavington examines martins face finding him familiar
but unable to place him then tavington remembers

			tavington
	ah yes that boy

tavington calmly holds martins glare

			tavington
	ugly business doing ones duty

			martin
	yes ugly business doing ones
	duty

martin takes a step closer to tavington then speaks very
softly very slowly very clearly

			martin
	if you are alive when this war is
	over im going to kill you

martin locks his eyes on tavington to make it perfectly
clear that he means what he says  tavington tries to
cover his reaction but its apparent that hes taken aback
by martins icy words

martin turns and walks out  the two great danes start to
follow but cornwallis snaps a command

			cornwallis
	jupiter  mars

the dogs freeze looking after martin who doesnt turn
back  the dogs reluctantly sidle over to cornwallis
side

ext  assembly yard  fort carolina  day

redcoats glare at martin who sits mounted waiting  his
eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and
directed to waiting horses  surprised to be freed they
mount up

cornwallis and tavington step out onto the front porch of
cornwallis headquarters and watch as martin and his men
ride toward the gate

the two great danes watch martin from cornwallis side

cornwallis motions to the redcoat sentries to open the
gates  they do so and martin and his men without
hurrying ride out

then just as the gates are closing behind him martin
without turning around lets loose with a piercing
whistle

the two great danes instantly race after martin making it
through the gates just as theyre closing

cornwallis seeing his dogs run after martin sputters
then turns and storms back into his quarters

tavington still offbalance from martins parting
statement watches martin ride away  then he turns to
major wilkins who stands nearby

			tavington
	take a detachment and go get our
	officers

wilkins hurries off

ext  hillside clearing  above fort carolina  day

major wilkins and a detachment of green dragoons ride up
the wooded slope toward the bound redcoat officers that
cornwallis saw through the spyglass  as the dragoons ride
out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead seeing
that

the redcoat officers are not real  theyre nothing
more than scarecrows in redcoat uniforms  theres no sign
of martin or his men

int  cornwallis headquarters  fort carolina  day

close shot  one of the redcoat officers stuffed with
straw is thrown onto cornwallis desk by tavington

cornwallis looks at the scarecrow then turns to
tavington

			cornwallis
	this fox believes himself clever

cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to tavington

			cornwallis
	colonel how can we end this
	madness

			tavington
	difficult sir  this is as you
	pointed out a civil war

cornwallis takes a moment then speaks simply

			cornwallis
	civility is a secondary virtue  it
	is superseded by duty

			tavington
	i understand sir

tavington smiles grimly and strides out

ext  fresh water plantation  day

tavington and wilkins wait while green dragoons and
loyalist militia search the remains of martins house and
barn  gaskins filthy from the ashes walks up to

and fan out to search  the thick fog turns the torches
into diffused floating balls of light turning the
dragoons into ghostlike apparitions

camera follows one of the torches carried by a
particularly roughlooking dragoon who skirts the edge of
the underbrush closest to the house  as the torch moves
its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the
underbrush

in the brush two faces gabriel and charlotte dark
motionless watching the search  behind them martins
other children nathan samuel margaret william and
susan

around them several more of martins men weapons ready

			nathan
	gabriel where is father

			gabriel
	sshhhh

at the front of the house the torches converge
illuminating tavington who gives the unheard order  the
torches fan out and begin setting fire to the house barns
and outbuildings

margaret grips charlottes arm  the roughlooking dragoon
gets closer about to discover them nathan looking the
other way doesnt notice being more concerned with

			nathan
	gabriel where is father

susans eyes grow wider the others notice turning
their heads to see what she sees which is

martin

a hundred yards away on his rearing horse lit by the
flickering light of the burning house surrounded by a
dozen of his men  martin fires his pistol into the air
drawing the attention of the green dragoons

several dragoons fire missing their marks  the others
including tavington race to their horses and mount up
giving chase as martin and his men turn their mounts and
gallop off

in the underbrush charlotte gabriel the children and
the handful of martins men watch as martin draws off the
green dragoons  then gabriel motions and they all ease
back disappearing into the brush

ext  shanty town  night

a compound of rude shacks built of scraps of lumber and
roughhewn logs stands on the side of the magpie river

martins men wait with the children while charlotte and
gabriel flanked by aaron and abigail talk with several
sternlooking middleaged black freedmen

joshua looks on a shattered man now with one arm and a
terrible facial scar  he wears the remnants of a british
army field jacket

the conversation which is out of the childrens earshot
is testy with one of the middleaged freedmen
particularly troubled

martins stonefaced children look around appraising
their surroundings registering the poverty of the shanty
town

the discussion between the grownups ends with a guarded
exchange of handshakes  gabriel charlotte aaron and
abigail rejoin the children and martins men

			gabriel
	its all set

they follow aaron down an alley to a shack  small
barely standing  the children stop in their tracks
knowing this is to be their new home

charlotte sees their hesitation  she walks up to the
little structure examining it with a critical eye  she
looks in the doorway seeing a single room a dirt floor
waxpaper instead of glass in the windows a rude
chimneyless firepit against the back wall  she smiles

			charlotte
	this will do very well

she turns to aaron and abigail

			charlotte
	thank you

charlotte walks inside without looking back  the children
hesitate then follow her inside

int  shack  shanty town  night

the children help aaron and abigail make beds out of
armloads of hay  outside charlotte and gabriel talk
quietly

			charlotte
	its him the one they talk about
	the swamp fox

			gabriel
	yes

			charlotte
	i knew the bits and pieces we
	heard a veteran fought in the
	french and indian war knows the
	swamps it had to be him

			gabriel
	they wont stop looking for you and
	the children

			charlotte
	well be alright here for now
		   beat
	how is he

gabriel searches for an honest answer

			gabriel
	i dont know im his son

gabriel steps over to his saddlebags opens his pack and
pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to charlotte

			gabriel
	these are for you and the children

they sense someone behind them

			susan
	why didnt father come

gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his
heretofore silent sister  charlotte nods smiling

			charlotte
	speaking for months now

			susan
	why didnt he come

			gabriel
	he wanted to susan but he couldnt
	leave his men

			susan
	he left us

			gabriel
	i know he did and hes sorry  hell

susan says nothing  gabriel continues hopefully

			gabriel
	there are some letters here from
	him  some are just to you

			susan
	i dont care  i hate him

			gabriel
	you dont hate him

			susan
	yes i do

gabriel kneels down and embraces her

			gabriel
	oh susan

she stands coldly with her arms at her sides

			susan
	i hate him and i hope he never comes
	back

ext  small farmhouse  sunset

tavington lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a
farmhouse looking out at a lovely sunset absentmindedly
picking at the petals of some wildflowers  a hideous
scream pierces the calm

tavington analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream
then rises passing several green dragoons who wait with
their horses in front of the farmhouse

			tavington
	i believe they are almost ready

in the farmhouse

blood is smeared on one wall where halfadozen corpses
lie in a jumbles mass on the floor

in the parlor tavington walks past more bodies including
a dead woman who lie protectively but ineffectually over
the bloody bodies of her two young children both under
eightyearsold

in the kitchen tavington finds wilkins and some green
dragoons

rob fielding one of the craftsmen in martins force is
tied spreadeagle to the table showing the terrible
effects of protracted torture  wilkins is apologetic as
tavington walks into the room

			wilkins
	im sorry sir  he died

tavington sighs irritated

			tavington
	very well get one of the others

several green dragoons step into an attached woodshed
where billings sits bound  they roughly grab him and
drag him into the kitchen

			billings
	damn your eyes  do your worst

			tavington
	i intend to

they tie billings to the table

ext  martins encampment  day

an astonished martin talks to gabriel

			martin
	she talked  susan talked

			gabriel
	full sentences  as if she had been
	speaking all along

			martin
	and i wasnt there for it

the cloud passes quickly

			martin
	tell me everything she said word
	for word

gabriel hesitates

			gabriel
	she said she loves you and misses
	you but she understands why you
	cant be there with her

			martin
	she said that  oh my lord she said
	that

gabriel nods

			martin
	isnt that something

martin shakes his head at the thought smiling to himself
gabriel uncomfortable with the lie  they turn as rev
oliver gallops up reins back his lathered horse and
speaks to them without dismounting

			rev oliver
	billings and rob fielding are dead
	tortured tavington has a list of
	our men most are on it  a regiment
	of dragoons is going to the homes on
	the list burning them killing

rollins hears and doesnt pause  he rushes to his horse
mounts up and rides off  martin and the other men mount
up and ride off fast after him

ext  black river road  day

martin and his brigade catch up to rollins and ride on
with him

ext  rollins farm  day

the small farm  very rudimentary  the house smolders
no sign of life  gabriel occam and a few other men
warily ride the perimeter of the cleared area around the
house

martin at the head of the rest of the brigade waits next
to an increasingly frantic rollins  they see gabriel
wave signaling all clear

martin rollins and the other men ride to the house
rollins is the first to see the bodies  horrified he
reins back and dismounts almost falling

his young son wife an older man and woman lie dead in
the dirt  martins men silently watch rollins agony
weeping and confused he moves in a mad staccato manner
as if he were a marionette whose strings were being
jerked by a drunken puppeteer repeatedly drawn back to
the body of the boy

martin delancey and rev oliver dismount and move toward
him  rollins sees them coming  he hardens and strides to
his horse pulling his flintlock pistol from his saddle
holster  rev oliver reaches out to embrace rollins

			rev oliver
	its not time for vengeance its
	time to mourn and

rollins puts the pistol to his head and pulls the trigger
blowing his brains out

every man freezes in place  for a long moment no one
moves no one speaks  then martin pulls himself together
and addresses the men

			martin
	five day furlough for all men
	occam dan reverend spread the
	word  any man who doesnt come back
	wont be thought a coward or
	uncommitted to the cause  attend to
	your families

the men mount up  delancey stands alone as martin
gabriel and the rest of the men ride off  he sighs and
heads over to tend to the dead

ext  shanty town  night

dark  shadowed   no one visible  martin and gabriel
wary slowly ride among the shacks  their horses hooves
the only sound

ext  shack  shanty town  night

gabriel waits in the shadows covering as martin cocks
his musket checks his pistols and walks slowly toward the
shack

he warily checks every shadow  no one anywhere  then a
sound  a squeal of laughter immediately followed by

			margaret os
	its him  i told you it was him

martins children race out of the shadows to martin  hes
practically bowled over as margaret nathan samuel and
william fling themselves into his arms

			nathan
	father

			william
	papa

charlotte steps out of the shadows watching the reunion
as martin covers the children with kisses trying to hug
all of them at once  martin and charlotte lock eyes over
the heads of the children

			martin
	thank you

charlotte smiles  then martin notices susan peeking out
from behind charlottes patched and mended skirt  he
kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesnt
move  he smiles to her and speaks softly

			martin
	susan

she looks coldly at martin tightens her grip on
charlottes skirt and retreats further behind her  martin
looks to charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance
then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces
of his other children

int  shanty  night

pouring rain  the ceiling drips  martin lies awake
with his children huddled against him sleeping in one of
the few dry spots  theyre covered with tattered quilts

on the other side of the children charlotte is also
awake  she and martin exchange a long silent look in the
darkness over the heads of the sleeping children

ext  shanty town  riverside  day

freedmen go about their business  several dry fish
others repair a repeatedly patched roof one tends a few
scrawny cows  martin walks the perimeter of the shanty
town with nathan and samuel  they listen carefully

			martin
	theres a good place to post a
	watch  work out a schedule  short
	watches especially at night
		   pointing
	if you can catch some mockingbirds
	you can make cages and put them
	along there for alarms

martin stops looks at the boys closely and grows unsure
as he realizes that hes with his sons not his soldiers
he tousles their hair but continues nonetheless

			martin
	lets find someplace for you to
	cache extra weapons

the boys follow gazing at their father not seeing his
unsteadiness

ext  shack  shanty town  day

dark  shafts of light shine in through the holes in the
roof  martin standing in the shadows senses someone
coming  he freezes

a figure rounds the corner  its william  martin
yells william squeals in delight then chases his father
around the corner tagging him  they laugh  martin
covers his eyes and william dashes off to hide

ext  riverside  shanty town  day

nathan samuel margaret and william play in the water
with the great danes  martin sits on the side of the
river with susan who avoids looking at him  using the
knife weve seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an
apple and eats them

			martin
	good apple

no response

			martin
	very good  sweet

he cuts a slice and offers it to her  she doesnt take
it  he puts the slice between them  after a long moment
she picks it up but as shes about to eat it she stops
seeing something on it  she puts it back

martin looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red
splotch on it  he looks at his knife and realizes that
its dried blood

offbalance he turns to susan who stares straight ahead
a thousand miles from martin

ext  shack  shanty town  day

mr and mrs howard help martin charlotte and the
children unload food and other supplies from a wagon

then taking her hand the two of them walk over to mr
howard

martin feels every word looking straight ahead but
knowing that hes standing next to his son

ext  shanty church  night

in front of the church the bride and groom say goodbye to
the wedding party  anne talks quietly with her parents
martin and gabriel talk nearby

			martin
	you could have told me this was

			gabriel
	i would have if

martin looks at gabriel sad that gabriel thought he

smile and offers it to his son  gabriel awkwardly smiles
back

anne joins them  martin embraces her a bit stiffly and
gives her a fatherly kiss

			anne
	im sorry we didnt give you more

			charlotte
	its a good measure of a woman that
	shell have her honeymoon under the

			martin
	for richer for poorer in sickness
	and in health til death do they
	part

they nod in agreement pointedly not looking at each
other

int  shack  shanty town  night

again martins children sleep huddled up against him  on
the other side of them charlotte lies awake  they look
at each other  martin smiles  she snaps at him angrily
whispering

			charlotte
	im not my sister

			martin
	what

			charlotte
	i said im not my sister

			martin
	i know that

			charlotte
	do you

			martin
	of course i do

			charlotte
		   irritated
	very well then

she turns from him and stares at the ceiling  martin
tries to figure out what just happened  after a long
moment he gets it  stunned at first his gears turn

after a very thoughtful moment he turns to charlotte and
offers a tentative smile  she catches the smile and rolls
her eyes  the children sleep unaware between them

ext  shack  shanty town  day

martin finishes tying his gear onto his horse  gabriel
already saddled up speaks quietly to anne  mr and mrs
howard prepare their wagon

martin turns to his silent children  one after another
they walk to him and embrace him  nathan samuel
margaret william

gabriel embraces anne tightly

			gabriel
	be careful

			anne
	i will

			gabriel
	very careful no one must know about
	us no one

she silences him with a kiss

martin sees susan standing next to charlotte  he motions
to her but she doesnt move  then he kneels down and
gently hugs her

			martin
	just a little goodbye  one word
	thats all i want to hear

susan remains silent standing with her arms at her sides
not responding to the embrace

finally martin lets go of her  she just stares at him

martin stands and turns to charlotte

			martin
	goodbye charlotte

			charlotte
	goodbye

they embrace with a hug that wavers between chastity and
something more  anne and margaret notice and exchange a
surprised knowing look  martin and charlotte break
apart selfconsciously

martin mounts up  gabriel reluctantly does so as well
they turn their horses and start to ride away  as theyre
about to round a curve and disappear susan cries out

			susan
	papa

with halting steps then faster and faster she runs down
the path toward martin

			susan
	papa dont go ill say anything

martin stops turning in his saddle to see susan running
after him her eyes filled with tears

			susan
	please papa ill say anything you
	want

martin yanks his reins turning his horse

			susan
	just tell me what to say  tell me
	what to say

martin spurs his horse straight toward her galloping
toward the running crying child

			susan
	please papa please dont go

martin rides toward her

charlotte anne and martins children watch as

martin leans over in the saddle without slowing down

swooping her up

pulling her into his lap

she sits astride the saddle facing him her arms wrapped
around him pleading the words tumbling from her as fast
as she can get them out

			susan
	 ill talk to you ill say
	anything you want just tell me what
	you want me to say ill say
	anything i promise please papa
	just stay

martin envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl holding her
covering her with kisses letting her cry fighting his
own tears

he reins back the horse stopping in front of the
others

he pleadingly looks to charlotte who steps up to the
horse to take susan

martin gives susan a final embrace

			martin
	ill come back i promise

martin hands the still crying susan down to charlotte

martin in agony averts his eyes yanks his reins and
spurs his horse

as he rides away the children take off after him running

susan seeing the others running after martin struggles
out of charlottes arms and runs after them as well

martin rides now joined by gabriel faster and faster
leaving a trail of dust

the children slow then stop one after another watching
as they ride away

ext  patriot encampment  acworth  evening

grim  the most rudimentary of the encampments weve seen
rain pours  some of martins men huddle under leantos
and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial
protection from the cold rain

occam and scott do their best to keep a wetwood fire
going  rev oliver tries to cook

martin and gabriel ride up and dismount  martin joins
rev oliver who is sorting through rollins possessions

			martin
	how many came back

			rev oliver
	about a hundred and twenty  less
	than a third

martin looks around

			martin
	delancey

rev oliver shrugs and offers his palms to heaven

			martin
		   sarcastically
	trust the french

just then delancey walks out of the woods carrying a
couple buckets of water having overheard rev oliver and
martin

			delancey
	yes trust the french

they look at delancey questioning with their eyes why
hes still here  he smiles

			delancey
	i would not desert  where else do i
	get the opportunity to kill english
	perhaps even a few wounded ones when
	you are not looking

thin smile  martin takes a place at a campfire next to
gabriel  they are out of earshot of the other men
gabriel is thoughtful miles away  after a long moment
he speaks

			gabriel
	im sorry father

			martin
	for what

			gabriel
	i thought that you were hiding
	behind your family when you were
	simply standing in front of us
	protecting us  i was foolish to
	think you were afraid

			martin
	i was afraid i still am

			gabriel
	of

			martin
	afraid that youd turn out like
	me

			gabriel
	there are much worse things than
	that father

gabriel smiles martin doesnt

			martin
	when i went to war it changed me
	and i didnt want that to happen to
	you

gabriel looks across the campsite seeing delancey on the
far side

			gabriel
	fort charles

martin nods

			martin
	when we took fort charles we took
	prisoners  what we did to them we
	told ourselves was just and proper
	revenge for what they had done to
	the families along the black river
		   beat
	thats what i was afraid of  i
	didnt want you to ever tell
	yourself something like that

gabriel nods understanding martin for the first time in
his life

			gabriel
	you neednt worry father  youve
	taught me well

martin and gabriel sit in silence and share slight nods of
understanding

ext  pembroke  day

anne and her parents ride into town on their wagon
finding the streets strangely empty

they sense someone behind them and turn to see halfa
dozen green dragoons and a mounted tavington  theyre
initially frightened but tavington speaks gently
politely

			tavington
	everyone has been requested to
	gather at the church

			anne
	everyone

			tavington
	i wish to address the whole village

tavington deferentially motions for the howards to follow
his men  uneasy mr howard snaps the reins and follows

ext  pembroke village square  day

tavington and wilkins on horseback watch as green
dragoons directs villagers into the church

one of the dragoons walks out of the general store with a
bowl of gumdrops  as he starts giving them to a few of
the children their parents waver unsure of the gesture
but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy

the townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of
the dragoons who though carry muskets are polite and
unthreatening

			dragoon
	into the church please

			another dragoon
	colonel tavington wishes to address
	all of you

anne and her parents join the others

tavington sees the last of the townspeople enter the
church  he nods to the dragoons near the door

the dragoons close the doors chaining them shut  the
door is pounded on from the inside

			voice
	open this door

			mr howard os
	by what right are we made prisoners

tavington nods to several roughlooking dragoons who
disappear into the blacksmith shop  they reappear a
moment later with flaming torches and approach the church

several other dragoons see whats about to happen and are
appalled  wilkins rides over to tavington

			wilkins
	sir

			tavington
	yes major

the dragoons with the torches stop around the church
waiting for the final goahead from tavington  the
pounding and calling from inside the church grows louder

			wilkins
	sir there is no honor in this

			tavington
	the honor is found in the end not
	the means  this will be forgotten
		   to dragoons
	proceed

the troubled dragoons turn to wilkins who struggles with
himself  tavington calmly watches wilkins distress
finally wilkins accepts it  weakly steadying his horse
he takes his place next to tavington

the other dragoons follow his lead and watch as the rough
dragoons light the church on fire heaving their torches
onto the roof through the windows and under the raised
foundation

screams are heard from inside  the door thuds with the
shoulders of men trying to escape  the chains hold

tavington watches stonefaced as the church goes up in
flames

a window shatters with a chair heaved from inside

some men try to climb out but waiting dragoons fire their
muskets point blank killing three men driving the
others back

ready

ext  pembroke  day

martin and his men slowly ride into pembroke  the remains
of the church smolder  the town is deserted no one dead
or alive is visible

unsure what they have found martin and his men spread out
and dismount warily checking out the buildings looking
for some sign of life

rev oliver and a few other men head for the charred
remains of the church

sidestepping some stillhot charred beams rev oliver
looks through the rubble

then he sees the bodies

the camera catches only a fleeting glimpse of

dozens of charred blackened bodies intertwined with the
remains of the church

rev oliver staggers from the rubble

onebyone martin and his men walk over and look into the
remains of the church

martin see several charred hands extended through a
shattered window as if grasping for escape one of the
hands is tiny a childs hand

gabriel on the other side of the square sees annes
packhorses and looks around growing increasingly frantic

			gabriel
	anne anne

martin in the church sees something among the charred
bodies  he reaches down and grasps the north star amulet
he gave to anne on the night of her marriage

gabriel hurries toward the remains of the church

			gabriel
	anne

martin walks out and intercepts him

			martin
	dont go in there

reels  martin grabs him keeping him from falling

small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the church
others carry out the grim task of pulling the charred
bodies out of the rubble  delancey hurries over to

grabs his pennsylvania rifle and weapons belt and strides
toward his horse speaking back over his shoulder

more dragoons take shots

then volleys from both sides mutual destruction

down to a handful of men

about to finish tavington off when

tavington pulls a pistol from underneath himself and
fires

straight into gabriels chest

then rein back stopping seeing a tableau of death

bodies and blood spread over the fields dead dragoons
dead avenging patriots dead horses a few riderless
horses graze

gabriel mortally wounded crawling

martin leaps halffalling out of his saddle  throws
himself on the ground holding gabriel

mixed gatherings of militia and continentals are clustered
around the campfires  more continentals arriving all the

tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired

violin

ground carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket

body which has grown ashen  a solitary bird cries in the
distance

ext  remnants of patriot encampment  night

a dark moonless night  the sky is filled with stars  a
soft wind blows dead leaves along the ground  a few of
the leaves are blown through the opening of martins tent

inside the tent

martin looks down noticing the leaves hearing the wind
a few of the leaves come to rest on gabriels haversack
martin sees a corner of gabriels old glory sticking out
he looks at the flag for a moment  then he stands and
walks

outside the tent

martin watches the leaves skittering along the ground  he
listens to the wind

then he looks up at the night sky  the stars are bright
his eyes are drawn to the big dipper and from there to the
little dipper and the

north star

holding his eyes on the faint but steady star he
gradually reorients himself  he looks around at the
abandoned encampment  then he looks into the tent and
sees gabriels body  the soft wind blows around him
martin nods in response

ext  burial ground  wooded encampment  morning

martin finishes burying gabriel putting the last
shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth  he stands
next to the grave looking down and says a silent prayer

ext  cowpens road  day

the american forces are on the move all heading in the
same direction  continentals and militiamen fill the
road  some on horseback others in wagons most on foot

among them a mixed unit of continentals and martins
brigade at the head of which ride lee and delancey

something catches lees eye and he turns back seeing over
a shallow ridge that runs parallel to the road an
american flag old glory just visible the rider carrying
it hidden behind the ridge

the flag approaches  one after another the men see it
coming  the flag is gabriels the repair almost
completed trailing a single strip

the men begin to sense who it is

and then they see him martin who rides up between lee
and delancey  they exchange nods

they ride on passing a sign that reads cowpens  20
miles

ext  american encampment  cowpens  night

the campfires of the american army burn  small groups of
uniformed continentals and raggedly dressed militia
cluster around different fires  theres little mixing
between groups

around one of the campfires

the commanders  lee martin delancey several other
officers and dan morgan a bull of a man around martin and
lees age  morgan a continental is in command

			morgan
	benjamin tell me about cornwallis

			martin
	remember braddock

			morgan
	that bad

			martin
	worse

morgan sighs

			morgan
	gentlemen as far as we know
	general cornwallis is at
	bradleyville  two thousand of his
	infantry along with four thousand
	green dragoons under tavington are
	between us and the river  they
	outnumber our regulars two to one
	and they have five times our
	cavalry  two thirds of our force is
	militia  unreliable at best

			lee
	we could pull back try to slip away
	before dawn

martin shakes his head

			martin
	you underestimate our militia all
	of you do

			lee
	ive seen our militia lines break
	again and again  at saratoga at
	monmouth at cherry hill

the officers are silent in agreement  martin shoots a
glare at lee

			martin
	tavington and cornwallis have seen
	the same thing  use that

			morgan
	how

martin pulls cornwallis journal out of his haversack and
leafs through it

			martin
	ill let cornwallis tell you
	himself and he speaks for
	tavington as well
		   reading
	 but it is this colonial militia
	that is the most irksome  not
	worthy of my attention but
	demanding it not worthy of british
	blood but taking it and not worthy
	of a soldiers honor but sullying
	it  those nights of mine that are
	not sleepless are filled with
	dreams of a cavalry charge on the
	heels of fleeing farmers

martin closes the journal

			martin
	cornwallis and tavington have even
	less respect for citizen soldiers
	than you do

morgan considers martins proposal

ext  american encampment  night

campfires receding into the darkness each with a small
cluster of men  delancey watches as martin talks with a
few men at one of the fires

martin leaves that campfire and joins another small
gathering of men at a different campfire  lee and some of
the other officers can be seen talking with other clusters
of militiamen at other campfires

martin steps up to another campfire this one near
delancey who listens

			martin
	 so all were asking is that the
	front line of militia fires two
	shots

a militiaman shakes his head with misgivings

			militiaman
	lot can happen in the time it takes
	to fire two shots specially
	against british regulars

			martin
	which is why im not asking for
	three

martin gives the men around the campfire a moment to
consider his words then he rises and heads over to
another campfire and another small group of militiamen

ext  cowpens  predawn

martin sits sewing  he finishes the final repair on
gabriels flag  he appraises his handiwork  though
stained and tattered the flag is intact

martin stands on the crest of a shallow rise looking out
at the british lines barely distinguishable in the faint
light  above him stars are visible but theyre fading
in the light of the predawn glow from the horizon

martin scans the disappearing stars searching out the
north star but in the increasingly harsh light of this
day he cant find it  he turns his eyes back to the
battlefield

ext  cowpens battlefield  day

the sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility
to a few dozen yards  men move like ghosts

the camera finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist
there is no overview just separate detachments

an orderly regiment of continental cavalry mounted
waiting steadying their horses

two long lines of blueuniformed continental infantry

massed squares of continental infantry reserves

the american command including morgan lee and several
other officers attended by riders and runners

and finally martin and his men who stand in the middle
of a long line of patriot militia in the center of a long
valleyline depression  martin stands next to delancey

they stand silently unable to see anything other than
each other and the gently slope of the dewcovered grass
in front of them

theyre all grim  they know whats coming

then the sound of a single drum heard but unseen coming
from over the slope

then more drums more and more a competition of drum
beats

martins men listen turning their heads trying to
imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in
front of them

martin turns to delancey

			martin
	how old were your daughters

delancey looks closely at martin and realizes with some
surprise that hes willing to answer  he speaks softly

			delancey
	i had two daughters violette was
	twelve paulette was ten  they
	had green eyes

			martin
	you have my sympathy

			delancey
	thank you

they stand silently next to each other

ext  british lines  day

tavington surrounded by his officers stands on a low
hill trying with the aid of a spyglass to catch the
first view of the battlefield as the morning mist begins
to burn off  through the fog he just makes out the
american lines

			tavington
	unless im dreaming i think i see
	irregulars at their center

tavington smiles

ext  low meadow  cowpens  morning

martin and his men wait

a strange sound  soft muted  the men turn their heads
listening their eyes shifting

they hear the sound of hundreds of boots on wet grass
advancing

the camera watches the faces of martin and his men as they
listen to an unseen army approaching

then they see it a massive wall of red appears over
the rise in front of them hundreds of redcoats in
perfect formation marching in lockstep straight for
them

martin sees the fear on his mens faces but none of them
move

the british drums grow louder and louder its almost
enough to drive a man to flight almost

the camera explores the faces of martins men all are
frightened but all are motionless

closer and closer the british line approaches the
americans dont move

then the british line stops

at a flurry of commands the redcoats ready their muskets
then aim

still martin and the americans dont move dead
silence

then a single thin voice calls out from the british
lines

			british voice os
	fire

in a thunderous massive volley three thousand british
muskets fire simultaneously just as the entire line of
american militiamen dive to the ground

many americans are saved by the move but many many others
are torn apart by the british musketballs

the amount of smoke is incredible it obscures
everything  each musket spits out a billow of think white
smoke a dozen feet in front of it and hundreds of them
just fired  the massive opaque white cloud quickly
spreads over the entire battlefield

the astonished redcoats instantly reloading

the americans rise shoulder arms and fire a thunderous
volley into the british ranks

scores of redcoats fall but the line of welltrained
regulars remains intact as rear ranks fill in the front

a race to reload the redcoats have a slight
headstart balls wadding tamp prime the pan
cock as fast as they can possibly reload a redcoat
drum beats fire when ready a command repeated by the
british bugle

the redcoats win the race raises their muskets fire
a rolling volley

scores of american militiamen fall but still the line
holds second rank men fill the gaps still loading

then loaded as one the americans raises their muskets
and fire a devastating volley into the british ranks
decimating the redcoats

the redcoats are staggered but then see the americans turn
in disorderly panic and flee the surprised grateful
redcoats rally some laugh

on a rise behind the battlefield tavington watches
through his spyglass trying to get a sense of whats
happening through the spreading cloud of musket smoke  he
barks to his signalman

			tavington
	fix bayonets dispatch the green
	dragoons

the signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the
message

martin and his men are caught in the middle of the chaotic
retreat

the british line advances at a quickstep bayonets
fixed from behind them the green dragoons appear at a
full gallop tavington at their head

the battlefield

its an astonishing sight total madness hell a
painting by hieronymous bosch

the mass of the british infantry charges after the fleeing
patriot militiamen the redcoat infantry grows
disorderly as it runs

tavington and the british cavalry thunders to the head of
the redcoats closing in on the fleeing patriots  the
cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter

then suddenly stepping into view from behind a low grass
covered rise a solid line of blue appears rock solid

it opens up allowing the fleeing patriots to pass through
it like water then it closes again becoming a solid
blue wall

martin his men and the entire mass of fleeing militia
stops dead turns and joins the blue american line

a flurry of orders then the blue wall erupts with a
volley of musket fire that stops the disorderly british
advance in its tracks

hundreds of redcoats fall instantly

hundreds of green dragoons and their horses fall with
them

the effect of the volley is devastating the american
timing is perfect

again the amount of smoke is astonishing visibility
drops to less than twenty feet in most places drifting
smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and there but
it is primarily a battle of sound men simply follow the
men in front of them

the blue continentals advance in an orderly manner from
both flanks onto the redcoats trapping them

martin fires one of his pistols draws his tomahawk
hacks killing one redcoat after another

no remorse no hesitation no pity his tomahawk sinks
into the stock of an upraised british musket and is pulled
from his hands

martin quickly kills the redcoat with his pistol

then through the smoke martin catches a glimpse of
tavington

martin freezes his eyes locked on tavington who is
fighting a pitched battle making his way toward the
perimeter of the field trying to escape back to the
british lines

seeing nothing but tavington martin hurriedly tears open
his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made
from thomas lead soldiers

as he loads the pistol his eyes still trained on
tavington delancey runs up

			delancey
	colonel  our line

martin finishes reloading distracted he turns to
delancey for an instant

			delancey
	our line is faltering

martin takes a quick glance at the continental line
seeing

an onslaught of redcoats and a smaller number of patriots
who are losing ground their lines breaking up

the patriot standard bearer a burly sergeant sees the
redcoat reinforcements and starts backing up

martin is torn

he looks to tavington seeing him distracted vulnerable
but too distant a target for the pistol

delancey cant wait he runs off

martin sees the patriot line beginning to retreat
the patriot standard bearer carrying the old glory
looses his nerve joins the retreat

martin takes a last look at tavington and turns away
heading over toward the retreating patriots

moving against the growing tide of retreat shoving the
men bumped by others as more and more americans join the
retreat

then martin sees the standard bearing sergeant passing

			martin
	stop hold the line

the sergeant tries to bull past but martin blocks his way
and grabs the flag from him

the sergeant holds on but a forearm to the head from
martin dislodges the flag from his grasp

martin holds the flag high and races back against the
tide of retreating patriots

			martin
	hold the line  hold the line

only martin moves against the tide then

several patriots stop then others

martin singlemindedly tears through them daring them to
follow not caring if they do

one patriot takes off after martin then another

the retreat slows then turns

the patriot force led by martin slams into the redcoat
line

handtohand some musket some swords many
bayonets and musket stocks

martin plants the flag in the dirt and plants himself
right next to it

he fires his pistol killing a redcoat grabs a downed
sword kills two more redcoats

the tide turns

a pair of redcoats back up from the patriot vanguard
then other redcoats disengage

several redcoats turn stumbling away a few run
those who dont are killed by the men around martin

the redcoats break into a full retreat which turns into a
rout as another mass of patriots bursts through the smoke
and joins the line

the patriots sees the retreating redcoats intercepted by
another detachment of patriots the tide fully turned
the battle is won

a cheer rises from the patriots joyous in victory
grateful for survival

all cheer except martin who through the smokefilled
chaos of the battlefield sees

tavington on a distant rise on horseback out of reach
about to flee

tavington takes a final look at the battlefield then
yanks his reins his horse rears up as it turns

tavington spurs the animal and disappears over the rise

extreme close shot  martin surrounded by cheering men
watches tavington go

martin does not see the flag waving at his side nor does
he hear the cheers all around him

						    dissolve to

ext  yorktown overlook  sunset

a hilltop road rises to an overlook  a long bedraggled
line of patriots trudges up the hill stopping on the
crest looking at something we cant yet see

martin and delancey in the ragged line of patriots walk
to the top of the hill  as they get to the crest they
stop looking out seeing

a magnificent tableau laid out before them  yorktown
the british are trapped on a pair of peninsulas one
jutting out from land the other jutting toward the land
from a large island  in a semicircle around the landward
peninsula is a massive force of american troops and

thousands and thousands of french troops flying scores of
french flags the french fleet is visible in the harbor

american and french cannons keep up a steady barrage on
the trapped british troops

martin and delancey look out at the grand and impressive
sight  delancey smiles and speaks quietly

			delancey
	vive la france

a commotion  the men on the crest of the hill excitedly
exchange whispers as they see a group of officers
approaching

			patriot private
	its him

			another patriot
	washington

patriots both militia and continentals hurry over to
catch a glimpse of

george washington surrounded by staff officers american
and french including lee morgan lafayette trailed by
messengers runners and aides  washington is tall and
powerfullybuilt an imposing man worthy of respect

washington and lee stop in front of martin and delancey
who stand at the head of the remains of the south carolina
militia their tattered militia flag flying beside
gabriels tattered old glory

washington and martin

stand facetoface looking each other in the eye  martin
smiles slightly and shakes his head

			martin
	your hairs gone gray

			washington
	ive earned it

washington holds out a small bag to martin who smiles in
recognition of some private ritual  he reaches into the
bag and pulls out a walnut

			washington
	i wanted to greet you and the south
	carolina militia myself  this
	nation owes a lot to you

			martin
	thank you

washington takes a walnut  they both crush the walnuts
shells between their thumbs and forefingers a prodigious
display of strength that both men take for granted

as they eat the walnuts washington motions for martin to
join him a bit away from all the soldiers and other
officers

the two men step away then speak quietly looking out at
the tableau spread out before them

			washington
	i was sorry to hear about your son

			martin
	i lost another a year ago thomas
	he was only fifteen

			washington
	ive had no sons to lose nor
	daughters
		   beat
	i lose the sons of other men

they look out at the vista knowing that theyre looking
at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men

			washington
	life was easier when we only had
	ourselves to get killed

martin nods then hardens a bit and turns to washington

			martin
	where do you need us

			washington
	we dont  their forward redoubts
	fell yesterday  they cant survive
	our mortars and its only
	cornwallis damned pride thats
	delaying the surrender

			martin
	then let us join the center until
	the surrender comes

			washington
	no  i want you and your men on the
	north peninsula to block the escape
	of secondary units

			martin
	sir my men would rather be at the
	center for the surrender and

			washington
		   interrupting
	youll go where i tell you to go

martin nods coolly respectful

			martin
	yes sir

martin turns to rejoin his men  washington speaks after
him

			washington
	benjamin

martin stops

			washington
	tavington and the green dragoons are
	on the north peninsula
		   beat
	give him my regards

martin nods in thanks to washington

int  cornwallis headquarters  yorktown  predawn

cornwallis looks out from the third floor window of a
commandeered mansion

out the window he can see the battlefield with his
besieged troops cowering in shattered defensiveworks as
huge american mortar shells explode within the redcoat
lines

cornwallis stares as much astonished as angry  behind
him colonel huntington and major halbert nervously wait

			colonel huntington
	sir i beseech you you must order
	the surrender  there is no other
	alternative

cornwallis in anguish hears the words but cannot bring
himself to move

ext  yorktown  dawn

the bombardment continues  american cannons and mortars
rain death onto the british position

the patriots regulars and militia wait behind their
barricades

then a single figure appears on one of the british
parapets  a drummer boy no more than tenyearsold  he
begins to beat the drum but it is unheard beneath the
sounds of the bombardment

a british officer steps out next to the boy and raises a
white flag

in the american lines a few men see the white flag  as
the artillery units notice the bombardment slows then
stops

it gradually sinks in  in the american lines some cheer
some laugh many simply take a deep breath then the
cheering grows louder and louder and louder

spyglass image  the british drummer boy and the redcoat
officer with the white flag  the spyglass is lowered
revealing

ext  north peninsula  dragoon camp  yorktown  dawn

tavington compresses the spyglass and turns to a couple of
his officers standing next to him

			tavington
	quickly we can slip out to the
	north and make our way to our forces
	in new york  this isnt over yet

they hurry off

ext  woods  north peninsula  yorktown  dawn

dark  eerie  a light rain falls through a heavy ground
fog in an oldgrowth forest

the sound of horses hooves on the soft ground  tavington
and his two officers appear out of the trees
galloping

a sudden unseen musket shot drops one of the officers
tavington and the other officer glance back and ride on

another musket shot drops the other officer  tavington
looks back sees that hes alone scans the woods as he
rides seeing no one

tavington spurs his horse harder

another shot  tavingtons horse falls spilling
tavington onto the ground

silence

tavington tries to get his bearing struggles to his
feet

reaches for his pistol its not there searches the
ground around him cant find it

a slight sound tavington turns quickly sees nothing

another sound he turns again nothing

growing more nervous by the second tavington searches for
a weapon  he sees his carbine on the other side of the
horse

as he start for it he hears something behind him turns
again nothing

turning back to the carbine tavington suddenly finds
himself

facetoface with martin

martin raises his pistol and coldly fires shooting
tavington in the shoulder

tavington spins and falls

martin calmly and grimly starts to reload pulling one of
thomas lead soldier bullets out of his weapons pouch and
dropping it into the barrel

tavington struggles to his feet

			tavington
	i surrender

martin says nothing as he methodically reloads

			tavington
	please i beg of you im wounded
	im surrendering

martin finishes reloading and without pause raises the
pistol and fires this time into tavingtons thigh

tavington falls crying out in pain

			tavington
	damn you  have you no honor  i am
	surrendering

martin pulls another of thomas bullets from his pouch and
starts reloading again

tavingtons terror grows  he struggles to his feet
desperately searching for some escape

he sees the carbine but its too far and on the other
side of martin

			tavington
	take pity  i beg of you

tavington sees that martin is almost finished loading

			tavington
	please do not fire the war is
	over

even as those words leave his mouth tavington remembers
martins cold promise horrified he realizes what hes
just said

martin raises the pistol and shoots tavington in the
heart

tavington falls back to the ground dead  martin looks
down at him

			martin
	ugly business doing ones duty

martin stands silently over tavingtons body and gives
himself a moment of bitter triumph

ext  yorktown field  day

a massive ceremony carefully orchestrated laid out on
the cleaned up battlefield  the french and american
armies fifteen thousand men between them stand in
perfect formation on either side of the field forming an
avenue for the british army which marches out of its
fortification

at the head of the avenue washington and his staff stand
waiting

a musical band of continentals thirty men strong loudly
plays a tune the world turned upside down a jaunty
british air with a melancholy undercurrent

cornwallis army marches between the assembled american
and french armies  cornwallis is nowhere to be seen

as the redcoats reach the head of the assembly they
truculently fling their muskets and other arms into a
massive and growing pile of weapons

martin and delancey stand among the south carolina militia
watching from a distance as

the british officers step up to washington and his
officers  hurried whispers are exchanged among staff
officers  then redcoat colonel huntington draws his
sword and offers it to washington who declines motioning
to general lincoln instead

as colonel huntington hands his sword to general lincoln
a massive sheer rises from the american and french
ranks

in the ranks

with every other pair of eyes directed toward the
ceremony martin quietly and unnoticed slips out the back
of the formation and walks away

ext  yorktown  day

the surrender ceremony continues  martin on the fringe
of the field finishes saddling his horse and prepares to
leave  lee and delancey walk out of the crowd and join
him

martin and delancey lock eyes for a moment  martin offers
his hand and says quietly with a slight ironic smile

			martin
	vive la france

delancey smiles  they shake hands

			delancey
	vive la liberte

martin mounts up

			lee
	goodbye benjamin

			martin
	goodbye harry

martin reaches down  they shake hands

			martin
	and congratulations on the birth of
	your son

			lee
	thank you  maybe all of this will
	buy him some peace

			martin
	i hope so

as martin starts to ride off he reins back and stops
speaking back to lee over his shoulder

			martin
	your son what did you name him

			lee
	robert  robert e lee

martin smiles

			martin
	a good name for a farmer

lee nods  martin rides off  lee and delancey watch him
go

sitting on the lookout with his musket suddenly stands
seeing something

charlotte and the others notice  theyre worried  then
they see samuel throw down his musket and tear down the
path running as fast as he can tumbling then regaining
his feet

charlotte and the others know whos coming

the children take off running after samuel

racing toward the road

charlotte hurries after them

and then they see him martin riding at a full
gallop

the children cry out with tears of joy

leans over without slowing he swoops her up into the
saddle she wraps herself around him

he reins back stops and dismounts just as the other
children reach him

they throw themselves into his arms embracing him

charlotte hurries up behind them she and martin lock

play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two
great danes

charlotte sits on the front porch nursing an infant

martin walks out of his workshop trailed by susan  he
carries a justcompleted rocking chair

the chair is a work of art thin and light a spiderweb
of perfectly turned wood no nails no glue

he steps onto the porch next to charlotte and places the
rocking chair next to her

			martin
	two pounds fourteen ounces

			charlotte
	lovely

he smiles and makes a minute adjustment in the chairs
position  then he sits down settles back and begins
rocking  not a creak

martin and charlotte watch susan run out of the yard
calling as she joins the other children

			susan
	wait for me

as the camera cranes up martin and charlotte disappear
beneath the overhang of the porch roof  suddenly the
sound of a crash

the camera continues to crane up as martin walks off the
porch crosses the yard and enters his workshop  a moment
later the sound of martins lathe rises
