sc 2     ext     scottish field near houseday     sc 2

a woman in a dark crepe victorian dress sits leaning against a tree 
her hands cover her face around her neck she wears a writing pad she 
crosses a field with large bare trees in the far background stands a 
3 storey stone house

a small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor a parlour maid 
looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared

the woman stands at a window lit by moonlight her skin appears 
luminescently white she touches the wooden window frame the curtain 
the objects on the window sill her mind abstracted her hands 
unconsciously performing a farewell turning from the window she moves 
to a square piano crowded by packing boxes in the dim light she 
begins to play strongly her face strains she is utterly involved 
unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie 
accompaniment to the music

an old maid in nightdress looks in abruptly the woman stops playing 
the emotion leaves her face it whitens and seems solid like a wall

under water a long boat passes overhead its oars breaking the 
surface

sc 9     ext     beach                    day     sc 9

amidst a riotous sea a woman ada is carried to shore on the 
shoulders of five seamen her large victorian skirt spreads across the 
mens arms and backs on her head a black bonnet around her neck her 
pad and pen we should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial 
offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited a 
black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush

the breakers are chaotic the men strain to keep their footing 
calling to each other

                         seamen
               hold still you smutt blast the 
               boat
               look up look up
               lay to lay to

               hard
               damn me wont you hold
               etc

two of the men are black all are battered tattooed and tough some 
are drunk
behind the woman is her daughter a girl of ten in scottish dress she 
too is carried on the shoulders of seamen

ada is placed on the sand she looks down at her feet sinking into the 
wet sand then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of 
her the sound of sea behind is thunderous

several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand


her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick but adas attention 
is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a 
huge piano shaped box they put it down as soon as they get to 5hore 
but ada makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher 
safer ground the piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it 
one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free 
hand

sc 10     ext     beach                         day     sc 10

two seamen finish carrying the last crate to shore trunks and boxes 
including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the 
shore

the seamen gather together after a discussion in which they look 
between ada and her child and their coaster out on the sea one of the 
men approaches behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or 
down on the sand they dont want to be involved the sight of the 
women alone on this beach is too hopeless

                         seamen
               its a little rough out there 
               could be they cant get through 
               to you in this weather maybe 
               theyll come over land

ada nods

                         seamen
               have you things for shelter

ada nods

                         seamen
               what things have you

ada signs to her daughter the little girl speaks clearly and loudly 
without emotion

                         flora
               she says thank you

puzzled the man walks off then turns and comes back

                         seamen
               does your mother prefer to come 
               on with us to nelson

ada signs vigorously to flora

                         flora
               she says no she says shed 
               rather be boiled alive by 
               natives than get back in your 
               tub

ada is sheltering behind the crated piano anxiety etched on her face

flora  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ada has 
found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play 
a few notes the sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to 
exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness

suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of 
the piano wetting her shoes ada stands pushing flora onto her feet 
she is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed

they watch three of their boxes float out to sea one of the hens has 
escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves

sc 14     ext     beach                         dusk     sc 14

there is just a pink streak left in the sky ada and flora shelter 
inside their makeshift tent a hooped petticoat secured at the edges 
with stones  inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation

ada is hand signaling a story to flora who lies back watching nervous 
and afraid adas whole self is involved in the telling her face is 
alight with expression now tender now sad now humorous now soft 
while her hands and fingers are deft and precise from outside it is 
an odd shadow play

                         flora
               hand signaling mother im 
               thinking

ada pauses

               speaking im not going to 
               call him papa  im not going 
               to call him anything im not 
               even going to look at him

sc 15     ext     bush on way to beach          day     sc 15

through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen maori people and two 
european men the wetness closeness and darkness of the bush is such 
that the air seems green like at the bottom of a deep sea two of the 
maoris share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a 
mixture of native and european costume of the europeans one is small 
and has a shy manner he has a half completed maori tattoo across his 
cheeks the other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit muddy 
and out of place here in the bush he staggers spurts forward then 
slows to a stop his hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the 
green foliage baines the younger man turns and slows

                         baines
               are we stopping do you want 
               to stop

the maori voices and laughter are becoming fainter baines watches 
torn between his concern for stewart and the split in their party

3see notes

                         baines
               shall we stop

unable to get an answer baines runs after the maoris

                         baines
               tai hoa me tatari tatou  me 
               tutatou i konei

               stopping
                         subtitled

stewart takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through 
his wet hair inside the darkness of his pocket he turns over and 
over a small worn edged photograph a smudge of green light allows us 
to see adas tumbling face taking it in the heel of his hand he 
secretly looks at it just as the party return and settle he stares on 
ahead possessed and determined

                         stewart
               we must get on

the maoris look at baines bewildered

                         tame

it is early morning the sea is calmer and the tide is again low the 
party or two europeans and fourteen maori men and women come out on to 
the beach about half the maori party head straight for the shoreline 
where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection all sorts of 
containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their 
arms the rest follow stewart and baines over to the boxes stewart 
automatically recombs his hair patting it against his forehead 
where it sticks in a raked pattern on his head he carefully places a 
formal top hat oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit the 
party stops short of the petticoats where a telltale foot reveals its 
occupants

                         stewart
               miss mcgrath alisdair stewart 
               youll have to wake yourself 
               ive got men here to carry your 
               things

ada and flora struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of 
men and women the maoris stare curiously and comment on the women

               aut he anahera enci
               are they angels they look 
               like angels
                         subtitled

a man points at floras feet and gestures as if holding one of the 
little shoes in his hand

               te monohi hoki 
               so small 
                    subtitled

flora is struck by shyness and hides under her mothers skirt ada 
cannot look straight at stewart and stewart also cannot look at her

                         stewart
               i see you have a good many 
               boxes id like to know what is 
               in each

as ada does not move stewart is puzzled

                         stewart
               can  you  hear  me

ada nods and looks up coldly insulted by his slow loud speaking

                         stewart
               well that is good yes that is 
               good good

stewart smiling searches adas face for some sign of comprehension but 
is unnerved by her lack of response he stops smiling and patting 
his hair walks to the closest box several of the maori party follow 
behind stewart while one of them closely and particularly mimics him


                         stewart
               whats in here

ada points to the writing already on the box saying crockery and 
pots

                         stewart
               ohh yes so it is written 
               there crockery

                         stewart
               and this one

ada writes bedclothes and linen on the pad around her neck while 
she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her

                         stewart
               youre small i never thought 
               youd be small

he walks to another chest

                         stewart
               whats here

she writes clothes the maori mimic also pretends to write

finally he comes to the piano box he lifts a corner experimentally

                         stewart
               whats in here then lead

                         flora
               gravely its my mothers 
               piano

                         stewart
               a piano

the maoris touch the exposed legs of the piano  stewart speaks to the 
other european man baines

                         stewart
               tell them to carry in pairs 

               those three and those two the 
               black and the red then the 
               suitcases

stewart holds baines back a moment

                         stewart
               what do you think

stewart nods towards ada baines thinks a moment then turns towards 
ada too

                         baines
               she looks tired

                         stewart
               shes stunted thats one 
               thing

baines walks over to hone a big man and the maorj leader he stands 
tall with a great sense of his own importance mana

                         baines
               anei nga pouaka  ko era e 
               toro
               me era e raa
               here are the boxes those 
               three and those two 
                    unsubtitled

                         hone
               e hoal

hone takes an aggressive fighting posture towards baines insulted 
that baines should suggest he might carry anything hone does not 
carrying he is the boss with great dignity hone retreats too 
injured to help other maoris come up and baines assigns them boxes 
ada gets worried the piano is being left alone she writes on her 
pad the piano she shows stewart

                         stewart
               oh no it cant come now

                         flora
               it must come

stewart looks at flora

                         flora
               she wants it to come

                         stewart
               yes and so do i but there are 
               too few of us here to carry it 
               too  heavy

ada writes i need the piano her maori mimic copies her

                         stewart
               do you mean you dont want your 
               kitchenware or your clothes is 
               that what you mean

ada signs to flora

                         flora
               we cant leave the piano

                         stewart
               let us not discuss this 
               further i am very pleased

stewart slows down as he watches ada again sign to flora he has the 
uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted

                         flora
               mother wants to know if they 
               could come back directly for 
               it

stewart is shocked his mouth hangs slightly open paused in mid 
speech tahu mimics this mouth drop perfectly

                         flora
               after they have taken the other 
               things

stewart is growing confused and anxious his two mimics and their 
growing audience unnerve him further

                         pito
               kei riri a te raho maroke 
               shouted loudly at tahu
               watch it dry balls is getting 
               touchy

                    subtitled

stewart nods suspiciously towards the maori speaker not understanding 
him the speaker smiles and nods back

                         stewart
               i suggest you prepare for a 
               difficult journey the bush 
               will tear clothes and the mud 
               is deep in places


stewart walks away ada stands beside the piano turned away from the 
activities flora pats her hand trying to cheer her down on the beach 
a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking some of the young 
men are racing naked into the sea

                         stewart
               to baines about the maoris 
               what are they doing we dont 
               have time for that

it is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make 
their way up into the bush ada still stands beside her piano flora 
wants to follow the party baines comes back along the beach trailed 
by a young maori boy kaha

                         baines
               mr stewart asked if i might 
               show you to the path ada does 
               not move  may i carry 
               something

ada turns to baines her face angry and defiant her eyes full of 
tears baines falls back struck by her show of emotion ada and flora 
walk past him toward the bush

the party threads its way through the bush along the cliff ada pauses 
at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand tiny and 
desolate its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her its 
music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene

brown feet squelch through the mud finally followed by dainty boots 
caked in dirt the maori leaders of the party have stopped

claustrophobic and exotic one of the maori women sits close to ada 
apparently not looking at her slowly she draws the scarf that is in 
adas lap into her own defiantly she puts it on

freckles from floras face

across the distant bush the whole valley is shrouded in mist stewart 
looks through the camera at the reverend and the photographer who are 
posing as the couple complete with tatty bouquet stewart notices 
adas arrival and seeing her as a real bride his bride he is 
struckdumb with pride even the rough tapes at the back or the dress 
cannot destroy the illusion

with flora

               i thought she met your father

                         aunt morag
               frowning and where did they 
               get married

aunt morag checks to see if someone is coming

                         flora
               her scottish accent becomes 
               thick and expressive in an 
               enormous forest with real 
               fairies as bridesmaids each 
               holding a little elfs hand

aunt morag sits back regarding flora with obvious disapproval and 
disappointment she smooths back her hair

                         flora
               no i tell a lie it was in a 
               small country church near the 
               mountains

aunt morag is becoming involved again she leans forward

                         aunt morag
               which mountains are those dear

                         flora

               she leans forward

                         flora
               mother used to sing the songs 
               in german and her voice would 
               echo across the valleys

               that was before the 
               accident

                         aunt morag
               oh what happened

morag looks over her shoulder as flora continues to talk so 
persuasive is floras storytelling that the scene comes vividly to 
life albeit in floras dark pupil

                         flora
               one day when my mother and 
               father were singing together in 
               the forest a great storm blew 
               up out of nowhere but so 
               passionate was their singing 
               that they did not notice nor 
               did they stop as the rain began 
               to fall and when their voices 
               rose for the final bars of the 
               duet a great bolt of lightening 
               came out of the sky and struck 
               my father so that he lit up 
               like a torch and at the same 
               moment my father was struck 
               dead my mother was struck dumb 
               she neverspokeanotherword

               from the shock yes it would 
               be

the story is interrupted by the return of the wedding party who are 
dripping wet exactly as the couple in the story aunt morag bustles 
over to take off the wet wedding gown her face puckered with tragedy

                         aunt morag
               terrible  terrible

before she can undo the ties ada pulls it from herself so aggressively 
that the ties and part of the gown comes apart none of this is a 
concern to ada who is distracted with fear for her piano she crosses 
to the little window and stares anxiously at the falling rain

the bedroom ada is signing intently to flora flora signs back 
sometimes using words stewart watches uneasy with their secret 
communication as stewart enters the animation is suspended ada 
stands and takes a step back as if to attention

                         stewart

               there is some maori land i want

               you will use the time to settle 
               in and in some ways we may

flora mirrors her expression

               cant do it

glances at them from under the horse and around its side they watch 
him closely not pleadingly but stubbornly1 eerily of one mind

the party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the 
piano still stands it has not been without visitors there are 
footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back 
ada passes baines walking urgently towards it soon ada has removed 
enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys emnes stays 
back ada takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys 
again her whole composition is altered she is animated joyful 
excited

down on the wet sand flora does a wild dance of her own invention 
using a seaweed wig she finishes by rolling down the beach in the 
sand

baines views them with suspicion yet he is magnetically drawn to the 
spectacle he has never seen women behave with so much abandon his 
attention fixes on adas uninhibited emotional playing and as he 
watches he finds himself edging irresistibly closer

and flora are attempting a duet ada notices him come towards them 
with the boards obviously intending that they should leave her mood 
darkens she continues playing stubbornly even though flora has 
stopped abruptly she finishes in black spirits she replaces her cape 
and bonnet baines is struck by this sudden change he watches her 
mesmerised as he replaces the boards

sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out 
suspicious that ada is singing stewart approaches the house quietly 
through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have 
been etched on the table top while ada plays the notes flora sings 
them

stewart puts his pack down ada stands to attention folding the

proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their 
demonstrative displays of affection and their clay tobacco pipes to 
which they are addicted

               was looking over done

stewart regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain

               like this we are a family now

ada is taken unawares she sits a moment unsure if she wants to 
cooperate then slowly she staffs to undo her buttons

ada pulls her arms out of the tight sleeves underneath she wears a 
wornin bodice her arms are so white they seem transparent a 
delicate network of bluegreen veins crisscross up the soft underpart 
of her arms a dark growth of hair in her armpit suggests a shadowy

way through the fallen logs to baines path

               wait

the two women stop there is a japanese sense of deferment to stewart

               ada nods enthusiastically

baines secures a chair against the door while ada is removing her 
dress top she sits at the piano hugging herself against the chill  
as baines passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back he picks it 
up and takes it across to her seat by the window

baines nods and ada begins to play baines fingers the still warm 
jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it ada turns around and stops 
playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking she 
holds out her hand for the jacket her expression stern and 
censorious she indicates he should return it to the chair back 
baines ignores her ada stands and comes over to baines she pulls the 
jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back but as 
she turns to sit

baines is beside her he pulls the shoulders of her bodice down 
exposing her shoulders and some of her breast ada immediately stands 
but bmnes is much stronger and manhandles her across to the bed ada 
struggles seriously this is much much more than she was expecting

                         baines
               ada four keys

ada holds up five fingers and mouths five

               i just want to lie

ada shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five 

               all right all right five

ada no longer struggles she is stiff and still baines intoxicated by 
the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle he kisses 
and touches her with feeling and affection then suddenly aware of her 
stillness he too becomes still he pulls himself up to see whether her 
face betrays her feelings ada seizes this opportunity to return to 
the uncertain sanctuary of her piano from the bed baines watches her 
run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys a gesture 
betraying affection never afforded to him baines gets up he shuts 
the piano lid forcing ada to remove her hand

ada immediately stands and dresses marking hurtfully baines 
ownership of her piano

instructions  baines is not himself he is sulky and distant

ada is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour a little 
uncertainly she sets about her playing after a little she too turns 
to see what baines is doing hes not there she is surprised then 
anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few 
keys to go she starts to play again but her anxieties prove too 
great she stops and listens she looks out the window where flora is 
mucking about in the yard she walks to his bedroom listens then 
opens the door baines stands naked looking at her ada is taken aback

clothes on how many would that

ada holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys

baines nods

ada is surprised she didnt expect him to agree ada checks again 
holding up her hands

                         baines

hesitantly she starts to undress she lies on her petticoat having 
deemed the bed too dirty baines lies very still on top of her a

never puts her foot on the ground she looks over at the house 
suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again she 
investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes

flora and three small maori children play amongst some native pines 
two maori women smoke and chat nearby the children rub up and down 
against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them the game has an edge 
of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a 
group unseen by the children stewart marches towards flora he pulls 
her off the tree

                         stewart

stewart stops and looks at her

               she just plays whatever she 
               pleases sometimes she doesnt 
               play at all

stewart continues through the trees more slowly

hands and places them lightly on the keys she turns from habit over 
her left shoulder where stewart waits crossed armed quickly she 
removes her hands stands and gestures flora to play flora proudly 
takes p the seat she pulls her lips in trying to control her 
happiness to say in front of both her mother and stewart

ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano ada is seen through 
the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly blackened trunks 
stewarts attention is drawn to ada he interrupts floras singing 
with a sudden outburst

play it we have it back and 
she just wanders off

flora stops to watch her mother through the window ada looks towards 
the house as the music stops

grimly stewart slaps the top of the piano to floras playing

stiffly irresistibly lifts and turns in the direction baines hut

slit of light falls across the piano highlighting its rosey walnut

taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano her finger 
holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its 
side a small heart and an arrow putting the cloth aside she sits at 
the piano to begin playing

she starts with wholehearted feeling her eyes closed but before long 
she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 
starts glancing over her shoulder she stops and begins again but 
once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she 
pauses in her playing disquieted she starts again and again she looks 
away she stops confused unable to go on unable to getup one hand 
on the lid and one on the piano keys

simply being there standing there baines comes through from the 
bedroom seeing ada he is aloof suspicious and his blinking becomes 
pronounced

               you leave something i have not 
               found anything

ada does not respond finally she looks at baines and her look has a 
vulnerability and frankness that takes him off guard

               does he know something

ada shakes her head

               the piano is not harmed it 
               arrived safely would you like 
               to sit i am going to sit

ada does not sit she stands immobilised  baines attempts to maintain 
his casual charade he pours a tea

he turns to her about to speak but stops unmanned by a new fragility 
to her strength he blinks rapidly

               want you because my mind has

               i dont eat i dont sleep if

baines walks roughly towards the door and opens it his softness 
turned suddenly cruel

               go go now leave

ada is stung by his change of tune she takes a step towards him and 
eyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face 
baines nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she 
has spoken words of love ada is flushed shocked the two face each 
other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other 
profoundly equal with each new breath with every moment that their 
eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and 
reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how 
they came to wake where they did they are standing next to each other 
and beginning to kiss each other the lips the cheeks the nose 
there is nothing practised about their tenderness only their feelings 
and emotions guide their instincts baines face crumples with the 
exquisite pain of his pleasure ada cradles his head to her chest 
baines struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin

climbs on to the small verandah carefully stewart peers through some 
loosely slatted boards there are sounds inside which are worrying 
him by standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see 
ada and baines kissing undressing

he reels back angry but just as we might expect him to burst through 
he steps up to look again the fatal second look the look for 
curiosity he watches baines barechested undressing ada her buttons 
burst ada laughs baines touches her under her skirts  anywhere he 
takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings stewart 
watches stepping down to peer lower as baines buries into adas 
skirt he does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand suddenly 
he pulls his hand away and looks at it wet with dog saliva he wipes 
it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised

ada is distracted collecting her buttons from the floor concerned at 
the time past worried to dress and return

the camera cranes down and down to find stewart wedged under the loose 
wooden floor slats he cannot hear clearly but adas hand reaching 
for each button is only inches away one falls through a slat on to 
stewarts neck and on down his shirt collar as she stands he rolls 
out

               hair behind her ear i already

ada considers this question clearly she doesnt know the question is 
more complex to her than to him then as if by way of answer she 
kisses him strongly and sexually baines pulls away confused ada 
finishes dressing baines comes up behind her to help with the 
buttons

               you are serious come tomorrow

ada turns and kisses him passionately with the new born enthusiasm of 
someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex then as 
quickly as she began she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave

ballooning adas cape wrapping it up high around her the tree tops 
are swaying furiously inside the bush it is dark and ada hurries up 
through the path she is out or breath and glancing behind her as if 
to guard against followers when directly in front of her stewart 
steps out onto her path ada stops short the look on his face is 
unlike any expression she has yet seen his eyes do not look at her 
but all about her in a way more animal than human she lowers her eyes 
and calling his bluff walks steadily past him but stewart takes her 
arm and spinning her back pulls her close and blind to all protest 
kisses her ada struggles furiously his grip falters and she steps 
back staring at him then runs off down the hill but stewart is on 
top of her clasping her skirts pulling her towards him hand over 
hand she slips and falls to the ground stewart is upon her lifting 
her dress touching her legs ada goes quite still which throws 
stewart long enough for her to scramble away yet again stewart 
catches her and again they roll on the ground stewart touching and 
kissing her ada turning herself this way and that to avoid it there 
is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by 
flora calling up the path distraught and in tears her angel wings 
have twisted about her waist

wearing a top hat and a long black dress beside her stands the maori 
who absconded with the buttons most of which he has attached to his 
jacket she plays loudly with two closed fists her companion listens 
gravely placidly blinking at the crashes two others listen from the 
doorway one with his bands over his head

adas face pales in the diminishing light exasperated by the 
threatened incarceration she shakes her head with anguish and moving 
to the piano lifts the lid and plays several bars brutally and 
strongly she passes on to the bedroom where she picks up the small 
hand mirror and looks at her face puckered with frustration she 
touches her face and neck tenderly then throws herself on the bed 
face to the wall her hands over her ears

flora stands over her mother

takes the clothes she just as soon lets them go and they float off

child after a bad dream fearful and trusting ada continues like a 
nurse spreading ointment on a wound tenderly and attentively she 
strokes down towards his belly stewarts skin goose bumps and be

stewarts face puckers his eyes fill with tears she strokes so 
softly the tenderness is shocking to him gently she pulls his under
garment down exposing his buttocks stewart grabs nervously at them 
hauling them up with his hands ada unclenches his fist and once more 
slowly pulls them down she begins to stroke his buttocks stewart is 
painfully eroticised painfully vulnerable he begins to weep the 
intimacy and softness unman him and he is helpless stewart sits up

helplessness but distanced as if it has nothing to do with her

the table he studies her pale face and dry lips adas eyes flicker 
open

               speaking to his feet 
               i lost my temper im sorry

               cannot do it  even to think on

nothing and has understood nothing she is struggling with pain her 
face grimaces and she groans

               we shall be together you will 
               see it will be better

her forehead is damp with fever she thrashes at the blankets stewart 
pulls them off to cool her he feels her brow

                         stewart
               whispering  
               my love bird

her nightgown is damp with sweat and clings to her body stewart 
reaches out to adjust her gown his hand touches her leg and he holds 
it there feeling a tingle of pleasure that grows and builds the 
longer his hand remains

                         stewart
               ohhhhh my love

his hand begins to move further and further up her leg nudging the 
nightgown higher and higher he looks at her face she is closedeyed 
unconscious stewarts face crinkles into a pained expression and all 
his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment he 
brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee her thigh a 
new thought occurs to him a terrible thought but as he has phrased 
the thought to himself he cannot resist it he glances at her face 
still fevered and unconscious quietly stealthily he begins to undo 
his belt buckle he bends across her to gently separate her legs as 
he moves his body over her he looks towards her and to his shame and 
horror she is looking directly back at him her eyes perfectly on his 
perfectly focused quietly stewart moves back and pulls down her gown 
all the time keeping his eyes on her

                         stewart
               you are feeling better

adas lips move slightly and stewart turns suddenly as if he has heard 
something slowly he turns back to ada

his eyes locked on hers

the sound of his own voice makes him blink he watches her as if 
listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint and distant that 
only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out as 
he watches her his face transforms his eyes fill his lips soften and 
his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own

the kerosene lamp burns fitfully fluttering a light pulse across 
their faces stewart moves closer to ada outside a wind bangs the 
iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a highpitched 
seesaw sound he leans closer still

               his forehead with a palm of his 
               hand her voice was there in 
               my head i watched her lips 
               they did not make the words 
               yet the harder i listened the 
               clearer i heard her as clear 
               as i hear you as dear as i 
               hear my own voice

stewart looks up at the ceiling as if reciting something he has learnt 
by heart and means to repeat exactly as he heard it

                         stewart
               she said i have to go let me 
               go let baines take me away

               frightened of my will of what 
               it might do it is so strange

               you punished her wrongly it 
               was me my fault

stewart does not answer finally be looks up his eyes full with 
tears

               understand me i am here for

the canoe has paddled away from the shore flora leans over the edge 
of the canoe her mouth open her hair held back by baines

                         flora
               i cant

baines rubs her back flora straightens up

               i cant

they retake their seats floras back to the piano while baines sits 
next to ada he tenderly takes her good hand ada removes hers and 
signs to flora who looks at her mother then baines amazed

                         baines
               what did she say

                         flora
               puzzled she says throw the 
               piano overboard

                         baines
               to ada its quite safe they 
               are managing

ada signs again

                         baines
               cautiously what

                         flora
               she says throw it overboard 
               she doesnt want it she says 
               its spoiled

                         baines
               i have the key here look ill 
               have it mended

ada mimes directly to baines push it over her determination is 
increasing

                         maori oarsman
               ae peja turakina bushit 
               peja te kawheha kite moana
               yeah shes right push it over 
               push the coffin in the water 
                    subtitled

                         baines
softly urgently please ada 
you will regret it its your 
piano i want you to have it

but ada does not listen she is adamant and begins to untie the ropes

                         flora
               panicking
               she doesnt want it

the canoe is unbalancing as ada struggles with the ropes

                         baines
               all right sit down sit down

ada sits pleased her eyes glow and her face is now alive

baines speaks to the maoris who stop paddling and together they loosen 
the ropes securing the piano to the canoe

as they maneuver the piano to the edge ada jocks into the water she 
puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth

the piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over as the 
piano splashes into the sea the loose ropes speed their way after it 
ada watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal 
curiosity odd and undisciplined she steps into a loop

the rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the 
sea and pulled by the piano down through the cold water

sc 146int     sea near beach     day     sc 146

bubbles tumble from her mouth down she falls on and on her eyes are 
open her clothes twisting about her the maoris diving after her 
cannot reach her in these depths ada begins to struggle she kicks at 
the rope but it holds tight around her boot she kicks hard again and 
then with her other foot levers herself free from her shoe the piano 
and her shoe continue their fall while ada floats above suspended in 
the deep water then suddenly her body awakes and fights struggling 
upwards to the surface

sc 147 ext     at sea beach     day     sc 147

as ada breaks the surface her voice over begins

                         ada voice over
               what a death
               what a chance
               what a surprise
               my will has chosen life
               still it has had me spooked and 
               many others besides

ada coughing and spluttering is pulled on to the canoe she is wrapped 
in jackets and blankets

               practice only when i am alone 
               and it is dark

dull light

only  a dim blue evening wash over her head she has a dark cloth her 
voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels

                         ada voice over
               at night i think of my piano 
               in its ocean grave and 
               sometimes of myself floating 
               above it down there everything 
               is so still and silent that it 
               lulls me to sleep it is a 
               weird lullaby and so it is it 
               is mine

adas piano on the seabed its lid fallen away above floats ada her 
hair and arms stretched out in a gesture of surrender her body slowly 
turning on the end of the rope the seaweeds rust coloured fronds 
reach out to touch her

there is a silence where hath been no sound
there is a silence where no sound may be
in the cold grave under the deep deep sea
