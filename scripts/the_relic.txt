     a taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds

     int taxi  night

     in the back seat is whittlesley early 40s the wreck of a once
     handsome man unshaven  sweat stained  rail thin  scratches on his
     arms a fresh scar on one cheek  as the taxi roars downhill towards
     the harbor whittlesley leans over the front seat  italics indicate

                              whittlesleydo yousweat pouring down his brow the driver redoubles his speed

     ext belem streets  night

     the taxi swerves around a corner nearly crashing into a fruit cart
     flies out of sight

     ext harbor  belem  night

     light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters  we hear
     faint laughter leavened with portuguese phrases distant calypso music
     from waterfront bars  one of the smaller boats the santa lucia is
     loading as the taxi fishtails to a halt

     whittlesley gets out sees the boat still at dock  his face floods
     with relief

                              whittlesley
                    thank god

     he tosses a handful of bills into the drivers lap sprints up the
     pier as the driver shouts curses after him in portuguese  whittlesley
     shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the santa lucia
     the boats engines churn to life

                              whittlesleyi need to speak to the captain
                    where is hethe sailors hold whittlesley back

                    to save your lives you foolsseveral crew members murmur the word loco  hearing the commotion a
     squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches  captain

                              franco
                    american

                              whittlesley

                    board  they were shipped by mistake
                    to the natural history museum  we
                    have to get them off the boat

                              franco
                    you have id

     whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair trying to keep
     control and appear reasonable

                              whittlesley
                    no  let me explain  i was on an
                    expedition for the museum on the
                    upper xingu  something horrible
                    happened  im the only one who got
                    out alive  i lost everything my
                    id everything  i have to make
                    sure no one else dies  the crates
                    the crates were sent out before we
                    knew  theres something unspeakable
                    inside  if your boat leaves harbor
                    with those crates on board i cant
                    be responsible  my god if they
                    reach new york 

     whittlesleys fists clench spasmodically  franco looks to his men

                              franco
                    loco

                              whittlesley
                    no  im not crazy  as god is my
                    witness im telling the truth

     franco barks an order and several sailors grab whittlesley by the
     arms  they start to lead him back to shore

                              whittlesleydont do this  you have to believe
                    me  your lives are in dangerthe sailors laugh  but with an almost superhuman strength born of
     desperation whittlesley throws them off  he pulls out his wallet

                              whittlesley
                    cash  cash you see  american money

     whittlesley throws the money down on the deck  the breeze scatters the
     bills across the bow and all the men including captain franco
     scramble for the money chattering in portuguese  while they are
     occupied whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck

     int hold  santa lucia  night

     whittlesley ducks between cages of goats boxes of farm equipment his
     movements jerky with panic  as he continues searching the camera
     moves past him into the darkness of the hold  we hear whittlesley
     mumbling between low ragged breaths  at the back of the boat the
     camera finds 

     a stack of crates clearly labeled natural history museum  move in on
     these as the crates vibrate  the boat has started to move
     whittlesley stands bolt upright realizing whats going on

                              whittlesley
                    no

     too late  he turns to run back on deck but then stops sniffs the air
     a look of desperation fills his eyes  with one hand he pulls out the
     knife and unexpectedly puts it to his own neck  better to kill
     himself than face what comes next  the knife touches 

     anecklace of two arrows one gold another silver

     whittlesley stares wideeyed into the blackness of the hold  the goats
     start bleating in blind panic  a shaft of moonlight comes through a
     porthole as the boat turns  the moonlight falls on

     the crates  whittlesleys eyes lock onto them and he inches towards
     them drawn inexorably closer closer 

                              whittlesley
                    no no 

     he begins mumbling a prayer

     move in on his eyes filled with dread as he falls to his knees
     staring always staring at the crates 

     ext docks  night

     the crew tends to business and the santa lucia points out of the
     harbor disappears into the night

                                                            dissolve to

     ext louisianna coast  day title card june

     squad cars roar down the back roads sirens flashing  in the center of
     the column is an unmarked car

     int unmarked car  day

     at the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing
     a simple oldfashioned dark suit narrow black tie and white shirt
     this is special agent pendergast fbi

     a bach sonata for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck
     pendergast hums along as he drives  a small town cop rides shotgun
     the cop is intimidated both by pendergast and the mornings events  he
     sweats heavily as he brings pendergast up to date

                              small town cop
                    one of the locals found it at dawn
                    didnt believe him till i saw it
                    myself  even then i didnt believe
                    it  scared my men shitless  me too
                    i mean hell you could smell it a
                    half mile away mr pendergast

                              pendergast
                        unperturbed
                    any of your men go on board

                              small town cop
                    no sir  no way  none of us wanted
                    to im the first to admit it  i
                    said dont get within a mile of
                    this thing  its way to big for us
                    im calling the fbi

     pendergast nods his approval resumes humming along with a
     particularly intricate harpsichord riff  as always the man is
     unflappable and totally calm as he drives

     ext louisiana beach  day

     the ocean is still the air stifling and close  a hot sun beats down
     on the deck of the santa lucia  the boat lists at a crazy angle where
     it has been washed up on the shore  at first glance it appears to be
     deserted  a barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each
     successive wave  we hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad
     cars pulls up  joining them now are two ambulances

     pendergast gets out along with the others  all of the cops immediately
     cover their faces gagging violently at the smell  pendergast sniffs
     once and frowns  apart from this he doesnt react

                              small town cop
                        choking
                    goin upwind if you dont mind

     pendergast nods  the cops all fall back in revulsion  they watch from
     a safe distance as pendergast approaches the ghost ship  his shiny
     laced wingtips sink in the sand  he leans down pulls them off one at
     a time  he balls both socks puts them carefully into his shoes and
     proceeds barefoot towards the boat

     using a piece of driftwood as a plank pendergast leans it against the
     santa lucia  with surprising agility he leaps up the plank to the
     deck  at the top he touches a rail  its covered in a dark sticky
     liquid

     blood  flies buzz loudly  a large machete lies abandoned in the stern
     chairs are overturned  a dead goat eviscerated lies in the bow  a
     lifeboat hangs half off the stern  pendergast moves aft  the cops
     watch from the sand below unwilling to get any closer  pendergast
     hears a door slamming open and closed  he follows the noise and
     sees 

     the door to the hold  he approaches pushes it open and looks down the
     stairwell  below deck are

     bodies stacks of them  theyve been torn to shreds

     the camera moves down to one particular man who is nearest the top of
     the stairs  its captain franco  his face is frozen in a howl of
     terror  flies congregate in the eye sockets  with his foot pendergast
     nudges the body over  the skull has been torn openthere is no back to francos head

     and the woman wearing the necklace margo green  she sips her morning
     coffee as she makes notes on several large fossilized teeth  her hair
     is neatly combed  no makeup  she doesnt need it  she has a natural
     unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap

     at margos elbow is a small tv  a cnn world news report plays
     margos new york times is open to the crossword puzzle which shes
     been doing rapidly in ink  clearly this is a woman who likes order
     with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time

     an alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the
     crossword puzzle makes one final note on the fossil specimens and
     shuts off the tv  she reaches for her back pack and looks out at
     central park with remarkably clear eyes

     helicopter shot swooping over the fall foliage of the park a riot
     of color and botanical life the camera picks out margos bicycle
     making its way along the winding roads dodging taxi cabs  margo wears
     jeans a work shirt a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone
     double helix pin  on her back is a leather back pack which holds her
     lap top computer  she emerges from the park catches the green light
     and rolls up to 

     ext museum of natural history  day

     as margo arrives the camera moves up and over the building comes to
     rest on the imposing turrets intersecting roof lines and gothic
     arches of the museum of natural history  this is not an ordinary
     building its a 19th century monument to science and mankind  the
     structure fills an entire city block

     happy visitors pour into the museum as margo takes the imposing wide
     stone steps two at a time  we hear screams of pleasure and release
     the normal raucous noises of a large group of third grade children
     margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids  their teacher
     mrs beasley a stern woman in glasses with a thick new york accent
     calls after them as they all head inside

                              mrs beasley
                    dont run children  stay with your
                    partner and do not run  if anyone
                    runs they will be sent back to the
                    bus

     ignoring mrs beasley two boys charge past margo  henry and larry
     henry has a buzz cut larry has rasta dread knots  both are 8 years
     old wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles

                              mrs beasley

     reluctantly henry and larry slow to a rapid racewalk as they reach
     the huge doorway flanked by two northwest coast indian totem poles
     above the doorway workmen are hanging a large banner  it reads

     the school children burst into a three story space dominated by a

     dresses and thinks like a banker  hired for his amazing ability to
     raise money cuthbert is one of a new generation of museum directors
     whose focus must always be on the bottom line

                              margo

                    you will be after tomorrow night

     cuthbert waves merrily  a workman uses a ladder in the stairwell
     cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder stops and carefully walks
     around it instead  margo smiles goes on upstairs

     int museum basement  day

     cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell  he is now in one of the
     hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general
     public  he follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined
     with rumbling steam pipes  there are storage areas on both sides
     labeled ornithology herpitology central asia expeditions akeley
     expeditions whale bone fossils and so on  finally cuthbert comes to a
     door marked

     whittlesley expeditions 197895  cuthbert pauses and gets out a key
     but to his surprise the door pushes open  the lock and doorknob
     mechanism are both broken off  cuthbert frowns

                              cuthbert
                    what the 

     he goes inside

     int whittlesley collection basement  day

     cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall narrow space  stacks of metal
     shelves reach up into the gloom  everywhere we see spears shields
     masks various artifacts  ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in
     plastic like corpses against the walls  and in the middle of the
     gloom sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are 

     the whittlesley crates  the same ones last seen in the hold of the
     illfated santa lucia  they are scattered about in disarray  one in
     particular has been broken open its contents spread on the floor
     cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay kneels by the crate

                              cuthbert
                    no it cant be

     cuthbert feels gently through the packing material lets out a sigh of
     relief as he pulls out a figurine  it is a small beautifully carved
     statue of a monster crouched on all fours

     the room falls totally silent as cuthbert studies the relic  its a
     truly frightening piece massive razor sharp claws large round
     nostrils enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes  suddenly cuthbert sees a
     drop of blood on his hand  hes been cut

                              cuthbert
                    damn

     cuthbert rises shakes his finger in pain  blood drips on the floor
     he pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound  the
     handkerchief rapidly soaks through  suddenly a hand clamps on
     cuthberts shoulder  hes not alone  he lets out a yelp almost
     dropping the relic and spins to see 

     a museum guard standing behind him  his nameplate reads beauregard
     hes a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling
     southern accent

                              cuthbert
                    beauregard  you scared me half to
                    death

                              beauregard
                    im sorry sir  you okay

                              cuthbert
                    someone broke into this room

                              beauregard
                    anything missin

                              cuthbert
                    doesnt look like it  were damned
                    lucky  this statue is priceless

     cuthbert holds up the relic of the monster  beauregard stares

                              cuthbert
                    mbwun  a south american warrior
                    deity  he carries a powerful curse
                    every member of the expedition that
                    found this statue died

     beauregard sees cuthberts cut finger

                              beauregard
                    looks like the curse is still at
                    work

                              cuthbert
                    the claws are sharp i must have
                    cut myself
                        uneasy laugh
                    better move these crates to the
                    secure storage area where theyll be
                    safe

     beauregard studies the door as cuthbert heads out with the figurine

                              beauregard
                    dont know if itll do any good mr
                    cuthbert

                              cuthbert
                    why not

                              beauregard
                    no one broke into this room sir
                    someone broke out  that lock was
                    torn off from theinside

     cuthbert glances at the evil face of mbwun pales  as he exits hold
     on beauregard left alone with the crates

     int physical anthropology lab  day

     huge centrifuges hissing autoclaves electrophoresis apparati
     glowing monitors elaborate blownglass distillation columns and
     titration setups  one of the most advanced technical facilities of
     its kind  and mixed in with all the modern machinery are

     skeletons of all kinds  complete homo sapien specimens are scattered
     around the room  standing midst all this is gregory kawakita early
     twenties  kawakita makes sharp jerky overhead movements with his left
     hand waving something about  hes practicing casting  we hear the
     zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as margo enters  a fly
     whips out passing right under her nose

                              kawakita
                    third from the end  right shoulder
                    aleut provenance unknown

     the fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third
     skeleton from the end labeled aleut provenance unknown margo
     rolls her eyes and kawakita smiles with pride

                              kawakita
                    if i spent half the time on my
                    fractal evolution thesis that i
                    spend on this fly rod id have my

                              margo
                        small smile
                    but at what a price

     kawakita reels in his line as margo drops her backpack on her large
     desk  an enormous microscope stands by the equally imposing computer
     topped by a tiger skull  a screen saver of an animated pterodactyl
     plays  margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth hits some keys revealing
     columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer
     screen

                              margo
                    i have the species identification on
                    these teeth  we can extract dna and

                    frock  he wanted a demonstration

                              kawakita

                    week

     margo is already out the door

     int corridorsstairwell  museum  day

     margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower
     she half runs down an elegant edwardian fifthfloor corridor her
     footsteps lost in the thick carpet  at the very end is a heavy oak
     door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply
     dr frock

     int frocks office  day

     margo bursts into the unique office which is in startling contrast to
     the modernity of her own  two large bow windows look out over the
     park  upholstered victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint
     carpets featuring large red roses  plant specimens and drawings of
     flora and fauna line the walls  cardboard boxes cover the floor
     seated in a wheelchair is a whitehaired man in a tweed jacket and a
     loud floral tie  glasses slip down his nose

     this is dr frock and hes in the middle of packing  he looks up
     smiles apologetically

                              dr frock
                    hello margo  sorry about the mess

                              margo
                    is it true  greg said youd been
                    fired

                              frock
                    yes  bit of a shock  but as cuthbert
                    so tactfully put it the museum
                    needs new blood  and since ive been
                    here since the mesozoic era 

                              margo
                    i dont believe it

                              frock
                    now margo dont overreact  cuthbert
                    has to cut costs somehow  my leaving
                    makes perfect sense  this isnt
                    exactly early retirement  ive
                    overstayed the party a bit

                              margo
                    we cant do without you  youre one
                    of the foremost authorities on
                    primitive pharmacology  youre
                    practically an institution around
                    here

                              frock
                    that apparently is the problem
                    im yesterdays news  who needs a
                    curator of plant biology in a museum
                    with one exhibit on plants  monsters
                    and dinosaurs cannibals and shamans
                    are the new currency of the realm

     frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and margo
     moves to his side  she pulls frocks books back out of the box
     returns them to his desk

                              margo
                    phyletic transformation and the
                    tertiary fern spike is not going
                    anywhere  ill talk to cuthbert and
                    put a stop to this right now

     she starts for the door and frock wheels into her path  now for the
     first time she sees what hes been carefully hiding the deep pain in
     his eyes

                              frock
                    please  dont humiliate me further

                    in the dust

                              margo
                        stubbornly loyal
                    your work is highly relevant  what
                    about your display on primitive
                    pharmacology  cuthbert told me
                    himself he was going to feature it
                    prominently in the superstition
                    exhibit

                              frock
                    healing plant use among the ki tribe
                    of bechuanaland has been cancelled
                    to make room for tibetan erotic art

     frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says
     the discussion is over

                              frock
                    come on  ill walk you back to the
                    elevator

     int museum hallways  day

     frock rolls back down the hall the way margo just came  margo is
     beside him downcast  shes not used to defeat

                              frock
                    this isnt a death sentence  greg
                    has promised to teach me fly
                    fishing  ill garden  ill write

                    same without you

                              frock
                    everyone needs a change of scenery
                    ive been rolling down these halls
                    for fortyodd years  thats quite
                    enough

     margo gets in the elevator reluctantly  he smiles and meets her eye

                              frock
                    ill see you at lunch

     he waves her off merrily  but once the doors close and margos out of
     sight frocks smile fades and his shoulders sag  he ducks his
     wheelchair quickly into the hall of african mammals

     int hall of african mammals  afternoon

     two stories high dark and dramatic  a very special display  dioramas
     of lions hippos wart hogs etc  in the middle is a large statue of a
     gorilla beating its chest  frock takes refuge in the darkness of the
     exhibit  his wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly
     wipe the back of his hands across his eyes

     int mollusks exhibit  day

     shells and sea life line the walls  a sign announces the exhibit
     mollusks and our world  the third grade class sweeps in  larry and
     henry start to sing mollusks and our world to the tune of welcome
     to our world the fao schwartz theme song  mrs beasley shoots
     them the evil eye and henry whines 

                              henry
                    mrs beasley its almost time to go
                    and we still havent seen the
                    dinosaurs

                              beasley
                    if you ask me about the dinosaurs
                    once more iii strangle you both

     she starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone
     henry and larry hang back

                              larry
                        whispers
                    this room sucks

                              henry
                    shes never going to take us to see
                    the dinosaurs  that lady said they
                    were on the fourth floor

                              larry
                    lets ditch and find them ourselves

     they dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs

     int reptiles and amphibians room  day

     larry and henry emerge and walk wideeyed among the cases of lizards
     chameleons tortoises  high windows light the room  outside the sun is
     going down  a woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys
     have the hall to themselves

                              larry
                    look at this  a komodo dragon

     as larry checks out the huge dragonlike reptile which has just
     sunk its jaws into a stuffed boar  henry points to a stuffed gecko
     climbing vertically up the side of its case

                              henry
                    check out this one  it can walk up
                    walls

     larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary
     barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room
     painting is in progress  scaffolding just begs to be climbed  henry
     runs over and starts up the scaffolding  larry hesitates

                              larry
                    were not supposed to go back there

                              henry
                    chicken  this is a great short cut

     henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and larry follows  in
     a moment both disappear from sight

     int museum hall of birds  day

     windowless and dark  a closed display under maintenance  thousands of
     little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling white
     cotton poking out of sightless eyes  henry and larry enter and slow
     down  larrys getting scared

                              larry
                    i dont want to go this way

                              henry
                    dont be a wuss  come on

     the boys continue onward more slowly their footfalls echoing in the
     silence

     int back hallways  day

     the children are now far from the other tourists and their class
     larry is frightened  the hall takes a sharp dogleg ending in a
     darkened culdesac full of display cases filled with hideous carved
     masks  against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which
     looks much like a wall  henry tugs at it and the barricade moves  he
     looks behind

                              henry
                    hey theres a secret staircase back
                    here  cool

     henry disappears behind the barricade leaving larry completely alone
     in the dark room with the shaman masks

                              larry
                    henry come back

     henry doesnt respond  the lights in the cases throw strange shadows
     larry starts to sniffle falls to hiccuping sits down  he pulls on a
     little flap of rubber thats coming off the toe of his sneaker all
     bravado gone

                              larry
                    henry  henry

     no answer  larry rises and peeks behind the barricade  he sees the
     circular stair  it descends into total darkness  from below comes a
     strange smell that makes larrys nose wrinkle

                              larry
                    henry

     no answer  larry puts his first foot on the stair

                              larry
                    henry  come up  please

     with no other option but staying alone in the dark larry follows
     henry down

     int spiral staircase  day

     larry clutches the banister whispers 

                              larry
                    henry  where are you  henry

     larry takes another step  another  and another  he stops  below him he
     hears snuffling rather like a large dog  larry freezes starts to
     cry

                              larry
                    henry  henry  it smells awful
                    answer me  are you all right

     larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions
     he pauses near the bottom of the stairs eyes wide holding his
     breath  there appears to be a darker area of shadow at the end of the
     hall  its gliding towards them

     suddenly something closes on larrys leg and he yelps  its henry
     henry pulls larry the rest of the way down the stairs  they stand
     alone together in the darkness  henry hisses

                              henry
                    quiet

                              larry
                    what is it

                              henry
                    i dont know  but i think its bad

     they keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as
     they back up step by step  move in as their faces suddenly twist with
     fear  the boys scream bloody murder the sound echoes in the
     darkness as we 

                                                            cut to

     int margos apartment  night

     margo sits up in the darkness gasping  moonlight cuts across the bed
     it takes a moment for her to realize that shes had a nightmare  she
     reaches for her light  as she switches it on we see a photo on her
     bedside table  it shows a group on a mountain in tibet  there are
     several people with their arms slung around each other  at the end is
     a younger margo holding hands with john whittlesley  they appear to be
     more than friends

     on margo she looks at the photo a moment then turns off the light
     and lies back alone in her bed

                                                            dissolve to

     ext central park west  day

     yellow crime tape encircles the museum  dead leaves swirl in clusters
     and the sky is overcast  overnight fall turned to winter  the front
     of the museum is ringed with police cars  margo rides up on her bike
     and pauses startled at the sight  we watch as she crosses has a few
     words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance  she
     wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up 

     a taxi cab arriving at the front entrance  out steps special agent

     int lower rotunda  day

     margo enters  the huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved
     from the trunk of a single tree  inside it are mannequins of northwest
     coast indians  milling around are at least twenty cops  one

                    all employees are to go to the imax
                    room for a briefing dr green

     int side hall  museum  day

     several cops go by with tracking dogs  margo looks back at the dogs
     increasingly uneasy almost bumps into 

     henry and larry  surprisingly they are alive and well and seated with
     mrs beasley outside an office  margo exchanges a look with both boys
     remembering them from yesterday  a tentative smile starts but henry
     and larry dont return it  serious and chastened they drop their
     eyes  margo continues on

     two cops stand outside the door to the rest room their backs turned
     to margo as she approaches

                              cop one
                    what was that  six

                              cop two
                    lost count

     margo glances past them to see an older man wearing the badge of a
     night watchman leaning over a sink  he wipes his mouth  margos eyes
     move down to see the mans sneakers are soaked in blood

     int hall of advanced fossil mammals  day

     more cops gather surrounded by skeletons of primates humans
     monkeys gorillas  its an odd sight  they all look up with interest
     as in walks the imposing figure of 

     special agent pendergast  he turns to a young eager beaver officer
     bailey flashes his badge  bailey straightens to attention

                              pendergast
                    could you please take me to the
                    officer in charge

     int circular stairwell  day

     pendergast follows bailey as they descend the rickety old metal
     staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum  the hall below them
     is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb  the stairway opens onto a
     mazelike set of rooms in the basement  everything around them is
     streaked and spattered in blood  there are trails of it on the floor
     the walls the overhead light

     several cops stand guard as detective vince dagosta goes over the
     area  he is a round balding man with an unmistakable air of
     authority  a modern knight in shining armor in disguisedeepdisguise  he has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt  his tshirt
     is plainly visible underneath  on his worn plastic belt is a badge

                              dagosta
                    dont touch anything until the
                    soc  has finished with those
                    stairs  keep everyone clear of the
                    perimeter  i dont want any
                    contamination  theres an incredible
                    amount of blood evidence down here
                    we need more light  wheres the
                    photographer  tell him to quit
                    eating donuts i need him

     as pendergast enters dagosta looks up at this serious african
     american in simple black suit white shirt and dark tie

                              dagosta
                    who are you  the undertaker

                              pendergast
                    special agent pendergast  fbi

                              dagosta
                    vince dagosta  am i out

                              pendergast

                    working on the same case  if so i
                    could use your help

     the two men shake hands  they couldnt be more different  pendergast
     is an elegant intellectual dagosta a working class spark plug who
     operates from the gut  pendergast gestures to the form on the ground

                              pendergast
                    the body

                              dagosta
                    whats left of it

                              pendergast
                    mind if i have a look

     dagosta calls to a police photographer who comes down the staircase
     carrying lights a donut stuffed in his mouth

                              dagosta
                    we need light in here stat

                              pendergast
                    wheres the head

     dagosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball thats in the
     corner

                              dagosta
                    careful  that mess on the ground is
                    brains

                              pendergast
                    whose footprints

                              dagosta
                    night watchman who found the body
                    sweet old man  been tossing his
                    cookies for over an hour  not a
                    likely suspect

     the photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with
     light  and now everyone but notus gets a very clear look at the
     body

     the photographer spits out his donut  his eyes roll up and he drops
     in a dead faint  just like that  dagosta swallows hard

                              dagosta
                    woof

     pendergast looks down utterly impassive

                              pendergast
                    yes id say were definitely
                    working on the same case

     recent addition an imax screen five stories high  the room is filling
     with museum employees all murmuring anxiously  margo sits down next

                    been killed  look its cuthbert
                    lets hear what really happened

     at this everyone falls silent and ian cuthbert steps forward to
     address the crowd  he appears drawn and grey

                              cuthbert
                    this has been a tragic and upsetting
                    morning  i have terrible news for us
                    all  a member of our security force
                    has been found murdered  the police
                    have just informed me it was daniel
                    beauregard
                        murmuring fills the room
                    quiet  please  with the help of our
                    head of security mr ippolito the
                    museum has been secured

     ippolito rises in the back and nods to the crowd hes an imperious
     looking pompous man with shifty eyes  right now hes defensive
     overnight his job is on the line 

                              cuthbert
                    the police are satisfied were in no
                    danger that were all perfectly
                    safe  weve been asked to remain in
                    the gem room and be available for
                    questioning for the rest of the day

                    we can to cooperate  are there any
                    questions

     ippolito raises a hand

                              ippolito
                    the party for the opening of the
                    superstition exhibit i imagine in
                    the light of whats happened it will
                    be pushed back

                              cuthbert
                    no action has been taken yet  the
                    opening of the exhibit is crucial to
                    the financial health of this museum
                    so for now we expect that the
                    superstition exhibit will open on
                    schedule tomorrow night

     ippolito registers surprise  the audience buzzes again

                    exhibitions success  the museum is
                    in debt  contributions and public
                    funding have dried up  admissions no
                    longer cover overhead  the last big
                    infusion of cash we had was the king
                    tut exhibit  cuthbert was hired to
                    get us out of the red  if the
                    superstition exhibit isnt

     compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a rabbits
     foot  frock goes over to speak to him followed by margo and greg

                              frock
                    ian  are you okay

                              cuthbert

                    beauregard  i cant believe it  i
                    may have been the last one to see
                    him alive  he was with me just
                    yesterday when i got out the statue
                    of mbwun

                              margo
                        taken aback
                    mbwun

                              kawakita
                        sensing more gossip
                    whats that

     margo frowns suddenly uneasy  she and dr frock exchange a look

                              margo
                    warrior deity of the kothoga an
                    extinct south american tribe  dr
                    john whittlesley led an expedition
                    that found the only known
                    representation of mbwun  the statue
                    is said to carry a curse
                        she looks away quiet
                    every member of whittlesleys
                    expedition died

                              cuthbert
                    i got the relic out yesterday to put
                    on display  beauregard was there
                    the crates had been broken into and
                    the contents were strewn about  but
                    nothing was missing  it was
                    downright weird  we joked that it
                    was the curse of mbwun  im not
                    laughing now

                              frock

                    superstitious  but youre among
                    scientists here  we deal in facts
                    that statue had nothing to do with
                    what happened to beauregard

                              cuthbert
                    all i know is everyone who has come
                    in contact with that relic is dead

     pendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds
     that line the walls

                              pendergast
                    an original roger tory peterson of a
                    redbreasted merganser  amazing  i

                    home

                              dagosta
                    cant really focus on birds at the
                    moment pendergast  im tryin to
                    keep my breakfast down

                              pendergast
                    in this violent world i believe the
                    only way to stay sane is to take
                    time to notice beautiful things

                              dagosta
                    i drink  after hours of course  on
                    duty i smoke
                        he pulls out a fat cigar
                    do you mind

                              pendergast
                    not at all  i enjoy the smell of a
                    good cigar

                              dagosta
                    then you wont like this one  its a
                    piece of shit

     he bites off the end spits it out on the floor

                              pendergast
                    lieutenant 

                              dagosta
                    call me vince

                              pendergast
                    did you read about a boat that
                    washed up outside of new orleans
                    about four months ago  twelve bodies
                    on board

                              dagosta
                    who didnt  big news  out of brazil
                    wasnt it

                              pendergast
                    yes  thats my case  now its yours
                    all the corpses were badly mutilated
                    in a very particular way
                    decapitated  brains extracted  limbs
                    torn to shreds  it looked like the
                    work of a large animal but there
                    was no sign of an animal on board

                              dagosta
                    so the method of death is the only
                    connection

                              pendergast
                    no  theres more  there were crates
                    from this museum in the hold of the
                    boat

     bailey enters interrupts

                              bailey

                    them

                              dagosta
                        rolls his eyes
                    no

                              pendergast
                    if you dont mind this could be
                    important

                              pendergast

     int museum classroom  day

     a modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the
     purpose of interrogation  seated on small chairs at a plain table
     are 

     henry and larry looking like two little boys with a story they are
     desperate to share  standing behind them is mrs beasley starchier
     than ever  dagosta takes a chair across from the boys at their eye
     level  by this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired
     pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind  this
     isnt hard duty for dagosta  hes surprisingly genial and at ease
     with kids  larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in
     excitement  henry tugs his tshirt

                              dagosta

                        he looks to pendergast so formal
                    special agent pendergast

                              beasley
                    this is henry weiss and larry
                    bowers

                              dagosta
                    so tell us about this monster

                              larry
                    we were lost and trying to find a
                    short cut to the dino

     henry elbows him hard  larry shuts up

                              henry
                    we were just lost okay  and we went
                    down this curvy staircase  at the
                    bottom was a big shadow

                              larry
                    big as a house

                              henry
                    not that big

                              larry
                    well almost  depends which house  it
                    smelled like old hamburger and it
                    made this weird noise

     henry makes a low growl in his throat  dagosta suppresses a smile
     shoots pendergast a look  but pendergast watches the kids intently

                              larry
                    and it snuffled the ground like a
                    dog

                              henry
                    like this

     he goes on hands and knees sniffs the ground

                              larry
                    it had a long tongue teeth this big
                    and yellow eyes

                              henry
                    they were green eyes and they were
                    slit like a lizards

                              larry
                    they were yellow

                              henry
                    youre color blind

                              beasley
                    boys please
                        to dagosta
                    these two get in a lot of mischief
                    and they tell some amazing whoppers

                              dagosta
                    i can see that

                              henry
                    this isnt a whopper  its the
                    truth

     pendergast now moves forward pulls up a chair as if deeply
     interested

                              pendergast
                    how did you get away

                              henry

                    we got through a little door just in
                    time  there was a guard there and he
                    went back to check

                              pendergast

     ext museum  day

     an ambulance pulls away lights flashing  pendergast and dagosta walk
     to a squad car

                              dagosta
                    ive got to admit that was a damn
                    sight better than the dog ate my
                    homework

                              pendergast
                    how do you explain the part about
                    beauregard

                              dagosta
                    they heard the victims name and
                    wove him into their story  nice
                    touch

                              pendergast
                    i believed them

     dagosta stops stunned

                              dagosta
                    you think what weve got here is a
                    monster as big as a house that
                    smells like hamburger

                              pendergast
                    no  i think what weve got here is a
                    psychotic killer wielding some kind
                    of unusual weapon who wants us to
                    believe hes a monster

                              dagosta
                        totally confused
                    oh

     int new york city morgue  evening

     dagosta and pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies
     on gurneys  its dark and quiet  they go into the autopsy room

     int autopsy room  afternoon

     a large gurney currently empty sits like an uninvited guest under
     the bright lights of the autopsy suite  beside it is a tall imposing
     doctor in her late 50s with intense eyes  this is dr ziewzic  with
     her are the photographer seen passing out at the museum and a young
     intern doctor gross

                              dr ziewzic
                    youre late vince

                              dagosta
                    sorry dr ziewzic  this is special
                    agent pendergast  pendergast dr
                    ziewzic  she runs the best chop shop
                    in new york

                              pendergast
                    weve met  the hacksaw murders  89

                              dr ziewzic
                    oh yes  who could forget  afterwards
                    you sent me that amazing case of
                    chateau lafitte

                              pendergast
                    i hope you liked it

                              dr ziewzic
                    lovely bouquet  after our last case
                    vince took me out for a draft beer
                    as i recall we split the check

                              dagosta
                        grumbles
                    its been one of those days

                              dr ziewzic
                        she snaps her rubber glove
                    shall we get down to it then

     dr gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a
     drawer  the shape under the plastic seems too small to be human  to
     the side of it is a large bump presumably the head  the two pieces of
     cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights  a
     stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurneys outlet pipe  dr
     ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body she taps it
     and it gives off the proper static

                              dr ziewzic
                        for the microphone
                    this is dr matilda ziewzic
                    assisted by dr frederick gross
                    its oct 28 six fifteen pm  we
                    are joined by lieutenant vincent
                    dagosta of the nypd special agent
                    pendergast of the fbi and a police
                    photographer  lets see what weve
                    got

     they pull off the sheet and dagosta swallows hard closes his eyes to
     keep his stomach in check  the photographer goes green but is
     determined not to clutch this time  pendergast leans closer totally
     impassive  he puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses assumes an
     expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant

                              dr ziewzic
                    caucasian male  age about 27  blond
                    height well i cant give a height
                    because mr beauregard has been
                    decapitated  the state of the body
                    is such that other identifying marks
                    are out of the question  there are
                    numerous lacerations proceeding from
                    the left anterior pectoral downwards
                    through the sternum and terminating
                    in the abdomen  this is a massive
                    wound two feet long and a foot
                    wide  the head has suffered severe
                    trauma and the occipital portion of
                    the calavarium has been crushed and
                    removed  it almost looks like 

                              dr gross
                        beat
                    a bite

     ziewzic turns to pendergast

                              dr ziewzic
                    what are we talking about here

                              pendergast
                    someone who makes the hacksaw
                    murderer look like mother teresa

                              dr ziewzic
                    right
                        back to work
                    the entire brain appears to have
                    been extracted  may i see it
                    please

     gross passes over a grey watery mass that sits in a stainless steel
     pan  ziewzic studies beauregards brain or whats left of it 

                              dr ziewzic
                    curious  theres something missing

                              pendergast
                    the thalamus and the hypothalamus
                    perhaps

                              dr ziewzic
                        looks up surprised
                    yes  two organs the size of a walnut
                    have been removed with what looks
                    like surgical precision

                              dagosta
                    what happened to them

                              pendergast
                    if you dont mind a suggestion you
                    might try a saliva test

     ziewzic gross and dagosta look at pendergast  the photographer is
     staring at the wall silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep
     from woofing all over the place

                              dagosta
                        incredulous
                    saliva test  you mean you think
                    someone ate part of the brain

                              pendergast
                    correct

     a long moment of silence then zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva
     test puts the result in a petrie dish

                              dr zwiezic
                    okay  one saliva test  now lets
                    look at these lacerations  they
                    start wide and then converge

                              dagosta
                    long fingernails  scratches

                              dr zwiezic
                    too extreme  perhaps some kind of
                    weapon  im now probing the wound
                    and theres a piece of foreign
                    material deep in the muscle lodged
                    on a rib  photograph

     the photographer gathers his courage steps forward with dagosta and
     pendergast  zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile
     water  it turns brownish red  she holds it up  they all stare in
     astonished silence  dagosta swallows

                              dagosta
                    sweet jesus

                              dr zwiezic
                    its a claw

     the photographers flash goes off

                                                       dissolve to

     ext streets  night

     a black and white heads uptown

     int cop car  night

     pendergast sits in silence  dagosta is visibly disturbed

                              dagosta
                    i dont like animals  never have
                    dog bit me when i was little  after
                    that i gave up on pets  animals are
                    irrational  give me a psychotic
                    killer any day  if theres one thing
                    that makes me queasy its being part
                    of a food chain  my first case as a
                    rookie two brothers climbed a fence
                    at the zoo  it was late august  over
                    ninety  the polar bear was inside
                    his cave  kids didnt know he was in
                    there  all they saw was the pool
                    they got to swimming and splashing
                    the noise woke up the bear  by the
                    time i arrived both little boys
                    were in pieces  the bear was
                    dragging one kid around by the foot
                    i can still hear the mother
                    screaming 

                              pendergast
                    this isnt an animal vince  ive
                    been on this case four months
                    remember  ive learned a few things

                              dagosta
                    youve been holding out on me
                    pendergast  you have a suspect
                    capable of this

     pendergast looks over nods quietly

                              pendergast
                    let me tell you about it vince

     ext natural history museum  dusk

     of the emergency vehicles have left  the police have released the
     employees who are now headed home  we see frock and kawakita exit
     cuthbert isnt far behind  pendergast approaches them headed back
     inside

                              pendergast
                    excuse me  has dr green left

     pendergast nods his thanks

     int museum hall of the gems  night

     the gems glow in the darkness as pendergast passes through the now
     empty room

     int meteorite room  night

     pendergasts footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far
     stairs

     int hallway  museum  night

     pendergast goes down a long dark hall alone  he arrives at a door
     marked physical anthropology lab enters

     screen glows at the end of the room casting the only light  but her
     chair is empty  the room is quiet  pendergast approaches slowly looks
     around

                              pendergast
                    dr green

     no answer  pendergast glances at the computer screen sees graphs and
     complicated notations  he scrolls down leans closer  he cant figure
     it out  he slides into margos chair fascinated  then 

                              margo os
                    you have a warrant to look at that

     pendergast leaps up  margo has appeared in the doorway behind him a
     cup of coffee in her hand

                              pendergast
                    special agent pendergast  fbi
                    forgive me  i guess i was snooping
                    what is this

                              margo
                    an invention of mine  its a
                    computer program designed to
                    describe the characteristics of a
                    given species from a reading of its
                    dna  i call it the genetic sequence
                    extrapolator

                              pendergast
                    how does it work

                              margo
                    with a dna analysis from a fossil
                    you can use this program to tell the
                    species and sex of the animal
                    whether it was nocturnal what it
                    ate how it hunted how big it
                    was 
                        abrupt
                    you arent here for a lesson in dna

                              pendergast
                    no
                        a moment
                    i came to talk about dr john
                    whittlesley

     margo turns to put down her coffee  she takes a moment to compose
     herself  when she turns back her voice is quiet

                              margo
                    somehow when all this happened i
                    knew it would come back to john  is
                    he really dead

                              pendergast
                    maybe not

                              margo
                    if he were alive hed have contacted
                    me

                              pendergast
                    you have time to talk

     int museum halls  night

     pendergast and margo walk together though various exhibits and halls
     they pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and
     stuffed behind glass

                              pendergast
                    dr whittlesley was last seen in
                    belem venezuela a week after the
                    rest of his expedition disappeared
                    a taxi driver drove him to the
                    harbor where he boarded a cargo
                    boat  that boat washed up in my
                    district  everyone on board was
                    killed

                              margo
                    and john

                              pendergast
                    disappeared  his body wasnt among
                    the victims

                              margo
                    i dont understand

                              pendergast
                    the people killed were mauled and
                    their brains were eaten  just like
                    beauregard  one part of the brain
                    was extracted with surgical
                    precision  the hypothalamus and
                    thalamus to be exact

     margo pales

                              margo
                    john couldnt have anything to do
                    with a horrible thing like that  he
                    was a fine man despite his
                    problems 

                              pendergast
                    you loved him

                              margo
                        a moment taken aback
                    yes  once  we met at columbia  john
                    held the cadwalader chair in
                    statistical paleontology when i was
                    a grad student there

                              pendergast
                    you were going to be married

                              margo
                    how did you know that

                              pendergast
                    i ran an internet search on dr
                    whittlesley  got a list of his
                    scholarly articles and the
                    engagement announcement in the
                    times  i also found a record of your
                    restraining order

                              margo
                    that was two years ago  john was
                    still in love with me
                        she looks down
                    he wouldnt leave me alone

                              pendergast
                    you were afraid of him werent you

                              margo
                    he was afraid of himself  he tried
                    suicide once  he was ill  manic
                    depressive  he had wild emotional
                    highs and lows  not a happy
                    affliction for a scientist  hed
                    been revered in our community  by
                    the end he was a joke

                              pendergast
                    tell me about the last expedition
                    what was he looking for

                              margo
                    a legendary monster called mbwun

                              pendergast
                    a monster

                              margo
                    yes  he developed his own theory
                    that he called the calisto effect
                    it held that evolution wasnt always
                    gradual or driven by natural
                    selection  the environment would
                    sometimes cause sudden and grotesque
                    changes which could result in a
                    monster species  it made no sense
                    but he felt he had evidence that
                    mbwun was such a monster living in
                    isolation on the tepui for thousands
                    of years

                              pendergast
                    what happened

                              margo
                    no one knows  the kothoga who live
                    on the tepui are cannibals

     margos voice catches again  pendergast reaches for his handkerchief
     but she shakes her head determined to keep control

                              margo
                    no  im all right  i wont let this
                    affect me anymore  john wouldnt get
                    help  his ego endangered the lives
                    of others  his theory came first

                              pendergast
                    what if whittlesley arrived on the
                    tepui and no monster was there  was
                    he desperate enough to create one

                              margo
                    i dont understand

                              pendergast
                    something came up in autopsy
                    tonight  imbedded in beauregards
                    body we found a claw

                              margo
                    my god  then it was an animal

                              pendergast
                    i dont think so  i think we were
                    meant to think it was mbwun  did
                    whittlesleys monster have claws

                              margo
                    i dont know  he sent back a statue
                    thats supposed to be an exact
                    representation  but ive never seen
                    it  its in the exhibit

                              pendergast
                    would you mind showing it to me

     int superstition exhibit  night

     this exhibit is unlike anything weve seen in the museum  horrifying
     artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness
     patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls
     there are tombs a torture chamber and endlessly curving mazelike
     winding halls

                              pendergast
                    where would we find it

                              margo
                    im not sure  we should split up
                    you take that hall and ill take
                    this one

                              pendergast
                    all right  im as macho as you are
                    perhaps

     without further discussion margo takes the right fork leaving
     pendergast behind

     on margo 

     as she finds herself alone  the silence is intense  she heads slowly
     into another long dark tunnel passing a set of maori tattooed heads
     the eyes are stuffed with fibers the shriveled lips are drawn back
     from rotting teeth  margo passes without a look

     on pendergast

     in another part of the exhibit he nears a mayan tomb  a skeleton in
     the center wears a headdress and tribal robes  gold rings encircle
     bony fingers  pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it heads into
     the next hall

     on margo

     getting farther from pendergast and ever deeper into the gloom  the
     walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft  there are
     shaman dancers masks covered in grasses and shells  from the new
     guinea coast there is kokpah god of a secret male society and zoe
     ba an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask

     finally the walls open up into another gallery  beyond it is more of
     the shadowy hall  margo stops and for the first time she wavers  this
     gallery is the most frightening yet  it features images of the devil
     from different cultures around the world

     in the dim light margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of satan
     tornarsuk the eskimo evil spirit incubi from india tibet new
     guinea etc  and there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar
     and lit by a spot is a small figurine  margo is instantly drawn to
     it  as she gets close enough she sees the label in gothic letters

                              mbwun

                    savage god of the kothoga also
                    known as he who walks on all
                    fours

     the statue is terrifyingly lifelike  margo stares at the beast  mbwun
     is covered in scales and stiff hair with glittering green eyes and
     crude reptilian features  the figure is hunched over in a threatening
     crouch  its long forearms trail to the ground ending in three large
     claws

     on margo she starts then remembers pendergast

                              margo
                    mr pendergast  i found it

     no answer  she turns tries again louder

                              margo
                    pendergast  over here 

     her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air  a stench rolls over
     her  she covers her face backs up holding her breath

                              margo
                    what the 

     she steps directly into a nasty statue of the tibetan lord of the
     dead  margo starts steadies the statue  the room is silent once more
     but then unmistakably she hears it  an odd rustling sound  slow
     deliberate  maddeningly soft on the thick carpet  and another wave of
     the smell  margo looks in the direction she came down the long dark
     hall  her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls 

                              margo
                    pendergast
                        no answer
                    whos there

     but now she freezes  at last shes truly scared  a shadow black
     against black is gliding stealthily towards her moving over the
     display cases and grinning artifacts

     margo stands stock still her eyes on the shadow  she lets out a small
     gasp of shock  she cant believe her eyes  it defies reason  slowly
     she backs up  she slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other
     side  in the next room she pauses again listens now hearing a
     distinctly animal snuffling sound

     something large is tracking her  theres no doubt

     overcome by a blind panic margo turns and runs  she passes through a
     display on mythical creatures disappears down another winding dark
     hall

     behind her comes 

     the pounding of something in a heavy loping run  whatever it is its
     charging after her  she turns another corner  and another tearing as
     fast as she can  but now the walls up ahead are narrowing leading to
      a dead end

     margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass  the hall
     features displays of terrifying totem poles  all around the ghoulish
     carved faces seem to leap out  she pounds on the door but its
     useless  shes trapped  and the thing is coming behind her  its just
     around the last bend when it stops  silence again envelops her  shes
     afraid to turn  she can hear heavy breathing and something like a low
     growl  reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long
     dark hall  margo starts as a face appears in the reflection 

     the image is wavering and unclear  its a large hulking form behind
     her  two glowing slit green eyes in the dark  margo screams as the
     thing leaps forward hitting one of the totem poles  margo sinks to
     the ground unconscious  at last we hear pendergast calling as
     darkness falls

                              pendergast
                    dr green  dr green

                                                       dissolve to

     int superstition exhibit  night

     on margo lying on the carpet  theres a large nasty bump on her
     forehead  the totem pole is on the floor beside her  leaning over her
     is pendergast  margo starts to sit up  pendergast gently restrains
     her

                              pendergast
                    what happened

                              margo
                    i dont know

                              pendergast
                    i heard you calling and i ran after
                    you but you kept disappearing and i
                    couldnt keep up

                              margo
                        she touches her forehead
                    you were behind me  running after
                    me

     pendergast nods  as margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him
     off collecting her thoughts

                              margo
                    its okay im all right  i remember
                    now it was an animal  something
                    large  i could smell it  it was
                    hunting me  i saw two green eyes in
                    the dark

                              pendergast
                    where did you see it

                              margo
                    behind me  over there

     margo turns and points behind her to 

     a large northwest coast indian mask  its carved out of wood in a
     horrible grimace inset with two glowing green eyes  pendergast sees
     it too says nothing

                              margo
                    thats not what i saw

                              pendergast
                    all right  if youre positive

     she leans against the wall touches her forehead panic overcoming her
     again

                              margo cont
                    i cant think straight at the
                    moment  i know how crazy this seems
                    please mr pendergast i need some
                    fresh air  could you get me out of
                    here

     ext rotunda front entry  exhibit  night

     three cops including mcnitt rodriguez and rogers prepare to enter the
     exhibit  all are armed  margo watches as pendergast gives them

     all is quiet

     int museum front  exhibit front door  night

     the doors to the exhibit are closed  doyle looks at his watch
     impatient  its almost eleven now  he pulls out his walkie talkie

                              doyle
                    bailey  doyle here  im still

                    to  ill come relieve you myself

     doyle shuts off his walkie talkie frowns  he fidgets looks at his
     watch once more

                              doyle
                    what the hell

     he turns takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it but then he hears
     something stops  its a low scuffling from inside the exhibit coming
     from behind the closed doors  doyle freezes turns

                              doyle
                    mcnitt

     no answer  doyle pauses  his hand goes to his gun for reassurance as
     he hears a footstep and a muffled thump  he moves to the door of the
     exhibit opens it and takes a step inside

                              doyle
                    mcnitt  cut the crap  i know its
                    you  youre not scaring me  come on

     silence meets him  the shadows of the exhibit loom  doyle takes one
     more step inside scanning the darkness with his gun  does he hear
     breathing  he freezes  yes he does  the hair on his neck rises and he
     loses the spit in his mouth  he takes a step backwards but hes half
     a second too late  the door slams behind him and a huge dark form
     leaps out

     int exhibit entrance  night

     officer mcnitt enters from a side corridor zipping up his fly  the
     hall is still  mcnitt checks his watch sees doyles walkie talkie and
     turns it on

                              mcnitt
                    mcnitt here  im outside the

     mcnitt shuts off the walkie talkie settles at his post

     int superstition exhibit  night

     in the blackness a large shape is moving quietly dragging its prey
     across the floor  we move in on the lifeless form of doyle  his face
     is rigid with terror his eyes frozen open wide  the last thing we
     hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness is the snapping
     of doyles skull

                                                       dissolve to

     ext museum  day

     signs announce that the superstition exhibit opens tonight  the museum
     is back in business but not many people are going in  a crowd lingers
     at the margins pointing at the building  several hold a copy of the
     post with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair

     int cuthberts office  day

     cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office looking out at
     the scene below  his face is pinched with worry  slumped in a chair is
     lieutenant dagosta  pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall

                              pendergast
                    i had no idea the museum had a
                    complete collection of piranesis
                    forum sketches

                              cuthbert
                    if you like them theyre for sale
                    another day like yesterday and half
                    the collection will be on the block

                              pendergast
                    ive read about the museums
                    financial troubles

                              cuthbert
                    weve been operating in the red for
                    years  that was the whole idea
                    behind the superstition exhibit  it
                    was designed to pull people in
                    weve spent every penny we have on
                    advance publicity betting
                    everything on the openings success
                    if we postpone at the last minute 
                    no  i dont want to think about
                    that

                              dagosta
                        chews on his toothpick mild
                    we all love the museum  i come here
                    myself with my kids  were trying to
                    work with you

                              cuthbert
                    i appreciate that

                              pendergast
                    if the party goes forward and
                    thats a big if ive arranged for
                    a large police presence

                              cuthbert
                    do they have to wear uniforms

                              pendergast
                    yes

                              cuthbert
                    i dont want to scare people

                              pendergast
                    i understand  but mr cuthbert
                    weve got bigger problems  depending
                    on what we find today we may have
                    to shut you down

     cuthbert looks grim

     int physical anthropology lab  day

     dagosta examines the huge centrifuges autoclaves electrophoresis
     apparati monitors computers etc  as margo and greg kawakita look at
     the claw

                              kawakita
                    what do you make of it margo

                              margo
                    its not mammalian thats for sure
                    i think its reptilian

                              pendergast
                    that would jive with what we got
                    from the preliminary dna readout
                    here have a look

     he hands them a computer readout  margo checks it quickly as kawakita
     looks on

                              margo
                    according to this twentyfive
                    percent of the claw dna is
                    unidentifiable about a third is
                    homo sapien and the rest is
                    hemidactylus turcicus

                              dagosta
                        looks over
                    whats that

     margo pulls off her glasses

                              margo
                    turkish gecko i believe  a lizard

                              kawakita
                    lizard dna and human dna on the same
                    strand  impossible  the sample must
                    be contaminated

                              margo
                    theres another possibility  a lot
                    of repeated base pairs could suggest
                    a high level of genetic damage

                              pendergast
                    genetic damage

                              margo
                    when dna is defective it often
                    uncontrollably replicates long
                    repeating sequences of the same base
                    pair  viruses can damage dna  so can
                    radiation certain chemicals  even
                    cancer  lets let the gse sort it
                    out  i have to get started  this
                    will take several hours

                              pendergast
                    we need someone to take us to the
                    secure storage area

                              kawakita
                    try dr frock  hes the curator of
                    plant biology  all the curators
                    have keys  and he knows every inch
                    of this museum  the rest of us still
                    get lost

     int museum hallway area  day

     pendergast dagosta and dr frock get off are in an older plain
     corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors  the doors are
     numbered up to eight then the corridor turns

     as the three go forward the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly
     in the hall

                              pendergast

                    dinosaurs in the world  just to give
                    you an idea there are more than
                    three million insects specimens  not
                    to mention amphibians reptiles
                    birds anthropological artifacts

                              frock
                    yes  john made quite a study of the
                    whole museum  he had a copy of my
                    original plans

     frock heads through a double door that leads to a freight elevator
     thats as big as a small room  the operator karl has it decorated
     with a table chair and pictures

     int osteological preparation area  day

     it looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else
     deep stainless steel tanks line one wall  on the ceiling near the
     tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger
     carcasses  in a far corner of the workshop is a stainlesssteel gurney
     bearing a dead gorilla  a pink faced eighty year old man is working on
     the carcass with sharp tools  this is don osterbaan

                    man thats ripe

     frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room
     inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox  its
     crawling with black beetles which are devouring it  dagosta and
     pendergast watch the grizzly scene properly impressed

                    thanks don  were in a hurry  some
                    other time

     int hallway  day

     more rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes  the
     light is dim here and several bulbs are burned out  but the numbers
     on the storage rooms are much higher now  the three men come out of
     the darkness  frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop

                              frock
                    this should be it  can you read the
                    number

     pendergast reaches up above them and taps the light bulb  it comes on
     and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area  dagostas
     jaw drops and his toothpick falls out  the door has been scored from
     top to bottom by long vicious claws

                              dagosta
                    holy shit

     frock stares in amazement shaken  he runs a finger down the deep
     ruts

                              frock
                    something tried to get into this
                    room

                              pendergast
                    and failed  these doors are solid
                    steel

                              frock
                    this means there must be an animal
                    loose in the museum

                              pendergast
                    i wouldnt be so sure

     pendergast takes frocks keys and opens the door  it swings wide on
     oiled hinges  dagosta turns on a light

     int storage room  night

     they all enter  nothing has been disturbed  the crates sit in the
     middle of the small room untouched  pendergast kneels by the only one
     thats been opened

                              pendergast
                    this must be the one that held the
                    statue  lets see what else is
                    inside

     pendergast removes the lid and hands it to dagosta pulls out a blow
     dart gun seed pods a carved stone  dagosta takes the lid and turns
     it

                              dagosta
                    the lid of this crate is scratched
                    with claw marks just like the door

     as dagosta studies the lid a brittle water damaged envelope slips
     out  dagosta picks it up  the envelope bears an imprint oftwoarrows one silver overlaid with another of gold

                              dagosta
                    look  its some kind of letter

                              frock
                        excited
                    may i see that

     dagosta hands the letter to frock

                              frock
                    its from john  those two arrows
                    were his insignia  its addressed to
                    louis moriarty a patron who
                    financed his expeditions

                              pendergast
                    read it out loud

                              frock

                    is accurate  i know because ive
                    seen the beast

     frock stops looks up at dagosta and pendergast  his face flushes
     with the thrill

                              frock
                    did you hear that  my god  he says
                    that mbwun is real

                              dagosta
                        snorts

                    it proof

                              pendergast
                    i think the scratches were put there
                    to scare us  perhaps even lead us to
                    this note

     pendergast looks out to the dark corridors

                              pendergast
                    you said john whittlesley made a
                    study of your blueprints of the
                    museum

                              frock
                    yes

                              pendergast
                    are there any hidden rooms or
                    staircases  places where someone
                    could hide

                              frock
                    not really  just the subbasement

     dagosta and pendergast exchange a look

                              pendergast
                    where is that

                              frock

                    museum  could we see them please

     ext museum side door  day

     a series of boxes labeled professor frock sit on the loading dock  a
     small moving van partially loaded with the contents of frocks
     office sits waiting  frock delves through one of the boxes while
     pendergast and dagosta look on

                              frock
                    i know theyre here somewhere  its
                    a good thing we caught the movers in
                    time  theyre nineteen century
                    blueprints from when the museum was
                    built  i remember the subbasement
                    was below the regular basement
                    linked to the city sewer  i only
                    know about it because it flooded all
                    the way up to the museum during the
                    hurricane of 49  i lost so many
                    precious books

     frock continues to unload boxes scattering things right and left
     its the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia  a collection of
     wildflowers soil samples a stuffed owl  finally he pulls out some
     very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile

                              frock
                    eureka  who says it doesnt pay to
                    be a pack rat  now please be careful
                    with these  when youre done id
                    like them back

     int hall of the african mammals  day

     visitors scatter as pendergast enters with dagosta two deputies a
     dog handler jonathan hamm and jonathans pair of huge bloodhounds
     the deputies are armed with large shotguns  pendergast scans the
     blueprints as they walk

                              dagosta
                    how big is the subbasement

                              pendergast
                    apparently its huge

                              dagosta
                    i think i should come with you

                              pendergast
                    we havent got time  you have to
                    meet with museum security so we can
                    make a decision about tonight

     int museum  staircase  day

     pendergast jonathan his dogs and the deputies make their way down an
     industrial set of stairs into the basement

     int basement corridor  day

     in a moment they arrive at the site of beauregards murder  the area
     at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk
     crime tape spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping
     in and out

                              pendergast
                    these plans indicate theres a
                    walled over entrance to the sub
                    basement right around here

     they move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the
     time we last saw it with henry and larry  unknown to jonathan or
     pendergast the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the
     boys faced the monster

                              jonathan
                    the dogs are picking up something
                    mr pendergast

     the dogs start barking in animation sniffing the wall  pendergast
     studies the blueprints with a flashlight moves to the spot  theres
     nothing to be seen  he shines his flashlight over the waterstained
     uneven stucco between two steel beams  the dogs sniff furiously at the
     point where the wall meets the floor  pendergast moves his fingers to
     the joint between the stucco and the beam shoves hard  the wall
     pushes back  its a door

     int stairwell  subbasement  day

     they enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs  water drips on the
     walls

                              deputy one
                    what is this  a dungeon

     jonathan looks uneasy double wraps the dogs leashes around his
     blackgloved hands  the two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their
     shoulders  then they all follow the animals descend down the inky
     stairwell

     int security command center  museum  day

     the place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant  two
     security guards monitor a battery of closedcircuit screens  dagosta
     is now accompanied by the pompous head of security ippolito  clearly
     ippolito feels dagosta is pissing on his territory and hes trying to
     assert control

                              ippolito
                    this huge police presence tonight
                    isnt necessary lieutenant  youll
                    just scare people off  i can handle
                    the security behind scenes with this
                    system  its state of the art

                              dagosta
                    the cops are nonnegotiable
                    ippolito  why dont you just tell me
                    how this space station works

                              ippolito
                    its fool proof basically  i
                    designed this whole thing myself
                    every valuable object in the museum
                    carries a small electronic chip  if
                    anythings moved so much as an inch
                    we get an alarm pinpointing the
                    exact location of the attempted
                    theft

                              dagosta
                    thats great if youre stopping a
                    burglar  not our goal here  are
                    there motion detectors

                              ippolito
                    in every exhibition room  the
                    museums divided into five cells
                    the reception and exhibit are in
                    cell five  we could arm the motion
                    detectors in cells one to four then
                    seal the perimeter with our fire
                    doors

                              dagosta
                    that would leave one exit for
                    hundreds of people  youd be
                    violating every fire regulation on
                    the books  well guard the perimeter
                    with my men and engage the motion
                    detectors in the other cells  one
                    more question  i see a big hole  if
                    this entire thing is run by
                    computer what happens if the power
                    fails

                              ippolito
                        snorts
                    you dont know much about computers
                    lieutenant  there are safeguards
                    built in  we have backup systems
                    with redundancies  theres no way
                    these computers can fail
                    
     int physical anthro lab  day

     margo kawakita and frock are studying the contents of the crate

                              frock
                    i cant help thinking theres
                    something that pendergast
                    overlooked  if the scratches were
                    made by whatever killed beauregard
                    it wants something thats in here

                              margo
                    a blow dart  seed pods  a plant
                    press  pretty unimpressive stuff

                              frock
                    let me see the plant press

     frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside

                              margo
                    what is it

                              frock
                    im not sure  as you know the
                    kothoga lived outside civilization
                    on the tepui for thousands of years
                    species flourished in isolation when
                    man and pollution rendered them
                    extinct  this could be one of the
                    last remaining samples of an unknown
                    plant

                              margo
                    whatever it is it must be common on
                    the tepui  john used it as packing
                    material

                              frock
                    youre right

     kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers as does frock

                              frock
                    theyre curiously fleshy

                              kawakita
                    and they smell delicious

     kawakita takes a nibble

                              kawakita
                    taste great

                              frock
                    i wouldnt put that in your mouth
                    until we do a chemical analysis
                    greg

                              kawakita
                    i can handle that for you while
                    were waiting on the gse

     kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant

                              margo
                    what about those seed pods  are they
                    from the same plant

     frock takes a moment to study them looks up

                              frock
                    margo these arent seed pods

                              margo
                    what are they

                              frock
                    theyre eggs

     int subbasement  day

     black as night  the only light comes from the mens flashlights
     theyre at a crossroads  crooked corridors with arched ceilings
     barely the height of a man stretch in several directions  jonathan is
     crouched down resting with the panting dogs  the deputies are having
     a smoke  they all look both uneasy and exhausted except for
     pendergast  he stares at the blueprints

                              pendergast
                    hard to read in this light  the ink
                    is so faded

                              jonathan
                    the dogs have lost the scent mr
                    pendergast  maybe we should head
                    back

                              pendergast
                    not yet  lets try the fork to the
                    left

     the men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on  the hounds
     walk ahead carelessly nosing the ground  the flashlight beams
     illuminate limeencrusted cavelike walls

                              deputy two
                    this place gives me the creeps

     at this the dogs begin to whine  the hair on their backs rises in a
     ridge  pendergast turns as a breeze stirs his clothes

                              jonathan
                    theyve got something

                              pendergast
                    keep the light up  i cant see

     the dogs strain and pull forward sniffing the air ahead  the deputies
     raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness  the
     flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions barely penetrating
     the gloom  suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying baying which
     bounces off the walls

                              pendergast
                    shut them up

                              jonathan
                    heel argo  hobbes  heel

     the dogs drag jonathan forward paying no attention foaming at the
     mouth  jonathan is now frightened

                              jonathan
                    theyre going crazy  i need help

     too late  as jonathan tries to grab the collars one of the dogs leaps
     forward and the leash slips through jonathans hands

                              jonathan
                    hes loose  argo

     argo bolts into the darkness  the men start after the dog following
     the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance
     pendergast is in the lead  suddenly he throws out his arms halts

                              pendergast
                    stop

                              jonathan
                    holy mother what is that

     a goatish odor envelops them all

                              deputy one
                    smells godawful  like rotten meat

                              jonathan
                    argo  come

                              pendergast
                    quiet

     a scuffling sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a
     roar  the men all freeze  the other dog leaps and twists with
     excitement  in the confusion it also breaks free  it tears after the
     first dog disappearing into the darkness  now jonathan is wildeyed

                              jonathan
                    no  hobbes

     the deputies are terrified retreat  the darkness is stifling
     claustrophobic  the flashlights are small help  pendergast alone
     remains dead calm  his voice is cool and commanding

                              pendergast
                    forget the dogs  you two get back
                    here  dont point that gun at me

     the deputies regain control and follow pendergasts orders  they fall
     into position pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall  in the
     echoing darkness ahead of them the barking falters and stops

     there is a moment of silence then a terrible unearthly shriek  the
     deputies quail frozen in their tracks  jonathan leaps forward

                              jonathan
                    argo  hobbes

                              pendergast
                    get back  now

     at that moment a shape hurtles at them from the darkness  the men yell
     in terror  there are two stunning blasts from the shotguns two
     flashes of light accompanied by a deafening roar  the rumble echoes
     and dies and theres an intense silence followed by a sob

                              jonathan
                    you shot my dog

     hobbes lies five feet from them a black shadow of death  jonathan
     kneels by the dog tears in his eyes  down the animals side is a gash

                              jonathan
                    my dog 

                              deputy one
                        stammers
                    he was coming right at me 

     in the distance they can hear a terrified howl  its the second dog
     hurt or frightened  its a pitiful sound

                              deputy two
                    lets get out of here

                              jonathan
                    im not going anywhere  not without
                    my dog

     pendergast grabs at jonathan who slips from his grasp  jonathan inches
     back down the hallway calling desperately

                              jonathan
                    hobbes

                              deputy one
                    get back

     jonathan shakes his head no

                              jonathan
                    theres something out there  lets
                    go get it now  thats why we came
                    down here isnt it

                              pendergast
                        to the deputies
                    hes right  follow me

     but the two deputies are terrified  they cling to the wall inching
     backwards sheer horror in their eyes

                              deputy one
                    no way  i say we get help  a lot
                    more guns

                              pendergast
                    im ordering you  cover me

                              deputy two
                    well cover you from here

     jonathan is disappearing in front of them  pendergast has no choice
     grim faced he pulls his colt 45 anaconda from a shoulder harness
     its a narrow and evillooking gun  from a pocket comes a handful of
     255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain fmj flatnose ammunition  he loads
     up goes after jonathan whos no longer in sight  pendergast passes
     down a long sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead  at the
     bottom pendergast stops  he has to stoop down as he goes through an
     archway and into 

     a vast arching room 

     a dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going
     off from all sides  it appears to be part of the sewer system  the dog
     cowers in a corner  jonathan moves to his side

                              jonathan
                    look  its hobbes  hes all right

                              pendergast
                    come on  lets get back to the
                    others  we cant leave them alone

                              jonathan
                    its alright  i can tell by the way
                    the dogs acting that whatever was
                    out there is gone  what is this
                    place

                              pendergast
                    not on the map  looks like it
                    connects with the city sewer

     pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies

                              pendergast
                    were coming back

     the words go unanswered  from the hall comes a loud report  its the
     shotguns blasting desperately  something flies up all around them as
     the sound echoes  bats

     pendergast and jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating
     wings  finally the animals settle and pendergast and jonathan exchange
     a look  the silence is filled by a soft rumbling sound  they stand
     together waiting  pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back
     to the deputies  a ridge of hair on the dogs back rises and it
     growls

                              pendergast
                    identify yourself  whos there

     no answer  the rumbling continues growing louder  then a dark object
     appears  it comes rolling out of the hallway bounces in front of them
     and stops  pendergast shines his light on 

     deputy ones head  the mouth is open wide in terror  across the cheek
     is a vicious claw mark

                              jonathan
                    oh my god

                              pendergast
                        hisses
                    quiet

     and now they hear a gut wrenching shriek thats abruptly cut off
     followed by a second rumbling sound  jonathan grabs pendergast by the
     shirt panicked

                              pendergast
                    stay calm

     they head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to
     slope up  after theyre gone a few moments the head of deputy two
     rolls to a stop

     ext museum  night

     cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance  a huge rotating
     spotlight is now turned on  elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets
     and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain umbrellas
     jousting

     int cuthberts office  evening

     cuthberts putting on his tux  he adjusts the cummerbund humming
     happily as dagosta looks on  dagosta paces highly agitated and
     worried

                              dagosta

                    arriving  the mayors car is pulling
                    up

                              cuthbert
                        irritated
                    you havent got the authority  only
                    pendergast can pull the plug

                              dagosta
                    pendergast may be in trouble  dont
                    you understand  he still hasnt come
                    back  its been over three hours 

                              cuthbert
                    hell be back  relax  were in good
                    shape  your security is air tight
                    thereve been no more incidents
                    nothing suspicious  theres no
                    reason to call off the opening now

     int great rotunda  night

     resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing
     the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to
     the hall of heavens  the palms themselves are festooned with orchids
     and violet lights  somewhere inside an invisible band is playing new
     york new york  an army of waiters in white tie thread their way
     through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with
     champagne glasses  cuthbert enters and crosses to meet the mayor and
     the mayors wife  photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop

     int hall of the heavens  night

     food is out  hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths
     decorations have a dark haunted house theme  a hum of activity floats
     up past the vast corinthian columns into the circular dome above

     int margos laboratories  night

     an explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant
     specimens  margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand greg a
     tissue as frock looks on

                              kawakita
                    what kind of egg is it

                              margo
                    its reptilian

                              frock
                    like the claw

                              margo
                        cautious
                    lets not jump to conclusions  this
                    egg could belong to any number of
                    reptiles dr frock

                              frock
                        excited
                    come on margo  were on the verge
                    of something huge  lets consider
                    the possibility just the three of
                    us alone in this room  what if john
                    was right  i mean what if  and he
                    sent back an egg of his monster in
                    the crates  when it got to the
                    museum it hatched

                              margo
                    several problems with that theory
                    for one thing this egg is intact
                    for another according to
                    pendergast the crates were shipped
                    here on a boat  everyone on board
                    was killed like beauregard  if the
                    thing hatched in midocean where
                    did it go

     frock has no answer  greg gestures to his computer screen

                              kawakita
                    i guess youre not interested in
                    this plant anymore but the chemical
                    analysis is done  frock reads the
                    computer over gregs shoulder

                              frock
                    genus unknown  family unknown
                    order unknown  phylum unknown
                    cripes margo what did you give me
                    is this an animal or one funky
                    shrub
                        to kawakita
                    i see youve been programming the
                    computer vocabulary again

                              margo
                        points to a hexagonal symbol
                    look at this  an ambyloid reovirus
                    protein  that explains why the
                    computers confused  the plants
                    infected with a virus

                              frock
                    thats not so unusual  many plants
                    carry viruses  like the burls on
                    maple trees

                              margo
                    but a virus normally codes for other
                    viruses  this ones making human and
                    animal proteins  listen to this
                        reads
                    glycotetraglycine collagenoid
                    weinsteins tropic hormone  4
                    monoxytocin supressin hormone

                              kawakita
                    these plant fibers are loaded with
                    hormones

                              margo
                    what kind of hormones

     kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf  the encyclopedia of
     biochemistry thumbs to a page and reads

                              kawakita
                    4monoxytocin is a hormone
                    secreted by the human hypothalamus
                    gland

                              margo
                    try weinsteins tropic hormone

     the tension is rising in the room  frock takes the book looks this
     one up reads silently and removes his glasses

                              frock
                    a hormone secreted by the human
                    thalamus gland

     kawakita and frock look puzzled  margo rises in agitation

                              margo
                    this is it  this is what he or
                    it is after  the plant has high
                    concentrations of the same hormones
                    found in minute quantities in the
                    human brain

                              kawakita
                    so what

                              margo
                    pendergast told me the killer
                    extracts and eats the hypothalamus
                    and thalamus of the victims brains

                              kawakita
                        pales
                    eats them

                              margo
                    yes  whatever killed beauregard may
                    have lived on this plant  when the
                    crates were put in secure storage
                    they were out of reach  the killer
                    couldnt get them so it got the
                    next best thing

                              frock
                    beauregards head

     theres a moment of stunned silence  then a loud buzzer makes them all
     jump

                              margo
                    its all right  that means the
                    gse  has finished analyzing the
                    claw dna  greg you go find
                    pendergast and lieutenant dagosta
                    now

                    so the claw came from a huge
                    creature with a preternatural sense
                    of smell and poor eyesight that
                    hunts at night

                              margo
                    with the intelligence of a human
                    being the speed of a greyhound and
                    the strength of a grizzly bear

                              frock
                        a long moment
                    margo what youve just described is
                    a killing machine

                    hundred people arriving right now
                    the animal hunts at night and it has
                    a keen sense of smell  all those
                    people in one enclosed space 

                              frock
                    its like ringing the dinner bell

     int entrance to superstition exhibit  rotunda  night

     the crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the mayor cuts a red
     ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds
     cuthbert is by the mayors side  he steps forward and raises his hand
     for quiet  the crowd falls silent

                              cuthbert
                    thank you everyone and welcome
                    were glad all of you were willing
                    to brave the inclement weather to be
                    with us tonight  our special thanks
                    to his honor the mayor and his
                    lovely wife

     the mayor takes a bow  more applause

                              cuthbert cont
                    some people have questioned whether
                    a superstition exhibit belongs in a
                    museum of science  spells
                    incantations demons magic these
                    are forces that defy the natural
                    laws  superstition provides answers
                    to the great questions based on
                    fear  science provides answers to
                    the great questions based on truth
                    science and superstition then are
                    polar opposites  mortal enemies if
                    you will  and that is why we are
                    here tonight  we have come to learn
                    more about the enemy and thus to
                    bring about its defeat  for every
                    good there is an evil for every
                    dark a light  and so tonight my
                    friends i give you ignorance
                    terror unreasoning fear pure evil
                        smiles gestures to the exhibit
                    have a great time

     everyone laughs applauds again as cuthbert and the mayor lead the way
     inside  kawakita is making his way over to dagosta  the crush at the
     entrance is incredible

                    mcnitt  dagosta here

     int security command center  museum  night

     officer mcnitt stands in the corner of the computer room bathed in
     neon light  running the security system is george your basic computer
     nerd  multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum  most
     are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition  on
     these the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms  mcnitt holds
     his walkie talkie

                              mcnitt
                    yeah lieutenant  im here

                              mcnitt
                    not yet

     at this moment a noise comes from the adjoining room  mcnitts head
     swivels  its a loud thump

                              mcnitt
                    hold on lieutenant
                        to george

                    the air conditioning  theres a shit
                    load of electrical rooms back there

     george is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention
     mcnitt returns to his walkie talkie as the thump comes again  now he
     looks distinctly nervous

                              mcnitt
                    lieutenant  theres something wrong
                    in the computer room

     george rises

                    youre overreacting  sounds like
                    the air conditioning to me

     mcnitt watches uneasily as george opens the door disappears into the
     next room

     int entrance  superstition exibit  night

     dagosta turns to kawakita who waits shifting from foot to foot

                              dagosta
                    damn  theres some kind of problem
                    in the computer room  i have to go
                    get ippolito  you wait here

     dagosta heads into the exhibit before kawakita can protest

     int superstition exhibit  night

     we see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms  a
     teenage girl lauren and her father david examine a lidless
     rotting european style coffin complete with corpse  a white haired
     gentleman dr pound leans on his cane as he looks at a display on
     primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture
     tools

     cuthbert and ippolito are at the head of a press of people giving the
     mayor and his wife a guided tour

                              cuthbert
                    here we have a very rare sacrificial
                    table from mesoamerica  the priests
                    would kill the victim on this slab
                    cut out the heart and eat it while
                    it was still beating

                              mayor
                    i could use one of these things in
                    city hall

     cuthbert laughs right on cue  they pass a congo power figure with its
     bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails  several people
     recoil from it looking repulsed  the mayors wife sees it and looks
     distressed

                              mayors wife
                    youre letting kids see this  i
                    should think theyd have nightmares

                              cuthbert
                    kid will love it  theyre our target
                    audience  nothing here is as violent
                    as what they see on tv

     they pass a mummy dripping in blood  the mayor gestures to it

                              mayor
                    i dont know  that could be a little
                    over the top  its not even
                    scientific  mummies dont bleed

     cuthberts smile fades as he sees the mummy

     close on the mayors white cuff as he extends his hand to point at
     the mummy  the pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a
     falling red drop of blood

     cuthbert sees it  so does the mayor and ippolito  they look up as
     another drop of blood falls right on cuthberts face  and yet another
     droplet falls on the mayors wifes white bosom exposed by her low
     cut dress

                              cuthbert
                    oh my god 

     their pov above the mummys head the top of the case is cut away
     exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork  a hand a
     watch and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the
     case  a small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger  and
     another drop falls

     cuthbert screams at the top of his lungs  conscious of the panic
     factor ippolito yells

                              ippolito
                    quiet everyone

     but its too late  the room is packed with people  and dagosta
     himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out 

                              woman
                    theres a body up there

     a ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room titters as people
     wonder if its a joke  at that moment from the darkness above the
     ceiling buckles and something falls

     its officer doyles headless torso dripping blood

     utter pandemonium breaks loose  the close space echoes with screams
     and shouts  people claw at each other stumbling desperately trying to
     get to the door  a young woman falls and dagosta runs to her to keep
     her from being trampled in the stampede

     int computer room  night

     mcnitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the
     chaos in the exhibition the faces registering blind fear  alarms
     start going off all over the place  mcnitt calls out panicked 

                              mcnitt
                    george  get out here now

     mcnitt looks around desperate  but george still isnt here  the door
     to the electrical room is still open  the ceiling shudders from
     thundering feet  mcnitt can hear distant screams  its raising the
     hair on the back of his neck  he calls out

                              mcnitt
                    george  where are you

     no answer  he moves to the open door a new fear in his eyes  he looks
     inside

     int electrical room  night

     blackness  mcnitt cant find a light switch  he stays in the doorway
     silhouetted by light from the computer room  with shaking hands mcnitt
     pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun  theres a strange low
     gurgling sound  its mcnitts stomach  he silences it swallows

                              mcnitt
                    hey you  george  damn it  where are
                    you  no response

     mcnitt edges into the darkened rooms  the first ones empty  he tries
     the next

                              mcnitt
                    george  weve got an emergency  are
                    you here

     suddenly theres a huge thump and a scuttling to his left  its a
     terrifying sound  mcnitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds
     each with a light and a deafening blast  a shower of sparks and a gout
     of flame licks upwards illuminating the room with orange light  a
     huge dark shape ducks out the door

                              mcnitt
                    oh god  oh god

     gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog  on the far wall a mounted
     metal box is smoking from three large ragged holes  with a sudden
     pop an electrical arc slices across the ruined box followed by a
     crackling and a shower of sparks  mcnitt ducks back into the computer
     room slams the door and locks it breathing hard

     int computer room  night

     every single screen flickers and dims  but to mcnitts relief george
     has returned  he is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair

                              mcnitt
                    george  i saw something in there  i
                    fired but i think i missed it

     george remains still his back to mcnitt staring at the computer game
     on the flickering screen

                              mcnitt
                    george for chrissake answer me

     mcnitt puts a hand on georges shoulder swivels his chair around

     on george his face ripped off

     int electrical room  night

     on the central switching box sparking and shorting as an enormous
     clawed arm swipes it off the wall

     int hall of the heavens  night

     everyone pours out of the exhibit running for the door leading to the
     rotunda  people are getting trampled  its a terrible crush  screams
     tables overturned everywhere  food scatters to the floor  dagosta
     pushes his way out of the exhibit crosses to kawakita who is
     appalled  above the chandeliers are flickering

                              kawakita
                    what happened

                              dagosta
                    theres a dead body in the exhibit
                    people are panicking trampling each
                    other trying to get out

     ippolito runs over to join them

                              dagosta
                    what the hell is going on

     above them the lights dim again and come back on

                              ippolito
                    the whole system is shutting down
                    we have to get out quickly before
                    the fire doors fall

                              dagosta
                    what doors

                              ippolito
                    i told you  they seal off all the
                    cells  they were designed to fall
                    automatically in a system failure 

                              dagosta
                    you said the system couldnt fail

     at this theres a low rumble from above  dagosta looks up and sees a
     large metal door is descending from a slot in the ceiling and not in
     an orderly fashion  its falling fast  below are crowds of people all
     pushing to get out  officer bailey near the door sees it

                              bailey
                    above you  look out

     his voice is lost in an ocean of screaming  kawakita stands in total
     horror a moment then joins bailey and dagosta

     all of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door
     ippolito on the other hand elbows his way to the front of the
     fleeing crowd

                              dagosta
                    ippolito  get back here

                              ippolito
                    like hell

     ignoring dagosta ippolito pushes past  he barrels over an old man
     who stumbles and falls directly beneath the falling door  ippolito
     jumps over him and is out

     the old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and screams
     dagosta runs forward dives for the old man but hes not in time

     kawakita covers his eyes unable to watch as the lights flicker a
     third and last time  the room is plunged into darkness  and over the
     screams we hear the rumble and crash the horrifying cries of the old
     man as the door comes down

     int margos lab  night

     margo and frock stand in the darkness  through a high window we can
     see lightning flash

                              margo

     int hallways  night

     frock wheels his chair as fast as he can  margo runs beside him
     carrying the crate with the fibers inside  a peel of thunder ends and
     distant screaming is heard  margo stops appalled

                              margo
                    dr frock  did you hear that

                              frock

     up ahead they hear metallic rumbling and a crash  they round a corner
     and come up against a huge steel door

     int basement  night

     pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac studying the blue prints
     by a stone wall  jonathan and the dog are with him exhausted and
     terrified  jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as
     pendergast works

                              pendergast
                    i know where we are now  were
                    getting out jonathan  this should
                    be another door

     taking a pen knife from his pocket pendergast places it into the
     plaster and gently twists the blade  a piece of plaster the size of a
     dinner plate falls revealing the tracings of another doorway
     pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark dusty room

                              jonathan
                    hallelujah pendergast  where the
                    hell are we now

     int alcoholic room  night

     jonathan and pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door
     pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens  all
     are stored in jars of alcohol  there are fetuses of many different
     species  we see a pig a cow a duck billed platypus as well as brain
     sections a disembodied monkey head  one rectangular glass container
     holds a skinned human foot

                              jonathan
                    jesus what is this

                              pendergast
                    another storage room

     pendergast tries the light switch to no effect

                              pendergast
                    somethings happened  the powers
                    out

     they cross the room to the main door and exit  now theyre in 

     int osteo prep  lab  night

     pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks  the humming of
     the bugs can be heard in their cabinet

                              pendergast
                    all right  i know where we are  this
                    is the osteo prep lab  i was in here
                    earlier  were safe now

     with these words the dog growls  jonathan freezes and sniffs the air

                              jonathan
                    oh no  i smell it

                              pendergast
                    keep the animal quiet

     jonathan kneels by hobbes as pendergast listens every nerve on end  a
     sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage
     area  its unmistakable heavy breathing and the creeping movement of
     claws  pendergast lifts his gun

                              pendergast
                    go out the other doorway  theres a
                    stair at the end of the hall  up
                    five flights is a corridor that
                    leads to the hall of the heavens
                    find lieutenant dagosta  bring
                    help

     jonathan doesnt have to be told twice  he takes the dog and exits
     from the other side of the lab leaving pendergast alone  pendergast
     waits a moment until jonathans safely out of sight  he switches off
     his flashlight backs up slowly step by step  he opens the door to
     the alcoholics storage  as he slips inside a dark shape appears

     int alcoholics storage  night

     slowly making no sound pendergast lifts the 45 anaconda passes his
     finger over the cylinder checking the loaded chambers  then he
     steadies the revolver and levels it at the door  the hideous pickled
     specimens seem to hover all around him  the smell is overwhelming and
     the snuffling is louder now

     its coming closer  after a long moment there is a faint bump at the
     door  this is followed by a low scratching noise pendergast watches
     frozen in horror holding his breath

     the doorknob begins to turn  not knowing what else to do pendergast
     simply grabs it from the inside and holds on

     outside he hears an amused snort then a low growl  theres one hard
     hit and the door shivers  the doorknob falls off  its over now
     pendergast kneels down bracing the gun in both hands  from this
     position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell
     his mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees 

     a huge redrimmed green eye

     involuntarily pendergast leaps back nearly falls and drops the gun
     beakers crash around him  he scrambles in the darkness  the flashlight
     falls and pops back on  the beam streaks up crazily  its chaos
     pendergast is an easy target now  he grabs for the light the gun
     steadies himself breathing fast and low  his heart pounds  but
     nothing more happens  the silence is heavy  the eye is gone  and
     suddenly pendergast understands

     in the distance he can hear human voices and a rolling wheelchair
     somewhere nearby are margo and frock  the monster has left him to get
     bigger game  fear for margo and frock lights pendergasts eyes  all
     panic and disorganization are gone  he holds his revolver at 12
     oclock and kicks the door open leaps out as

     a huge dark shape darts from the room  its headed for the secure
     storage areas again  pendergast takes off  not knowing how else to
     address this thing he finds himself calling 

                              pendergast
                    halt

     int secure storage hallway  basement  night

     pendergast runs into the hallway but hes already too late  the
     hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed

     on pendergast as he levels his gun and shoots

     the creature stops rears back on its haunches looks once at
     pendergast pissed  as the voices around the far corner fall silent
     pendergast fires  the shot blasts off a piece of the wall

     with astonishing speed and agility for its bulk the beast turns and
     leaps around the corner passing out of pendergasts sight

                              pendergast
                    margo  frock  its coming  run

     around the corner 

     are margo and frock frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012
     in his hand  margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers
     they can hear the sound of thundering movement

                              frock
                    look

     margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast  its
     descending like a freight train  one split second of sheer amazement
     then 

                              margo
                    dr frock  quick

     frock immobilized in his wheel chair stares at the monster like a
     trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk  margo grabs his keys from
     him fumbles desperately to open the door  it swings wide at last  she
     grabs the handles of the wheelchair tugs with all her might  the
     wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn
     thing inside

     int secure storage area  night

     margo shoves frock behind her slams the door shut  seconds later the
     beast throws itself against the storage door  they hear it outside
     growling in fury claws lashing out  margo and frock press back in the
     darkness terror in their eyes

     int hallway  night

     pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway his gun drawn his
     flashlight on  a few more steps and he holds hard  his eyes go wide in
     astonishment as his light illuminates the beast  its tearing at the
     steel door furiously with incredible force

     as the flashlight beam hits it mbwun roars and looks up  now we see
     it clearly for the first time  the monster is massive putrid rank
     slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red  a ridge of stiff black
     hair rises on the creatures buffalolike humped back  the withers are
     muscled and covered with plates  a forked tongue licks out as purple
     lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth  the claws raise up to fend
     off the light

     pendergast steadies himself with difficulty takes a few seconds to
     aim with the greatest care  mbwun makes a move towards him and he
     squeezes the trigger hard  the gun echoes in the hall  a split second
     and a white streak moves right up the beasts cranium  a direct hit
     the shot echoes and mbwun drops its claws

     the flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the
     beasts eyes  angry and blinded the creature turns and in a moment
     lopes off  pendergast watches unimaginably relieved  realizing what
     just happened his knees start to buckle  he catches himself wipes
     one hand across his eyes  a voice comes from the storage room

                              margo os
                    pendergast  are you all right

                              pendergast
                    no  i think im hallucinating

     the storage door opens slowly and margo looks out

                              margo
                    youre not  where is it

                              pendergast
                        shakes his head
                    gone

                              margo
                    wounded

                              pendergast
                    no  a chromium alloy tipped 45
                    caliber bullet bounced off that
                    things skull like a spit ball  i
                    think it was bothered by my light

                              margo
                    that would fit  its nocturnal
                    quick  come inside

     ext museum  night

     as hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain crying
     terrified unclear what exactly happened  these are the lucky ones
     among them we find ippolito  his walkie talkie is squawking  the
     windows of the museum behind him are black

                              dagosta on radio
                    ippolito  where the hell are you
                    were trapped in here  we need help
                    ippolito  come in dammit

     ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain knowing the extent of
     what hes done  the wheels are working hard now trying to figure out
     damage control  the walkie talkie keeps calling  he doesnt respond

     int hall of the heavens  night

     tables are overturned food lies on the ground people cower in the
     darkness  dagosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie
     talkie  he shuts it off rises looks around  light comes from a few
     sputtering candles

     most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered
     steel door  among them are kawakita and cuthbert  from the body of the
     man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood
     bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door

                    down

     the crowd starts to murmur  one man yells

                    else needs you

     pound moves off  everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a dog
     bark  dagosta pulls his gun  the door to a stairwell at the far end
     of the room opens and hobbes bounds into the hall  hes followed by
     jonathan who is filthy and wildeyed

                              jonathan

                        crossing breathless
                    five flights down  we were lost in

                    to hurry

     dagosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight  the
     remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear
     in the center two men are bending over a still form  one of them is
     dr pound

                              dagosta
                    both of you  get back here

     the urgency in dagostas voice gets everyones attention  the mayor
     brings his wife over  cuthbert comes too  they huddle apart from the
     others  cuthberts white with fear

                              cuthbert

                              cuthbert

                    where are you going  dont leave us
                    alone

     the remaining crowd begins to whimper  the mayor rises

                              mayor
                    everyone quiet  the lieutenants in
                    charge

     bailey and dagosta carry shot guns  they quietly move to the back
     stairwell at the far end of the hall of the heavens  everyone else
     bunches together and watches

                              dagosta
                    bailey well go first and check the
                    stairwell  jonathan you and greg
                    guard the door

     jonathan gives hobbes leash to the mayor  dagosta hands greg
     kawakita a shotgun tightens his grip on his own  then he gives the
     signal and bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell

     int stairwell  night

     dagosta and bailey go in slowly  jonathan stays in the doorway
     sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight  kawakita gingerly holds
     his shotgun  hes scared out of his mind  he turns to jonathan
     whispers

                              kawakita
                    excuse me  could you tell me how
                    this thing works

                              jonathan
                    oh jesus  dont point it at me  just
                    aim and shoot

     dagosta heads down the stairs in the lead with bailey close behind
     the stairwell is windowless and dark  dagosta shines his light and it
     cuts into the blackness  he moves quietly makes the first landing and
     stops  bailey watches his back from several steps behind as dagosta
     signals for him to wait  the flashlight flares into a glass door one
     flight down  dagosta raises his hand

                              dagosta
                        low
                    hold on  i thought i saw something

     everyone stops  bailey pumps his shotgun  so does jonathan  kawakita
     fumbles to do like the others  they wait  dagosta moves alone down
     several more steps  the silence is heavy  suddenly dagosta wrinkles
     his nose

                              dagosta
                    whoa you smell that

                              jonathan
                    lieutenant  get back

     too late  at this something drops from above  a huge dark shape leaps
     into the stairwell descending two floors  it lands pounces on bailey
     and the marble walls echo with a roar

                              dagosta
                    bailey

     bailey screams in terror as mbwun pins him down

                              bailey
                    nooooo

     close on bailey three claws close on his neck and wrench hard
     theres a horrifying snap as baileys head comes off  blood spurts all
     over and drips down the stairs

     dagosta levels his shotgun at the monster and fires with no apparent
     effect  when the shots stop echoing we hear screams and frantic
     barking from the hall

     mbwuns green eyes look up and its forked tongue licks out  the
     monster leaps past baileys body and heads for the door  dagosta
     seeing whats happening screams at the top of his lungs

                              dagosta
                    jonathan  dont let it get into the
                    hall

     on jonathan frozen in the doorway kawakita by his side  both of
     them are rigid with horror  disbelief in their eyes  the beast leaps
     up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door

     dagosta keeps firing until hes pumping an empty chamber  plaster is
     falling all around  screams resound in the hall of the heavens as
     dagosta stumbles up the stairs

     int hall of the heavens  night

     dagosta throws open the doors and charges into the hall  jonathan
     lies on the ground dazed  kawakita stands to one side teeth
     chattering in shock  his hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the
     gun swings in his hand

                              dagosta
                        yells
                    where is it

                              jonathan
                    i dont know  it hit me hard

     dagosta pumps two shells in the shotgun  screams can be heard from
     the people crouched together at the edge of the room  hobbes is
     barking wildly foaming at the mouth  its too dark to see whats
     happening

                              dagosta
                        screams
                    somebody tell me  where is it now

                              mayor
                        quiet
                    lieutenant  in the south corner

     dagosta sweeps his light to the mayor who stands rigid in front of
     the others points to his left  the light moves to the far end of the
     room where the dark shape of mbwun crouches over the body of a man
     its lunging up and down with odd jerking motions  the man is long
     past making a sound  from the monster comes a faint crunching and
     slobbering  jonathan rises comes to dagosta  so does frank  they
     stand shoulder to shoulder raise their guns  dagosta motions for
     kawakita

                              dagosta
                    on three

     kawakita stumbles to join them tries to join in  the barrel of his
     shot gun still swings wildly  he steadies it by taking it in both
     hands

                              dagosta
                    one two three

     all three fire  theres a loud report  the kickback knocks kawakita
     backwards  screams erupt from the huddled group  hobbes abruptly shuts
     up  the men fire and fire until theres nothing left  dagosta reaches
     for more shells comes up empty

                              dagosta
                    jonathan  get everyone behind me

     jonathan moves  dagosta sweeps his light across the room but already
     the shape is gone  cuthbert hides behind the mayor calls out in a
     terrified squeal

                              cuthbert
                    it went out the door to the rotunda

     dagosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors
     theres a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam
     both doors  he picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles
     backs up  the doors shudder as something hits them hard

                              dagosta
                    get everyone into the stairwell

     jonathan the mayor cuthbert and kawakita together herd everyone
     towards the stairwell  they move inside

     int stairwell  night

     dark and close  the smell of gunpowder and death  the mayors wife
     sees baileys body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up

                              cuthbert

     police cars are pulling up outside the museum  sirens wail  torrents
     of rain limit the number of onlookers  crowds of people are scattered
     about  theres disbelief on everyones faces  many people are in
     shock  ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a guard station
     near the gate  he yanks the door open and jumps inside

     int guard station  night

     a number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion

                    wont pump enough power to lift the
                    doors

     ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie

     int museum stairwell  night

     dagostas group has reached a lower floor  here this stairwell ends
     ahead stretches the hall of the asian peoples

                              ippolito os

     dagosta passes the walkie talkie to the mayor

                              mayor
                    mayor jordan here

                              ippolito on radio

                    command

                              mayor

                    and get us out of here now

     the mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner
     and disappear from sight

     int security room  night

     ippolito finds waters and the others staring at him  humiliated he
     swallows hard

                              ippolito
                    all right  the steel doors are
                    designed to retard cutting  we can
                    go through them but it would take
                    hours

                              waters
                    the quickest way in would be to go
                    through the roof sir  cell two goes
                    up to the fifth floor  there are sky
                    lights up there

                              ippolito
                    coordinate with the fire department
                    and swat teams  move

     int hall of the asian peoples  night

     its very dark  the huge shape of mbwun can barely be seen sliding out
     of the stairwell and into the hall of the asian peoples  then dim red
     hall lights come on in the corners of the ceiling  the monster utters
     a low growl  the emergency generators are beginning to come on  the
     animal lopes to the spot where we last saw dagosta and his group
     sniffs the ground  it looks up and with a curiously human gesture
     cocks its massive head

     the silence is broken by voices  theyre in the distance and muffled
     but definitely there  the monster crouches eagerly lopes forward with
     great stealth  the voices are getting louder  we follow as it goes
     through the hall and down 

     a stairwell at the bottom mbwun quickly turns a corner the voices
     have stopped  mbwun creeps forward enters 

     int hall of marine animals  night

     a huge room several stories high  a whale hangs suspended from the
     ceiling  dioramas of fish line all the walls  mbwun pauses next to a
     diorama of the gentle vegetarian sea cow the manatee  the two make a
     startling contrast

     a pause and then the voices are heard again much louder now  the
     source is right around the edge of the manatee display  mbwun leaps
     forward claws lashing out  he turns the corner and crashes through a
     wall of glass as he grabs at the source of the voices 

     a display of small extraordinarily lifelike talking holograms
     theyve been reactivated with the emergency power system  each little
     talking figure is no more then five inches high  they move around a
     small three dimensional display of marine animals explaining the lung
     systems of fish

     mbwun stands in the pile of broken glass stares at the holograms
     mesmerized  he makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a chuckle
     then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch
     one of the holograms  but the shadowy creatures cant be caught  the
     beast seems to realize this snorts and moves off  as he goes he
     passes behind a

     large glass elevator  it stands in middle the open room  the elevator
     is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story
     exhibit  in the dim light with his poor vision the monster doesnt
     see dagosta the mayor kawakita and their entire group sandwiched
     inside  the monster exits the exhibit and quietly dagosta slides the
     doors open  everyone all thirtyfive people in evening clothes
     quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the
     far side of the hall

     int secure storage area 1012  night

     margo frock and pendergast wait in the darkness  pendergast for the
     first time seems fazed

                              pendergast
                    i dont know how to deal with this
                    its hellish  like nothing i ever
                    saw  im not trained to deal with a
                    monster a supernatural creature
                    like that

                              margo
                    its not supernatural  mbwun is an
                    animal  part lizard part human a
                    genetic freak of some kind like the
                    halfgoat halfsheep they found
                    last year in the jungles of vietnam

                              pendergast
                    but this isnt the jungle  this is
                    new york  how did it get here  a
                    thing like that crossed two
                    continents  it makes no sense

                              frock
                        lame
                    we think it may have something to do
                    with the eggs we found in the crate

                              pendergast
                    i dont believe it

                              margo
                    none of that matters now  the people
                    upstairs need us  we have to help

                              frock
                    we cant  weve managed to get
                    inside the one place thats safe  i
                    think we should sit tight and wait
                    for reinforcements  if we go
                    outside were risking more lives
                    you have to accept it margo
                    theres nothing we can do  the
                    building must be swarming with
                    police by now  it wont take long
                    for them to get through the doors

                              margo
                    that thing could kill ten people in
                    a matter of minutes

                              pendergast
                    but what can we do  our guns are
                    useless 

                              margo
                    we have the fibers  dont you see
                    the creature is hungry  it wants the
                    hormones in these plants  it would
                    take hundreds of human brains to
                    supply whats in these fibers  were
                    just a poor substitute  to make it
                    stop hunting we have to give it
                    what it wants

                              cuthbert
                    oh god  i dropped my rabbits foot

     cuthbert drops to his knees groping in the darkness

                              jonathan

                              jonathan
                    oh jesus 

     jonathan starts again sweating  the tumblers fall with agonizing
     slowness  cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck
     charm  meanwhile unnoticed by jonathan the dog is staring at the oak
     doors  we see the hair on his back rise

                              jonathan
                    fifteen whats next

                              cuthbert

                    it

     clutching the rabbits foot like a talisman cuthbert leaps up just as
     the last tumbler falls

     at this the oak doors behind them crash open splintering like so many
     match sticks

     cuthbert screams in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast  the
     dog barks wildly at mbwun  jonathan lifts his shot gun  but the
     monster barrels past him and zeros in on cuthbert

     a huge red tongue licks out and encircles cuthberts waist  it
     squeezes him horribly drags him towards the open jaws  cuthbert
     bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter  he opens his hand and
     the rabbits foot drops  the last jonathan sees of cuthbert is his
     head disappearing down mbwuns throat

     hobbes barks and whines in terror  jonathan takes the leash and drags
     the animal out

     int museum hallways  night

     jonathan and hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear  behind them
     comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls

     int hallways  secure storage area  night

     the door opens slowly and pendergast appears  he shines his beam in
     both directions

                              pendergast
                    all clear

     margo and frock quickly come out  margo holds the crate  frock tries
     to follow in his wheelchair

                    rooms  were going upstairs  well

                    to trap the monster in here

                              frock
                    margo this is too dangerous  you
                    always think you can solve
                    everything  this time you dont have
                    enough information  the animal might
                    behave in unexpected ways
                        to pendergast
                    leave her here with me  dont put
                    her in danger

                              pendergast

                              margo
                    no  youll need me 

     at this a loud sound comes from upstairs

                    for their lives

     all three know this ends the discussion  frock opens the door to room
     1010  inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks  margo takes
     pendergasts handkerchief and wraps her hand  she quickly sprinkles
     some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012  before dr frock
     disappears into room 1010 he looks back to margo one last time

                              frock

                              margo

                              frock
                    remember it has poor eyesight  it
                    hunts with its sense of smell  so
                    for gods sake margo dont get
                    those fibers on your clothes

     int osteo prep  night

     margo and pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run
     for the far stairs  from somewhere above the sound of running is
     louder now

                              dagosta
                    step back

     dagosta frank and kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot
     repeatedly  the shots echo wildly  the sound is terrifyingly loud  the
     small glass window shatters  then the men lean heavily on the door  it
     still wont budge  dagosta looks through the window

     int hall of the north american mammals  night

     pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints

                              margo
                    is there another way around

                              pendergast

                    cell  this is one of the fire
                    doors 

     pendergast returns to the window

                              pendergast
                    vince  theres no way we can get to
                    you with the fire doors down
                    theres an entrance to the sub
                    basement in the hall off the north
                    side exit

                              dagosta
                    the subbasement

                              pendergast

                    the old sewer system  i can guide
                    you out

     dagosta turns to the others

                              dagosta
                    how much ammo do we have to make a
                    stand

                              kawakita
                    youre asking me  i dont even know
                    how to load this thing

                              frank
                    four rounds 

     theres a movement of air and a ripe fetid smell

                              dagosta
                    oh shit

     dagosta pumps his shot gun

                              dagosta
                    i smell it  its here

                    go out the north exit  theres a
                    hallway and a false wall by the
                    greek vases  run

                              dagosta
                    everybody  get behind me

     the others move past  dagosta frank and greg kawakita hold the rear
     the group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment
     disappears

     int hall of the north american mammals  night

     pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously  from the south
     entrance to the planetarium an enormous dark shape slinks into view
     pendergast steps back from the doorway turns to margo

                              pendergast
                    hide quickly

                              margo
                    what are you going to do

     pendergast checks his gun totally calm

                              pendergast
                    buy them some time

     margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas  theres a plain
     door at their end of the hall  pendergast faces the broken window

     his pov the beast is slinking away after dagosta and the others
     headed to the north exit from the planetarium

     pendergast calls out 

                              pendergast
                    hey you big tub of lard  over here

     the beast pauses turns

     pendergast puts his palms up at his ears wiggles his fingers and
     makes a face through the window

                              pendergast
                    come on you smelly pile of refuse
                    come get me  i dare you

     a low surprised growl comes from the beast  it crouches as if to
     pounce  pendergast makes more faces sticks his tongue out  the beast
     watches in silence its evil eyes fixed

     on margo watching pendergast  she cant leave him yet

                              margo
                    what is it doing

                              pendergast
                        loud
                    its scared of me

     suddenly theres a crash and the door bends like cardboard  two huge
     sets of claws lash through  margo screams as the claws pass inches
     from pendergasts face  he leaps back lifts his gun which looks like
     a pea shooter in the face of mbwun

     two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door then mbwun
     simply lifts it out of the frame  this leaves pendergast face to face
     with the foul enormous monster  it regards him evenly blinks once
     then the tongue slides out licks its lips eagerly and 

     pendergast flicks on his high powered flashlight shining it at close
     range right in the beasts eyes  then carefully with total calm he
     fires once twice  the beast howls more in anger than pain rears up
     and swipes at pendergast  pendergast dives to one side and the claws
     miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light
     now pendergast spins and runs for all hes worth  margos been
     waiting holding the door

                              pendergast
                    drop the fibers

     she leaves the crate behind as pendergast dives inside with her  margo
     shoves the door shut hard as mbwun still blinded leaps into the
     hall  but now suddenly all is quiet  no sign of margo and
     pendergast  the beast moves forward snuffling slowly  it starts for
     the door which hides margo and pendergast but stops as it finds 

     the crate  the beast moves to it clearly surprised  it pokes at the
     crate carefully inhales the fragrance and grunts  the monster seems
     to be struggling with itself  it sniffs the fibers lifts a few out
     carefully then shoves the crate away hard  then it rises on its
     haunches and squints into the dark

     on all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo gazelle wild
     horses wolves giant elk sabre tooth tigers  mbwun moves close to
     one after another  suddenly we notice in the back of one of the
     dioramas 

     margo and pendergast  they stand frozen crouching behind mannequins
     of native americans riding horses across the plains  the beast sniffs
     right at their window then turns away  confused it heads back
     towards the planetarium and slinks from the room

     inside the diorama pendergast and margo exchange an astonished look
     they whisper

                              pendergast
                    what happened

                              margo
                    its eyesight is worse than i
                    thought  it couldnt see us  and it
                    couldnt smell us through the glass

                              pendergast
                    it didnt want the fibers  what does
                    that mean

                              margo
                    i think it means its full

                              pendergast
                    then it wont go after the others

                              margo
                    no  its still hunting but not for
                    the hormones

                              pendergast
                    for what

                              margo
                    i think for the pleasure of the
                    kill

     int hallway  museum  night

     greg the mayor dagosta and the others are in a hallway lined with
     at least a dozen vases  a greek vase has been shoved aside revealing
     the outlines of a door  behind is a sloping dark corridor  the last of
     the thirtyfive people pack in  greg and dagosta cover the corridor

                              dagosta
                    thats it lets go

     grimfaced dagosta follows kawakita as they duck through the
     doorway shutting it behind them  the impact rattles the wall and the
     greek vase falls

     int subbasement  night

     kawakita and dagosta reach the bottom and turn to see the mayor his
     wife dr pound and their whole group standing in several feet of
     rushing water  lauren is shivering  her father has his arm around her
     tight  behind them are two corridors one forking left and the other
     straight  dagosta gets out the walkie talkie clicks it on

                              dagosta
                        into walkie talkie
                    pendergast  we made it  you all
                    right

     int diorama  night

     pendergast has the plans open as he studies them  he speaks into the
     walkie talkie  margo paces behind him thinking hard

                              pendergast
                    were fine  take the left fork
                    behind you  youll be in a straight
                    passage  when the hall forks again
                    in fifty yards go right  then radio
                    back

     int subbasement  night

     dagosta shuts off his walkie talkie  everyones staring at him

                              dagosta
                    all right  kawakita cover the rear

                              kawakita
                    oh shit

                              frank

                    enough shot  ill do it if you take
                    care of my daughter

     dagosta nods  frank expertly reloads  dagosta holsters the walkie
     talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage  kawakita takes
     charge of lauren who is confused and terrified  the tunnel has a
     slight downhill grade and the water begins to move faster tugging at
     everyones legs  people slip and slide as they half make their way
     down the hill  dagosta calls behind them

                              dagosta
                    damn  its getting deep  see
                    anything

     on frank back not far from the first fork  he looks towards the head
     of the tunnel calls out 

                              frank
                    youll be the first to know

     frank turns and plunges after the others  but then suddenly he stops

     on dagosta he reaches the second fork and takes a right  this
     tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper  slimy
     plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on  dagosta
     pulls out his walkie talkie

                              dagosta
                    pendergast  i made the right hand
                    fork  were already in about three
                    feet of water  where should we go

     but before pendergast can answer dagosta hears the loud report of
     franks gun  everyone freezes in the darkness  the walkie talkie
     cackles and dagosta shouts

                              dagosta
                    hello

                              frank os
                    sweet jesus help

     they hear splashing in the water  lauren screams tries to run back
     kawakita grabs her  theres more thrashing water and then silence

                              dagosta
                    frank  are you all right

     dagosta starts for frank but the mayor catches his arm and holds him

                              mayor
                    its too late

     everyone waits staring into the darkness  still no answer  lauren
     screams again

                              lauren
                    dad

     dagosta turns his flashlight on the water  its running red  he spins
     to the mayor points down the tunnel

                              dagosta
                    run

     people start to cry and whimper as the mayor urges them on  he takes
     charge of lauren  only greg kawakita stays with dagosta  they stand
     shoulder to shoulder and completely alone  thrashing in the water can
     be heard as the beast comes closer  theres a low pleasurable growl
     both men lift their guns

                              dagosta
                    on three

     kawakita nods  behind them in the tunnel is total blackness  ahead is
     equally dark  the noise of their friends gets ever fainter  the water
     now rushes half way up their thighs  kawakitas teeth start to
     chatter  he bites them shut steadies his gun

                              dagosta
                    one two 

     silence as the water murmurs  dagosta holds the count  a long
     agonizing moment  kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel

                              kawakita
                    i think its gone

     suddenly a huge claw snakes out of the water right in front of them
     and the beast roars up  it was beneath the surface directly before
     them  the claw closes on dagosta and his shot gun goes off  dagosta
     screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth

     for one horrible moment kawakita is frozen  then he leaps forward
     shoves the barrel of his gun behind dagosta right in the beasts
     open jaws  he pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes the recoil
     throwing him back ass over tea cups in the water  with a roar of pain
     the monster drops dagosta and retreats in the dark  dagosta grabs
     kawakita

                              dagosta
                    i think you took its tonsils out

     they haul ass down the tunnel firing behind them as they go  ahead is
     another fork  the group is waiting  when they see dagosta and
     kawakita a cheer goes up

                              mayor
                    which way

     as he runs up dagosta grabs for his walkie talkie  the holster is
     empty the walkie talkie gone  without missing a beat he registers
     whats happened then covers it up with the next breath  he points to
     the right as if theres no doubt and says 

                              dagosta
                    this way

     dagosta exchanges a look with kawakita who understands exactly what
     happened  as they plunge into the right tunnel greg mutters 

                              kawakita
                    holy shit

     int hall of the african mammals  night

     pendergast and margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to
     the dioramas  pendergast holds the walkie talkie desperate

                              pendergast
                    vince  can you hear me  vince

     nothing but static comes in response  margo paces in agitation

                              margo
                    we have to try and draw it off

                              pendergast
                    how

                              margo
                    the answers right in front of us

     she points to one of the dioramas  it shows a bird being stalked by a
     fox

                              margo
                    thats a ptarmigan feigning a
                    broken wing  the bird pretends to be
                    injured to draw the fox away from
                    its nest

                              pendergast
                        starts running
                    its deceptively simple  like a
                    bruckner symphony or a matisse

     margo heads for the planetarium calling 

                              margo
                    help  please someone  help

     they disappear down the hall with the greek vases both calling with
     all theyve got

     ext museum roof  night

     there are increasing numbers of swat vehicles around  a helicopter
     lands on the roof  the rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain
     pouring down  ippolito is in the thick of the action  the swat
     commander jennings comes over buckling an ammo belt over his
     fatigues

                              jennings
                    were ready  weve got enough
                    firepower to turn a herd of lions
                    into a fine red mist

                              ippolito
                    then do it

     jennings nods goes off  as ippolito watches the swat team break
     the glass skylights gets ready to go in

     int hall of the reptiles  night

     jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the hall of the
     reptiles  hobbes is still by his side  he keeps the gun pointed out
     into the room his eyes scanning the dark  he whispers to hobbes as
     if to comfort both of them

                              jonathan
                    its okay hobbes  well be all

                    fine

     suddenly he sees something  what appears to be a body lying on a glass
     case  jonathan pumps his gun approaches slowly  the man wears a
     tuxedo is lying very still  as we get closer we see its the drunk
     kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago  he suddenly hiccups
     jonathan starts  now the man gently snores  jonathan moves to him
     shakes the drunks shoulder

                              jonathan
                    hey  wake up

     the man snorts opens his eyes and frowns

                              drunk
                    who the hell are you

                              jonathan
                    you first

     jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case  the mans a little
     unsteady as he tugs at his tux

                              drunk

                    you wouldnt believe me if i told
                    you

     hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw
     jonathans attention

                              jonathan
                    what is it boy

     from above comes the beating of a distant helicopter and then the
     sound of breaking glass  hobbes pulls jonathan back to the staircase
     jonathan grins follows behind with the drunk

                              drunk
                    where we going

                              jonathan

     int hall of the dinosaurs  night

     huge skeletons of tyrannosaurus stegosaurus and brontosaurus loom in
     the darkness  rain is pouring in  jonathan hobbes and the drunk
     enter looks up to the sky lights  a flash of lighting hits
     illuminating the dinosaurs and a swat team which is descending on
     a series of ropes  its a sixty foot drop  jonathan steps forward

                              jonathan
                    hello  were over here

     they run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend  the
     first one down is jennings

                              jennings
                    are you hurt

                    need help  theres a monster down
                    there

     a sling suspended on ropes is lowered down

                              jennings
                    the rescue workers will lift you out
                    one at a time

     jennings signals to a group of five men heavily armed and in flack
     jackets  they prepare to get the drunk out

     int hall with greek vases  night

     pendergast and margo are at the top of the long narrow shaft
     pendergasts flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black
     oily water below  both of them continue calling trying to draw off
     the monster

                              margo
                    help someone

                              pendergast
                    oh god  help

     they suddenly hear the sound of splashing  an updraft rustles their
     clothes  margo sniffs the air turns to pendergast

                              margo
                    you smell that

                              pendergast
                    its coming  run

     int subbasement  night

     the group has reached another intersection of tunnels  the left fork
     turns back uphill  dagosta indicates this tunnel

                              dagosta
                    at least well be dry

     they all press forward in the low vaulted darkness  as they move
     steadily upwards the water recedes  kawakitas flashlight flickers and
     he bangs it  it comes on again

                              kawakita
                    i believe in you a hundred percent
                    vince but thats the second time
                    weve been at that intersection

                              dagosta
                    not so loud

     dagosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in
     a large round pipe

                              kawakita
                    whats that

                              dagosta
                    all right everybody hold up

     kawakita and dagosta move past the shivering people who are strung
     out along the sides of the tunnel  dagosta touches each person as he
     passes

                              dagosta
                    we dont know whats in there  let
                    me go first

     int pipe  night

     the mayor follows behind with the group as kawakita and dagosta lead
     the way  the pipe is dry and rusted  they move forward with stealth
     in twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness  dagosta steps out
     first

     int cavern  night

     the group huddles at the mouth of the pipe confused as dagosta pans
     his flashlight around the huge space  the walls are carved out of dirt
     and rounded like a cave  from the ceiling hang huge cobwebs  theres a
     large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed  on a
     mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag

     greg moves to it shines his light on the side  a name is written in
     marker

                              dagosta
                    what does it say

                              kawakita
                        looks up shocked
                    dr john whittlesley

                              dagosta
                    whats that doing here

                              kawakita
                    i dont know  i thought dr
                    whittlesley died in south america

                              mayor
                        interrupts
                    look  theres a ladder at the end  i
                    think it goes up to the street

     they move forward into the darkness eagerly towards the ladder which
     leads up to a manhole  but as they pass the bed of twigs something
     loud crunches underfoot

                              kawakita
                    what is that

     dagosta shines his light down and everyone freezes  then one woman
     screams

     the wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white bones  the
     humming noise is louder and we see its source  atop the bones is the
     body of cuthbert  its covered with black dermestid beetles  theyre
     stripping the skeleton clean devouring the flesh

     the group panics and breaks for the ladder  kawakita and dagosta once
     more guard the rear

                              kawakita
                    dear god  where are we lieutenant

                              dagosta
                    id say were in its home

     int hall of the northwest coast indians  night

     pendergast and margo run down the long dark room passing an enormous
     hollowedout canoe  as they exit the far end the dark shape of mbwun
     emerges  it leaps forward closing in fast

     int hall of the asian peoples  night

     margo and pendergast enter a series of mazelike room with hidden
     corners nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric buddhist and
     japanese art  theyre running through the twists and turns as fast as
     they can

                              pendergast
                    were not going to make the storage
                    room

                              margo
                    listen to me pendergast  mbwuns
                    dna is part homo sapien  in
                    primates the eye is a direct path
                    to the brain  if you get a clean
                    shot theres only one place you can
                    kill it  shoot it in the eye

     at this they round a corner and mbwun leaps out  it circled ahead and
     was waiting in front of them  the animal swipes at margo and
     pendergast  the force of the monsters blow sends margo reeling and
     slams pendergast into the wall  he falls crumples and drops his gun
     the case beside him shatters spewing relics as mbwun pushes past
     pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty

     margo is frantically crawling away in the dark  the beast makes a low
     sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw easily pins her down
     pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon

     on margo now pinned beneath the heaving body of the monster
     powerless she looks up into the horrible face of death as mbwun
     raises an enormous claw  pendergast desperate cries out 

                              pendergast
                    please no  dont hurt margo

     oddly enough the beast pauses for once  talking to the damn thing is
     the one tactic no one has tried  the claw halts in midair  the beast
     blinks once and looks from pendergast to margo  margo sees a flash of
     somethingunexpectedly humanin its eyes  in astonishment she
     whispers 

                              margo
                    my god  you understand

     as they stare amazed imperceptibly the beast appears to narrow its
     eyes in response  margo controls her voice keeps it even

                              margo
                    please let me go  we wont hurt you

     a strange noise comes out of the monster  a low confused growl  he
     doesnt loosen his grip on margo but he leans down to look at her
     closer with one green unblinking eye

     she struggles not to turn away in revulsion  his enormous jaws are
     right near her throat  everything is very still  and then 

     a barrage of fire breaks out  the swat team is in the doorway
     laying down everything theyve got  the creature roars as if betrayed
     leaves margo and leaps up  it barrels down on the swat team picks
     up jennings and spikes him to the ground  jennings hits the floor with
     his neck at a crazy angle  it snaps like a twig  the other men drop
     back  mbwun follows tearing through the men cutting a deathly swath

     pendergast moves to help the swat team  margo struggles to her
     feet and her hand touches the wall  beside her is a fire hose in a
     cabinet  in a split second margo hauls it out throws a switch and
     gets a blast of water  she turns it on the beast as it grabs for
     pendergast  the force of the water is enormous  it pushes the monster
     out the end of the hall

     pendergast runs towards her takes the hose and holds it

                              pendergast
                    run

     she takes off blindly in the mazelike room  from somewhere behind her
     she hears a horrible howl

     on margo as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases
     tearing blindly in the dark  ahead is a door  she dives through it and
     finds shes in 

     int mens room  museum  night

     a row of mirrors and urinals line the wall  its a huge room designed
     to handle crowds of visitors  margo ducks into one of the stalls as
     mbwun crashes in  margo looks through a crack in the door to see 

     the animal at full stop  its staring at itself in the row of mirrors
     the sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound  the claws
     lash out breaking every mirror in the place littering the floor with
     glass

     then the beast turns and backs up groaning as if cornered  margo
     sees now that one limb is dragging leaving a trail of blood  the
     mouth too appears to be bleeding  the swat teams bullets had an
     affect

     margo presses back in the stall bracing as the beast gets closer
     its just outside  it sniffs the air once and suddenly turns rears
     up furious and crashes through the bathroom door  margo screams and
     the thing grabs her  it holds margo up before it and roars  it closes
     its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for
     everything  the claws tighten  she struggles and fights to no purpose
      but then the beast pauses its seen something

     the necklace with two arrows around her neck

     it stops and its grip loosens  a pained look flashes across its
     bestial face 

     and in that split moment margo looks downa necklace of silvergleams around the beasts throat too  the
     necklace is the twin to her own

     on margo can it be possible  she stares at the thing 

                              margo
                    johns necklace  you killed him

     incredibly the beast shakes its head  a noise comes from it a sad
     noise like a groan  and now margo gets it  she can hardly believe it
     her eyes widen in astonishment  she whispers 

                              margo
                    oh jesus  john

     the name is a knife through the monsters heart

                              margo
                    no  its not possible

     the last piece of the puzzle falls  the monster is john whittlesley
     margo still desperately frightened tries to keep control

                              margo
                    john  if it is you i can help

     the monster shakes its head no and releases her  as she watches he
     moves away quickly limps out the door

     int hall of the asian peoples  night

     mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet headed for the stairs
     in the darkness of the hall of asian peoples pendergast is waiting
     he lifts one of the swat team rifles which he holds in his hands
     he aims is about to fire but then margo comes up behind him

                              margo
                    no  dont kill him  pendergast you
                    were right  its john

                              pendergast
                    what

                              margo
                    that thing is john whittlesley  i
                    should have seen it before  the
                    fibers are infected with a virus
                    you eat them and the virus alters
                    your dna  he became addicted to them
                    in south america followed the
                    plants back to the states  he
                    probably entered the country as a
                    man  it would have taken several
                    months for the change to take place
                    thats how he got from the boat to
                    the museum

     pendergast looks over and sees the monster  his eyes show disbelief
     mbwun looks back at both of them briefly then it disappears up the
     stairs

                              pendergast
                    i dont believe it

                              margo
                    you have to  listen  all viruses
                    pass on their own dna  instruct the
                    cells of the host to make more
                    viruses  this one was different  it
                    inserted a whole array of genes into
                    john  reptile genes sixty five
                    million years old  those genes
                    remade him  its not his fault

                              pendergast
                    whatever that thing is we have to
                    kill it

     margo tries to stop him but he shrugs her off

     ext museum roof  night

     a helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the
     roof  ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a
     sling  waters approaches holding the walkie talkie

                              waters
                    we cant raise the swat team  no
                    ones answering  what do you want to
                    do

     ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them

                              ippolito
                    holy shit  pull him up

     lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons
     all around as mbwun limps into the hall  the men on the roof stare
     down astonished  their mouths hang open at the sight

                              ippolito
                    get more guns  now

     the men get the drunk up and abandon the sling leaving jonathan
     trapped below

     int hall of the dinosaurs  night

     jonathan and hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide
     mbwun sees jonathan lifts both claws swings at the skeleton sending
     it crashing down  jonathan screams hobbes is caught and falls  he
     scrambles into a corner whimpering as pendergast and margo appear in
     the door  fifteen more swat team members with rifles now line the
     hole in the roof  they all point their guns at mbwun

                              ippolito
                    get back  were going to shoot

     now margo runs forward

                              margo
                    no  wait  let me talk to him first

                              ippolito
                        screaming
                    kill that thing  kill it now

                              margo
                    no

     mbwun turns and sees margo  she speaks desperately

                              margo
                    john you can give up now  just lie
                    down where you are

     mbwun seems to consider for a moment but then its eyes gleam and it
     roars  with renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to walk up
     it like a gecko on all fours  on the roof 

     some of the swat team fall back in terror  now that the monster is
     on the wall its out of range of their fire

                              waters
                    holy shit its coming this way

                              ippolito
                    its headed for the roof  run

     ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror  astonished
     waters tries to regain control

                              waters
                    get back here you asshole  we cant
                    let it get out
                        to the swat team
                    surround the opening and kill it

     but the men are terrified retreating like ippolito  waters shouts

                              waters
                    back everybody  thats an order

     but the team is in chaos and losing precious time

     int hall of the dinosaurs  night

     the monster is now half way up the wall  margo is distraught crying
     her cool demeanor is cracked  pendergast is with her  she shakes her
     head

                              margo
                    just like john  he wont listen

                              pendergast
                    i have to shoot

                              margo
                    do it quickly  please  aim for the
                    eye

     pendergast raises a high powered rifle with a laser sight  he aims the
     red laser beam directly at mbwuns left eye

                              pendergast
                    he has to look here or i wont get a
                    clear shot  call him margo

                              margo
                    i cant

                              pendergast
                    you have to  do it now

     margo takes a moment her eyes streaming  she has no choice she calls
     out

                              margo
                    john  john look at me

     the beast looks down sees pendergasts rifle  theres a long awful
     moment  suddenly it emits a sound like a wail

     on jonathan staring stunned

     pendergast steady 

     margo shes crying as she raises her arm as if to say goodbye

     and the gun explodes

     on mbwun its head shoots back in pain and it falls sixty feet
     straight down to the ground  silence  thunder rolls

     its over  pendergast turns to margo and quietly folds her in his
     arms

                                                       dissolve to

     ext museum  night

     place  greg kawakita wet and bedraggled as a rat runs up from
     columbus ave  behind him the mayor and dagosta help the rest of the
     company to the ambulances

     waters is on the steps of the museum helping to organize the rescue
     efforts as kawakita runs up to pendergast

                              kawakita

     greg turns to see margo come out of the rotunda with frock jonathan
     and hobbes  her face is devastated  he moves to her side  she reacts
     as she sees him and teacher and pupil hug

     dagosta is lost in the swirl of people  and he likes it like that  he
     rests against a large stone lion pulls out a cheap cigar in
     cellophane unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet
     match

     hes struggling hopelessly  finally he tosses the useless pack of
     matches sighs  but then a flame lowers right before his face  he
     looks up to see pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter  dagosta
     smiles takes a nice long hit

                              pendergast
                    nice to see you lieutenant

                              margo
                    no time for fishing anymore

     greg looks up from his work and smiles

                    they were sent to the center for
                    disease control in atlanta

                              dagosta
                    shouldnt a drug that powerful be
                    destroyed

                              frock
                    the virus itself might have positive
                    applications  theyll keep the
                    plants in secure lock up while the
                    studies are made

     they pause on a new diorama  its huge filling one entire end of the
     hall  in the center is a lifesized representation of mbwun standing
     on the tepui amid the plants  behind is a painting of john whittlesley
     as he once was  he wears the necklace with the two arrows of silver
     and gold  as margo looks she touches her own  pendergast turns to
     her sympathy in his eyes

                              pendergast
                    we did the right thing margo

     margo smiles warmly

                    yes  i know

     int margos labs  day

     greg kawakita wears gloves high powered glasses works in solitude in
     the lab  suddenly he stands up throws off the glasses then he sits
     down again  he seems to be struggling with himself  he glances over
     his shoulder to make sure hes alone  quickly he moves to a locked
     drawer  he opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small
     envelope looks inside

     insert the envelope is full of the plant fibers  greg has managed to
     keep his own cache

     moving quickly with jerky motions he lays one fiber down on a slide
     with a shaking hand  with an exacto knife he cuts off a tiny sliver
     pops it into his mouth  he closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the
     taste  then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver leaves it on the
     slide  he takes a deep breath returns the envelope to the drawer  he
     turns the key carefully and we go close on his hand 

     on the back is a row of scales 

                                                       fade out
