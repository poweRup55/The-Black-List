fbi director womack
fbi director womack general



hummel
youll be particularly interested its a slush fund where the pentagon
 keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales

general kramer
frank jesus this is classified
information


womack
stunned
is this true

general kramer embarrassed nods yes

hummel
if you want the money back youll have to tell the attorney general and the
 boys down at justice where it came from  good luck


hayden sinclair returns to the table


hayden sinclair
general ive just spoken to the president and he is clear as hell on this
 we will not negotiate with you and we do not care if 


hummel
someone please gag that man
beat
alert the media i launch the gas  refuse payment i launch the gas  it is
 just after midnight  you have 36 hours  all of today and half of
 tomorrow until 12 noon  to transfer the money  dont even consider the
 standard countermeasure general


general kramer
whats the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with vx
 general peterson


general peterson
in a dense urban area sixty
seventy 


rayden sinclair
well thats not so bad 



i general peterson
thousand  seventy thousand  dead one teaspoon will kill all living
 organisms in a three story office building  get the point



fbi director womack 
what did hummel mean by standard countermeasure general

general peterson
napalm  standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm  it burns it up
  consumes it upon detonation  the problem is that vx gas is ten times
 more toxic and designed to withstand napalm  hummel must know about willy
 peter general


general kramer
course he does
explaining to others willy peter short for white phosphorous
 incendiary device still in its test phase  it detonates at 6000
 degrees enough to burn up vx
dawning on him
that explains hummells time frame  he knows were not operational  what
 would it take general


general peterson
to equip a flight of f16s with willy peter in 36 hours  an act of
 god
off kramers look
all right we can trv  but view the use of willy peter as a secondary
 initiative



general kramer
then on to our primary initiative
hits intercom button
send in seal team leader anderson
to fbi womack
whos your best chemical biological
man



agent wood
rises
ill find out



fbi director womack

int  pier 39  fbi command center  day
night is falling  a large warehouse room with windows
looking out to alcatraz island  looks like nasa

at a rectangular table  mason sits at the head of the table 122 in front of
 a scale model of alcatraz  commander anderson and ten navy seals look
 toward mason

anderson is agitated staring at mason


commander anderson
okay one more time down this second fork fiftyseven paces to a septic
 chamber  turn left at the water pump then fortytwo paces to the prison
 showers 


mason
no fortytwo paces to the septic
chamber  fiftyseven to the showers



commander anderson
pointedly
thats not what you said three minutes
ago



mason
innocently

commander anderson dagger stare at mason
 excuse me rises womack


womack follows anderson aside  they confer heatedly


commander anderson i ask for someone with knowledge of the islands tunnels
 you give me a fuckin convict who wants to play twenty
 questions


fbi director womack
he knows every inch of those tunnels
commander



commander anderson 
then hes keeping it to himself  hes
fucking with me and i dont have the time



fbi director womack
pause he thinks
what if he went with you



commander anderson
out of the question  hell endanger the mission  hell endanger my men 
 hes a security risk  who says he wont bolt as soon as we turn our backs
 on him

fbi director womack

the hulking chaney escorts mason over


fbi director womack

 curious about whats happening on alcatraz

mason and the seals climb into the drainage pipe

int  drainage pipe under shower room  night
the seal team mason leading the way climbs toward a
faint light emanating from a drainage grate above


seal reigert readies a fibre optic seeing device he
pushes the fibreoptic camera up through the grate


int  alcatraz  prison shower room  night

the fibreoptic camera turns looking in a 360 degree
radius and transmitting images of 


the prison shower  a tiled room with shower heads and a 20 160a ft
 ceiling  above a mezzanine circles the showers here alcatrazs guards
 once watched inmates below


int  drainage pipe under shower room  night

commander anderson views the shower room images on a tiny 2 inch by 2 inch
 wristheld video monitor  the shower is deserted but theres something of
 interest 

a motion detector a blue beam flashed from a transmitter to 161a
a receptor across the grate



commander anderson
motion sensor

anderson gingerly lifts the grate  reigert wiggles his hands past the edges
 of the grate and nudges the beam transmitter with one hand and the beam
 receiver with the other away from the grate

anderson directs boyer and reigert to a tiled column  they creep across the
 tiled floor taking check and defefid positions behind the showers tiled
 columns  but suddenly shockinglyfloodlights flash on  coming from
 the mezzanine above


the seals whip off their night vision goggles

165 int  pier 39  mobile command trailer  night


on the video monitor  we see the illumination of the shower
room transmitted from the seals cameras

illumination above  goodspeed whispers

the seals whirl around startled unnerved squinting
into the blinding whiteness of the floodlights



hummel vo

the seals terrified hesitate but do not drop their weapons they stand
 backtoback weapons trained at the catwalk squinting into the white
 light


the seals behind the tiled columns take cover we cannot yet see hummel
 and the marines  this plays with as much tension as possible  the
 situation is chilling


commander anderson

lives of your men you will order them to safety their weapons

seal reigert
get a grip on yourself 

on the mezzanine  pvt  coxis boot nudges a tile which has come loose from
 its mortar  the tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine  then it falls
 


boyer reacting to the falling tile brings up his machine
gun and fires a sustained burst in its direction 


and all hell breaks loose  the marines fire in unison  a
cruel withering fusillade


 the seals in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it they
 gamely return fire  but theyre hit  again  again  again


in the drainage hole  goodspeed mason and lt  shepherd listen and
 watch when the view allows in utter horror to the firefight above


lt shepherd scrambles up the ladder  goodspeed grabs him
tries to pull him down


goodspeed
don t do it


seal shepherd
let go of me


lt  shepherd climbs the ladder

in the shower room  anderson takes a bullet in his leg  his automatic
 blazing he takes a bullet in the forearm  the chest  the shoulder

 three marines on the mezzanine are hit and killed

 lt  shepherd climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing  he
 instantly takes a bullet through the visor killing him instantly 
 shepherd falls to his knees and pitches over falling face first into
 



the drainage hole where shepherdis lifeless eyes come facetoface with
 goodspeed who nearly passes out then looks away in horror



seals behind the columns return fire  theyre hit
picked offone by one



 marine cox and mccoy fire a 50 cal  gun as powerful as antiaircraft or
 antitank round through the column killing reigert and
 boyer



hummel
hold your fire hold your fire 

int  drainage pipe under shower room  night

suddenly thefiring stops  goodspeed and mason freeze  thinking fast
 mason rips the tac radio from shepherds helmet takes his 9 mm pistol and
 machine gun and his sawtoothed knife and sheath and climbs
 down


goodspeed indecisive at first clambers down after mason

 a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor then your skin turns
 black
