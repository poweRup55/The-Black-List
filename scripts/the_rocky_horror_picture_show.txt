as scripted up to  what further indignities were they
to be subjected to

then please add	and what of the floor show that had been
spoken of  in an empty house  in the middle of the night
what diabolical plan had seized franks crazed imagination
what indeed  from what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic
