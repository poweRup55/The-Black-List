               stained glass window as shown from the inside of a building
               there are two maidenly figures worked into the stained glass
               window one older and slightly taller dressed in van
               colored garments leads by the hand a younger and smaller
               girl dressed in a simple flowing white robe through the
               lighter colored pieces of glass in the window the branches of
               a tree can be seen stirring in a light wind

               the camera holds on the stained glass window beneath the
               painted figures is a scroll and on the scroll a part of the
               stained glass window is an inscription

               and all my pleasures are like yesterday

               as the camera continues to hold the jumbled sound of
               classroom recitations can be heard

               these classroom sounds although they can be heard clearly
               should not disturb the serenity of the stairway or of the
               painted figures on which the camera is leveled

               suddenly from overhead a gong rings with a harsh jarring
               noise doors are heard opening feet scuffling over the floor
               and the light high sound of girls voices chattering a
               moment later a cascade of uniformed schoolgirls of all ages
               pours down the stairs past the camera against this tide one
               single girl makes her way

               the camera pans with her up the remainder of the short flight
               of stairs and across the hallway to a door marked principal
               the girl knocks and from inside an over— cultured womans
               voice is heard in response

                                   mrs lowoods voice

               close shot  mary gibson at the door she hesitates before
               opening it she is young and her youth gives her prettiness
               but something in the quiet serenity of her face and the clear
               candor of the eyes show the innate niceness of the girl a
               quality of character which will give her real beauty as she
               grows older at the moment she is somewhat perplexed by her
               unexpected summons by the head mistress

               med close shot of mary as she opens the door and looks
               expectantly toward the desk no one is there

               med long shot as mary walks into the room it is a large
               room and every effort has been made to invest it with
               authority a large sheraton desk with side trays stands at
               one end on the wall behind this desk hangs a gloomy dour
               visaged portrait of the founder of the school the wall
               opposite the door is pierced by a large window there are
               several bookcases with dulllooking volumes books of
               reference and encyclopedia on top of one of these cases is
               the white plaster head of athena the walls are covered with
               enormous framed sepiatinted prints of the acropolis the
               colosseum trajans column and other celebrated ruins

               mrs lowood the principal a solidly built lady with iron
               gray hair and her assistant miss gilcrist a slim frail
               lady of indeterminate age are at a small table at the end of
               the room they are cutting out paper hearts as mary comes up
               to them mrs lowood finishes cutting out a paper heart and
               lays down the scissors with an air of satisfaction with mary
               close behind her she starts toward the desk miss gilcrist
               follows the camera pans with them as they cross the room

                                   mrs lowood

               mary looks concerned

               mrs lowood has reached her desk while mary stands wondering
               what might come next mrs lowood deliberately seats herself
               and puts her fingertips together firmly over this gothic
               arch she speaks to mary miss gilcrist takes her accustomed
               place beside her

                                   mrs lowood

               her

               int hallway outside mrs lowoods office  day

               mary comes out of mrs lowoods office closely followed 
               by miss gilcrist who closes the door softly behind her

                                   miss gilcrist

               mary looks at her in surprise

                                   miss gilcrist
                             in a kindly more

                         have courage to really live in the
                         world  i came back

               the two stand looking at each other for a moment while mary
               realizes what her future may be  what miss gilcrist is 
               then suddenly the ringing notes of mrs lowoods voice come
               from the other side of the door

                                   mrs lowoods voice

               miss gilcrist starts turns automatically to open the door
               then looks back at mary with a fond glance she pats her arm
               before opening the door and going on into mrs lowoods
               office

                                                       dissolve

               and the boughs of the tree beat back and forth mary comes
               down the stairs dressed in plain travelling clothes she
               carries her bag in one hand she hears the familiar sound of
               daily classroom recitations

                                   french students voice
                         je cherche

               the french lesson dies away and we hear mrs lowoods voice

               mary smiles in the distance some young girls fingers falter
               awkwardly over the melancholy chords of traumerei mary
               reaches the bottom of the stairway and passes the big fumed
               oak grandfathers clock which stands with majestic infinity
               of time reminding all tardy students that it is later than
               they know as she passes it it rings the hour she looks at
               its friendly familiar face and gives it a little pat of
               farewell os we hear a sweeping girls voice reciting the
               final verse of the chambered nautilus

                                   girls voice

                         shut thee from heaven with a dome
                         more vast
                         till thou at length art free
                         leaving thins outgrown shell by

               with this burst of poetic encouragement mary crosses the
               hallway opens the door and passes out of highcliffe academy
               closing the door behind her

               onto the back of her hand and judges the rapidity with which
               the cream dissolves at body temperature evidently it meets

               along the cobbled street and beatrice with two companions
               large flourishing wenches is casting him a coy look over

               enormous shining metal coffee machine this is a patented
               contraption for making coffee the entire machine is
               contrived to serve only one small purpose ——to make a cup of
               coffee by driving steam through ground coffee near this
               machine and flanking the door into the kitchen are fake palms
               in wooden tubs there is a door leading to the house hallway
               and through this door we can see the newel post of the

               dinner hour when mary enters the restaurant is empty but
               echoes to the sound of a rich female voice singing with great
               sentimental emphasis the words of care mio ben mary looks
               around hesitates a moment and then starts toward the back
               of the restaurant as if following the source of the singing
               at the swinging door which separates the restaurant from the
               kitchen mary hesitates a moment then knocks timidly the
               singing continues and realizing that her knock will not be

                             her voice almost a
                              whisper

               mary thinks a moment and as she thinks all the horror of her
               trip to the morgue and what she has seen	is reflected in
               her face and voice

                                   mary
                         the morgue ——

               the glass and over the shot we hear his voice

                                   gregorys voice

               middle thirties handsome and well—dressed in a quietly
               professional way he takes the glass away from marys lips
               and passes it to miss summers who is beside him

                                   gregory
                             shakes his head
                             negatively
                         but id give a great deal to know

                                   mary
                             spunkily

                                   gregory

                         her very much

               there is a little silence while mary looks at him steadily
               then she half smiles he leans over and pats her hand

                                   gregory
                         its easy to understand now isnt
                         it

               mary nods

                                   gregory
                             speaking in a low voice
                              almost as if to himself
                         a man would look anywhere for her
                         mary there is something exciting
                         and unforgettable about her —
                         something you never get hold of —
                         something that keeps a man
                         following after her

                                   mary
                         because i loved jacqueline i
                         thought i knew her today i found
                         out such strange things
                         ——frightening things i saw a
                         hangmans noose that she had
                         hanging — waiting —— i feel as if
                         id never known her

                                   gregory
                             smiling
                         at least i can explain that mary
                         your sister had a feeling about
                         life —— that it wasnt worth living
                         unless one could end it i helped
                         her get that room

                                   mary
                         werent you afraid

                                   gregory
                         afraid she might commit suicide
                             he shakes his head
                         people who commit suicide dont
                         talk about it that room made her
                         happy in some strange way i
                         couldnt understand she lived in a
                         world of her own fancy she didnt
                         always tell the truth in fact —
                         im afraid she didnt know what the
                         truth was
                             he pauses for a moment
                              and looks at mary
                         there were many things about
                         jacqueline i didnt understand and
                         yet without understanding i had
                         to be with her —— to see her —— to
                         touch her —— in order to be happy
                         its hard to explain to a
                         youngster

                                   mary
                             a little
                             sharply
                         im not a youngster i can
                         understand

               he looks at her

                                   gregory
                         the colors returning to your
                         cheeks you look as if you were
                         coming back to life are you sure
                         you didnt faint because you were
                         hungry

               mary looks astonished and then laughs to herself

                                   mary
                         you knowi didnt have lunch

               he looks at his wristwatch and chuckles

                                   gregory
                         its nearly six time for dinner

                         you or not

               mary starts out and a little reluctantly august follows
               her

               ext  street near la jeunesse  night

               mary and august come across tho street and look in the
               windows of the cosmetic company only the night lights are
               burning in the salon august tries the door rather
               perfunctorily he shakes his head and with mary moves on to
               the side door leading into the passageway from his pocket he
               takes a bunch of keys and tries one after another finally
               one key works and the door swings open mary stops in ahead
               of august

               int passageway la jeunesse  night

               two shot of mary and august august softly closes the door
               behind him the street light shines through the glass upper
               haif of the door and invades the dark hallway for a short
               distance they walk softly forward to the place where this
               light ends abruptly in the darkness here mary pauses august
               looks at her

                                   august
                         i dont like this

                         its the last door at the end of
                         this hall

               mary starts forward a step or two the shadows closing around
               her until only her face is still in the light august follows
               her she stops and looks off into the darkness

                                   august

                         no

               they stand a moment in silence

                                   mary

               august shakes his head

                         its only a little way mr august

                                   mary
                         no

               they stand again silently looking down the dark corridor

                                   august
                         we cant stand here all night

                                   mary

                                   august
                         listen ——

               realizing the futility of argument he breaks off what he was
               going to say shrugs and starts down the dark passage mary
               watches him and retreats a stop or two toward the street in
               order to have the comforting light around her again she
               stands there while augusts footsteps recede in the darkness

               ext  entrance of the salon  night

               a night watchman an old man wearing a worn corduroy norfolk
               jacket and a battered hat with his time clock hanging from a
               broad strap around his neck comes out of a neighboring
               store a flower shop he carefully closes the door behind him
               and goes to the entrance of la jeunesse from a key ring
               hanging from the leather clock strap he selects one key and
               begins to open the door

               int passageway  night

               mary still stands in the patch of light near the doorway
               abreast of her is the doorway leading from the hall to the
               salon through the glass upper half of the door she sees a
               gleam of light in the other room and tiptoes up to the door
               and looks out

               ext salon la jeunesse  night

               from marys angle shooting through the window can be soon
               the night watchman the beam of his flashlight coursing ahead
               of him as he makes his way to a time clock ho rings in his
               clock

               med close shot — mary nervous and apprehensive looks
               through at the night watchman she makes a decision and
               starts off along the hallway to warn august she disappears
               in the blackness of the unlit portion of the hallway

               reverse shot at the far end of the hallway the illuminated
               square of the street door can be seen and the little patch
               of light near it  nearer the camera a broad streak of light
               from a partially open door is between the darkness and the
               camera mary comes out of tho darkness and into this light
               at the same moment august comes out of the partially opened
               door blocking out the light for a minute his shadow goes
               ahead of him  contorted and strange he stands a moment
               before mary both of his hands clenched tightly against his
               stomach she speaks to him in a whisper

                                   mary
                         mr august  the night watchman

               august makes no answer but starts walking blindly swaying a
               little toward the street door mary goes with him walking
               at his side trying to peer into his face

                                   mary
                         the night watchman  he is in the
                         salon

               still august pays no attention

                                   mary 
                         mr august what is it whats the
                         matter

               there is no answer ho continues to walk in the same jerky
               pain—gripped fashion slowly and unsteadily toward the
               light they are engulfed in the darkness

               med close shot  august and mary from the street angle as
               they come out of the darkness mary is very agitated and
               worried august still continues to plod blindly forward mary
               reaches out to touch his shoulder

                                   mary
                         mr august 

               her hand touches his shoulder almost as if unable to bear
               this trifling weight he collapses suddenly at her foot she
               looks down

               closeup of irving augusts arm on the floor it is sprawled
               awkwardly out  the sleeve is darkly stained and there is a
               widening stain of blood upon the floor marys slippered foot
               step back so that the blood will not touch her

               mary screams the narrow hallway rings echoes and reechoes
               with the sound

               mary runs wildly toward the door fumbles with the knob and
               pulls it brusquely open as she does so the beam of the
               night watchmans searchlight comes in from the loft os a
               wild bell starts to ring madly as mary bolts in panic

               ext street in front of la jeunesse  night

               mary comes out of tin deer and starts running down the
               street behind her the lights of both the hall and the salon
               blaze the bell rings os she looks ever her shoulder and
               continues running

               ext subway entrance  night

               mary still running comes down the street she looks back
               for a moment and then goes down the stairs to the subway

               the camera remains on the subway entrance a moment so that it
               can be clearly seen that this entrance is marked

               int subway car  night

               it is late and this particular car is almost empty there is
               mary sitting huddled in one corner under the map of the
               route which the irt so thoughtfully provides mary sits
               still and white obviously shaken her coat collar is drawn
               protectively against her throat opposite her are a pair of
               young lovers their hands clasped who look blissfully into
               each others eyes

               the conductor comes shambling into the car he leeks at mary
               and takes a step toward her teetering on practiced tees
               disdaining the overhead strap

                                   conductor
                         you know where youre going lady

               mary nods

                                   conductor
                         youve been to the end of the line
                         and back again  hope you enjoyed
                         the ride

               he passes on mary looks after him frightened as he reaches
               the end of the car the subway train begins to come to a
               step the two lovers get up their hands still tightly
               clasped

               insert a sign reading	14th street

               back to scene the train comes to a stop mary glances up
               the subway door glides open the two lovers sidle crabwise
               through it never relinquishing their clasps on each others
               hands and through this same door come three men three
               convivial drunks

               group shot of the three drunks as they seat themselves
               opposite mary the middle drunk carries the heaviest load
               the ether two support him laughing and rearing as they make
               him comfortable between them all three wear top hats and
               dark overcoats  the hat of tin man in the middle is tilted
               over one eye

               med close shot of mary as she looks at the three men across
               from her over this shot comes the sound of the subway train
               stopping

               three shot of the three men one of them leans across the
               supposedly drunken man between them to offer a light for the
               ethers cigarette the man in the middle lolls awkwardly
               swaying between them

               closeup of mary as she stares at the man in the middle some
               familiar chord of memory is touched in her mind

               three shot of the three men  the car jolts and the hat
               slides off the middle mans head we see that the man is
               irving august and that he is dead one of the men quickly
               reaches down picks up the hat and puts it back on augusts
               head

               closeup of mary her fear is confirmed looking around her
               cautiously she gets up and starts down the aisle at the end
               of the car she leeks back

               the man only mutters something in his sleep mary continues
               down the cars length to where a drunken girl sits her head
               lolling

                                   mary 
                         i want your help please

               the drunken woman merely looks at her blankly the cars are
               coming to a stop again the door opens and the conductor
               comes through mary seizes his arm

               the conductor looks at her and merely observes

               waiting her face anxious and strained as she peers out onto

               breakfast and lunch and is patronized by office workers who
               can content themselves with a sandwich and a cup of coffee  
               the scene opens on the newsboy as he comes into the
               restaurant and goes up to the counter the waiter behind the
               counter buys a paper and brings it with an order of one cup
               of coffee and a glass of milk to mary and ward who are
               sitting at a small table the newsboy goes on outside and
               over the scene from time to time we hear his voice crying
               murder read all about it

               counter in front of mary he opens up the paper and scans it
               carefully mary watches him anxiously and turns to him

                             after a little pause
                         the important thing is the

                         white —— and the men holding him up
                         between them

               unable to hide his disbelief

                         yes of course —— but the police
                         would say youd probably had a bad

               judd silences her by raising his hand

                                   dr judd

               the buzzer sounds and miss summers brings the phone receiver
               to her ear

                                   miss summers
                             looking up from the

               judd gets up and saunters toward the door

                                   dr judd
                             as he walks

                         sordid

               he smiles charmingly at her and deliberately pockets her
               lighter

                                   miss summers
                             as he goes through the

                              her voice
                         thank you

               she reaches for a cigarette then realizes that judd has
               usurped her lighter with a blank expression she turns and
               looks at the closed door

               int gregory wards office  day

               dr judd comes in and walks calmly across the room

                                   dr judd
                             as he crosses
                         ive come from jacqueline she
                         needs money

                                   gregory
                         i thought you told me you didnt
                         know where she was

                                   dr judd
                             sprawling into
                             a chair
                         i didnt she came to me a few days
                         ago to put it delicately her care
                         imposes a financial burden upon me
                         she thought you might lighten that
                         burden

                                   gregory
                         if jacqueline wants money she
                         can come to me herself

                                   dr judd
                         im afraid she cant do that
                         ward it would endanger her

                                   gregory
                         what sort of danger

                                   judd
                         id like to tell you i would tell
                         you but im fond of jacqueline i

                                   gregory
                         this is nonsense unless i know
                         where jacqueline is and how she
                         is i wont give you any money

                                   dr judd
                             almost musingly
                         youre a curious man youre
                         willing to jeopardize jacquelines
                         life in order to satisfy your own
                         curiosity

                                   gregory
                         you come to me with some wild story
                         about her being in danger 
                         naturally i want to know what kind
                         of danger i want to know where she
                         is

               gregory ward rises and starts around the desk toward dr
               judd

                                   gregory
                         its not just for myself im
                         asking her sister is here the
                         kids half crazy with anxiety

                                   dr judd
                         as a man you distrust me —
                         perhaps you believe me as a
                         physician

               judd looks coolly at gregory and gregory nods grudgingly

                                   dr judd
                         well then i can tell you that in
                         addition to other dangers there is
                         a grave danger of jacqueline losing
                         her sanity i would advise against
                         you seeing her

                                   gregory
                         but why shes been ill erratic
                         but ive never heard of anything
                         like that

                                   judd
                         i told you i was speaking as her
                         physician  not as anything
                         else  you can believe me or
                         not just as you choose

               gregory looks at him a moment then turns and sits down in
               his chair with an air of resignation

                                   gregory
                             wearily
                         how much does she want

                                   dr judd
                         she could use a hundred dollars

                                   gregory
                             making a motion toward
                              his desk
                         ill give you a check

                                   dr judd
                             shaking his head
                         she can only use cash

               ward takes out a billfold and examines its contents

                                   gregory
                         i havent got that much in cash

                                   dr judd
                         how much have you got

                                   gregory
                         about fortyfive dollars

                                   dr judd
                         for the time being i imagine
                         that must do

               ward frowning hands over the money reluctantly

                                   gregory
                         tell me how is jacqueline

                                   dr judd
                             rising
                         oh as beautiful as ever

               judd starts for the door

                                   gregory
                         but tell me 

                                   dr judd
                             shrugging
                         shes nervous naturally under
                         the circumstances

                                   gregory
                         what circumstances

               judd has reached the door he turns and grins

                                   dr judd
                         you know that i cant tell you

               he starts to open the door pauses and looks back

                                   dr judd contd
                             insolently with the door
                              half open
                         as her physician and i am speaking

                         that it would be extremely
                         dangerous to attempt to see her

               the door closes behind judd ward stands for a moment looking
               at the closed door then crosses resolutely to a halltree in
               the corner takes his hat and coat and strides out

               int day nursery classroom  day

                         her i see some woman
                         peer into her face and find a
                         stranger i dream of her at
                         night its terrible to say 
                         but if she were dead it would
                         be easier there would be
                         some certainty about it

               ward patiently pats her shoulder and looks at her with
               understanding and sympathy they face each other for a moment
               in the bg nancy again rises from her neat fold of blanket

                         got a telephone book

               mary reaches into her desk drawer and pulls out the new york
               telephone directory he takes it and thumbs through it
               rapidly then dials while he is doing this nancy pokes up
               her head again

                                   nancy

                         more minutes

               nancy lets herself relax on the hard floor in quiet
               desperation by this time ward has finished dialing his
               number someone has evidently answered

                                   gregory

                         may i speak to mr irving august

               from the telephone comes the sound of unintelligible
               conversation in an explanatory note ward listens frowning

                                   gregory contd

                         shes not here shes gone

               mary looks around her a little apprehensive at the thought of
               being alone with this stranger however his own nervousness
               at jacquelines absence is very genuine as mary crosses the
               room to the desk he continues to talk excitedly

                                   judd

               little ash tray beside the dressing case a cigarette is
               smoldering mary points to it judd looks at it then quickly
               crosses the room to a door obviously leading to a bathroom
               he knocks and receiving no answer opens it and turns back
               to the room

               mary stands looking at him amazed at this sudden transition
               the almost palpable fear of this smooth easy sneering man

                                   mary
                             softly

               judd pays no attention to her he walks quickly to the other
               end of the room then turns to face her

               door fumbles furiously with the chain and lock opens it and
               goes out closing the door behind him

               mary stands in the center of the room completely at a loss
               she turns back to the desk and snuffs out the cigarette
               thoughtfully again she examines the mirror or some other
               article in the dressing case as she stands there looking at
               her sisters initials there is a soft knock at the door

               interruption she too wishes that mrs romari and jason had
               not interrupted but feels it incumbent upon her to be
               gracious

               situation and uncertain as to whether to accept or take
               himself off mrs romari settles the matter by pulling out
               the chair and forcing him to seat himself

               he pauses and the two look rather questioningly at him after
               this preamble he looks first at one and then at the other
               before speaking

               jason turns to mary

                                   jason

                         and greatness

               he half draws mary to her feet

                                   gregory
                         you dont even know where to start 
                         

               jason takes mary along with him starting for the door

                         beginnings lead to an end

               ward is forced to rise and go with them

               even mary looks concerned and puzzled they have stopped
               before the next house and again jason has taken the attitude

               by this time they have come to the third house and again
               jason has paused

                                   jason
                         wait this is a party

                                   jason
                         sounds dull doesnt it my ear is
                         perfectly trained i can tell the
                         brand of liquor and the quality of
                         the guests from the noise they
                         make

               from the next house comes the sound of revelry laughter and
               a burst of jazz music from a phonograph which obscures the
               milder noises of the house in front of which they stand

                                   jason
                             excitedly
                         that sounds more like it come on

               he grabs hold of marys hand and draws her along they go up
               to the door ward follows them

               int natalie cortez house  night

               close shot of natalie cortez she is seated at a small card
               table shuffling a pack of cards with one hand and
               surrounded by a small group of her guests in evening clothes
               natalie is a very beautiful woman of early middle age it is
               apparent why she uses only one hand to shuffle her cards she
               has but one arm a	little cape of gold lame covers her
               shoulders and hangs down over the missing arm

                                   judds voice
                         shuffle the cards well natalie
                         this is a trick of telepathy not
                         card manipulation

               another shot of the same group to include judd who stands a
               little distance away with his back purposely turned to the
               card table mrs cortez is finishing shuffling the cards the
               door knocker sounds

                                   judd
                         now pass me the cards

               the knocker sounds again and mrs cortez hands the cards to
               gladys a big gushy girl full of hormones and cocktail gin

                                   mrs cortez
                             rising
                         gladys you hand the deck to louis
                         while i answer the door

               gladys takes the cards and crosses to judd who still stands
               with his back to his audience while mrs cortez turns and
               walks in the other direction

               reverse shot  toward the door for the first time mrs
               cortez living quarters can be seen the house was formerly a
               stable on the mews and in remodeling it for living purposes
               mrs cortez has allowed the stalls and general architecture
               of the stable to remain she uses one of the two stalls as a
               little dining nook although above it the name of the horse
               apocalypse is still printed on a placard the next stall
               has been converted into a little escritoire and over this
               stall is the name morning star the place is lit with
               electrified stable and carriage lamps and furnished with
               harness and horse adornments which contrast with the rich
               piled carpet the lovely square piano of rosewood and the
               beautiful modern prints with plain wood frames book shelves
               cover the largest portion of the walls

               mrs cortez wends her way through little groups of her guests
               and goes to the door

               med close shot of the door as mrs cortez opens it revealing
               mary ward and jason on the threshold

                                   mrs cortez
                         jason how nice to see you

                         natalie may we all come to your
                         party

                                   mrs cortez
                         of course

                                   jason
                         mrs cortez mary gibson and mr
                         ward

                                   mrs cortez
                             to mary
                         its so nice to meet you

               jason has been looking about trying to peer over the heads of
               various other guests suddenly he turns back to mrs cortez
               and mary

                                   jason
                         youll have to excuse me

               another angle  jason emerges between two groups of people
               the camera picks him up and dollies with him up to the group
               around judd judd has turned and is facing them with the
               cards in his hands

                                   judd
                         mrs freeman yours was the jack of
                         spades gladys yours was the seven
                         of diamonds and mrs gosden the
                         queen of hearts —

               there is a murmur of admiration from the little group

                                   gladys
                         how do you ever do it louis

               jason makes his way through the group and faces judd

                                   judd
                         hello jason

               jason takes his arm and draws him away a few feet from the
               group

                                   jason
                             sotto voce

                             smiling
                         what a peculiar question

                                   jason

                         wait look over there

               he half turns so that judd faces the door

                                   jason

               giggling she turns to go

               dissolve

               int upstairs hallway dante  day

               jason comes up the stairs whistling as he reaches the
               landing mimi comes out of her door at the end of the
               corridor and goes across to the bathroom she is in her
               soiled dressing gown her hair lank about her shoulders she
               carries a towel over one arm

                                   jason
                             waving to her
                         mimi

               she turns toward him and is about to speak when a fit of
               coughing takes her she passes on goes through the doorway
               to the bath jason goes on to a door halfway down the hall
               lo he knocks on the door marys voice can be heard bidding
               him enter

                                   marys voice
                         come in

               jason turns the knob and throws the door open through the
               open door marys room can be seen it is a small dismal
               cubicle like the room with the noose there is a day bed a
               dresser a little desk an armchair an old— fashioned rocker
               and light curtains at the window there are a few odd—shaped
               pillows on the day bed and some other evidences of marys
               attempts to make this place bright and livable on the
               dresser top stands a large framed photograph of jacqueline

               as the door opens mary can be seen washing a pair of white
               gloves in a little basin set in the corner of the room	

               as the scene progresses she can be seen washing the gloves
               on her hands removing them rinsing out the soap and then
               tacking them up on the open window sash to dry jason pulls a
               rose from his pocket a withered blossom he offers it mary
               holds up her whitegloved hands to indicate that she cant
               take the flower he picks up a tumbler fills it with water
               puts the rose in it and sets the whole mess on the window
               sill

                                   mary
                         its terribly sweet of you jason

                                   jason
                         i have something even better

               he fishes through his pockets and brings out a ragged worn
               piece of paper crossing over to her he carefully smooths out
               this paper beside the wash basin

                                   mary
                             puzzled
                         what is it

               insert	the parallelogram traced on thin paper

                                   jasons voice
                         a parallelogram with a split
                         triangle in its very center

                                                       back to scene

                                   mary
                         but for what jason

                                   jason
                         to unlock mysteries  to unravel
                         the thread that leads to
                         jacqueline

               mary looks helpless and bewildered

                                   jason
                             with mock patience
                         i suppose ill have to explain go
                         on with your washing

               he seats himself on the edge of the day bed

                                   jason
                         i have been at the library

                                   mary
                         but youre always at the library

                                   jason
                         i went as a detective i found out
                         that mrs redi reads the same books
                         as dr judd

                                   mary
                         i dont think thats so revealing

                                   jason
                         but who is judd a psychiatrist
                         its quite natural that he should
                         read books on the history of old
                         religious societies but why should
                         mrs redi a woman with a beauty
                         parlor 

                                   mary
                         i dont know

                                   jason
                         thats it and this figure she
                         traced it the book i saw at the
                         library had been marked perfect
                         by the library inspector in march
                         mrs redi had it out in april no
                         one else had read it since

                                   mary
                             laughing
                         im at sea jason

                                   jason
                             with even more patience
                         such a simple matter this figure
                         is the symbol of the palladists

                                   mary
                             lightly mocking
                         its all clear to me now  so
                         clear

                                   jason
                         i thought it would be but just to

               is dressed in street clothes and who has perched herself on
               the arm of a large overstuffed chair they have evidently
               been talking for some time the scene opens with a slight
               lull in the conversation while judd takes a cigarette and
               lights it blows out the first inhalation of smoke and looks
               squarely at mrs cortez

                         one believes in evil if one
                         believes in god one must believe

                         she might only protest half as
                         much

                                   mrs cortez
                             rising
                         youre very flippant and perhaps
                         wise but not wise enough to see
                         the truth louis

               judd walks with mrs cortez to the door

                                   judd
                             very sincerely
                         what is truth

               mrs cortez looks at him from the doorway in surprise

                                   mrs cortez
                         those are the first words i have
                         ever heard you say without mockery
                         and contempt

               judd smiles

               mrs romari with the pigeon on the table in front of her is
               shelling beans as she shells them she sings an italian song
               her voice ringing out merrily

               mary is in the shower it is an oldfashioned affair	in a tub
               with a round pipe rail above it from which a translucent
               curtain is hanging to keep the water from splashing marys
               head neck shoulders and a portion of her back can be seen
               she is wearing a shower cap the warm water is streaming over
               her making a comfortable fog of steam mary is humming or
               whistling the song that mrs romari was singing downstairs
               she lifts her hand to soap the back of her neck a dark and
               threatening shadow falls athwart the curtain and through the
               steam and water a figure can be dimly seen standing there it
               is a moment or two before this figure speaks

                                   mrs redis voice
                         mary

               mary looks toward the shower curtain and sees the grim
               indeterminate bulk of someone standing there she brings her
               hands and arms up protectively huddling all her forces
               together in embarrassment

                                   mary
                             her voice weak and
                              embarrassed

                                   mary
                             reaching for the faucet

                         much to say

               mary turns the water off and stands listening

                                   mrs redi
                         if i were you mary  id go back

                                   mary
                         why

                                   mrs redi
                         it will make you unhappy to find
                         jacqueline it would put her in
                         danger  great danger 

               there is a little silence

                                   mrs redi
                         i can almost feel your doubt about
                         what im saying mary

                                   mary

                         mrs redi no matter what youre
                         hinting at

                                   mrs redi
                         i have no intention whatsoever of
                         hinting your sister mary is a
                         murderess she killed irving august
                          stabbed him out of fright when
                         he discovered where she was hiding

                                   mary
                         i dont believe it

                                   mrs redi

                         go back and forget jacqueline

               the shadow of mrs redis figure leaves the curtain the door
               clicks shut behind her mary moves her hand out to part the
               curtain

               close up of marys face as seen from the other side of the
               shower curtain as she opens it she is looking off at the
               door through which mrs redi has passed

                                                       dissolve

               int natalie cortez apt  late evening

               long shot  there is a fire burning in the fireplace the
               lamps have been lit although outdoors there is still a gray
               cold light in the street the room looks bright and warm
               there are about a dozen people who are	standing and sitting
               smoking and chatting before the sofa a tea service has been
               set on the coffee table an alcohol stove keeps the tea water
               hot and a slight steam rises from the tea kettle

               among the guests can be seen certain familiar faces frances
               fallon stands near the door talking with a young man mr
               durk who can be recognized as one of the two drunks who
               supported the body of irving august on the subway the other
               of the two drunks mr leo is seated by himself in an
               armchair looking through a record album in his street
               clothes chatting with a very lovely whitehaired woman is
               joseph the workman at la jeunesse

               mrs cortez is opening the door as the scene opens to admit
               mrs redi who is dressed in exactly the same clothes she
               wore in the previous scene

                                   mrs redi
                             starting to remove her
                              furs
                         im sorry to be late natalie

                                   mrs cortez
                             taking the furs and
                              hanging them over the
                              back of a chair
                         we havent even begun tea yet

               the two women cross to the sofa and sit down on the way
               across the room mrs redi nods to several of the people
               standing about she and mrs cortez seat themselves

                                   mrs cortez
                         wont you pour mrs redi

               mrs redi pours out a cup of tea her hand trembles and she
               moves rather awkwardly

                                   mrs redi
                         sorry im nervous this is very
                         trying for me

                                   mrs cortez
                         i know you introduced jacqueline
                         to us  but how could you tell —

                                   mrs redi
                         i should have known she had no
                         sincerity — no real belief

               mrs cortez pats mrs redis hand comfortingly then turns
               and calls out

                                   mrs cortez
                         cream or lemon frances

                                   frances
                         lemon

               frances comes forward and mr durk comes with her they stand
               beside the sofa near mrs redi mrs redi pours another cup
               of tea mrs cortez poises the cream pitcher over it she
               turns to a tall darkhaired woman who is standing near the
               window

                                   mrs cortez
                         miss rowan do you take cream

               miss rowan without bothering to answer strides across the
               room and takes the teacup from her hand she seats herself in
               a small chair facing the sofa mrs redi starts to pour
               another cup of tea but has a slight mishap there is a
               clatter

                                   mrs redi
                         please natalie would you mind
                         pouring

               mrs cortez takes the teapot in her hand and begins pouring

                                   miss rowan
                         you shouldnt be nervous there is
                         nothing personal or vengeful in
                         what we are about to do we have
                         only to make a decision

               a tall quiet woman has come up to the table she speaks 
               to mrs cortez

                                   mrs swift
                         but it can be such a horrible
                         decision i found peace here i
                         know that a large portion of that
                         peace came because we are all
                         pledged to nonviolence now this 

                                   miss rowan
                         our founder must have known when he
                         wrote these seemingly contradictory
                         rules — the rule of nonviolence
                         and the law that whoever betrays us
                         must die  he must have known

                                   frances
                         but i cant understand it

               mrs redi turns to her

                                   mrs redi
                         some of us frances must believe
                         without understanding

                                   frances
                         yes

               as she speaks a mature handsome forceful man dressed in a
               dark business suit mr bruns comes forward

                                   mrs redi
                         i went back through the history
                         last night i read about johann
                         rozenquartz  i read what he 
                         wrote 

                                   mr bruns
                         i can quote it fully mrs redi
                         we will avoid violence for once
                         undertaken violence becomes its
                         own master and can lead to either
                         good or evil

                                   mrs redi
                         but he also wrote 

                                   mr bruns
                             interrupting
                         i can quote that too those who
                         shall go out into the market place
                         and let their tongues speak of us
                         and give knowledge of our being and
                         our deeds whomsoever doeth this
                         shall die

                                   mrs swift
                         since the founding of our order
                         there have been six betrayals and
                         six deaths and now there is
                         jacqueline —— she is the seventh

                                   frances
                         you cant do anything to her
                         you mustnt hurt her

                                   mrs cortez
                         but she betrayed us frances

                                   frances
                         she never betrayed us she was only
                         going to a doctor  a
                         psychiatrist

                                   mrs redi
                         but she told him frances she told
                         him about us

                                   mr bruns
                             to frances
                         i know this is difficult for you i
                         know that you love her

                                   frances
                         she didnt betray us

                                   mr bruns
                         even if i believed that i would
                         still consider her dangerous there
                         is the matter of irving augusts
                         death without consulting me mrs
                         redi was ill—advised enough to have
                         the body removed by leo and durk
                         this makes us all a party to the
                         crime what if there is a trial
                         what if jacqueline is asked how the
                         body was removed do you think
                         frances she would keep silent

               there is a long pause he looks around the circle

                                   mr bruns
                         it is a very real danger and one
                         which forces our decision

                                   mrs redi
                         what about judd  he knows about
                         us

                                   mrs cortez

               frances fallen begins to cry outside the streetlights go on

               int jasons room  night

               it is a small room with a skylight there are no curtain on
               the skylight behind it the night sky can be seen and
               occasionally the beam of a searchlight cuts across there is
               a bed an easy chair and a desk with a typewriter stand
               beside it the walls of the room are almost hidden by
               bookcases and books and even the mantel bears a burden of
               numerous volumes jason is seated at his desk turned toward
               the typewriter he types a line reads it inaudibly and at
               the same time beats out the rhythm with his left hand on the
               desk top evidently it scans because he types another line
               and is about to repeat the rhythmic test on it when there is
               a small knock on the door he gets up crosses the room and
               opens the door mary stands outside she is dressed in the
               little traveling suit she wore in the first sequence and
               wears a hat

                                   jason
                             pulling her into the
                              room
                         mary

               he shuts the door behind her then stands to watch her as she
               looks around the room he smiles happily

                                   jason
                         mary this is so wonderful

               mary looks at him questioningly

               he takes her hand and leads her further into the room 

                                   jason

                         my books 

               he leads forward a step and bends down to touch a battered
               little tavern table of old maple wood

                                   jason
                         my furniture

               points to the window

                         its not a searchlight —— its a
                         sword blade cutting the blue cloak
                         of a prince — not stars

                         your work —

               he suddenly senses the compulsion that had been in her words

                         friend

               mary turns away close to tears jason stands looking at her

                                   jason
                             in a low voice
                         i had begun to write again —thats
                         whet i was doing when you came in

                             incredulous

                         knew id seen his body on the
                         subway

               jason thinks for a moment

                         if it is true — theres all the
                         more reason for you to find
                         jacqueline

                                   mary
                         and gregory  he loves her

                                   jason
                         he loves you mary and youll have
                         to tell him

                         hes jacquelines husband i cant

               she begins to cry jason puts his arm about her shoulders

                                   jason
                         you cant tell him  you cant
                         even dream of loving him 	you
                         feel guilty for not having had love
                         enough for jacqueline to save her
                         from whatever it was that took her
                         away  i know that feeling

               they stand for a moment silently

                                   jason
                         but youve got to tell him about
                         jacqueline — if only for the
                         practical reason that hes a lawyer
                         and will know what to do im going
                         to phone him

               jason drops his arms from her shoulder and starts for the
               phone

                                                       dissolve

               int jasons room  night

               gregory ward is striding up and down the room he seems
               greatly perturbed he speaks and the camera pulls back to
               show mary and jason both seated and both watching him as he
               strides

                                   gregory
                         shes got to be found thats the
                         first step shes got to be found
                         so that she can give herself up to
                         the police

                                   mary
                         weve tried so long to find her

                                   jason
                         judd could tell us  if he would

               gregory stops in front of jason

                                   gregory
                         do you think he knows about this

                                   jason
                             shaking his head

                                   gregory
                         hes clever and hes cautious in
                         his way if he knew i think hed
                         advise her to do what i want —
                         surrender herself to the police ——
                         stand trial —— i dont think he
                         knows

                                   jason
                         we could tell him

               gregory strides on again to the end of the room then turns
               to jason

                                   gregory
                         could you find him

                                   jason
                         i suppose so i can pick him up
                         somewhere

               jason picks up his overcoat from the foot of the bed and
               takes his hat in his hand

                                   mary
                         jason i sometimes wonder ——youre
                         so sweet to me — so kind and
                         sympathetic  i dont know how i
                         can ever thank you

               jason looks at her for a moment

                                   jason
                         thank me you dont need to thank
                         me

               he looks at her again and then at gregory ward evidently
               some idea has passed through his mind because he turns from
               mary crosses to the table picks up a manuscript and puts it
               into a large manila envelope

                                   gregory

                         verse  verse that i wrote i need
                         it

               he puts the envelope under his arm and starts toward the
               door

               judd walks along unconcerned and seemingly unaware that on
               the opposite side of the street jason is patiently following
               him he sees his image reflected in a weighing machine mirror
               and turns to him the two men wave a friendly hello jason
               ducks out of sight around a corner for a moment and then
               takes up judds trail again judd passes into a small
               apartment house jason follows a moment later

               int apartment house hallway  night

               there is a self—service elevator jason comes in and sees
               that the elevator is in use and the sign in use is glowing
               and the fourth floor button is red he waits patiently for
               the elevator to stop and presses the down button when it
               returns to the first floor he opens the outer door then the
               inner grill and is about to step in when judd suddenly
               appears from the other side of the elevator reaches in and
               taps him on the shoulder jason turns around surprised

               jason reaches into his overcoat pocket and pulls out the
               manila envelope containing the manuscript

                                   jason
                         some time ago you spoke about my
                         writing again i want your help
                         id like you to bring this to your
                         publisher

               judd takes the envelope and starts to open it looking up at
               jason

                                   judd
                         this is curious jason half the
                         time you talk as if shakespeare
                         were not fit to tie your
                         shoe—laces now this sudden
                         humility

                                   jason
                         i should like people to read what
                         ive written

               judd looks at him and taps the envelope

                                   judd
                         and this poetry —— like the poetry
                         you wrote before extols the passion
                         and beauty of life

                                   jason
                         it goes beyond that it praises the
                         goodness of god and the greatness
                         of all his works

                                   judd
                             looking at him
                              quizzically 
                         i hope it finds as much favor as
                         your other book  but somehow i
                         doubt it  the time is out of
                         tune

                                   jason
                         why not let your publisher judge
                         that

               judd starts for the door but jason takes a quick step after
               him and lays hold of his arm

                                   jason
                         wait — there is that other
                         favor

                         tell us where she is — when you
                         know shes a murderess she killed
                         a man

               walks with jason behind them mary and gregory go past the

                         perhaps

               house mary looks up at the dark windows glances at the
               garbage can full of refuse near the door and shudders

               dr judd takes a key from his pocket and opens the front
               door the hallway is dimly lit by a bare electric bulb at
               the back can be seen an angular stairway

                                   judd
                         wait ill call her

               he goes into the house and the rest stand together on the
               stoop looking in through the open door judd crosses the hall
               and standing at the front of the stairs calls up to
               jacqueline

                                   judd
                         jacqueline this is judd

               there is no answer he waits a moment then calls again

                         jacqueline	

               there is a frightened strained voice that answers a voice
               that seems to have come up through layers of heavy sleep
               emerging only to be frightened

                                   jacquelines voice
                         who is it

                                   judd
                         judd im here with your sister
                         come on down

               judd goes forward and stands by the banister mary stands at
               one side with jason and gregory at the other side they
               wait

               very slowly jacqueline comes down the stairs she has on her
               nightgown and over it a fur coat her hair is loose about her
               shoulders her eyes are wide and apprehensive judd puts out
               his hand to help her down the last few steps mary goes into
               the lighted hall the two sisters look at each other for a
               moment then go into each others arms judd leans against the
               banister watching finally they break from their embrace
               mary is crying and jacqueline is halflaughing halfcrying
               she holds mary off at arms length looking at her

                                   jacqueline
                         mary

               she sees the two men in the doorway and starts back
               fearfully gregory steps forward

                                   gregory
                         jacqueline

               she stands quite still looking at him nervously

                                   gregory
                         its all right

               jacqueline turns back to judd and moves a little in his
               direction judd continues to lean against the banister
               smiling

                                   gregory 
                         youre safe nothing is going to
                         hurt you

                         must let us help you

               mary extends her arms to her sister and jacqueline goes into
               them

                                   judd
                             to jason
                         for me — this seems to be the end
                         of a delightful relationship

               judd smiles and shrugs his shoulders

                                                       dissolve

               int	jasons apartment  night

               there is a bright fire in the fireplace jason is crouched
               before the fire he has a coffee pot set up on the edges of
               three bricks inside the fireplace and on the hearth is a
               reflector baker with biscuits baking in it a bottle of cream
               and other oddments and endments of his culinary art are
               strewn about on the hearth

               jacqueline is seated before the fire in an armchair with mary
               at her feet marys head is resting against jacquelines
               knee gregory sits on a straight chair a little
               uncomfortable and facing them from the other side of the
               fire judd lounges on the bed

               jason wraps a tea towel around his hand and reaches in the
               fireplace for the coffee pot he pours out a cup of coffee
               and then with the same wrapped hand snatches a biscuit from
               the baker and puts it on the edge of the coffee saucer he
               hands it to jacqueline her hand trembles as she takes it

                                   jason
                             as he passes the coffee
                         here this will put some life into
                         you

                                   jacqueline
                             looking fixedly into the
                              fire
                         its like coming back to life

                                   gregory
                         jacqueline it would be so much
                         easier if you would tell me just
                         what happened id know what to do
                         for you

               jacqueline shakes her head

                                   mary
                         please jacqueline

                         are i was one of them

               she pauses and judd in moving from his place on the bed
               speaks

                                   judd
                         jacqueline was always a
                         sensationalist trying to seize
                         onto something  anything  in
                         order to find happiness through
                         mrs redi she stumbled onto the
                         palladist movement — it appealed
                         to her

                                   jacqueline

                         wanted me to die  to kill myself

                         jeunesse i was there such a long
                         time

               she stops

                                   judd
                         you can imagine the effect of such
                         imprisonment on jacqueline

                         away he was lying in the hall with
                         the blood around him

               she shudders

                                   mary
                             comforting her

               jacqueline raises the cup to her lips and sips jason busies
               himself at the fire again

                                   gregory

               the camera is fixed at the spot in the apartment where the
               palladists had grouped themselves during the meeting 
               there is no one present but the chairs are still in the same
               disorderly pattern to which they had been pulled during the
               meeting

               there is the sound of a door buzzer and the light tread of
               feet as someone crosses the room at the other end and answers
               the door the door can be heard opening

                                   mrs cortez voice

                         disturbed you if it werent for a
                         matter of grave concern to me

               he is dressed in street clothes with his overcoat over his
               arm and hat in band he stops and looks moodily at the oddly
               spaced collection of chairs mrs cortez seats herself on the
               arm of the sofa

                                   mrs cortez

               he stands silently staring

                                   mrs cortez
                         is it about jacqueline

                             with the air of one who
                              dismisses a trivial
                              matter
                         no shes no longer under my care

               mrs cortez looks at him in astonishment he is too absorbed
               to notice this start on her part

                                   judd
                         i dont know how to begin this

                         deep conviction im coming to you
                         out of loss i no longer can
                         believe in the power and the
                         rightness of things that are called
                         good

                                   mrs cortez

                         ive talked nonsense ive scoffed
                         and hooted  but somewhere very
                         deep down in me i always felt that
                         good held the balance of power

                                   mrs cortez

               at their glee goes on alone the telephone at her desk
               rings

               mary still singing crosses the room and mimics the chopping
               gesture of the last phrase as she reaches for the phone

               jacqueline the beams of the other lamp gleam on the eyes in
               the dark faces around her there is a deep silence in the
               apartment after a moment bruns voice grown hoarse can be
               heard speaking from the shadows

                                   bruns voice
                         go ahead jacqueline go ahead

               the words drop into the silence like stones in a pool of
               still water and the silence closes over them jacqueline
               moves her position a little bit her movements are slow and
               she moves without disturbing the stillness of the room mrs
               cortez light voice comes in

               scene the almost tableau arrangement of the character is
               shattered frances fallon jumps hysterically to her feet

                                   frances
                             hysterically completely

               very slowly jacquelines hand goes forward and seizes the
               stem of the glass slowly she brings it up to her lips
               frances suddenly knocks the glass from her hand it goes
               crashing to the floor frances sobbing falls at
               jacquelines feet embracing her knees and weeping bitterly

                                   frances

                         me i was never happier than when i
                         worked for you —— never

               mrs  cortez reaches back of her and snaps on the wall lights
               the whole room is filled with a hard white light jacqueline
               has not moved frances continues to sob at her knee the rest
               get up stiffly and move awkwardly about bruns and leo
               whisper together bruns comes over to jacqueline end stands
               before her

                         but now you can go

               jacqueline makes no move to rise but continues to sit with a
               dead set face looking ahead of her with frances still
               weeping at her knee bruns takes her arm roughly and pulls
               her to her feet in the background leo can be seen going out
               of the room

                                   bruns
                         i told you you could go

               she seems to be aware of what he has said for the first time
               she starts for the door almost stumbling as she walks
               jacqueline goes through the front door without looking back
               and without closing the door behind her mrs cortez walks
               forward and shuts the door

               ext washington news  night

               jacqueline comes out of mrs cortez apartment and stands for
               a moment in a broad patch of light thrown by the open door
               behind her this door closes and she is suddenly in darkness
               she looks apprehensively into the shadows and then quite
               hesitantly begins to walk to the right at the end of the
               street the brighter lights of fifth avenue can be seen
               washington news itself is full of dark shadows

               she is exhausted and unnerved she walks slowly she passes
               one place where the out—jutting of the building casts a
               deeper shadow on the sidewalk a garbage can is set behind
               the out—jutting this and the bough of an old ailanthus
               combine to cast a manlike shadow beside the shadow of the
               building jacqueline pauses peers intently into the shadow
               then summons up courage enough to pass she walks quickly
               past the outjutting building somewhat relieved she walks a
               little bit more confidently suddenly there is a clatter and
               bang of metal behind her she gasps startled and whirls
               around

               a white dog with a long bony tail slinks away from a garbage
               can the lid of this can is still oscillating from its fall
               and roll

               jacqueline draws her coat more closely about her and goes on
               ahead of her thrown by the thin light from a transom above a
               door is the enormously long shadow of a man across the
               sidewalk and across the street she hesitates then starts to
               cross the street diagonally looking back all the while at
               the doorway from the center of the street it can be seen
               that a man stands there with him stands a woman her figure
               somewhat lost in the doorway they are saying good night on
               the opposite side of the street jacqueline hurries toward
               the avenue

               ext the avenue  night

               with evident relief jacqueline comes out of the darkness of
               washington news to the more brightly lighted avenue traffic
               is passing and people are all about her she starts off up
               the avenue with confidence then some premonition makes her
               turn only a few paces behind her is leo and there is a grin
               on his lean satyrlike face

               she hurries her step behind her leo quickens his pace it
               she peers into the faces of passersby seeking some
               unpreoccupied person who might be sympathetic and helpful
               people pass her intent on their own business and without
               concern she begins to run leo merely lengthens his stride
               it is easy for him to keep up with her a few people turn
               their heads to watch her run but leos long strides attract
               no attention suddenly in desperation she dashes across the
               street a cab narrowly misses hitting her and a bus coming
               from the other direction has to stop with an appalling
               scream and roar of brakes

               jacqueline shaken out of breath and trembling reaches the
               other corner of the street she pauses for a moment to take
               a deep breath she looks back of her there is no sign of
               leo again she starts on and from the shadow of a light
               standard a deeper shadow detaches itself and steps out behind
               her it is leo and he is grinning she sees him and begins to
               run down the cross street she runs wildly leo at first
               lengthens his stride and then suddenly breaks into a lope —
               a lope that will bring him up to her within an instant

               she ducks into an alley and is lost in the darkness she
               hides in a corner amid some debris crouching back out of the
               light leo plunges ahead in pursuit jacqueline stands a
               moment as the sound of his footsteps diminish then turns
               back and begins running down the street ahead of her a dark
               slim figure not unlike leos is walking up the street
               toward her

               she dodges into the next alley this is an alley behind a
               theatre it is cluttered with all sorts of strange
               impedimenta flats crates etc there is an overhead lamp
               burning in the center of the alley but the periphery of the
               light beneath it does not extend to the walls of the alley
               the area immediately adjacent to these walls is heavy with
               darkness and strange shadows jacqueline stands in the middle
               of the pool of light and listens it seems to her that she
               can hear in the darkness the soft taptap of someone walking
               on his toes she shrinks back from the bright light into the
               darkness and begins to grope her way along the wall she is
               going from left to right a sound at her right attracts her
               attention and she looks off but continues to grope her way
               along the wall to the left her hand passes from the
               roughness of the wall to the smoothness of cloth and a split
               second later leo whom she has touched grins as he seizes
               her wrist she screams and then silently struggles to free
               herself still smiling he holds her firmly with his right
               band with his left hand he draws something from his pocket
               he presses a button on this and a fourand ahalf inch knife
               blade flashes out jacqueline stands stock still with fright
               leos hand goes back for the blow

               at the opposite side of the alley a door is suddenly thrown
               wide open and a great patch of light is thrown on jacqueline
               and leo he puts the knife behind his back

               out of the door come half a dozen people in costumes they
               are members of a ballet company performing in the theatre
               also there emerges the sound of loud and merry music

               the actors are in a gay mood laughing and shouting one of
               them breaks into a half dance step it is infectious and the
               rest join in making a sort of carmagnole that sweeps down
               the alley jacqueline breaks from leos handhold on her
               wrist and runs in among them

               one of the dancers is an enormous man dressed in roman half
               armor to represent the god gambrinus with gilded hop blooms
               as a garland about his shoulders and wearing a papier mache
               mask surmounted by crown of similarly gilded hop leaves and
               wheat the face of the mask is a grinning jolly rubicund
               visage  it is next to this enormous man that jacqueline
               finds herself in sportive mood the giant dancer sweeps her
               up with one arm forcing her to dance his grotesque steps

                                   jacqueline

               on the street corner is a beer saloon the dancers some of
               them still skipping and dancing come around and go into the
               brilliantly lit saloon the dancer with jacqueline tries to
               pull her into the saloon she fights away from him laughing
               and slapping his thigh in mirth he leaves her and passes
               into the saloon she is left alone in the street she makes a
               half—hearted movement to adjust her disarranged clothing
               slowly with great weariness she begins to walk away from
               the saloon going further and further into the darkness she
               looks around the darkness frightens her she looks back
               there is the warm glow of light from the saloon windows she
               starts to go back from the lighted end of the street a man
               crosses to the same side of the street as jacqueline his
               silhouette somewhat resembles the silhouette of leo she
               turns runs and is lost in the darkness

               tiny flame to illuminate the hall the draft in the hallway
               stirs this little flame and the shadows move with it
               jacqueline comes up the stairs now that she can be seen more
               closely it can be seen also that she is exhausted her eyes
               wild her hair in disorder she almost staggers as she
               reaches the landing and goes slowly supporting herself on the

               stands watching until the light snaps on in mimis room and
               then the door closing plunges the hall into weird half light

               and walks down the hall toward room 7 she opens the door
               and goes in for a brief moment the light from the hall casts
               the shadow of a noose against the further wall of the room
               and then the door closes behind her

               the room is lit by a single little lamp on the dressing table
               — mary herself stands near the window looking out gregory
               is talking over the telephone from downstairs we hear mrs
               romari singing the song comes faintly to this upper story
               she is singing an italian song the words are dantes

                                   mrs romaris voice
                             singing
                         death why hast thou made life so
                         hard to bear
                         taking my lady hence east thou
                         no whit or shame
                         the youngest flowers and the most
                         fair
                         thou hast pluckd away and the
                         world wanteth it

               gregory puts down the telephone and crosses to the window

                                   gregory
                         that was dr judd he was phoning
                         to say that jacqueline is on her
                         way here 

                                   mary
                         gregory ——
                             pauses then goes on
                         youd better take jacqueline with
                         you tonight

                                   gregory
                         its what i should have done
                         yesterday ill take her away
                         somewhere where she can rest

               mary turns back toward the window gregory stands watching
               her

                                   gregory
                         mary

               she turns toward him he puts his hands on her shoulders and
               turns her back to the window

                                   gregory
                         no stay that way i want to talk
                         to you i love you — you know
                         that

                                   mary
                             in a choked voice 
                         yes

                                   gregory
                         perhaps later when things are
                         settled when jacquelines well
                         again  maybe we can arrange
                         things differently

               mary turns and faces him

                                   mary

                         sister —— whom i had lost and have
                         found again
                             breaks off
                             shaking her
                             head

                                   gregory

               mary shakes her head turns back toward the window they
               stand together for a moment from below comes the sound of
               mrs romaris singing

                                                       dissolve

               int second floor hall  dante restaurant  night

               the camera is leveled on the empty hall from downstairs
               can be heard the sound of mrs romari singing then mimis
               door opens and mimi sweeps out dressed in a black dress
               gleaming with sequins her hair piled high her walk proud
               and steady she comes down the hall toward the camera just
               as she reaches the door of 7 there is the sound of an
               over—turned chair falling she pauses and looks toward the
               door there is the creaking sound of the rope she listens
               for an instant and failing to comprehend sweeps on past the
               camera

               int dante restaurant  morning

               it is a bright day and the sunlit street can be seen through
               the windows children are hurrying by on their way to school
               at a table near the window mary sits with gregory she has
               been crying and has her sodden handkerchief in her hand
               gregory has a preoccupied air and is tracing figures on the
               table cloth with his fork

               jason comes in bearing a small tray with three tiny cups of
               coffee on it he puts a cup in front of each of them and
               keeps one for himself he sips his coffee
               neither mary nor gregory touch theirs jason pushes marys cup
               toward her to attract her attention she picks it up and
               brings it to her lips

                                   jason
                         i hate people who try to peddle
                         comfort butmary you shouldnt
                         mourn for jacqueline life for her
                         was full of the agony of a
                         disordered mind its better this
                         way

                                   mary
                         i keep telling myself that

                                   gregory
                         well tell yourself mary that
                         this is a world that doesnt pass
                         with the passing of any one of us
                         all three of us are going to start
                         afresh

               he looks up and across at jason with a meaningful glance at
               mary

                                   gregory
                         you and i have new hopes —— and new
                         plans can come from them ——

               jason looks at him across mary and shakes his head

                                   jason
                         not i — i am alive yet every hope
                         i had is dead
                             turns to mary
                         death can be good death can be
                         happy if i were really dying i
                         could speak like cyrano — my
                         courage like a white plume — and
                         all the other lovely words with
                         which he greeted death then
                         perhaps you might understand

                                   mary
                             reaching over to touch 
                             his band
                         i understand

                                   jason
                             suddenly
                         good we all understand each other
                         you gregory and i we all know
                         there is sunlight in the streets
                         and work to do both of you —
                         youre off to work

               he gets up and takes marys arm helping her to rise

                                   jason
                         off with you you cant sit here in
                         this cellar with the sun shining

               he hustles her toward the door and gregory follows mary and
               gregory ascend the steps to the street level

               jason steps back a pace or two so that he is backgrounded by
               the mural of dante he stands there and the smile leaves his
               face his whole body reflects his hopelessness and despair
               it is at this moment that mrs romari comes hustling in from
               the kitchen

                                   mrs romari
                         ah good they have all gone now
                         you and i can laugh and joke again

               he turns to her forcing a smile

                                                       fade out

               the end
