               fade in

               int grubby hotel corridor  day dimly lit

               a womans face backs into shot her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper she is tense sweaty wideeyed with 
               concentration this is clarice starling mid20s trim 
               very pretty she wears kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker khaki pants her thick hair is piled under a 
               navy baseball cap a revolver clutched in her right hand 
               hovers by her ear she raises a speedloader in her left 
               hand locks it into her cylinder twists and reloads

               close on

               a guest room door with a small wired pack attached to its 
               knob suddenly wish a sharp crack the knob explodes and 
               the door bursts open

               with clarice  moving shot

               as she runs around a corner through a cloud of smoke she 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside gun at 
               the ready in both hands

                                                                    cut to

               int hotel room  day

               clarices pov  moving  as she first sees sitting on the 
               edge of a bed  a female hostage black late 20s gagged 
               hands behind her back then swivelling she sees a startled 
               male suspect white mid20s standing by a window with a 
               rifle in his hands he is turning towards her

               clarice drops into a combat crouch gun extended and shouts

                                     clarice

               clarices pov  slow motion

               all natural sound suspended  as the suspect faces her with 
               a strange pleading expression the rifle is rising in his 
               hands but oddly enough it is held across his chest not 
               pointing then another puzzling detail registers

               the suspects hands

               are taped to his gun away from the trigger he couldnt use 
               it even if he tried suddenly we hear a metallic click which 
               registers with unnatural amplification as  clarice reacts 
               drops to the floor rolling sideways and 

               the hostage

               pulls a revolver out from behind her back still in slow 
               motion raising it in her untied hands she fires repeatedly 
               flames leaping from the muzzle the sound is an echoing roar 
               in these close quarters but 

               clarice has come up on one knee beside an armchair and is 
               already firing back herself two quick shots which send 

               the hostage

               pitching over the bed backwards to shudder and lie still 
               in a haze of gunsmoke clarice rushes to her clamping one 
               knee down on her gun hand still keeping her covered in case 
               of movement hold for a few beats then we hear the shrill 
               blast of a whistle from somewhere off screen as normal 
               action and sound are restored

               clarice relaxes lowering her gun the lights brighten

               dark openings of unexplored passages  various objects loom 
               briefly into view overhead  a stainlesssteel work table 
               a big sink jars of chemicals neat racks of gleaming 
               knives

                         among those who tried to conceal 
                         their past look for severe childhood 
                         disturbances associated with

                         childhood incarceration then go 
                         to their personality tests

               we pass a row of female mannequins some nude some wearing 
               colorful leather jackets designer knockoffs in various 
               stages of completion then a huge maroon armoire in chinese 
               lacquer its double doors are slightly ajar the jaunty 
               background

               music is growing even louder fats waller singing bye bye 
               baby and now we hear something else too  the rapid 
               clicking of a sewing machine

                         happy future no baby carriage 
                         out in the yard no pets no toys 
                         no flowers no sun

               we turn another corner and there is mr gumb himself as we 
               approach his wide back is to us hes hunched over an old
               fashioned sewing machine humming cheerfully and working a 
               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see a female 
               wig rests near him on a head form he wears a hairnet and a 
               beautiful kimono and pumps the treadle with his bare feet

                         his females will be more crudely 
                         sketched than him males  but hell 
                         compensate by adding exaggerated 
                         adornments jewelry big breasts 
                         and his tree drawings  oh his trees 
                         will be frightful

               next to mr gumb is an antique phonograph  source of the 
               music his little dog precious perches by his plump ankles 
               as we pass mr gumb precious scurries away from him panting 
               happily and we follow the little dog down another corridor 
               the music starting to fade behind us

                         billy hates his own identity he 
                         always has  and he thinks that makes 
                         him a transsexual but his pathology 
                         is a thousand times more savage 
                         he wants to be reborn clarice he 
                         will be reborn

               at the end of this final corridor the cellar widens into a 
               lowceilinged chamber with two additional doorways and in 
               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette 
               precious sniffs her way over to the edge  excited tail 
               wagging  than barks happily as we hear a hoarse ghostly

               are tying a chicken bone to the buckets handle where it 
               meets the string the other end of the string is tied to her 
               wrist

               she stands

               gathers the coiled string in one hand and swings the bucket 
               by its handle calculating this distance up to the basement

               she hurls the bucket upwards

               at the lip of the oubliette

               the bucket sails out bounces loudly then falls back inside

               angle on the dog precious

               who is elsewhere in the basement worrying a toy she cocks 
               an ear making a low growl then sets off to investigate

               down in the pit

               catherine swings the bucket again trying another cast

               the bucket lands

               two feet beyond the pits edge rolls a bit stops

               the enticing chicken bone six feet away it twitches as 
               catherine tugs on the string edging the bucket back towards 
               the pit

               precious with her tail wagging barks  greedy but suspicious

               the bone in her teeth she tries to run away with it but 
               catherine is pulling her towards the hole working her like 
               a hooked fish her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop

               stares desperately unable to see how shes doing

               precious

               still fights for the bone growling as the bucket rocks 
               precariously on the edge of the pit a long seesaw battle 
               until finally when one of her forelegs slips momentarily 
               into the hole she panics and lets go the bucket flops over 
               the edge

               catherine

               as clarice turns startled and the fuming chilton seizes 
               her elbow pembry and boyle are beside him looking grim

                                     chilton

                                     dr lecter
                         brave clarice will you let me know

                              moving closer to the 
                              bars

                         wont be needing it anymore

               he holds out the file arm extended between the bars she 
               hesitates then reaches to take it

               very close angle  slow motion

               as the exchange is made his index finger touches her hand 
               and lingers there just for a moment

               dr lecters eyes

               widen crackling at this touch like sparks in a cave

                                     dr lecter
                         goodbye clarice

               clarice

               hugging the case file to her chest stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her pushing her away

               her pov  moving

               as dr lecter head cocked in a smile slowly recedes

               aisle sound of many sewing machines all clattering at once 
               as he passes row on row of work tables the seamstresses 
               mostly black or hispanic glance up as he passes then quickly 
               avert their eyes his presence disturbing them in some 
               nameless way

               a thin foreman in a flowery shirt sees him approaching he 
               rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully as the rack 
               rolls to a stop

                                     foreman

                         what have you brought us today

               he seizes one of the dangling jackets pulling up the plastic 
               wrapper he examines it stroking the sleeve

                                     foreman

                         youre leaving oil on the skin

               the foreman quickly releases the jacket

                         of course youll be wanting your 

               mr gumbs hand reaches into shot snatching an envelope 
               from him the foreman is watching him walk away as a 
               seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments the 
               foreman is vaguely troubled but shakes it off he strokes 
               the jacket again admiringly

               close on a steaming rather elegant dinner tray being carried 
               by pembry as he approaches dr lecters cell

                                     pembry
                              shouts
                         ready when you are doc

               in the cell

               the bach is issuing from the cassette player beside it on 
               the table the pile of dr lecters drawings the top one is 
               an accurate sensitive portrait from memory of clarice 
               beyond the table we see lecters shadowy form seated behind 
               the paper screen he calls out from there

               pembry grunts sets the tray down boyle joins him handing 
               him a riot baton and a mace cannister which pembry fastens 
               to belt clips boyle is similarly armed and carries a ring 
               of keys

               inside the screen

               dr lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet  swaying 
               slightly eyes closed lost in the music tongue working in 
               his cheek suddenly like magic a little shiny piece of 
               metal protrudes from his lips he plucks it out opens his 
               eyes

               in extreme closeup

               he is holding the pocket clip from prentices disassembled 
               pen  a straight thin strip of metal with a circular collar 
               at one end a square edge at the other

               dr lecter

               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge then 
               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim he pushes 
               down hard using both hands for leverage after a moment he 
               smiles holding up the result and twirling it before his 
               eyes

               in extreme closeup

               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle 
               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers

               outside the cell

               pembry and boyle turn as the toilet flushes and dr lecter 
               reappears looking jaunty

                                     pembry
                         okay doc grab some floor same 
                         drill as lunchtime

               dr lecter sits on the floor legs straight then wriggles 
               backwards he stretches his arms behind him hands and wrists 
               through the bars with two bars between them and clasps his 
               hands

                                     dr lecter
                         im ready when you are officer 
                         pembry

               pembry comes around the cell to squat behind dr lecter he 
               tugs his hands farther out rather roughly handcuffs his 
               wrists he shakes the cuffs making sure of them then nods 
               to boyle

               new angle  at cell door

               as boyle picks up the dinner tray and pembry crosses around 
               pembry takes the keys from boyle unlocks the cell door and 
               pushes it inward boyle goes inside with the tray

               dr lecter

               watches as boyle approaches the table above five feet from 
               him boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear 
               off some of the mess of drawings the music plays on

               very close on

               dr lecters hands outside the bars as the makeshift 
               key held between the tips of his right index and middle 
               fingers searches for the keyhole of the cuffs and finds 
               it

               new angle  favoring boyle

               as he finishes clearing the drawings then turns back towards 
               dr lecter stooping to pick up the tray

               boyles right hand

               is just inches from the tray when dr lecters hand darts 
               into shot snapping a handcuff onto his wrist

               boyle

               looks up astonished to find himself right in the grinning 
               face of dr lecter  who just as quickly rolls sideways and 
               snaps 

               the other cuff

               around the bolted leg of the table and suddenly all natural 
               sound and motion are suspended as the music soars much 
               louder each separate note of it now echoing distinctly and 
               we see

               various angles  each blurring into stopaction

               pembry starting into the cell reaching for his riot baton 

               dr lecter smashing against the cell door driving it into 
               pembry pinning him across the chest against the door 
               frame

               boyle on one knee on the floor digging desperately in his 
               pants pocket for his handcuff key

               pembrys hand mashed against his body by the door as he 
               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist 

               pembrys eyes widening in horror as he stares at

               dr lecters bared teeth flashing towards him

               dr lecter gripping pembrys face in his jaws shaking it 
               like a dog shakes a rat

               boyle finding his key but in his terror dropping it

               dr lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed 
               pembrys belt spraying him in his bloody face then clubbing 
               him to his knees

               boyle mouth open in a silent scream finding his key again 
               unlocking the handcuff but then as he starts to rise 
               seeing

               dr lecter standing over him with the riot baton raised 
               high he swings it viciously down again and again and 
               again

               then normal sound and motion are restored as we go to 

               close angle on

               the cassette player and the portrait of clarice both now 
               flecked with blood in addition to the bach we now hear 
               soft panting close by and whimpering sobs in the background

               angle on dr lecter

               eyes closed lost in a favorite passage of the music his 
               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes as his breathing 
               slows to normal he opens his eyes sighs contentedly looks 
               down

               his pov

               by the sprawled legs of boyle lie various objects that spilled 
               from his pants pocket  coins a comb a big pocketknife

               dr lecter

               picks up the pocketknife examines it happily about a four
               inch blade he becomes aware of the whimpering off screen 
               turns

               low angle on pembry

               as he crawls with torturous slowness towards the command 
               desk and the phone he is crying but frantically determined

               pembrys pov  partially blurred then clearing

               above the desk hanging from pegs are his and boyles 
               holstered revolvers

                                                                    cut to

               the bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards 5 then 
               indicates a stop there at the top floor

               favoring sgt tate

               at his command desk as he stares at the indicator another 
               cop jacobs sits on the desks edge flipping through a 
               magazine many more cops can be seen beyond them idling in 
               the lobby

               echo down the nearby stairwell sgt tate jumps to his feet 
               grabs a radio mike as the other cops stir confused and

               which is already cocked using both hands he is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger when we hear his door buzzer 
               surprisingly loud and close by he turns startled and sees 

               dusty black metal box

               the extension buzzer mounted high on the wall which is 
               making the hideous grating jangle it finally stops but 
               not before waking precious who starts frantically barking 
               off screen as 

               mr gumb

               raises his gun again spinning back towards 

               his pov  the pit bottom

               where catherine hearing but still not seeing him quickly 
               yanks the futon over both herself and the dog instantly the 
               two of them become one squirming indistinguishable mass

               mr gumb

               bites his lip his aim wavering as he cant decide where to 
               safely place his shot the maddening buzzer sounds again 
               even more insistently and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury but as the buzzer continues he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun looking up angrily towards his front door

                                                                    cut to

               then she turns does see it and her eyes freeze a beat of 
               pure fear a tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm

               clarices own rapid breathing then she crouches 

               lower angle  bursts forward through the doorframe 
               sidestepping

               a small refrigerator

               with its thermostat just switching on

               clarice

               gasps for breath fighting for calm she turns again slashing 
               her free hand at the moths moving quickly on

               clarice moves past the mannequins all of them naked now 
               then quickly past the huge chinese armoire ready to shoot 
               into it its doors yawn open it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers she moves on past the big sink with its 
               dripping faucet the counter with its gleaming knives 
               the rows of chemical jars at the end of this room is

               a closed door

               clarice starts to open it then hesitates looking around 
               she seizes a wooden chair wedges it under the door know 
               sealing off this section of the cellar with her back thus 
               defended she turns softly retracing her steps

                                                                    cut to

               passing again through the workroom clarice pauses seeing a 
               halfcurtained door to one side that she had previously 
               skirted she crosses to the door listens and hears no sound 
               inside takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob she 
               twists it and as it turns shoves hard and follows her gun 
               inside all in one quick move

                                                                    cut to

               from an oval ring hides whatever might be inside

               clarice

               centers her gun on the curtain at chest height and yanks 
               it aside with her left hand no one standing there something 
               lower down catches her eye

               she leans in stares more closely not understanding at 
               first that shes seeing 

               female hand and wrist

               sticking up from the tub which is filled with hard redpurple 
               plaster the hand is dark and shriveled with pink nail polish 
               and a dainty wristwatch as 

               clarice

               is reacting with horror to this sight the lights go out to 
               be replaced a splitsecond later by the eerie green glow 
               of mr gumbs infrared system clarice cries out turns 
               blindly reaching for the door cant find it free hand 
               clawing desperately into what is for her utter darkness 
               sound of catherine keening again in the far distance clarice 
               stumbles goes to her knees rights herself finally clutches 
               the door frame

                                                                    cut to

               clarice emerges from the bathroom in a halfcrouch arms 
               out both hands on the gun extended just below the level of 
               her unseeing eyes she stops listens in her rawnerved 
               darkness every sound is unnaturally magnified  the hum of 
               the refrigerator the trickle of water her own terrified 
               breathing and catherines faraway echoing sobs moths 
               smack against her face and arms she eases forward then 
               stops again listens she eases forward again following 
               her gun and creeps directly in front of and then past 

               mr gumb

               who has flattened himself against a wall arms spread like a 
               high priest colt in one hand he wears his goggles and 
               kimono and under that  draping down over his naked arms 
               like some hideous mantle  his terrifying halfcompleted 
               suit of human skins this is an exquisite moment for him  a 
               ritual of supreme exaltation he smiles at clarice as 
               completely unaware she moves beyond him exposing her back 
               very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her taking his 
               gun in both hands aiming

               close on

               the colt python as  in slow motion  his thumbs cock the 
               hammer the sound registering as a loud metallic click and 

               clarice

               spins still in slow motion flame already leaping from her 
               gun muzzle as we see 

               the two figures

               almost at pointblack range guns roaring hugely one flash 
               from mr gumb and one two three four flashes from clarice 
               overlapping his and then as the echoes crash deafeningly 

               close on clarice  low angle 

               with normal speed restored as the side of her face hits the 
               floor and she is gasping stunned by the noise and flames 
               there is blood on her check and an ugly powder burn but 
               she ignores them twisting to yank her speedloader from her 
               jacket pocket locking it blindly onto her guns cylinder 
               reloading right in front of her face then rolling onto her 
               stomach aiming her gun upward again blinking her dazzled 
               eyes straining to locate him in the darkness where is 
               he where then as the echoes finally fade she hears 
               something else  a tortured sucking whistle from perhaps 
               eight feet away

               moving angle  with clarice

               as she crawls forward on her elbows following her gun 
               until it bumps against mr gumbs shoulder he is lying on 
               his back chest a bloody mess she slides her muzzle against 
               his head hard but he doesnt move another shot isnt 
               needed he stares upwards through his goggles bloody lips 
               working he tries to speak but cannot one hand reaches 
               slowly upwards the fingers twitching as if to seize 
               something overhead then a final ghastly groan his hand 
               drops he is dead clarice feels for a pulse at his neck 
               making sure then and only then does she permit herself to 
               roll over collapsing onto her back beside him

               overhead angle

               down at the two faces  intimately close together like lovers 
               on their pillow then as we pull slowly away we see that 
               her staring eyes and his dead gaze are both locked onto 

               a deathshead moth 

               perched on an infrared bulb overhead its wings pumping 
               slowly

               sound upcut  wailing sirens many excited voices as we

                                                               dissolve to

               vans and even a firetruck choke the street cops reporters 
               ems workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective 
               barricades the buzz of their voices goes even higher as

               clarice

               dazed her face bandaged  comes out of the house walking 
               protectively beside catherine who is wheeled on a gurney

               they are followed out by uniformed cops then two firemen 
               with an extension ladder catherine blinking in confusion 
               is still clutching the little dog and refuses to give her 
               up even as shes trundled into an ambulance clarice sways 
               with exhaustion everyone seems to be shouting at her at 
               once pulling her sleeve she tries to fight free of them 
               desperate for a familiar face

               an ohio highway patrol car

               pulls up stops and crawford climbs out of the back seat 
               he makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies 
               stopping when he sees clarice

               they look at one another

               for a long moment crawford choked with pride for her with 
               sorrow for her ordeal with love but unable to find any 
               words and then he does

                                     crawford
                         starling your father sees you

               and then all at once she is sobbing her knees giving way 
               but he is there to catch her he is hugging her fiercely 
               hold on them for a long beat

               but only a dial tone comes from the phone she is still 
               staring at her receiver in shock as we 

                                                               cut back to

               ext the moonlit patio

               dr lecter sighs sets his phone down then rises popping 
               an orange section into his mouth he turns towards the 
               brightly lit house stepping delicately over the sprawled 
               body of a uniformed security guard he walks in through open 
               french doors

                                                                    cut to

               int a booklined study

               in a swivel chair amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books is the writhing figure of dr frederick chilton the 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls dr lecters own 
               former restraints his screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth he stares at dr lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights

               dr lecter

               considers him for a genial moment then raises the little 
               penknife his eyes are twinkling

                                     dr lecter
                         well dr chilton shall we begin
