               int basement  evening

               a naked lightbulb sparks to life it dangles from the ceiling 
               of a basement

               light quick footsteps as anna crowe moves down the stairs

               anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence she 
               stands in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress 
               that outlines her slender body her gentle eyes move across 
               the empty room and come to rest on a rack of wine bottles 
               covering one entire wall

               she walks to the bottles her fingertips slide over the 
               labels she stops when she finds just the right one a tiny 
               smile as she slides it out

               anna turns to leave stops she stares at the shadowy 
               basement its an unsettling place she stands very still 
               and watches her breath form a tiny cloud in the cold air

               shes visibly uncomfortable

               anna crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry each step 
               faster than the next she climbs out of the basement in 
               another burst of light quick footsteps

               we hear her hit the light switch

               the lightbulb dies dripping black devours the room

                                                                    cut to

               table takeout chinese food sits half eaten on good china

               an empty bottle of red wine sits between boxes of chinese 
               food

               anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a 
               sweater she hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to 
               malcolm

               anna giggles some more as malcolms shadow stumbles across 
               the bedroom

               malcolm turns on the bathroom light

               a shaft of light falls on anna as she stands in the corner 
               of the room

               anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater she sways 
               to a pretend striptease song

               malcolm cant hold back his grin he joins in  slowly 
               peeling off the sweatshirt he looks back to anna shes 
               stopped her playful dance shes facing away from him

               he walks towards her his grin quietly disappears malcolms 
               face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the shattered 
               window in their bedroom the wind moves through the room

               a lamp lays broken on the ground by the window

               malcolm kneels down beat annas eyes fill with a quiet 
               awareness

                                     anna
                         hes still in the house

               malcolm slowly starts towards the door the first thing that 
               comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor

               then the figure of a man comes into view a stranger stands 
               bare chested in the back of the bathroom

               malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone 
               homes across the street he gazes blankly at the brownstones

               beat

               a door opens malcolm is brought out of his trance

               cole sear steps out his front door cole is a munchkin of a 
               boy with large black eyes that seem to take in everything 
               around him

               his hair is dark with a small patch of jet white on the 
               side cole carefully locks the door behind him

               he moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around 
               nervously anxiously

               the eightyearold child reaches into his pocket and slips 
               on a pair of very large glasses they look comical on him

               malcolm rises to his feet he smooths out his shirt looks 
               down and buttons his jacket

               when he looks up cole is gone

               malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy cole runs at 
               full speed down the street and turns the corner tiny sneakers 
               screeching on the sidewalk

               for a second malcolm doesnt react the second passes he 
               stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too

                                                                    cut to

               malcolm hauls down the sidewalk he comes to a hard stop at 
               a street intersection searches spots cole running into a 
               parking lot

               cole sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a 
               building he has to use all his strength to push open the 
               highly ornate doors he slips inside

               malcolm jogs into the parking area his pace slows to a walk 
               and then to stillness as he gazes up at the building

               its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the 
               modern buildings all around it malcolm stares up at the 
               historic philadelphia church quietly

               a shooting pain pierces his side malcolms hand goes to it 
               quickly

               he waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate doors

                                                                    cut to

               int church  day

               only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews

               malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what hes looking 
               for in the last row of the church

               he moves down the center aisle towards the back

               malcolm finds cole playing in his pew with a set of green 
               and beige plastic soldiers cole makes the soldiers talk to 
               each other

                                     cole

                         pro fun add

               the words are unintelligible

               cole senses someone he looks up and sees malcolm staring at 
               him the boy immediately goes white every cell of his body 
               still with fear

                                     malcolm
                         its okay cole dont be frightened

               cole stays rigid hands clutching a handful of plastic 
               riflemen

                                     malcolm

               malcolm waits for a response none comes

                         while just so i wont forget it

               beat cole slowly slides down the pew giving malcolm most 
               of the seat malcolm sits

               cole fidgets with his soldiers beat malcolm looks over and 
               stares at coles glasses he leans forward to inspect them 
               more carefully

                                     malcolm

               he takes it in silently

               his eyes move to her face one wisp of hair falls over her 
               soft lips outlined in the soft reading light anna crowe 
               truly looks like an angel

               sits in the corner next to the wine racks

               the room still feels unsettling

               malcolm hunches over one of the books rifles through a stack 
               of dusty books pulls out a thick text

               the spine of the text reads the meridian latin dictionary

               malcolm sits back at his desk and opens coles file

               handwritten on the first page are the words de profundis 
               calms ad te domine

               malcolm starts working through the latin text as he comes 
               to each word he jots it down underneath the latin

               malcolm translates the last word

               he stares quietly at the paper the new words reads

               the words seem to hang in the air forever

               many candlelit tables he finds anna

               anna sits alone at a corner table the remains of her half
               eaten dinner lay on the only place setting on the table a 
               small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched

               anna stirs sugar in her coffee as malcolm sits in the seat 
               across from her she gently stops stirring but doesnt look 
               up beat

                         there are cuts on coles arms 
                         fingernail marks i think looks 
                         like defensive cuts

               malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his 
               face

                         be a child climbing a lot of trees

               malcolm loses himself in his thoughts the waiter drops off 
               the check on the table anna grabs it before malcolm and 
               quickly signs it

                                     malcolm

                         i cant let it slip away

               anna waits till hes done and rises from the table she pushes 
               her chair in hard and walks away without a word

               malcolm sits alone and stares at the piece of cake with a 
               candle on it

               mr marschal leans over his gate and stares at cole for a 
               few seconds

               mr marschal smiles at cole before walking back inside his 
               house

                                     cole

                                     cole
                              whispers
                         she died a long time ago

                                                                    cut to

               int mr marschals living room  morning

               this brownstone has been home to the marschals for many 
               many years its filled with a lifetime of memories

               memories shared by two people

               two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that 
               overlook the street a corner table displays fancy wooden 
               chess set the game halffinished frozen in a layer of 
               dust

               an easel stands before a piano the incomplete water color 
               painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano 
               bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper

               malcolm takes in the living room silently he stands near 
               the open door

               cole walks through the room tiny eyes searching carefully

               he leans behind the sofa looking for something malcolm 
               watches cole with a crinkled brow

               cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall

                                     mr marschal
                         maybe jill will play for us when she 
                         gets back

               cole turns to find mr marschal standing with a glass of 
               lemonade cole takes it from his shaking hands

                                     cole
                         thank you

               mr marschal shuffles over to the sofa takes a seat

               cole begins surveying the room again beat his eyes finally 
               come to rest on a plant seated in the corner he stares at 
               it the leaves of the plant shake slightly from a breeze

               cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the 
               plant cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant 
               aside the pot screeches on the wooden floor

               malcolm calls to cole under his breath

                                     malcolm
                         cole

                                     mr marschal
                         whats going on there

               mr marschal strains to see across the room

               cole doesnt answer either of them instead he continues to 
               push the plant aside revealing an air vent cole gently 
               reaches over and takes off the metal face it slips right 
               off

               coles hands disappear into the darkness of the vent they 
               reemerge holding a stack of notebooks

               malcolm becomes very still

               cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to mr 
               marschal cole carefully places them on his lap

                                     mr marschal
                         is this for me

               mr marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick 
               glasses hanging from his neck he places them on the tip of 
               his nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face

                                     mr marschal
                         whats this jills keeping a diary

               malcolm takes an involuntary step forward

               mr marschal starts flipping through the notebooks

                                     mr marschal
                         shes full of surprises

               he gets to the last book his hands become still as he stares 
               at the final page of writing

                                     mr marschal
                              whispers
                         she hasnt written anything for some 
                         time

               beat mr marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks looks 
               up to cole cole just stands quietly

               mr marschals eyes slowly fill with tears of realization 
               they gently spill down his weathered face

                                     mr marschal
                         oh no

               cole takes a deep breath trying hard not to cry himself

               the sight of mr marschal weeping shakes cole

               cole softly lays his hand on mr marschals silver hair

               mr marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand

               they stay like that for a while beat mr marschal lets go 
               and brings the notebooks tighter to his body

               cole quietly walks to malcolm who stands motionless he stares 
               down at cole in a daze

               cole turns his head crying

                                     cole
                              softly
                         stop looking at me

                                                                    cut to

               to his mouth

               int brownstone  night

               lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with 
               the thermostat in the hall the house is cold lynn wears a 
               winter jacket in the house

               lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway no lights

               the house seems somewhat ominous beat

               lynns eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw 
               something

               she stares in the doorway until a sound turns her in the 
               direction of the family room

               she picks up balledup boys sweat socks and dirty tshirts 
               laying on the carpet when she reaches the end of the hall 
               she hits a light switch the hall lights up revealing a wall 
               of photos lynn forms a tiny smile

               snapshots of cole and lynns life hang before her eyes

               coles birthday parties lynn and cole at an amusement 
               park

               cole under the christmas tree cole on lynns shoulders in 
               a pool cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue

               lynn takes a step forward lynns face betrays the fact that 
               she notices something she never noticed before she touches 
               a photo of threeyearold cole

               we move into the photo  coles face smiles at us lynns 
               finger gently brushes a thin streaks of light that curves in 
               the background behind cole the streak of light is blurred 
               like something caught in motion

               lynn looks to the adjacent photo  the barbecue photo 

               everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas lynn searches the 
               picture her eyes suddenly stop at the tiniest blur of white 
               light streaking around cole

               we move from framed photo to framed photo  each the same  
               somewhere hidden in the frame somewhere not easily seen 
               lynn finds a blur

               lynn takes it all in curiously

                                                                    cut to

               int coles bedroom  afternoon

               lynn moves into coles room with the laundry basket balanced 
               on her hip the walkman headphones on her head blares a 
               muffled techno dance beat lynn starts picking clothes up 
               around coles room

               this bedroom is an eerie place the shadows seem to make 
               shapes and figures all the furniture is wood  old 
               fashioned the lamps the paintings on the wall  antiques 
               as well

               the most striking feature of the room however is the 
               homemade tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to 
               chairs and bureaus it takes up a large corner of the room

               a sign hangs over the bedsheets

                                      do not enter

               lynn grabs the spiderman pjs that drape over the tent

               a german shepherd puppy sleeps on the pillow sebastian lifts 
               his head sleepily and peers at lynn before returning to his 
               slumber

               lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from 
               under coles pillow slides it out its a vacation photo 
               of a couple lynn and cole and a man the man looks in every 
               way a larger version of cole

               the picture has a visible effect on lynn she lets out a 
               shaky breath before returning the photo to its hiding place

               lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden 
               roll cover desk next to the bed

               the desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with 
               writings

               lynns eyes are drawn to the papers

               her curious gaze turns serious her mouth opens a tiny bit 
               involuntarily

               the papers are strewn with lines of handwriting countless 
               lines thousands of words some horizontal some vertical

               the writing moves in arcs and flows in various size  written 
               at great speed  every word connected by a single pen stroke  
               everything written in one continuous motion

               lynn slowly spins the papers taking in some of the phrases

               christ break the freaking glass oh no god no what the 
               hell is going on quiet the damn baby ill cut you i swear it 
               someone stop the burning ill kill you ill kill all you 
               bastard the words go on and on

               lynn removes her hands from the paper she pulls her 
               headphones off slowly

               the muffled techno dance beat fills the dead silence of the 
               eerie room

                                                                    cut to

               cole is playing behind the couch all we see is the top of 
               his head

                                     malcolm
                         sometimes we dont even know it 
                         but we do things to draw attention 
                         do things so we can express how we 
                         feel about issues divorce or 
                         whatever

               every now and then we get glimpses of things cole is playing 
               with peeking over the back of the couch but we cant quite 
               make out what hes doing

                                     malcolm
                         one night as an example leave 
                         something on a desk for someone to 
                         find

               the top of coles head stops moving

                                     malcolm
                         cole have you ever heard of something 
                         called freewriting or 
                         freeassociation writing

               cole shakes his head no

                                     malcolm
                         its when you put a pencil in your 
                         hand and put the pencil to a paper 
                         and you just start writing you 
                         dont think about what youre 
                         writing you dont read over what 
                         youre writing you just keep your

                         after awhile if you keep your hand 
                         moving long enough words and thoughts

                         can you do something for me

               malcolm smiles he rises and grabs his coat

                                     malcolm
                         think about what you want from our 
                         time together what our goal should

                         life anything at all what would 
                         you like that to be

               coles brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully

                                     malcolm
                         you dont have to answer now

               malcolm heads for the door stops when cole emerges from 
               behind the couch cole is wearing his fathers jacket it 
               hangs to the ground like a dress

                                     cole
                         instead of something i want can i 
                         have something i dont want

               coles sad eyes stare up at malcolm

               the surface of malcolms desk is covered with open texts

               malcolm pours over a thick reference book

               he circles a phrase

               resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may in 
               fact be selfinflicted

               malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through 
               his head

               annas muffled voice carries down the stairs

               his face turns up to the ceiling

                                     malcolm
                              loud

               stretches his legs

               malcolm moves to the narrow basement window

               intext malcolms house  day

               we see sean an attractive young man in his late twenties

               he gets into his car across the street he just sits there 
               for a moment before putting his forehead to the steering 
               wheel

               malcolm turns away from the window as seans car starts up 
               and pulls away from malcolms house

                                                                    cut to

               a question on the board

                                     mr cunningham

                         america from 1790 to 1800

               mr cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and 
               nine year old private school students they stare back at 
               him blankly

               cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with 
               big eyes

                                     mr cunningham

                         philadelphia

                         before i went to this school even

               stanley cunningham looks over the class of blank faces

               hes just about to answer his own question when he sees a 
               hand go up

               mr cunningham looks surprised to see who it is

                                     mr cunningham
                         yes cole

               tommy tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering

               cole glances up sees all the eyes on him he glances at the 
               teacher who is still staring

                                     cole

               mr cunningham sees the traumatized expression on coles 
               face and instantly stops smiling

                                     mr cunningham

               malcolm and anna are slow dancing theyre whispering and 
               laughing with each other

               the happiness from them is tangible

               malcolm cant help smiling as he stares at the flickering 
               images

               he turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom

                                                                    cut to

                                                                    cut to

               shower

               anna stands still her head tilted back

               malcolm watches quietly by his experience its clear hes 
               taken by his wifes beauty

               malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to 
               the sink malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble 
               surface

               he reaches out and picks it up the label on the plastic 
               bottle reads

               zoloft antidepressant 
               to be taken twice daily

               malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle he gazes at the 
               still figure of his wife as the water covers her

               malcolm leaves the bathroom he makes sure not to make a 
               noise with the door as he closes it shut

               lynn drowns in her thoughts cole moves away from the kitchen 
               with sad eyes

                                                                    cut to

               cole walks past two expensivelydressed mothers eating hors 
               doeuvres as they move down the hallway

                                     mrs weston

                         it tasted like cheese whiz

               they pass when cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood 
               hallway

               the womens conversation fades away behind him

               cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop he turns white 
               as he stares at an open crawl space closet a few feet away

               coles eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet beat

               the hallway erupts with noise as the children run in from 
               the backyard

               birthday boy darren a skinny kid in a party hat

                         your character alone

               tommy glances down the hall and sees cole standing frozen 
               staring at the crawl space closet

               tommy grabs darren

               darren and tommy look at each other and then back at the 
               crawl space door

               then the screaming begins

               terror at the top of his lungs he crashes over and over 
               against the door his body slamming against the wood the 
               door rattles like its going to break off its hinges

               the two boys are statues as coles bloodchilling yells fill 
               the hallway

               footsteps spike the air as children and mothers come running 
               down the hall lynn is one of them

               darrens mother turns the corner

                                     darrens mother

               lynn closes her eyes lets out a tense breath beat

               malcolm eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic 
               looking woman standing at the reception room door

                                     malcolm

                              raising voice

               dr hill gets up

                         very wrong

               dr hill hands his files to mrs sloan and exits the reception 
               room without looking back

               everyone in the reception room stares at lynn mrs sloan

               cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards 
               home

               suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield its a 
               page from a playbill a 1941 playbill it flies away revealing 
               a woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40s suddenly 
               walks into the middle of the street as the pages of her 
               playbill swirl in the air

               lynn slams the brakes too late

               the woman smashes into the front grill of the car her 
               terrorstricken face comes over the hood and crashes right 
               through the windshield in a shower of blood and glass

               cole screams lynn screams the car screeches to a stop in 
               the middle of a congested intersection

               the line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and 
               swerve to one side avoiding a mass collision after a few 
               seconds the entire intersection has come to a halt

               cole who has shut his eyes slowly opens them

               he looks around fearfully his eyes move to the windshield

               no broken glass no blood and no woman cole looks out 
               through the pristine windshield onto the street where cars 
               are stopped and staring all around them

               cole slowly looks over to his mother he finds her staring 
               at him in complete and utter disbelief her hands clutch the 
               wheel the whites of her knuckles showing her fear

               she has no idea why he screamed

               door closes and the silence

               nothing happens for a long time and then we hear a sudden 
               chair screech across the floor vincents breathing quickens 
               a slight static starts to filter in on the tape

               malcolms eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it 
               spins in the player

               malcolms fingers move to the volume dial he turns it way 
               up the static noise from the tape fills the basement

               malcolm leans closer to the tape player closes his eyes and 
               listens beat

               deep in the static another sound emerges whispering

               a mans voice is heard in the room with vincent

                                     mans whispering

               malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk he stares into the 
               bay window of mr marschals brownstone

               inside the window we see mr marschal seated with a group of 
               older gentlemen his age they sit around a table eating 
               sandwiches and talking malcolm watches as mr marschal tells 
               a story to his friends we cant hear what hes saying but 
               when he finishes everyone at the table laughs mr marschal 
               smiles

               malcolm cant help smiling as well this is not the same man 
               he saw before life has returned to this house beat

               malcolm turns and moves down the street each step faster 
               than the next

                                                                    cut to

               his eyes scan the empty seats no one in sight in any 
               direction

               malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath he holds 
               his hand to his side as he winces a bit

               handle begins to pull the sword starts to come out

               the villagers gasp

               merlin and everyone on stage bows a silence fills the 
               auditorium

               the villagers rise and rush to cole they scoop him up and 
               carry him around the stage in celebration cole chuckles and 
               then starts laughing as the group of eightyearolds try 
               unsuccessfully to keep him up they slowly sag and then 
               collapse all the students are laughing as they try to 
               untangle themselves

               malcolm watches with utter joy as cole becomes 
               indistinguishable among of a group of twenty children giggling 
               and enjoying themselves on stage

                                                                    cut to

               door

               malcolm doesnt know what the hells going on his eyes 
               are drawn to the dining table only one place setting is
