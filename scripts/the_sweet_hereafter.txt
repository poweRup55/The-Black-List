		time but its important that we
		talk

				wanda

				mitchell
		im a lawyer

				wanda
		you cant come here

				mitchell
		please let me explain  ill only

	int the ottos house  day

	mitchell walks into the otto residence  it is a large two
	storey space divided into several smaller chambers with
	sheets of brightly colored cloth  tiedyes and indian
	madras  that hang from wires

	on a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is
	a large woodburning stove  a few feet from the stove
	sitting on an overstuffed cushion is hartley otto

	hartley is listening to music on his headphones  he is very
	stoned  wanda moves over and pulls the headphones off her
	husbands head

				wanda
		we have a guest  what did you say
		your name was

				mitchell
 






		mitchell stephens

	mitchell hands them a card  hartley reads it with
	deliberation

				wanda
		the walkers sent him by

	hartley rises up  he stares at mitchell  a tense pause

				hartley
		you want a cup of tea or something

				mitchell
		a cup of tea would be nice
				beat
		would it be alright if i sit down
		for a few minutes mrs otto  i
		want to talk to you

	wanda stares at mitchell  no response  mitchell waits a
	beat then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large
	pillow  he is unsure whether to cross his legs or fold
	them under his chin

				mitchell contd
		the walkers spoke very highly of
		you

				wanda
		youve been retained

				mitchell
		yes

				wanda
		their child died and they got a
		lawyer

	pause  mitchell assesses wandas energy

				mitchell
		it should be said that my task is to
		represent the walkers only in their
		anger  not their grief

				wanda
		who did they get for that

				mitchell
		you are angry arent you mrs
		otto  thats why im here  to give
		your anger a voice  to be your
 






		weapon against whoever caused that
		bus to go off the road

				wanda
		dolores

				mitchell
		its my belief that dolores was
		doing exactly what shed been doing
		for years  besides the school
		boards insurance on dolores is
		minimal  a few million at the very
		most  the really deep pockets are
		to be found in the town or in the
		company that made the bus

				wanda
		you think someone else caused the
		accident

				mitchell
		mrs  otto  there is no such thing
		as an accident  the word doesnt
		mean anything to me  as far as im
		concerned somebody somewhere made a
		decision to cut a corner  some
		corrupt agency or corporation
		accounted the cost variance between
		a tencent bolt and a million dollar
		outofcourt settlement  they
		decided to sacrifice a few lives for
		the difference  thats whats done
		mrs otto  ive seen it happen so
		many times before

	hartley returns with the tea

				hartley
		but dolores said she saw a dog and
		tried to

				mitchell
		how long has dolores been driving
		that bus mr otto  how many times
		has she steered clear of danger
		what went wrong that morning

	mitchell takes the cup of tea

				mitchell contd
		someone calculated ahead of time
		what it would cost to sacrifice
		safety  its the darkest most
		cynical thing to imagine but its
 






		absolutely true  and now its up
		to me to make them build that bus
		with an extra bolt or add an extra
		yard of guard rail  its the only
		way we can ensure moral
		responsibility in this society  by
		what i do

	pause

				wanda
		so youre just the thing we need

				mitchell
		excuse me

				wanda
		isnt that what you want us to
		believe  that were completely
		defenseless  that you know whats
		best

				mitchell
		listen to me mrs otto  listen very
		carefully  i do know whats best

		as were sitting here the town or
		the school board or the manufacturer
		of that bus are lining up a battery
		of their own lawyers to negotiate
		with people as griefstricken as
		yourselves  and this makes me very
		very mad  its why i came all the
		way up here  if everyone had done
		their job with integrity your son
		would be alive this morning and
		safely in school  i promise you
		that i will pursue and reveal who it
		was that did not do their job

				mitchell
		who is responsible for this tragedy
		then in your name and the walkers
		name and the name of whoever decides
		to join us i shall sue  i shall
		sue for negligence until they bleed

	pause

				wanda
		i want that person to go to jail
		for the rest of his life  i want
		him to die there  i dont want his
		money
 







	mitchell nods sympathetically

				mitchell
		its unlikely that anyone will go to
		prison mrs otto  but he or his
		company will pay in other ways  and
		we must make them pay  not for the

		money or to compensate you for the
		loss of your son  that cant be
		done  but to protect other innocent
		children  you see im not just
		here to speak for your anger but
		for the future as well
				beat
		what were talking about is an
		ongoing relationship to time

	pause  hartley looks at mitchells teacup

				hartley
		i didnt ask if you wanted milk

				mitchell
		no  a little sugar though

				hartley
		weve only got honey

				mitchell
		illtake it straight

	mitchell maintains his eye contact with wanda

				wanda
		are you expensive

				mitchell
		no

				mitchell
		if you agree to have me represent
		you in this suit i will require no
		payment until after the case is won
		when i will require one third of the
		awarded amount  if there is no
		award made then my services will
		cost you nothing  its a standard
		agreement

				wanda
		do you have this agreement with you
 






				mitchell
		its in my car

	mitchell gets up

		should discuss this all without me

				dolores
		i told you that i was doing fifty
		miles an hour when the accident
		happened  thats how i remembered

		and if thats true that i was over
		the limit when the bus went over

				dolores
		anything you didnt understand

				mitchell
		there might have been a word or two

				dolores
		abbott said that the true jury of a

		town  only they the people who
		have known her all her life and not
		twelve strangers can decide her
		guilt or innocence  and if i have
		committed a crime then its a crime
