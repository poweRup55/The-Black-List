	silence  gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
	audible  a low angle bounded on one side by a chainlink
	fence and on the other by the onestory public school build
	ings  spraycan hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha
	dows  this is a los angeles public school in a blue collar
	neighborhood

	angle between school buildings where a trash dumpster looms
	in a low angle part of the clutter behind the gymnasium
	a cat enters frame  camera dollies forward prowling with
	him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows

	close on cat which freezes alert sensing something just
	beyond human perception

	a sourceless wind rises and with it a keening whine
	papers blow across the pavement
	the cat yowls and hides under the dumpster
	windows rattle in their frames
	the whine intensifies accompanied now by a wash of frigid
	purple light  a concussion like a thunderclap right over
	head blows in all the windows facing the yard

	cu  cat its eyes are wide as the glare dies

	slow pan as the sound of stray electrical crackling subsides
	frame comes to rest on the figure of a naked man kneeling
	faced away in the previously empty yard
	he stands slowly
	the man is in his late thirties tall and powerfully built
	moving with graceful precision

	cu  man his facial features reiterate the power of his
	body and are dominated by the eyes which are intense blue
	and depthless  his hair is military short

	this man is the terminator

	he glances down taking calm inventory of himself and
	notices that a fine white ash covers his skin  he brushes
	at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence scanning
	his surroundings

	camera moves up as terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
	beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
	cityscape below  the school is perched at the edge of a pro
	montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem
	ing and glistening under a sullen sky  the night clouds are
	shot through with occasional flashes of lightning presaging
	a thunderstorm

	terminator stands hands on hips in prefect symmetry gazing
	down at the city as the camera reaches full height

	a beer bottle smashes on the ground  pull back to include
	its exowner and his two compatriots youth gang members
	lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground  they

	walks naked into a pool of streetlight striding purpose
	fully toward them

	angle  over terminators shoulder as he approaches them
	they slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground

						terminator
				your clothes  give them to me

	the punks exchange glances dismayed

						terminator
					coldly

						second punk

				fuck you asshole

	without warning terminator hammerpunches him in the temple
	with blinding speed  the blow flings him with a clang into
	the jungle gym  he drops to the ground in a still heap
	eyes open twitching

	the leader whips out his switchblade and slashes in one
	motion  terminator ducks back and catches the knife
	wielders wrist in an inhuman grip  then he punches the
	leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone

	angle  pavement as the knife clatters down  the punks
	combat boots are on tiptoe barely touching the ground

	angle  two shot terminator and the leader are close
	together as if dancing but motionless  their bodies are in
	total shadow  the punks eyes are wide his veins distended
	with an agonizing pressure  terminator jerks his fist back
	with a wet sound and the other drops out of frame

	the last tough is stumbling away gaping with terror  he
	backs into a chainlink fence turns to run along it finds
	he is in a corner

	terminator takes a step toward him his gaze ominous

	the punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes
	thunder peals overhead

	a light rain begins to fall

 5	  ext downtown streetalley  night				 5

	another part of the city  seedy apartments and storefronts
	the streets glisten hissing with sporadic late night traffic
	slow pan and dolly into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
	with trash containers and fire escapes  from a recessed
	doorway two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement
	an angry inarticulate drunkards monologue rises occasionally
	above the rain sounds

	angle  doorway  the derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
	as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
	around him  a shockwave hurls trash into the air
	painted over windows shatter
	rat scurry blinded

	a figure drops into frame as if out of the sky and smacks
	the pavement with a muddy splash

	cu  derelict as he blinks at the fading glare amazed

	a naked man compact and muscular rises in a defensive
	crouch  kyle reese is 22 but his face has been aged by
	ordeal the mouth hard eyes grim  a crinkled burn scar
	traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead  other
	scars from burns and bullets mar his hardmuscled body

	the rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
	as electrical arcs lace back and forth between the fire
	escapes behind him hissing and sputtering  the sound
	fades then stops altogether to be replaced by a rising
	scream of animal agony

	reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley

	camera moves with reese as he leaps to the fire escape and
	clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
	naked man who appears to be entangled in the ironwork  the
	man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
	gasp  closer angle reveals that he has been skewered through
	the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
	shoulder by a railing  he has materialized in the same
	space occupied by the fire escape structure  the figure
	slumps motionless

	reese quickly checks for signs of life  the man is dead

	reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
	huddled in the doorway

	a pair of flamboyantly dressed women obviously working
	girls passes by the alley mouth  they do a double take
	when they see reese but walk on without breaking stride
	completely jaded  hes certainly not a potential customer

	walk between the two huge mechanisms sarah clambers over
	an innocuous control panel
	her knee inadvertently hits a red push button
	with a roar the stampingplate of a hydraulic press slams
	down an inch from her hand
	startled she tumbles to the catwalk

	the terminators eyes swivel as he hears the single non
	rhythmic sound

	kyle and sarah run to the end of the catwalk but find the
	door there locked

						sarah
				come on

	they double back to escape the culdesac  the terminator
	steps in front of them cutting them off

						reese
					shouting
				run

	he pushes sarah roughly and she stumbles away
	kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the terminator
	advances

						reese
					over his
					shoulder
				  run damn it

	she hesitates backing away
	the cyborg swings at reese
	steel clangs on steel
	kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back

	angle on catwalk as kyle lands in a heap smashed against
	a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
	the factory floor twenty feet below

	sarah turns and runs

	low angle past reese fg as the cyborg approaches him

	ecu  a fuse burning

	cu  kyles face streaked with blood pressed to the
	floor as a metal foot clangs down fg   his eyes snap open

	sarah falls gets up runs on
	the terminator draws back for a death blow
	and kyle rolls with the last of his strength raising
	the pipe bomb he has been cradling  he jams it between two
	hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborgs armored  rib
	cage  then rolls off the catwalk  terminator has an instant
	to react reaching for the bomb before it explodes

	sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
	floor
	slams up against one wall
	a withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her
	pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory rain
	ing down

	cu  sarah very still  she winces and opens her eyes
	slowly looks up

	pov  sarah as the smoke clears  the terminator is gone
	unrecognizable clumps of burning debris lie scattered about
	looking down through the grating floor she sees kyles
	body
	low angle on kyle fg sarah on catwalk above  kyles eyes
	are halfopen  still  his face peaceful
	angle on one of the fires climbing some plastic tubing and
	triggering a sprinkler head  it begins to rain
	cu  sarah sitting up as the water runs over her
	she looks down  protruding from her right thigh is a twisted
	piece of metal  shrapnel  part of the cyborg  she pulls
	it out grimacing  her leg is broken

	it is a long time before she can gather the will to move

	sarahs pov  she sees a wall phone several yards away
	beyond the debris from the explosion
	she starts to crawl toward it
	she passes a large clump of debris fg

	angle on debris fx as it rolls over suddenly
	now recognizable as the terminators head and arms with
	half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
	metal

	it lunges for her

	sarah wants to scream this time from the depths of her
	soul but there is no scream only a dry shivering sob

	the terminator drags itself scraping over the floor steel
	fingers clutching

	sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away
	crawling in agony

	angle on conveyor belt as sarah flops from the catwalk
	onto the moving strip  she is carried into the intricate
	lattice of equipment  sarah rolls off weakly before going
	under a set of sorting rollers

	angle through machinery  on the terminator fx as it crawls
	after her dragging its body  it tracks her unerringly
	eyes glowing

	sarah moves deeper into the dark clashing jungle of machinery
	around her is a raindrenched tangle of cables pipes and
	unforgiving mechanisms of steel

	the terminator clambers through after her

	cu  sarah  water pours into her eyes as she catches
	sight of something  a familiar control box
	she drags herself toward it

	cu  the terminator fx  it spots her wedged in a tiny
	crawl space  no way out

	it crawls the last few feeteyes red in the dark
	hypnotized sarah watches the terminator reaching toward her
	she is jammed in a corner
	sarahs hand claws around to the front of the control panel
	seeking the red button

	ecu  her wet fingertips feel the button

	angle on the terminator fx his steel hand reaching out

	ecu  sarah her face inexplicably calm eyes steady in
	that infinite instant  she clenches her teeth to keep
	from screaming as she waits

	the terminators hand reaches for her throat to crush
	the life out of her and end its long mission

						sarah
					voice icy
				youreterminatedfucker

	ecu  button as her bloody finger stabs it down

	full shot showing how the cyborg has been led into the
	maw of the hydraulic press
	the stamping plate thunders down
	tons of mechanical pressure flatten the terminators head
	and body like tinfoil  the press screams jamming solid
	lightning snaps out in one brief blaze leaping to surround
	ing machinery arcing to sarahs wristwatch  all the
	terminators energy is released in one second

	angle on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates
	a pinpoint of red light dwindles and goes out
	tight on sarah shivering uncontrollably  the steel fingers
	are frozen an inch from her throat  she can only stare as
	water runs over her

	wide shot showing the gurney being rolled by two attendants

	several police officers are picking through the debris

	cover shot reveals sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
	parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station  all of
	its signs are in handlettered spanish  beyond lies an
	expanse of scrub desert  the sky scowls with an impending
	storm

	sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark
	complected attendant laconically fills her tank  she
	cradles the cassette recorder in her lap in the lee of
	her swollen belly
	she looks to be about six months along
	under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
	and the butt of a 357 revolver presses against her
	breast  she tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
	her way  a german shepherd sits in the back among taped
	boxes and suitcases

				should i tell you about your

				we had together we loved a
				lifetimes worth

	click  whir  sarah jumps at a sound nearby breaking
	her reverie  a small mexican boy has snapped her picture
	with a beatup polaroid camera  he holds it out to her
	speaking rapid spanish

						attendant
				he says you are very beautiful
				senora and he is ashamed to ask
				five american dollars for this
				picture but if he does not
				his father will beat him

						sarah
				thats a pretty good hustle
				kid  four  quatro

	the boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
	snapshot develop  it is a good photograph of her
	the wind lightly ruffling her hair expression thought
	ful slightly sad

	we recognize it as the one reese carried in 2029
	she slips it into her short pocket

						attendant
				mil trescientosfifteen dollars

	as she pays him distant thunder rolls
	the boy yells something in spanish as he runs off

						sarah
				what did he say

						attendant
					accented
				there is a storm coming in

	sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
	desert  heat lightning pulses in their depths

						sarah

	camera cranes up as she pulls away driving across the
	flat desert on a ribbon of highway  a brilliant flash
