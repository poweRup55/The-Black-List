               in the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the 
               united states national science foundation to gather data 
               concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent 
               of antarctica

                          the main compound of us outpost 31

               the interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways 
               passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and 
               compartments within the compound sturdy but prefabricated 
               materials have been used in its construction

               there is a laboratory an infirmary a kitchen and mess hall 
               a communications room and sleeping quarters other cubicles 
               are for storage and supplies

               the most spacious area of the building and the main center 
               of activity is the rec room of the many entrance ways to 
               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their 
               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment

               the below quarter houses the generator and still other 
               compartments for storage

               a long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the 
               dog kennel

               forward it closes getting larger its features becoming 
               more identifiable a vessel flipflopping out of control 
               its stern roaring with flame it passes its blue fire surging 
               into the screen

               a sound

               loud and strident a helicopter streaks across frame it 
               travels precariously close to the ground its chassis battered 
               and swayed by the wind

               int copter

               red dials beam on the faces of two men one carries a rifle 
               and searches the horizon with binoculars the other pilots 
               their unkempt faces their blazing eyes notate a wildness 
               they bark at each other in some scandinavian tongue two men 
               arguing like mad and desperate children

               the man with the binoculars sights something

               ext horizon  binoculars pov  a dog

               it turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards 
               to its rear then whirls and gallops off a gun blast kicks 
               up snow at its heels

               int copter

               another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his 
               prey the pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and 
               implores for better aim the craft swoops lower and the engine 
               is put into full throttle

               running feverishly up and over a hill of ice a weather

               a rifle blast kicks up more snow

               ext compound of us outpost 31

               a large almost snowcovered building not far from that a 
               tall meteorological balloon tower

               a scattering of several small shacks at varying distances 
               from the main compound the smaller hovels are connected by 
               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes multicolored 
               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions 
               to outdoor experiments

               a tractor and two helicopters sit idle covered with mounds 
               of continuously mounting snow

               two men norris and bennings

               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the 
               process of letting up a large red balloon childs a hefty 
               black man is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile 
               their beards are caked with ice it is winter and it is harsh

               the faint sound of the copter turns their attention

               the copter

               flying ever lower now the man with the gun leans dangerously 
               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost

               the men

               outside the compound look to one another incredulous

               the copter

               much too low now and chastised by the wind attempts a high
               speed landing directly on the heels of the sprinting dog  
               it bounces violently on the hardpacked surface

               once twice passing the dog

               a third bounce sends it skidding it flips its blades 
               snapping off like toothpicks it lands bellyup soundless 
               except for the whine of its engine

               the man with the gun rolls out before the explosion

               int main compound

               the half a dozen men playing cards monitoring equipment 
               listening to music  spring to their feet startled

               ext compound

               the dog reaches norris and bennings as they awkwardly wade 
               through the snow toward the downed copter

               the survivor

               of the crash his eyes crazed with determination struggles 
               to his feet heedless of his companion he doubletimes his 
               way to the men and the dog he reloads his gun and bellows 
               in his scandinavian tongue

               norris and bennings have no idea what he is saying

               the survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off screaming 
               as he does so his face now caked with blood

               the two men are bewildered the dog jumps up licking and 
               pawing them imploring for safety

               blam the visitor fires the men jump back in disbelief

               dogs hip sending it skidding and howling in pain

               as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the

               norris bundled in his sixtyfive pounds of clothing exits 
               the main compound he walks the prefab wooden planks up the 
               precipice his destination is someone a hundred yards up the 
               slope  to a shack he grabs onto the steadying ropes and 
               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet

               int macreadys shack  close on ice cubes

               being dumped into a glass followed by the pouring of whiskey  
               an electronic voice is heard

                                     voice
                         bishop to knight four

               macready takes a sip of his drink makes his way over to his 
               electronic chess game a large mexican sombrero hangs on his 
               back he is tall about thirtyfive his shack is sparse but 
               unkempt a few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by 
               an occasional poster of some mediterranean or south american 
               paradise

               the chess game is of larger than normal size the pieces 
               move automatically with the press of a button he sits down 
               and chuckles over his opponents bad move

                                     macready
                         poor little son of a bitch youre 
                         starting to lose it arent you

               he confidently taps out his move his companions response 
               is immediate

                                     voice
                         pawn takes queen at knight four

               macreadys grin slowly fades as he examines the board there 
               is a pounding at his door macready broods for a bit heedless 
               of his visitor and makes his next move

                                     voice
                         rook to knight six check

               more impatient pounding macready glares at his opponent for 
               a beat he bends forward opens up a flap containing the 
               chess games circuitry and pours in his drink there ensues 
               a snapping popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the 
               machine followed by a flush of chess gibberish

               macready gets up from his seat mumbling on his way to the 
               door

                                     macready
                         cheating bastard

               he opens the door norris steps in followed by a flurry of 
               snow and wind

                                     norris

               dr copper sits next to macready who is at the controls

               macready tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck 
               and starts up its choking engine

               macready fights violently with the controls as he struggles 
               to get the craft into the air it finally rights itself and 
               moves up and off into the greywhite sky

               int main compound

               a couple of the men mingle in the area clark the dog 
               handler looks out the window

               takes notice

                                                                    cut to

               ext the chopper

               moves over a ridge of ice columns of smoke can be seen rising 
               ominously from a quarter mile off

               int chopper  point of view

               as they near the smoke looms thicker a black tarlike 
               gush billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below

               ext norwegian camp

               smoke climbs upward in the fg macready sets his craft down 
               pull back to reveal the camp itself resembling the aftermath 
               of a western fort sacked and ravaged by indians

               small fires and debris are strewn everywhere the prefab 
               administration building exposes gaping holes smoke rises 
               from the almost entirely snowburied quonset huts embers 
               swirl in every direction

               int chopper

               the two men look at each other in silence they get out

               close on a large makeshift funeral pyre

               smoldering to a close a hastily conceived crematorium wood 
               books furniture tires anything that will burn has been 
               mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and 
               the body of a man

               curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within 
               the mess

               a small can of gasoline lies nearby a large oil drum not 
               far off

               macready and copper

               their faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight

               macready turns to view the norwegian compound he then 
               exchanges a look with copper macready heads back toward the 
               chopper

               the chopper

               macready unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel 
               behind the seats

               ext the main building  the door

               macready and dr copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of 
               snow and embers macready tries the door it is unlocked he 
               slowly pushes it open with his gun a creaking a long pitch
               black corridor copper shines a flashlight

                                     dr copper
                         anybody there

               no answer just wind they exchange a look and enter

               int narrow corridor

               the two men move slowly it is dank and cold their breath 
               bleating like exhaust a soft steady wind howls overhead  
               the flashlight is not much help

               further down they hear a faint hissing sound as they get 
               closer it more resembles static the flashlight finds a door 
               at the end of the corridor the sputtering static comes from 
               within

               the face of the door has been shredded an ax sticks out 
               from its middle macready wrenches out the ax there is blood 
               on it the men acknowledge this for a beat

               macready tries the knob it opens slightly something is 
               blocking it from the other side

                                     macready
                         anybody in there

                         come to help you

               macready pushes against the door

                                     macready
                         give me a hand

               they push shove grunt the door gives a bit finally more 
               it widens enough for macready to see that a large computer
               like machine is blocking their path macready wedges in and 
               shines the flashlight

               it is the communications room holes in its roof have allowed 
               in the freezing cold the flashlight exposes the back of the 
               radio chair one more nudge allows them into the room

               a beat as they catch their breath macready spots a coleman 
               lantern he lights it with a match holds it up the brighter 
               light exposes the top of a mans head sitting in the radio 
               chair

                                     macready
                         hey sweden you okay

               the chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze they inch 
               closer a yard from the chair macready stops the doctor  
               he pokes his gun at the chairs back

                                     macready
                         sweden

               dr copper spots something from the mans wrist on the 
               armrest he follows a long yarnthick red line ending in 
               a pool of frozen blood on the floor

               the two men step around the chair the norwegian stares up 
               in blanched death a gaping black hole for a mouth

               his throat and wrists slit an oldfashioned straight razor 
               in his lap

               macready turns off the hissing radio and marches to the 
               other door it is locked and barricaded

                                     dr copper
                              more to himself

                         come on copper

               the two men free a machinelike obstacle from the other exit 
               macready opens a lock and pushes the door open

               more blackness stronger wind copper holds the lantern high 
               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a 
               cavernous underground causeway

                         theyre not swedish goddamn it 
                         theyre norwegian macre 

               whap something slaps into the doctors face from the 
               darkness the lantern crashes to the ground the doctor 
               stumbles falls macready grabs the flashlight and whirls in 
               different directions a panting beat silence

               dr copper holds up what hit him a thick centerfold buffeted 
               by the wind macready takes it

                                     macready
                         norwegian of the month doc harmless

               macready pockets it for further viewing

               int the narrowest of corridors

               the supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked 
               from the constantly moving ice underneath the evidence of 
               fire has further weakened the foundations the wood creaks 
               overhead bits of ice and silt trickle down

               the two men walk hunched cautious macready gingerly tries 
               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam he 
               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning 
               roof

               the two men wait until it subsides and then moves on

               further down macreadys knee bumps into something along the 
               wall causing him to stumble slightly he shines his light 
               on it

               an arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off 
               the ground the door has been slammed shut the arm pinned 
               its fist still gripping a small welding torch

               the flame long since gone out

                                     macready
                              wincing
                         holy shit

               he tries the door unlocked it opens the arm drops to the 
               ground it has been severed by the force of the slam

               its owner is nowhere to be seen

               macready sickened coughs dr copper mumbles

                                     dr copper
                         christ

               they step over the arm and into another slim passageway

               moving along they come to rest in front of a door with 
               norwegian lettering on it

               macready pushes it open with his foot dozens of papers fly 
               about flailed by the holes in the quonset hutstyle roof 
               the place is a wreck they enter macready surveying the 
               small room with his flashlight

                         portable video unit

               copper makes his way over to the main work table he shuffles 
               through papers glancing at the writing

                                     macready

                         all in norwegian

               dr copper bends down and begins gathering the papers strewn 
               about the room

                                     macready
                         what are you doing

                                     dr copper

                         well bring it back

                                     macready
                         its getting late hurry it im 
                         going to check the last few rooms

               he exits amongst the rubble dr copper finds a pocket tape 
               recorder and several cassettes he selects a tape and is 
               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear he 
               turns looks a beat nothing

               int hallway

               macready shoves himself into another room

               int room

               debris and wood flush down on him the receding ceiling had 
               been blocking the door from above he brushes his coat and 
               shines the light upwards

               the ceiling is a shambles he then shines the light deeper 
               into the room

               int norwegian lab

               dr copper is playing the small tape recorder a casual 
               norwegian voice drones on as if making notes he fast 
               forwards the same casual drone

                                     macready os
                         copper come here

               int room

               dr copper enters squeezing in through the door the wood 
               cracks overhead more debris comes falling down

                                     macready
                         careful its about to go

               copper dusts himself macready stands before a huge block of 
               ice fifteen feet long six feet wide four feet tall

               it has partially melted but its thawing process has been 
               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost

               its one curious feature the middle has been thawed and 
               scooped out giving it the appearance of a large bathtub 
               the two men study it uncomprehendingly

               macreadys gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left 
               he moves for a closer look several photographs are pasted 
               to its door small snapshots of the norwegians at work and 
               play

               he tries to open it stuck the partially cavedin ceiling 
               is slightly blocking the top of the door he tries again 
               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above bits of 
               dust float down

                                     dr copper
                         watch it

               his grip is too strong it gives suddenly unexpectedly the 
               large metal door flies open

               large chunks splash from the ceiling they come thumping to 
               the floor behind and in front of the open cabinet door 
               macready coughs and waves away the dust he peers inside 
               nothing much some empty shelves some small scientific gear

               his flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the 
               inside of the cabinet door

               it is a picture of five norwegians arm in arm all smiles 
               toasting each other they are on either side of the frozen 
               block of ice pridefully displaying it for the camera the 
               block looks much thicker its interior opaque

               macready looks to the block of ice and then back to the 
               photograph he untapes it pockets it and shuts the door

               an armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing 
               door dislodged from the ceiling the body and macready go 
               crashing to the floor

                                                                    cut to

               london can be heard throughout the compound the room is 
               empty close on a video pong game its ball of light lazily 
               traveling back and forth the dog its tail wagging its

               zevons record is blasting from nauls stereo he skates

               to pan keeping time with his sounds

               he smells tastes adds a little something here a touch 
               there he clearly enjoys his work

               station manager garry stops past the open door

                                     garry

               int compound corridor

               an empty hallway larger than most doors to several sleeping 
               quarters on either side the dog slowly walks through

               one of the doors is open up ahead of his left the dog stops 
               in front of it and looks in someone is inside

               inside the small cubicle a slight portion of a mans back 
               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair his large shadow 
               displayed on the wall

               back in the corridor the dog looks up the hall once and 
               casually to the other end no one he enters the room the 
               sound of a mans voice too indistinct to tell whose mumbles

                                     mans voice
                         hello boy

               a beat

               the sound of a glass breaking a muffled scuffling the door 
               is slammed shut from the inside and then silence

                                                                    cut to

               around the compound he stops at the end of a long quonset 
               hut almost completely buried in the snow the hut is fifty 
               yards long and connects to the main compound he enters a 
               tunnel from a latch door up top

               int tunnel

               he jogs down the steps passing the underground dog kennel 
               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel 
               he passes and waves to clark who rolls along a wheelbarrow 
               of dog food

               clark

               opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner

               the quarters above

               childs waltzes through humming a big smile on his face

               of test tubes notices a large bandage on the floor he picks 
               it up inquiringly it is mangled and shredded

               int generator room

               palmer works on the generator he hears the sound of 
               approaching propeller blades from outside and then the sound 
               of his tool box crashing to the floor he turns to see what 
               caused the ruckus

               the dog who has entered the shed has jumped on the work 
               table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out 
               of the above window palmer curses under his breath and calls 
               out

                                     palmer

               the dog

               it paws at the window and watches as the chopper carrying 
               macready and dr copper fights against the newly arrived 
               heavy winds and lands safely

               int station manager garrys quarters

               garry macready dr copper norris bennings blair and his 
               assistant fuchs are present the small norwegian video 
               unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a 
               tv screen grainy home movieish no sound

               the proceedings are grim

               shots of the norwegians at work others of them playing 
               soccer on ice generally the footage is a prosaic record of 
               their daytoday life

               norris shuffles the bundle of notes dr copper brought back 
               with him

                                     norris
                         seems they were spending a lot of 
                         time at a place four miles northeast 
                         of their camp

                         seismology glaciology same old 
                         shit we do

               the present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably 
               drunk holding a sign across their waists as they stand 
               outdoors in superfreezing weather

                                     bennings

               macready turns on the light and shuts off the video machine 
               he then slides the portable tape deck across the table to 
               dr copper they exchange a look

               a norwegian voice drones on calmly making verbal notes

               norris shrugs

                                     bennings
                         what do you want from us

                                     macready
                              flat
                         just listen

               dr copper fast forwards the calm voice continues and then 
               a loud blast followed by pounding the sounds of confusion 
               voices loud frenetic mens feet running up and down wooden 
               floorboards a gurgling a hissing

               screams and then a screeching more blasts mixed with the 
               din of wild carnagewrought cries and then more screeching 
               a screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard

               the men look from one another in silence as they listen

               dr copper turns it off

                                     dr copper
                         goes on like that quite awhile
                              beat
                         what do you gentlemen make of it

                                     garry

                         isolation some beef that 
                         snowballed got out of hand

                                     norris

                         something they ate what about food 
                         poisoning doc

               dr copper taps the tape deck pensively

                                     dr copper
                         maybe

               he glances at macready and then back to the others

                                     dr copper
                         theres something else we want you 
                         to see

               int infirmary

               dr copper and macready begin dumping the heavy contents of 
               a large plastic trash bag onto the slab

                                     dr copper
                         we found this

               displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a 
               man badly charred what is left of the trousers and shoes 
               of the bottom torso are ripped and split as if his legs and 
               feet had burst from the inside his upper body is an almost 
               undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush

               the head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal 
               it is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen 
               tendonlike appendages are wrapped around the carcass and 
               sticking up and out in odd postures one is wrapped around 
               the bodys left leg

               the shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tarlike 
               mess

               the men grimace

                                     dr copper
                         i know hes pretty badly burned 
                         but could fire have done this

               blair sickened but fascinated pokes at the tendonlike 
               things and the tarry goo

                                     dr copper

               the other body is draped with a sheet waiting its turn dr 
               copper pulls off his gloves

                                     dr copper

               kennel a new dressing has been placed on its hip

               he unlatches the door to the kennel and leads him in

               int kennel

               about twenty feet long five feet wide poorly lit

               cramped with dogs some of them sleeping others pacing around 
               and curious greet their new companion sniffing panting 
               and rubbing up against him clark pats the dog and several 
               others then leaves latching the door behind him

               int sleeping cubicle

               childs lies in his cot watching a small television the show 
               is a tape of an american tv game show he has seen this one 
               too many times extracts the cassette and injects another 
               game show

               book and smoking a joint childs beckons for it and takes a 
               hit

               int pub

               a small area just off the rec room set up like a bar

               macready is alone looking over the rest of the videotapes 
               from the norwegian outpost mundane to esoteric chores of 
               antarctic camp life he looks bored

               int lab

               blair hovering over the microscope lays in a slide focuses 
               and motions for dr copper to take a look

               copper is confused as he examines he shrugs

                                     dr copper
                         i dont understand

               fuchs takes the opportunity to look blair moves over to the 
               disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous tendon
               like appendages

                                     blair
                         its tissue from one of these sinewy 
                         rods

               fuchs is befuddled as he examines

                                     fuchs
                         what in the world kind of cell 
                         structure is this

                                     blair
                         thats the point

                                     dr copper
                              tired
                         i dont get you blair

                                     blair
                         im not sure it is any kind of cell 
                         structure biologically speaking

                                     dr copper
                              sighing
                         this really isnt my field blair 
                         lets wrap for the day

               dr copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as 
               he exits blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body

               ext compound  night

               a steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small 
               surrounding shacks

               int rec room

               vacant the wall clock reads fourthirty

               int hallway

               sleeping cubicles on either side the sound of snoring

               int pub

               blearyeyed macready is in the process of blowing up some 
               strange inflatable object as he puffs away he still keeps 
               an eye on the norwegian video tapes his balloon begins to 
               take shape it blossoms into a lifesize replica of a full
               breasted woman something on the tape catches his eye he 
               rewinds then starts it forward again

               the screen shows the norwegians on the surface of what appears 
               to be an enormous flat glacier they are spread out on the 
               ice around a large odd oval shape their arms outstretched

               it fades to black and then a norwegian comes on mugging 
               childishly in front of the camera apparently quite pleased 
               with something

               the tape fades to black again and the picture reappears

               this time they have marked off the large oval area with flag 
               sticks

               closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into 
               the ice there is a small patch of something dark and metallic 
               at the bottom

               macready leans forward intrigued

               the men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various 
               points around the markings macready squints and mumbles to 
               himself

                                     macready
                         decanite thermite charges

               the tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings 
               no norwegian in sight an explosion kicks up the ice a beat 
               as the ice sprays to the ground then the camera appears to 
               shake as the ground beneath it quivers

               another immense explosion follows an earthquakelike force 
               throws the camera to the ground

                                     macready
                         what in

               the tape continues distorted unviewable a distinct crack 
               in the lens macready lets go of his companion and quickly 
               rewinds the deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around 
               the room

               int kennel  night

               most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging the new dog watches 
               them calmly silently

               he takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs 
               and sits upright completely still he stares at them a 
               beat the dogs are aware of something they begin to seem a 
               bit confused uncomfortable

               the new dog continues to stare sitting rigidly unnaturally 
               still his eyes dead lusterless black spheres

               bewildered a few dogs start to pace as if sensing something  
               a portent a danger but so odd they begin a soft purring 
               growl

               the new dog remains a statue the growling builds more dogs 
               begin to pace nervously faster encircling

               emitting hisses snarls the lack of response driving them 
               into a frenzy

               barks growls more frenetic pacing the din escalating 
               three dogs start to close in on the stranger

               they attack

               the shadow of the new dog

               against the kennel wall the shadow suddenly lurches upward 
               seeming larger

               the kennel roars

               int pub

               macready is still going over bits of the same footage 
               fascinated he hears the faroff clamor of the dogs

               int nauls quarters

               he too bothered by the noise tosses and turns in his sleep

               int clarks quarters

               clark snores macready has entered

                                     macready
                         clark

               no response macready nudges him clark rolls away annoyed

               macready pinches his snoring nose cutting off the air

               clark sits up groggy

                                     macready
                         dogtowns going nuts take care of 
                         it

               int tunnel

               clark sleepy irritated makes his way down the freezing 
               corridor the wind soughing loudly overhead

               clark

               reaches the kennel door the savage outpouring of noise from 
               within baffles and angers him he unlatches the door

                                     clark
                         whats got into

               smack just as he opens the door two dogs as if jettisoned 
               from a cannon knock him off his feet growls barks snarls 
               and a screeching from within

               int kitchen

               macready is fetching himself a beer the sound of the far
               off screeching he freezes a beat he turns and sprints

               his beer can

               as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm he pulls the lever

               int tunnel

               the alarm is blaring throughout the camp macready garry 
               norris run through the narrow tunnel led by clark

               macready carries a shotgun garry halfdressed has his 
               44 clark a fire ax

                         whatever it is

               int hallway

               chaos men halfnaked bounce from their cubicle

               pulling on their pants digging into shoes

               int childs cubicle

               childs is grappling with his belt buckle

                                     childs

               bennings is off

               int tunnel

               as the men approach the locked kennel door the two dogs 
               thrown into clark back ferociously and scratch at the door 
               trying to get back in one is badly bloodied

               the fight inside rages on macready and clark brace themselves 
               by the narrow door norris and garry hold back the two 
               hysterical dogs clark undoes the latch and he and macready 
               enter the kennel

               the light has been broken and it is pitch black macready 
               snaps on his flashlight norris and garry cant contain their 
               animals and the dogs burst into the room they smash into 
               macready and send him sprawling total confusion the dogs 
               the men the screeching the blackness

               macready gropes for his flashlight and rights himself he 
               finds clark then shines it around the cramped room trying 
               to get his bearings

               the light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner

               barking mixed with hissing a gurgling a screeching

               dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray 
               with a vengeance

               the flashlight illuminates parts of some thing a dog

               but not quite impossible to tell it struggles powerfully  
               garry pokes his head into the blackness

                                     garry
                         whats going on damn it

               macready aims his shotgun at the entire pack

               clark wades into the pack grabs at dogs hides and throws

               hacking away at the gurgling hissing silhouette

               from out of nowhere a large bristly arachnidlike leg 
               springs up and wraps around clarks ax it sends clark 
               smashing violently into the wall

               outside

               him and his flashlight once more to the ground

               of the hissing and screeching a dog is hit macready crawls

               childs lets loose with a burst of blue flame a mewing a 
               screeching

               part of the kennel starts to burn

               childs moves closer continuing his assault on the hissing 
               gurgling presence

               men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning 
               walls dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and 
               co2

               the screeching lessens the hissing and gurgling fade childs 
               turns off his torch

               uneasiness

               blair in silent awe stands over the badly burned corpses 
               of two interlocking dogs that lie before him on a table

               they are connected as if they were one animal though the 
               one wearing the remnants of clarks bandage is much larger 
               and appears less doglike its entire torso is cracked and 
               peeled as if its innards were trying to burst out

               odd appendages recoiled and withered by the flame are 
               wrapped grotesquely about both bodies

               clark his eyes set in glassy stare sits in shock nauls 
               comforts him childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring 
               at the floor

               blair transfixed continues hovering over the united 
               cadavers weighing thinking a very worried look on his 
               face

               the dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not 
               far off

               macready pilots young palmer and norris are with him

               it is clear but the winds are troublesome the ride is a 
               shaky one norris refers to their map he points

                                     norris
                         one of their sites would be directly 
                         over here

               they aim for a large mountainous wall as they go up and 
               over they see

               flat glacial expanse

               on the surface an enormous blackened oval shape

               int us outpost 31  lab

               all the bodies of the dogs have been brought in fuchs stands 
               by as blair studies through his microscope

               of two cells they appear to be much different from each 
               other they are joined at the ends but are completing the 
               process of breaking off from each other

               on blair

               a disturbed look on his face he checks his watch as if 
               timing the procedure

               ext glacier  tracking with macready norris and palmer

               as they walk along the ice they come to a stop at the edge 
               of a sharp drop

               pull back to reveal  the massive black hole about fifteen 
               feet beneath the ice charred gnarled and mangled metal are 
               all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere

               macreadys and norris eyes meet each other in silence

               palmer is in awe

                                     palmer
                         wow

               macready finds a burst thermite canister he and norris climb 
               down

               they move along amongst the wreck almost everything but the 
               skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy 
               powder

               norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage 
               while macready browses through the center

               palmer continues to marvel as he walks around the oval 
               atop the ice

               macready returns and kneels down next to norris as the latter 
               examines a piece of metal

                                     norris
                         magnesium of some type or some 
                         kind of strange alloy
                              looks out at debris 
                              in disgust
                         and those poor dumb bastards had to 
                         go and blow the hell out of it

                                     macready
                         so what do you make of it

                                     norris
                         you know damn well what we both make 
                         of it

                                     macready
                         no chance it could have been some 
                         new kind of test craft

               norris shakes his head no

                         old

               palmer calls out waving them over

               ext glacier

               the two men join palmer about fifty yards from the oval

               a large rectangular chunk has been cut out of the ice it is 
               fifteen feet long six feet wide and eight feet deep

               macready kneels down to observe a beat

               a gust of wind picks up the snow at their feet

                                                                    cut to

               macready sits quietly by his chess set contemplating a large 
               glass of scotch clark less interested than the others is 
               flipping through the norwegian nudie magazine

               blair looking worried sits off in a corner pondering the 
               photo of the block of ice and fingering a piece of crumbled
               up metal brought back from the site

               a beat as blair stares straight ahead transfixed he speaks 
               softly to no one particular

                                     blair

                         was here in this camp

               the men take in his grave countenance

                                     garry
                         so so what its over with

               blair turns to them a pause the men search his face

                                     bennings
                              edgy
                         well isnt it

               int lab  close on a sheet

               as blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking 
               dogs

               pull back all the men have gathered some of the men settle 
               into chairs others stand

                                     blair
                         whatever that norwegian dog was  
                         it it was capable of changing its 
                         form
                              indicates their dog
                         when it attacked our dog it 
                         somehow was able to digest or 
                         absorb it and in the process shaped 
                         its own cells to imitate our dogs 
                         cells exactly
                              holds up gooey dog 
                              leg
                         this for instance isnt dog at 
                         all  its imitation we got to 
                         it before it had time to finish or

                                     nauls
                         finish what

                                     blair
                         i think the whole process would 
                         have taken an hour maybe more 
                         and then i suppose both would have 
                         changed back to dog form

                                     palmer
                         well that thing in the ice sure 
                         werent no dog

                                     blair
                              impatient
                         of course not but whatever it was 
                         revived it well the thing was 
                         probably disoriented and realized 
                         it couldnt survive for long in our 
                         atmosphere but being the incredibly 
                         adaptable creature it was it tried 
                         to become something that could 
                         before the norwegians killed it 
                         it somehow got to this dog

                                     clark
                         what do you mean got to the dog

                                     blair
                         it was a life form that was able to 
                         imitate and reproduce whatever it 
                         ate or absorbed cell for cell

               silence

                                     blair
                         the concept is staggering i know 
                         i i dont fully understand it 
                         myself

                              nodding
                         i think were talking about an 
                         organism that could imitate other 
                         life forms perfectly it could 
                         have gone on and on it could have 
                         become one dog it could have become 
                         as many dogs as it wanted to  and 
                         without losing any of its original 
                         mass

               jump of some twenty feet

               childs lets loose a blast hitting the dog in midair the 
               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice 
               in flames

               macready throws his thermite canister it discharges and 
               engulfs the screeching animal in fire

               in different directions part of bennings body pops up in a 
               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down

               macready grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles suddenly a 
               steellike arachnidshaped arm shoots out in pain and with 
               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the

               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess

                         theoretically any of us could be 
                         whatever the hell this thing is

               norris shakes his head rubbing his chest in slight 
               discomfort

                                     norris

               macready pushes his sombrero back over his head

                                     macready
                         well you can believe it now

               the men it is the shredded pair of long johns

                         these things dont imitate clothes 
                         just flesh and bone

               the men look from one another silence macready picks it up 
               and examines the label

                                     macready

                         coppers the only one who has any 
                         business with it

               the eyes shift from garry to copper

                                     dr copper

                         him in the clear bullshit

               sanchez bolts out the door stunned for a beat the others 
               chase after him

                                     garry
                         hey sanchez

               sanchez

               in terror runs at top speed through the narrow corridors

               opening and shutting doors the others are in pursuit

               they shout for him to stop

                                                                    cut to

               sanchez

               as he reaches a small armory a glass case set into the wall 
               a half dozen rarely used guns are inside he tries the handle 
               locked

               he hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are 
               nearing he breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun then a box 
               of shells he frantically tries to load but is too nervous

               the others arrive at the end of the hallway garry pulls his 
               handgun and points

                                     garry
                         put that down

                         head

               no one doubts garrys sincerity

                                     sanchez
                         you guys going to let him give orders 
                         i mean he could be one of those 
                         things

               the other regard garry tensely no one oblivious to the fact 
               that sanchez just might be right

                                     macready
                              calm
                         put it away sanchez just put it 
                         away

               still trembling he tosses the shells back into the broken 
               case leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob

               nauls skates over to comfort him

               the men watch as garry lowers his gun he turns to them

                                     garry

                         if someone else is in charge

               he hands his gun to norris

                                     garry

               dr copper presses the prongs onto norris chest and shoots 
               a bolt of current norris body heaves upward a slight 
               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask

                                     dr copper
                         again more current this time

               norris body begins bounding up more crackling and popping 
               his chest begins to break up and spread the mask pops off  
               a hideous mewing escaping from norris distorted mouth

               the men jump back incredulous dr copper scrambles off his 
               chest and flops to the floor

                                     sanchez
                         god what

               they watch on in stunned horror as the thing that was norris 
               begins to change to spread awkwardly on the slab

               its clothes tearing a shoe splits in half and falls to the 
               floor exposing the beginnings of a talon

               macready charges toward it shooing the men off

                                     macready
                         get out of the way

               he unloads with a stream of flame the body writhes in pain 
               belching and hissing the slab catches fire it struggles 
               lunges for the floor straightens up and moves a few feet

               a black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and 
               squirts to the floor norris body collapses on the 
               fibrillating machine in flames extinguishers are ripped 
               from the walls and put to work

               macready watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination 
               as they twitch and mew on the floor

               within seconds the fire is out the men stand around in awe 
               as they look upon the thing that was once norris

               macready continues to observe the small particles their 
               tiny squeals abating into silence

               int rec room

               macready still carrying the industrial torch has maneuvered 
               all the men into the room he holds garrys 44 he has 
               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the 
               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite

               macready turns on a bunsen burner while he cuts the rubber 
               covering off an electrical cord exposing the copper wire

               all the while he keeps his eye on the men

                         watching norris in there gave me 
                         the idea that maybe every part of 
                         you bastards is a whole every piece 
                         of you is selfsufficient an animal

                         you things wont obey its a newly 
                         formed individual with a builtin 
                         desire to protect its own life when 
                         attacked your blood will try and 
                         survive  and crawl away from a hot 
                         needle say

                                                                    cut to

               sanchez

               grimacing as dr copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and 
               collects a small portion of his blood in a dish

               all the men have been tied up palmer childs and garry on 
               the small couch the others including the lifeless corpse 
               of clark in chairs

               copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in 
               line with the other plates of blood that he has collected

               the names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates

               macready slides the doctor a fresh plate

                                     macready
                         now you

               copper cuts his thumb his blood dribbles onto the plate

               he stands nervously for a beat

                                     macready
                         slide it back here

               copper pushes it toward macready

                                     macready
                         now step way back

               copper steps backward moisture beginning to collect on his 
               brow macready begins to heat the copper wire over the bunsen 
               burner

               the men watch intently the wire begins to glow macready 
               points the torch directly at the doctor both of them 
               perspiring macready lifts the glowing wire from the flame 
               the doctor is dead still macready slowly touches the wire 
               to the doctors plate a soft hiss

               macready heats it again and tries once more the same soft 
               hiss macready and the doctor both let out a sigh

                                     macready

                         fibrillator on norris if you were 
                         one of them

               he hands copper the torch

                                     macready
                         watch them

               he cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his 
               own blood

                                     macready

                         know

               he heats the wire and puts it to his plate the same harmless 
               hissing all eyes continue to watch as he tries again the 
               same result childs mumbles

                                     childs

                         well see lets try clark

               he heats the wire and lays it in clarks dish the hissing

                                     childs
                         so clark was human huh

               macready nods

                         so that make you a murderer

               macready glances over the group

                                     macready
                         palmer now

               he sets palmers plate in front of him and heats the wire

                                     garry
                         pure nonsense this wont prove a 
                         damn thing

                                     macready
                         thought youd feel that way garry 
                         you were the only one who could have 
                         gotten to that blood plasma
                              placing the wire in 
                              palmers dish
                         well do you last

               screech the blood howls trying to crawl off the plate

               palmer bolts forward with incredible force racing for 
               macready his face splitting his mouth roaring  dragging 
               the couch childs and garry with him he smashes into macready 
               knocking him over the table

                                     macready
                         copper

               its all happened too fast copper tries to get off a burst 
               of flame the everchanging palmer breaks his bonds and leaps 
               on the doctor

               the others sit helpless struggling at their bindings

               macready dives on palmers back and the three go rolling to 
               the floor screeching crackling macready pounds viciously 
               at palmers head a powerful shirtsplitting arm sends him 
               skidding across the floor

               copper momentarily has control of the torch just as he 
               positions it palmers mouth splits from his chin to his 
               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the doctors head

               the big torch slaps against the wall palmer bounds to his 
               feet wrapping his arms around the dangling struggling body 
               of dr copper

               the men are screaming hysterically macready tries to fire 
               up the bruised torch busted wont work

               frustrated he charges up behind palmer and begins hammering 
               the thick steel instrument over his head

               the shirt of palmers back erupts in macreadys face

               splitting and ripping wildly exposing the beginnings of yet 
               another orifice a blackened ironstrong tongue lunges 
               outward stunned macready manages to elude it diving for 
               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite

               macready lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the 
               table palmer awkwardly spins in circles swinging the 
               doctors body like a propeller blade struggling to keep on 
               balance as he advances on macready the second orifice 
               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form

               macready waits until palmers back spins around facing him 
               only two yards away macready flings his lit roll into the 
               everevolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering 
               childs and garry with his body

               a muffled boom as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep 
               within palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the 
               room macready rolls away from childs and garry as fast as 
               he can

                                                                    cut to

               macready

               perspiring profusely his hand trembling slightly prepares 
               to continue the test he heats the wire

               the men are pouring sweat whiteknuckled

               one of the smaller torches is pointed at nauls he closes 
               his eyes macready places the heated wire into his plate 
               hiss macready exhales nauls opens his eyes

               macready unties nauls with one hand while the torch stays 
               glued to the others

               macready heats the wire once again both he and nauls have 
               torches aimed at sanchez sanchez is near tears

               the wire is dipped into the plate hisssss

               sanchez breaks down and sobs

               childs

               sits stoicly while he watches the preparations for his turn

                                     childs
                         lets do it bwana

               nauls and sanchez take aim five yards away fierce 
               determined the wire comes off the flame into the plate 
               the harmless hissing

               the muscles in childs face melt into a sigh

                                     childs
                         muthafu

               all eyes

               snap towards station manager garry childs suddenly realizing 
               who he is sitting next to squirms

                                     childs

                         cut me loose damn it

               nauls rips away his bindings the other two stand guard

               childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor

               garry

               stares grimly ahead childs soaks his clothing with a can of 
               gasoline he is then surrounded the room tenses adrenalin

               sanchez and childs flop down in chairs macready wipes his 
               face

               a long silence sanchez weeps quietly with relief

                                     garry
                         i know you gentlemen have been through 
                         a lot but when you find the time

                         winter tied to this couch

               a beat childs starts to giggle the strain on macreadys 
               jaw begins to lessen garry sits catatonic nauls scowls at 
               childs uncontrollable laughter

               the infectious rasping causes macready a slight smile as he 
               looks up taking comfort in the sound of the raging antarctic 
               wind vibrating the roof nauls untying garry grumbles at 
               childs

                                     nauls
                         shut the damn hell up

               childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward macready his 
               smile fades macready is now stonefaced childs grin goes 
               stale in sudden realization

                                     macready
                              almost a whisper
                         blair

               ext compound  night

               the wind rumbles the storm is at its peak macready childs 
               and nauls guided by their flares pull themselves along the 
               steadying rope headed for blairs shack

               blairs shack

               the door is wide open they pause by the entrance trying to 
               balance against the wind they enter

               int blairs shack

               empty a few of the floorboards are loosened they pull them 
               up they stare down into a large hole beneath the planking 
               something is down there they pull up more boards

               the hole is some fifteen feet deep its dimensions are the 
               same as the shack its space is almost completely taken up 
               by some strange metallic object

               crudely fashioned a patchwork job but streamlined

               sheets of corrugated steel are visible but cut apart and 
               welded into the desired shapes the object appears to be 
               unfinished

                                     nauls
                         what is it

                         where was he trying to go

                                     macready
                         anyplace but here

               macready pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite

                                     macready
                         but he aint going to make it

               far off amidst the howling gale  the screeching the men 
               jump macready lights the fuse as they make it to the exit 
               he tosses it in

               ext compound along the rope

               the explosion echoes behind them the men pull along their 
               heads jerk in circles searching into the blackness

               some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down 
               severing the line the wind sends the men tumbling along the 
               ice childs loosens the line and is blown away rolling out 
               of sight

               macready and nauls have lost their torches they pull 
               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound

               the screeching closes in behind them macready loses his 
               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building

               he crawls along looking for an opening

               nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel

               he climbs down through the open stairwell

               int plant room

               macready has found the broken window he rolls through it 
               landing on the frozen plants below something smashes at the 
               glass above his head trying to get in he sprints for the 
               door fuchs frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax 
               macready grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob

               he finally gets it open and lets himself out slamming and 
               locking the door from the hall fuchs body swings eerily 
               back and forth

               int hallway

               macready charges up the stairs from the plant room he zooms 
               down the twisting corridors opening and closing doors he 
               rounds a bend and crashes into nauls coming the other way

                                                                    cut to

               two portable generators macready appears to be injecting 
               something into empty contact capsules the men work 
               feverishly

               nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite

                                     nauls

               int kitchen

               nauls pushes a stove reinforcing a locked door five yards 
               away sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another 
               outlet

               sanchez hears a quiet purring bubbling sound he turns to 
               nauls

                                     sanchez
                         you hear that

               a blaring they whip their attention to stereo speakers on 
               either side of the kitchen rock music screams out top 
               volume

               int rec room

               the same loud music macready and garry look to the three 
               speakers attached to the walls macready yells his 
               incomprehension to garry garry tries to respond their voices 
               drowned out

               int hallway

               empty another of the stereo speakers that line the walls 
               thunders

               int kitchen

               nauls in sudden realization screams over the din and points 
               back in the direction they came

                                     nauls

               int rec room

               macready cursing rips the speakers off the wall

                                     macready
                         what are they doing out there

               the music is now subdued within the room but continues 
               booming throughout the camp nauls scream can be barely 
               heard

                                     garry
                         whats he saying

               int kitchen  nauls

               at the top of his lungs

                                     nauls
                         macready we been cut off

               a sharp red talonlike fingernail pierces the top of the 
               door above nauls head it saws downward quickly

               black goo drips through the slit the sawing obscured by the 
               music

               sanchez eyes bulging points nauls turns a claw rips 
               through the wood nauls dives to the floor

               in the opposite direction behind sanchez another arm splits 
               through the door and the refrigerator extends itself five 
               feet and yanks sanchez back as if he were a puppet

               sanchez struggles looking imploringly at nauls he bites 
               down on his capsule nauls takes off like a speed skater

               int rec room

               the sound of the screeching over the music

                                     macready
                         got to get to the generator

               he opens the door looks down the hall no one the speakers  
               blaring music

               nauls

               full speed down the maze left right totally reckless he 
               hits a straightaway

               sanchezs body

               from out of nowhere blasts through the hallway wall directly 
               in nauls path a thick arm pins the body to the other side 
               unable to stop nauls skids out of control banging into the 
               sides of the wall his cyanide capsule flying out of his 
               mouth

               whatever the rest of it is it starts to crumble through the 
               wall nauls dives over the arm somersaults to his feet and 
               takes off

               int main hall

               macready running spots nauls careening out of a turn 
               heading toward him

                                     nauls
                         get back

                         screw the generator

               nauls blazes by him macready hears the snarls and screeches 
               heading his way he streaks after nauls

               int rec room

               they make it in lock the door macready tries to catch 
               his breath nauls shakes pants

               garry fiddles with the two generators

                                     garry

                         boulder dam might do it

               the loud music in the compound is turned off macready shuts 
               off the lights the men spread out silence

                                                                    cut to

               int rec room

               the men watch all the doors dead silence dark whispers

                                     garry
                         how longs it been

                                     macready
                         little over two hours

                                     nauls
                         maybe it aint coming

                                     macready
                         then we go after him

                                     nauls
                         bet the last place you ever go

               the sound of a door opening and closing far off

               another creaking door is opened a rustling still far off 
               macready and nauls spread further apart

               the soft bubbling cooling sound a slight scratch at the 
               door garrys hand tightens around the generator switches 
               the scratching gets more pronounced macready cautions garry 
               with a whisper

                                     macready
                         wait

               the door begins to pound from the outside nauls and macready 
               light two cocktails each

               the door booms the rooms foundations shake the ceiling 
               quivers the gas bombs are cocked

               from the roof the thing roars down into their midst

               stunned the men stumble back macready throws his gas bomb 
               nauls the same

               for a moment it stands silhouetted in flame enormous

               grotesque

               garry bolts for the main door the things tongue spirals 
               from his mouth and spears him the good twothirds of its 
               body follows its tongue and engulfs garry by the door

               another leg slaps nauls to the ground macready dodges still 
               another appendage dives on the generators and throws the 
               switch

               the current rips through the door garry dies instantly

               one of the things talons still caught in the door sends 
               it writhing in pain it literally rips the door from its 
               latchings and pounds it to the ground trying to shake it 
               loose nauls hobbles scrambles out of the opening

               macready dives through the window and out into the storm

                                                                    cut to

               int compound  hall

               the distant sound of a motor nauls battered and bloodied 
               his leg apparently broken crawls along the ground another 
               sound a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear 
               but closing

               the terror forces him to drag faster oblivious to the pain

               he reaches the bathroom stall crawls in locks it the 
               gurgling nears leaning on the toilet seat he looks about 
               himself frantically

               the presence pauses at the door a scratching nauls paws 
               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood cutting his 
               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding

               a strong blow begins to breach the stall door nauls finally 
               unhinges the piece of wood brings the jagged end to one 
               side of his throat and rips

               int lab wall

               the motorized rumbling nears the wall seems to explode the 
               tractor barrels into the lab its enormous shovel scooper 
               tearing half the room to shreds

               macready drives his eyes glint like a wild mans he looks 
               stark raving mad

               his frostbite now in an advanced stage resembles black war 
               paint he clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth 
               like a buccaneers cutlass two large compressed air tanks 
               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his 
               neck they are marked  hydrogen

               they are used for the weather balloons

               he pulls the tractor to a stop yanks the stick from his 
               mouth grins and bellows

                                     macready
                         okay creep just you and me now be 
                         on your toes were going to do a 
                         little remodeling

               macready guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary 
               medical equipment goes flying the machine is powerful the 
               prefabricated walls buckling under its force

               int compound

               a trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend

               boom

               macready rams into the mess hall sweeping away tables 
               chairs he sings out loud the lyrics of some mexican song 
               all the while he keeps his eyes on everything

               through the kitchen the foundation is crumbling he sings 
               on

               narrow passageway

               gurgling and hissing a taloned arm slinks around a corner 
               in retreat

                                     macready os
                         chime in if you know that words old 
                         boy

               macready

               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub 
               area he backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from 
               the bar

                                     macready
                         you like whiskey come on join me 
                         for a drink be good for you grow 
                         fangs on your chest

               he takes a drink and rams through another wall

               int rec room

               the tractor blazes into the rec room macready parks it 
               directly in front of the hole in the roof created by the 
               thing when it surprised them earlier

                                     macready
                         damn it ran out of gas

               he pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over 
               the tractor as he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing 
               from roof to doorways to rubble

               wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes stinging 
               macready with the cold he winces at his mittenless blackened 
               fingers

                                     macready
                         sweetheart its going to get mighty 
                         cold in here soon you better make 
                         your move i mean hell im only 
                         one person

               he takes a swig from his bottle

                                     macready
                         i know youre bugged because we ruined 
                         your trip right spiffy little toy 
                         you had there

               a slight tremor perks his eyes and ears he looks up through 
               the hole then around he lights a lighter and cups it in 
               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap

                                     macready
                         but your real hang up is your looks

               a stronger tremor the adrenalin pumps

                                     macready
                              wants him bad
                         atta boy i know youre around

               the floor shakes macready stands his head whirling around 
               the room

                                     macready
                         come on sucker

               the tractor inches up off the ground macready falls forward 
               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the 
               vile and grinning face below a claw flashes up splitting 
               the steering wheel but missing his face

               he depresses the ignition bolting the tractor ten feet

               he jumps hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling 
               the things face and arms burst through the metal plating of 
               the tractor the reaching claws just miss him as he pulls 
               himself through

               ext roof

               he lights his fuse drops in the stick turns and runs

               half of the things grotesque and angular torso bolts up 
               through the hole howling in fury an appendage springs 
               outward and winds around macreadys jacket hissing like 
               acid into the fabric

               an immense explosion the hydrogen tanks send a white fireball 
               fifty feet into the sky the things body disintegrating 
               almost immediately

               the force of the blast sweeps macready off the roof he and 
               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames he 
               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off 
               the insidious limb

                                                                    cut to

               int camp

               a ruin one half of it burnt almost to the ground

               macready wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud 
               from his shoulders to the floor

               he walks bent over and in much pain trying to blunt patches 
               of fire with an extinguisher it is futile he gives up

                                                                    cut to

               int pub area

               mostly untouched by the fire but like most of the rest of 
               the camp exposed to the outside the storm has settled 
               considerably

               close on macready

               lighting a cigar his hands are heavily wrapped he pours 
               himself a drink

               a puffy white hand missing two fingers enters the frame 
               and whirls a startled macready around it is childs

               white and black blotches cover his frostbitten face

                                     childs
                         did you kill it

               he looks as weak as macready a beat

                                     macready
                         i think so

                                     childs
                         what do you mean you think so

               both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously

                                     macready
                         yeah i got it
                              refers to childs 
                              condition
                         pretty mean frostbite

               childs steps back keeping his distance he indicates his 
               puffy white hand

                                     childs
                         itll turn black again soon enough 
                         then i guess ill be losing the whole 
                         thing
                              refers to feet
                         think my toes are already gone

               macready carrying the bottle and glass limps over and sits 
               down behind a gaming table there is a chess set and several 
               decks of cards the two men continue to eye each other

                                     childs
                         so youre the only one who made it

               macready begins setting up a nonelectronic chessboard

                                     macready
                         not the only one

                                     childs

                         up all over camp wont last long 
                         though

                                     macready

                                     childs
                         maybe we should try and fix the 
                         radio try and get some help

                                     macready

                         then well never make it

               macready puffs on his cigar he reveals a small blowtorch 
               from under the table and places it beside him on top

                                     macready
                         maybe we shouldnt make it

                                     childs

                         lets take that blood test of yours

                                     macready
                         if weve got any surprises for each 
                         other  we shouldnt be in any

               they regard each other for a moment childs painfully sits 
               down across from macready

                                     childs
                         i guess ill be learning

               macready grins and hands the bottle to childs childs smiles 
               back and takes a healthy swig

               ext compound  night

               the fires smolder on bright embers dance in the blackness  
               pushed by the soughing wind

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
