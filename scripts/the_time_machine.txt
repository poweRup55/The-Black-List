     leo the lion roars over the fanfare then

                                                 fade out

     gliding objects in a wide dark void  animation

             out of the silent darkness a short white       a
             fluted column surmounted by a sundial
             appears  it floats in waveringly until
             it becomes clearly visible then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit

             next an hourglass floats in from the left      b
             of the screen  the faint hissing of
             running sand breaks the stillness of space

             as the hourglass glides across the screen     c
             it is met by a greek water clock accompanied
             by the sound of dripping water

             a medieval clock with weights arises as its    d
             horizontal escapement ticks loudly  mean
             while the sundial hourglass and water clock
             return drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen

     the sound of the various devices continues to mount

             a figure wheels past with the face of a       e
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century beating the hour

             a small clock bears a golden angel with        f
             hammer in hands as it strikes a bell

             another timepiece with chimes floats in      g
             to mingle with all the drifting objects

             the big ben is tolling                         h

             then a great bell                             j

     deafening sounds now come from all directions as the time k
     devices weave across the screen and reaching crescendo
     stop abruptly  a mellow voice begins to sing the theme of l
     the picture the land of the leal  simultaneously the
     screen reveals the main title                             m

                           the time machine

                        the land of the leal

                      words  music by peggy lee

         when i was a wee lad                               l
         and dark was the night
         afraid i would be
         til the bright morning light
         and sometimesfor comfort
         away i would steal away
         i would go to the land of the leal

         and soon i would be there
         it took me no time
         my heart would be soaring
         as i made the climb
         and there was the green grass
         so cool and so sweet
         so good to be run through
         with happy bare feet

         and who was my teacher
         and how did i know
         just when to be going
         and which way to go
         but always when wishing
         away i would steal
         away i would go to the land of the leal

         and now that im older
         i try to be wise
         but when i am troubled
         i still close my eyes
         and just like the wee lad
         away i will steal
         away i will go to the land of the leal

         for there are no questions
         and there are no lies
         and never a storm there
         to darken the skies
         the birds who are flying
         no freer they feel
         than i
         when i live in the land of the leal

     after the credit titles the music subsides and we slowly

                                                 fade out

     warm lights pour through the windows spreading
     over the snowpatched countryside  only the
     laboratory a converted greenhouse is dark shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic leafless oak
     a twohorse carriage in the style of the turn of
     the century lingers in the driveway  beyond all
     this the river thames takes a sharp curve

     a lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     knocks on it impatiently



     at the door                                            2

     the knock is answered by mrs watchett the house
     keeper a thin tense woman with iron gray hair
     the camera enters the hall with david filby an
     amiable redhaired young man of science who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat then rushes
     toward



     int library                                           3

     a pleasant edwardian room the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books many of ancient
     vintage

     three men are seated in a rough circle motionless
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs  the silence is accentuated by the
     merry crackling of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious ticking of innumerable timepieces about
     the room

     filby enters pauses to glance down then embarrassedly
     takes his chair

               dr philip hillyer is an imposing            a
               businessman wearing full sideburns
               he stares stonily at the last empty
               chair then at filby with annoyance

               anthony bridewell a man of the world       b
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion
               welcomes filby the only way he knows by
               lifting his glass of whiskey

               walter kemp a middle aged man with keen     c
               black piercing eyes angrily chews on
               his havana

               filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     d
               as

               hillyer glances impatiently at his           e
               watch comparing time with a grand
               father clock behind him then snaps
               it shut and glares at

     reaching the hour of eight it begins to strike its
     yellow chimes  other timepieces join in the announce
     ment



     groupshot                                              7

     the men look at each other until the chimes bells
     etc fade away  dr hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair

                         dr hillyer
               i say this is outright rude of the man

                         filbey
               hes undoubtedly been detained  thats
               all

     bridewell filling his glass is trying to say some
     thing but is interrupted by

                         kemp unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips
               this is such a confounded waste of
               time  if hes not coming ive any
               number of more important things to do

     all heads turn as mrs watchett enters closing the
     door quietly behind her  with an envelope in her
     hand she stands there hesitating

                         dr hillyer
               speak up  what is it woman

     she is taken aback for a moment then walks over
     to filby and hands him the open envelope  he
     takes his time in extracting the note

                         bridewell
               wellare we or are we not invited
               to dinner

                         filby reading
               apparently we are
                    to mrs watchett
               how long has he been gone

                         mrs watchett nervously
               i cant rightly say sir  several
               daysi hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately  he never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his mealsbut he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions
                    pointing to note

                         filby
               thank you mrs watchett

     a faint nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door

                         dr hillyer indicating the
                    note
               what does it say filby  whats
               wrong

                         filby
               nothing really  george merely says
               that if he is not here by eight were
               to begin without him

     kemp tears the note out of filbys hand and reads it
     hurriedly  meanwhile mrs watchett swings the door
     open and turns around

                         mrs watchett
               dinner is served gentlemen

                         bridewell puts his glass
                    down
               first sensible thing ive heard all
               evening

     he rises and starts for the dining room  the others
     follow

     as they walk toward the dining room

                         filby
               this is peculiar  he is usually very
               prompt precise and punctual

                         dr hillyer
               hes making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up
               its not the behavior of a gentleman

                         kemp
               to say nothing of the waste of
               time

                         dr hillyer agreeing
               to say nothing of the waste of
               time

     bridewell already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down  this time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied

                         bridwell arises lifting
                    his glass
               one thing i will say for george he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               englandand mrs watchett is the
               finest cook in the world  i think
               ill drink to that

     the glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the sound of dropping trays and a piercing scream
     all look in the direction of another door across
     the room



     the door  full shot                                   9

     it bursts inward and mrs watchett her hair flying
     dashes down the steps panicstricken into the room
     the camera rushes with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet  clutching filbys arm
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door

                         mrs watchett frightened
               therethere

     all stare os hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand



     corridor through doorway  full shot                   10

     we see the figure of a man approaching a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage  he is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward limping  the man comes
     closer his features still blacked out by shadows
     but as he nears the doorway the light from the
     room strikes first his legs then his body and
     finally his face  here he stops

     this is our first meeting with the time traveller
     for so it will be convenient to speak of him  at
     this instant he is in a sorry state  his clothing
     is tattered and dirty his face pale bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue  for
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room



     filby and bridewell  moving shot                      11

     they come to life  bridewell noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with filby toward the time traveller

                         filby
               good lord  whats happened

     reaching him each seizes an elbow to support him
     bridewell throws a frantic glance at dr hillyer
     back at the table  the time traveller however
     moves forward under his own power

                         time traveller
               im all rightjust some fooda
               drink

     he reaches the table and sinks into his chair  with
     trembling hands bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine spilling most of it over the tablecloth
     the time traveller looks up at him with a wry smile

                         time traveller
               are you all right

     a stunned bridewell is unable to speak while the time
     traveller empties his glass

                         bridewell a delayed
                    answer
               of course  imall right

     meanwhile mrs watchett hovers over the time traveller
     like a mother hen

                         mrs watchett half
                    apology half concern
               i didnt recognize youit was
               so dark

     the camera moves in as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him but he pushes it away

                         time traveller
               meatim hungry for meat

     mrs watchett grasps the carving knife from dr
     hillyer and with a single slash cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate



     groupshot                                              12

     the time traveller eats the men watching him
     curiously  finally dr hillyer leans forward

                         dr hillyer
               well cant you speak man  what
               happened to you  arent you going
               to tell us

                         bridewell
               leave him alone cant you

                         time traveller swallowing
               its all right  i want to tell

                         filby
               it will keep george  eat rest a
               little

                         time traveller
               no  i must tell it now while i
               still remember

                         filby
               relax try to relax a bit  youve
               all the time in the world



     close on the time traveller                            13

     as he looks up amused

                         time traveller
               youre right david
                    almost to himself
               thats exactly what i have 
               all the time in the world
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago the last day of
               eighteen hundred ninety nine

     slowly the camera moves in closer while everyone
     listens so intensely that aside from the time
     travellers voice only the ticking of a pendulum
     clock is heard

                                         slowly dissolve



     int  ebony box on table  close shot afternoon     14

     note  the slow dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the ebony box
             emerging from the time travellers brain

                         time travellers voice
               there in that box rests the result
               of two years labor

     the camera draws back to reveal the library  the time
     traveller wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe
     sits in his favorite chair behind the ebony box
     across from him in another chair sits dr hillyer
     puffing his cigar  bridewell and filby have glasses
     in their hands  kemp nothing  all are looking at
     the box

                         time traveller
                    continues
               i wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began  i barely
               made it

                         bridewell
               marvelous

                         dr hillyer stands up
               what is it

                         time traveller
               well it has to do with time

                         dr hillyer
                    steps to box
               ive always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece
               the navy needs one the army needs
               one  for the artillery you know

                         kemp leaning forward
               couldnt do better george  so
               thats why youve been in hiding 
               clever of you indeed

                         filby studying the time
                    travellers reaction
               i dont believe george is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece

                         time traveller
               when i speak of time im referring
               to the fourth dimension

     a perplexed look comes over bridewells face
     dr hillyer registers concern  kemp looks troubled
     only filby expresses avid interest

                         filby
               go on george

                         time traveller
               now as you know the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension

               if you dont mind george would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions

                         dr hillyer
               really filby they must have
               taught you something at school

                         bridewell baiting
                    dr hillyer
               suppose you explain it doctor

                         dr hillyer
               certainly
                    he demonstrates
                     pompously
               when i move in a straight line
               forward or backward thats one
               dimension  when i move to the
               left or right two dimensions 
               when i move up and down three
               dimensions
                    a bright idea lights up
                    his face  at last he can
                    get ahold of the box but
                    filby interferes before
                    dr hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing
               for instance this box has three
               dimensions  length breadth and
               height

                         bridewell amazed
               well then whats the fourth
               dimension

                         dr hillyer
               well thatsthats mere theory
               no one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists



     the time traveller  med shot                         15

     leaning forward in his chair

                         time traveller
               on the contrary doctor  the
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three  in fact they couldnt
               exist without it

                         dr hillyer enters the shot
               how do you mean

                         time traveller
               well take that box  it has the
               first three dimensions as you said
               but what if it didnt exist in time
               it wouldnt exist at all would it

                         dr hillyer
               no

                         time traveller
               so  for an object to exist at all
               it must exist in the fourth dimen
               sionand that fourth dimension
               is durationtime

                         dr hillyer impatiently
               all right  but whats in that box

                         time traveller
               im coming to that  but first
               consider  why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension  because
               we have no freedom to move in it  we
               can move in the other three  up
               down forward backward sideways
               but when it comes to time we are
               prisoners  do you follow me anthony

               george  youve given a most lucid
               explanation and all that  but i
               dont think i entirely understand

                         time traveller
               look  there are a lot of things in
               the world you dont understand
               arent there

                         kemp
               of course  quite a number

                         time traveller
               but you dont refuse to believe
               in them because of that

                         kemp
               not if i can see the proof with
               my own eyes

                         time traveller
               good  all im asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension
                    to dr hillyer
               philip will you please hand me
               that box

     all eyes turn to dr hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table lifts the box with surprise at its lightness
     and takes it to the time traveller  george opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

               ive told you  the larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through time  not through space
               mind you but through time

                         bridewell
               oh i say george  if you start
               floating around in the future arent
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us

                         dr hillyer

               thats the most important question
               to which i hope to find an answer
               can man control his destiny  can he

               this experiment can be performed

     they look at each other uncertain whether he is

                         dr hillyer
               where did it go

                         time traveller recovering
               go  nowhere in the usual sense
               its still here
                    indicating space where the
                    machine stood
               but its no longer in the present
               its traveling through time  to
               the future to be precise

                         dr hillyer
               do you seriously expect us to
               believe that

                         time traveller
               certainly

                         dr hillyer
               but you just said it hasnt
               really moved

                         time traveller
               thats correct

                         dr hillyer
               then why cant we see it

                         time traveller
               because were in this room on
               december 31st 1899 while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away  this room or even
               this house may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now  but the
               time machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey

     dr hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table

                         dr hillyer exasperated
               if it occupies the same space i
               should be able to feel it

                         time traveller
               you must remember that the space
               youve just put your hand through
               is todays space  you cant put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow

                         dr hillyer getting angry
               space is space  it doesnt change
               the same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now

                         time traveller
               no  time changes space  this flat
               ground were standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago  and a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain

                         time traveller
               for my part i intend to take a
               journey into the future  unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer

     there is no response

                         bridewell chuckling
               i say george  suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century
               how will you find your way back

                         time traveller quite
                    serious
               thats a calculated risk im prepared

     dr hillyer having controlled his fury now exchanges
     significant glances with kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness

                         dr hillyer
               now listen george  i dont
               know what you take us for but
               were not fools  there are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick  but a man of

     spots a newspaper on a nearby table apparently left by
     one of his guests and picks it up



     insert newspaper                                      40a

     a roll of drums in military fashion accents the headline
     that the boer army has won another victory



     close on time traveller                                40b

     he closes his eyes and added to the drums we hear
     the call to battle by a distant bugle  then more
     brass fifes and horns join the bugle and drums to take
     up a militant overture

     he loosens his collar then with sudden resolution
     strides toward

     the time traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the fg  he stands there and even in the darkness
     we can observe that he is an angry man  he strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture  the
     light comes up and the music stops as he stares
     across the room to see

     deep in thought he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals  the camera follows

                         time traveller
               i appreciate your gesture david
               but if you dont mind id rather
               you left me alone

                         filby
               you have changed george
               enormously

                         time traveller
               im sorry

                    directly
               will you answer me one question
               honestly

                         time traveller
               ill try

                         filby
               why this preoccupation with time

                         time traveller sharply
               why not

                         filby
               dont go simple on me george

                         time traveller a beat
                    then calmly
               if you want to know the truth i
               dont much care for the time i was
               born into  it seems people arent
               dying fast enough these days  they
               call upon science to invent new
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth

                         filby
               i quite agree with you  but here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it

                         time traveller
               you may have to  i dont

               a greek  a roman  one of the

                         time traveller
               i prefer the future

                         filby
               youre not seriously saying you can
               do it

                         time traveller
               you saw the experiment this afternoon
               didnt you

                         filby
               i saw a toy machine vanish  but
               im certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick  any
               magician at the hippodrome could
               probably do it

                         time traveller angrily
               it was no trick  would you care
               to see the fullscale model

                         filby
               no i would not  i have no desire
               to tempt the laws of providence and
               i dont think you should  its not
               for man to trifle with

                         time traveller
               now you sound like hillyer and kemp

                         filby

               destroys you

     distant sounds of new years celebrations are heard

                         time traveller

                         filby rising
               have it your own way

     he goes to the door



     at the door                                            60

     filby stops then turns around

                         filby
               will you promise me that you wont
               leave the house tonight

                         time traveller
               i promise you i wont walk out of
               the door

     filby a little puzzled by this strange promise turns
     to go as the time traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him

                         time traveller
               david  please dont think me un
               friendly  come over to dinner

               with you

                         filby with a warm smile
               whatever you say george  happy
               new year

                         time traveller shaking hands
               and a very happy new year to you david

     filby pats his arm before he leaves  the time traveller
     stands there until he hears the front door shut  then
     followed by the camera he goes to the writing table
     and sits down



     at the writing table                                   61

     the time traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads  1900 welcome new century
     he flips a few pages to find the next friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement  at this point mrs watchett
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him

                         mrs watchett
               will you be having supper in this
               evening sir

                         time traveller while ex
                    changing jackets with mrs
                    watchetts help
               i dont think so mrs watchett  why
               dont you take the evening off and
               celebrate

               needing me i think ill turn in early
               and get some sleep
                    indicating revelers outside
               it i can  goodnight sir

                         time traveller
               goodnight

     she turns to go as the time traveller calls after her

                         time traveller
               oh mrs watchett
                    as she responds
               ive invited mr filby and the others
               to dinner next friday
                    and then
               happy new year mrs watchett

                         mrs watchett
               happy new year sir

     mrs watchett exits closing the door after her  once
     again the time traveller is alone  he looks at the
     old calendar that reads  december 3l 1899 rips
     the final sheet from the pad crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns  with slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one  then he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table  he rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to

     the time traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway  here he pauses momentarily
     removes the key from his pocket unlocks the door then
     slowly swings it open as the music starts the theme of
     the picture



     int laboratory  full shot  night                  63

     the laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse  only a few potted plants remain  the
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants  only the glass skylight
     is clear  thick dark lowhanging clouds are pass
     ing beneath the moon dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows  as the slow mov
     ing clouds pass overhead a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we see workbenches numerous tools sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter

     but the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     time machine  it is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen

     however its size gives it a majestic quality  nickel
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle  while
     the miniature possessed a delicate appealing note the
     full size machine has an ominous look  the wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement



     close on time traveller  moving shot                  64

     staring at the machine hypnotized by his own crafts
     manship he locks the door with accustomed movement
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle  here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer
     the time traveller sets it in motion polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond  as he works his
     lips purse and he softly starts to whistle the melancholy
     strains of the land of the leal  a clock near him on
     the workbench reads  930

     satisfied with the buffing he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the machine  he settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever  there is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     machine

     then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at

     passing clouds

     he looks upwards for several moments  then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever  gently he urges it forward

     a humming sound similar to the one made by the model
     but more resonant starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the machine

     glow increases

     at once the time travellers hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the machine  the
     humming lessens and fades

               bad been before  but no

     the camera swings back to the workbench close where
     the clock now shows 1109 and the candle has burned
     shorter

                         time travellers voice excited

     he looks amazed then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain  it flips open
     showing almost 932

     flickers with the speed of a bees wing melting the
     candle down  the camera moves to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow
     light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise

     oratory wall and sweep across the time traveller and

     up and squints

     the camera pulls back as he steps out of his machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory  the once clear windows are now

     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out

     the furnishings previously seen lend the room a

     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches

     open it  even when he uses his shoulder it does

             conception that timetravelling does
             not involve geographical movement
             for instance the sharp curve of the
             river thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself

     the underscore for the scene  the time traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products

     significance of each he smiles with approval proud
     of his fellow man  his delight increases until he

     coming from the office is the warden dressed in a
     plastic suit  he also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet both bearing the insignia of civilian
     defense  mumbles are heard from beneath his mask
     as the camera pans him to the time traveller

     the time traveller looks up as he hears the
     approaching sirens of an ambulance  alarmed
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road  the driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the time traveller
     suddenly there is a blinding flash  he stops and
     looks startled

     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead as
     though the earth were being torn apart  it zigzags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise

     in the background across the hall the time traveller
     halts  he is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling  although ancient in appearance everything
     is ultra modern in design  sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken  faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls and at random about the floor are low
     tables some heavily fractured loaded with bowls
     of fruit

     the time traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit  everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared  yet there is no indication
     of life or sound either human or animal  the air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness  slowly the time
     traveller turns and looks around the walls his
     eyes searching scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place  there is none

     then he picks up an empty marble plate and pounds
     with it on the top of the table

                         time traveller shouting
               anyone here

     intercut inserts of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with closeups of time traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering silence and lack of life
     or movement

     the continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the time traveller which grows
     as he moves along  the apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum

     the trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze  the time traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement
     but all this is imaginary on his part  there is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest

     suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite human combination of noises  the sound
     splashing water and laughter  he hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out

     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand
     they are small but delicately formed  their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new

     he pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion but

     utter indifference

               there is no one older

     the time traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words  all of the little people seem to be
     of the girls age or younger

               doesnt anyone age in this land

     fallen over the distant hills

               because i shall return to my time

     they both shrug their shoulders

     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his machine beating the branches with
     his free hand  after he passes one of the bushes
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness  unaware of this the

     claws of the sphinx  with both hands now free
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down  taking a penknife
     from his pocket he runs the blade around the panels
     edge hunting for a secret latch  no success

     then he pauses searching for a tool and sees a
     loosened flagstone  he picks it up  with this
     heavy weight he batters the panel  at each blow
     it resounds loudly not unlike a gong  four times
     he strikes and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands  he stops in despair

     he senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence  alarmed he whips around then looks up
     to



     the sphinx  low angle  miniature or matte          208

     the marble face looks baleful almost smiling in
     the torch light



     back on time traveller                                 209

     he turns and peers toward



     the bushes                                             210

     in the shadows beyond reach of the light is a
     wide semicircle of luminous eyes reflecting the
     flame of the torch



     time traveller  full shot                             211213

     he grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush  but as he ap
     proaches the glowing eyes vanish in the haze
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale
     fleeing creatures

     the time traveller halts and turns in another
     direction  the same thing happens

     then he has an idea  bending he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it  now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits peering
     around until he hears a twig crack then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush looking off



     the path                                               214

     through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly  it emerges onto the lawn



     time traveller  med shot                             215

     the camera follows as he leaps forward grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth  for a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still  the time traveller rears back to
     get a look at it



     the figure on the ground  extreme close shot          216

     it is weena  the moving shadow of the time traveller
     reveals her pale face with closed eyes wearing an
     expression of helpless terror  she appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end but when it does
     not come she slowly opens her eyes  she sees the
     time traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief

     the camera withdraws to two shot as the time
     traveller embarrassed helps her sit up

                         weena
               i heard you poundingi came to
               tell you

                         time traveller
               how do you open that panel

                         weena
               no one opens it  only the morlocks

                         time traveller
               morlocks  who are the morlocks

     a look of fear comes into her eyes  she drifts
     her gaze away from his too frightened to answer
     gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him

                         time traveller
               why are you afraid of the morlocks

     again weena drops her eyes from him but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his

                         time traveller
               tell me

                         weena
               when they call we must go below

                         time traveller
               do the morlocks live beneath the
               earth
                    weena nods
               why must you obey their command

                         weena
               they give us the food we eat the
               clothes we wear  we must do as
               they command

                         time traveller
               what happens to your people when
               they go below

                         weena repressing an in
                    voluntary shudder
               no one knows  no one has ever
               returned

                         time traveller smiling
                    at her warmly reassuringly
               it wont happen to you

     weena looks up at him her fears dwindling find
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand  then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns

                         weena
               it is night

                         time traveller
               only children are frightened by
               the dark  but then you are a
               child arent you
                    weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows
                    her anxiety mounting
               ill build a fire

                         weena taking his
                    hand rises
               let us go from here

                         time traveller getting
                    up
               i cant child
                    walking toward the sphinx
               my machine is inside there i
               intend to wait here til morning
               then find some way of getting
               inside

                         weena catching up
               no you must not

                         time traveller stops
                    then
               help me gather some wood



     the lawn and the base  long shot                      217

     reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him

                         weena
               where are you from

                         time traveller picks
                    up dry branches
               as a matter of fact im from
               right here
                    gesturing
               theres where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago  here  to
               that monument was my laboratory
               about there was my library where i
               once sat talking with friends about
               my time machine

     meanwhile weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the fg

     she watches every move he makes

                         time travellers voice
                    continuing
               i hoped to learn a great deal  i
               hoped to take back the knowledge
               the advancement mankind made
               instead what do i find  vegetables

     meanwhile a pair of pale hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her

     with his back turned he is piling up the sticks

               the human race reduced to living
               vegetables



     back to weena                                          220

     the hairy hands grab her shoulders  the fear
     paralyzes her  she is unable to scream



     back to time traveller                                 221

     he is about to light a match but finds he needs
     more wood  without turning he calls back to weena

                         time traveller
               get me a few more twigs

     when there is no answer he turns and looks



     at the bushes                                          222

     weena is gone  the camera zips to left then to
     right and finally stops on the limp legs of weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush



     time traveller  moving shot                           223

     we hear the rustling of branches and quick diminishing
     footsteps as the camera rushes with the time traveller
     toward the bush  he helps weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches

                         time traveller
                    after calming her
               what was it

                         time traveller strikes
                    match and holds it to twigs
               this seems to keep them away

     she gazes into the fire with fascination  slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame



     two shot                                               225

     the time traveller grabs her hand  it is almost
     too late  she looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain

                         time traveller while
                    examining her hand
               what ever made you put your hand in
               the fire

                         weena
               i never saw it before

     apparently no harm done the time traveller releases
     her hand  he shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her

                         time traveller
                    after a long silence
               do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire
                    he looks at her
               no i suppose you dont
                    pokes at fire
               the next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel
                    turns to her
               do you know what that is
                    she shakes her head
               im sorry i was angry with your
               people  i had no right to be
               no more than if i had visited the
               island of bali in my own time
               you were safe inside your great
               house yet you came out into the
               night to warn me  the one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice  you have
               that quality girl  im sure all
               of your people have it  all it
               requires is someone to reawaken it
               i shall try if youll let me  will
               you

                         weena
               i do not understand you but i
               believe you

                         time traveller
               thats a good start  now try to
               tell mewho or what are the morlocks
                    weena looks at him blankly
               are they people or animals
                    her expression remains unchanged
               what do you know about yourself  the
               past  dont your people ever speak
               of the past

                         weena
               there is no past

                         time traveller
               dont you ever wonder about the future

                         weena
               there is no future



     another angle                                          226

     the time traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words

                         time traveller
               mans past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up  these rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing  i
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone
               weve had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them  all
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out  im only a tinkering
               mechanic but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people
               if i can only kindle that spark my
               coming here will have some meaning

     during his speech weena has cuddled close to him
     her cheek touching his knee  he looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend  he places his hand
     gently on her hair  she looks up her eyes no
     longer showing fear  their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames

     the ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark circular shaft from
     which comes the low throbbing of some giant
     machines pounding beating monotonously  the
     camera moves back to include the landscape
     where more wells are visible in the distance
     each surrounded by a low porcelain wall  their
     roofs are shining brasslike disks

     across the field from the direction of the sphinx
     approach the time traveller carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder and a few steps behind weena

               my efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless  i had to find
               another way to retrieve my machine

     walks up to the well in the fg and peers down into

                         weena
               no only heard of them

     the camera eases back to include the time traveller
     as he reaches her

                         time traveller
               who told you

                         weena
               the talking rings

                         time traveller
                    moves closer to her
               what sort of rings

                    with a shrug
               rings that talk

                         time traveller
               can you show me these rings

     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the young man had previously shown him

     she enters an archway and walks up a dark stone

     the time traveller and weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museumlike room all done in a greenish
     colored porcelainlike substance  there are no
     windows but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the suns rays changing with the course
     of day illuminate the entire museum  it is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit

     their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic  some of the cases are
     broken and their contents exposed to the atmos
     phere have decayed crumbled to dust  we recognize
     objects and machines some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary  then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension

     weena finally leads the time traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide lined

                    picking up a ring
               are these the talking rings

                         time traveller
               how do you get it to talk

     weena takes the ring from the time traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge like a coin and spins it like a top

     a voice emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves much like a phono
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records

                         voice from ring
               whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man  this is the

     weena in disinterested detachment

               the war between the east and west
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twentysixth year has at last
               come to an end  there is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight  the atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed  there is no place on
               this planet that is immune  the
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed  stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone
               we must die

     the last few words decrease in volume and fade away
     the time traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it

                         another voice from ring
               this is the last day  we the last
               to survive have had our final meeting
               we have decided to split into two
               groups  each man and woman has made
               his own decision  some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earths surface  the rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight small as those chances
               may be

     the voice from the ring dwindles and is heard no
     more  the time traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it  no words are
     heard  only the sound of marching footsteps over
     floors of stone  then a deadly silence

               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity which explained why
               there were no older people along them

               now i knew i must go below  it was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below

     the time traveller places his jacket on the wall
     then into the well he drops a dry leaf which instead
     of fluttering slowly down is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft  then he looks
     around and finds a pebble drops it down the well and
     listens

     after a plop is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes feeling its surface then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend  weena rushes to his side to stop him

                         weena
               you will not come back

                         time traveller
               ill be back

     weena shakes her head and as though giving him
     a farewell gift thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket  the time traveller smiles as he dis
     appears



     from throat of well  low angle                        243

     locking from below the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with weena peering down
     the time traveller gropes his way

     suddenly from the far distance comes the sound of
     low but powerful siren  weena straightens



     close on weena                                         244

     an expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the low siren is joined by another of higher
     pitch  the two make a grating dissonance  slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound



     back with time traveller                               245

     back to weena                                          246

     as the third discordant blast joins the other two
     weenas fear is gone  in its place is an expres
     sion of utter resignation  like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead  then as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal she starts
     walking away  the camera pans and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves

     note  during the above and throughout the follow
             ing sequence the dirgelike whistles
             continue echoing mournfully

     strains of the sirens

     free himself  his movements are almost mechanical

     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall
     the gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver
     ing lights revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows

     this is obviously a feasting place of the morlocks
     in the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away

               into the lowest form of human
               lifecannibalism

     the match dies between his fingers  suppressing a

     the tt wielding the whip fiercely drives the

     we begin to hear the

                      time travellers voice
                 calmly
             the underworld of the morlocks was
             goneand so was the life of leisure
             for the eloi

     the man in white with others approaches the group
     headed by the young man  the two men look at each
     other their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear

                      time travellers voice
             from now on they would have to work
             to survive  and looking at their
             faces i somehow knew that they could
             start over again



     back to time traveller and weena                       377

     he looks down to weena and we hear

                      time travellers voice
             another night was coming but this
             night no eloi needed to fear

     the camera moves close on time traveller who looks
     up in concern

                      time travellers voice
             but what of me  i was imprisoned
             in a world in which i did not belong

     this is the same pool where the time traveller
     saved weenas life  the peaceful sound of the
     rushing stream is occasionally interrupted by a
     remote rumble of explosion from the earth below

     there is no sign in the sky of old constellations
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar
     the time traveller wearing his velvet jacket
     relaxes on the white sand playing with the
     blossom weena gave him earlier that day and
     whistling the land of the leal

     weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool washing the soot from her face and hands
     she glances over to the time traveller

                      weena
             are you sorry

     he stops whistling but the music continues
     he turns

                      time traveller
             sorry  sorry for what

                      weena
             that you have to stay

                      time traveller
                 gazing into the night
             yes  i am sorry because i could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time i could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them  they could
             learn from itor would they

                      weena
             you dont want to stay do you

                      time traveller
             it isnt that but i dont fit here
             anymore than you would in my time

                      weena
                 a pause and then
             i would like to see your time

                      time traveller
             no girl you wouldnt be very
             happy there

                      weena
             do you have someone like me 
             there

                      time traveller
             no  no one like you  but there
             are friends who will miss me  as
             a matter of fact im probably late
             already

                      weena
                 stealing a glance
                 then quietly
             women

                      time traveller
             no men
                 teasing
             there is a woman too of course
                 noticing her disappointment
                 he relents
             she looks after my house for me
             she is sixtytwo years old  much
             older than you are

     weena relieved starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement

                      weena
                 suddenly
             how do they wear their hair

                      time traveller
             who

                      time traveller
                 with awkward gesture
             like this

                      weena
             show me

     the time traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket gets up and walks over to weena



     weena  med shot                                      379

     the time traveller appears behind her  he first
     hesitates then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept edwardian style  she
     smiles then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him

                      weena
                 innocently
             would i be pretty

     the gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his
     he still holds her upswung hair and as he gazes
     into her young eyes he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek

                      time traveller
                 slowly
             yesyou would be  more than
             pretty
                 his voice sinks to a whisper
             i wish we could go back together
             weena back to my own timeor to
             times before that when the world
             was young  we could

     excited voices os interrupt this interlude  they
     both look in the direction of the voices

     in white approach them talking excitedly
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke  the face is

     panel is open

     the face is broken in half  it is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye  the rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal  beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world  the time
     traveller and weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn  here they stop

     have not yet reached the machine

     he releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the machine
     will not function

                         time traveller without
                    looking at her
               come girl

     he walk toward the panel  weena follow
     hesitantly but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold  unmindful of this
     the time traveller enters

     shooting from inside the pedestal the time
     traveller and his machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground while beyond him weena stands
     on the lawn outside the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features

     inside black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the time traveller examines his machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place

     the time traveller working eagerly  a shadow
     starts sliding across his figure moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a clang



     outside the panels                                     388

     weena seeing the panels close runs up to them
     and pounds her fists vainly on the metal doors

     the time traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them  from without he hears weenas
     pounding and cries  suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx  for a moment there is
     silence  then from the right comes a hacking
     weak cough  another from the left  then some
     thing stumbles off down the stairway  he whirls
     around gasping and coughing to see three of the
     enmaddened morlocks rising before him  avoiding
     them he stumbles to his machine and gets into
     the saddle  the suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever  morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the machine  the fire and
     smoke become dense half obliterating the struggling
     bodies

     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene
     as the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration  he looks off to see

     the time machine has returned but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it

     in the gloom the time traveller clambers pain
     fully from the machine  then followed by camera
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it
     his eyes explore the room and finally come to rest

     sitting silently around the table  mrs watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur  the time traveller
     is puffing on his pipe  kemp is chewing on his

     with the spoon which clinks loudly in the rooms

     from his brandy

     he alone starts to laugh at his joke but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that  mrs watchett
     steps to the time traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy

               thank you david for being such
               a good friend  always

               what do you think filby

                         filby after a pause
               one thing is certain  those
               flowers couldnt have possibly
               bloomed in the wintertime

               you dont really think that story

     in the falling snow  he waits until the carriage
     disappears then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it  he pauses a moment then
     uses the heavy knocker  there is still no answer
     he steps back and looks off toward the

     the coals still glow in the grate as filby enters
     the fully lit room looking for his friend
     suddenly a clock from the neighboring room chimes
     once  filby turns goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway



     dining room  filbys pov                           422

     the table is cleared candles extinguished  the
     pendulum clock is ticking lazily  the time is
     930



     filby  panshot                                        423

     he calls into the darkness

                         filby
               george

     no answer  then an odd humming sound brings
     him to stiff attention  the sound increases in
     volume and pitch until the entire house seems
     to tremble  then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory

     filby pivots and runs up the steps through the
     corridor



     at the door of laboratory  full shot                  424

     filby dishevelled and out of breath arrives
     and tries the door  it is locked  the noise
     is almost deafening  he puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open  at the
     very instant he does so the sound ceases abruptly
     he stops short gazing aghast



     the laboratory  filbys pov                        425

     the time traveller with his machine fading
     leaving the present

     then the camera moves across the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the time machine  it is
     not there  the camera whips to the other corner
     nor is it there  a few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor



     close on filby                                         426

     he looks tense ignoring the approaching footsteps
     behind him  mrs watchett hurries in

                         mrs watchett nervous
                    breathless
               oh mr filbywhat
                    her eyes widen

                         filby with finality
               hes gone

     the camera follows mrs watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room  here with
     squinting eyes she leans down to observe the
     floor

                         mrs watchett to
                    filby
               theres something funny here sir

     filby steps aside her to investigate



     what they see                                          427

     the camera moves along parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the time machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx  they are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood  here not only its
     imprint but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved

     they straighten  mrs watchett looks at filby
     puzzled

                         filby
               i think i understand  look



     laboratory  full shot                                 429

     mrs watchett listens as filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the machine first stood and
     explains

                         filey pointing
               see the imprint  this is where
               the time machine originally
               stood
                    he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves
               but the morlocks moved it
               they dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinxright
               here
                    turns and points
               and weena was standing there when
               he last saw herthe same space 
               in a different time  so he moved
               back his heavy machine from here
               across the room scratching this
               floor
                    indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint
               so that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the eloi
               build a new worldand build a
               new world of his own

                         mrs watchett faintly
                    sentimentally
               where he left her

     filby doesnt answer  he looks about the labora
     tory for the last time then takes mrs watchetts
     arm and leads her from the room  the music starts
     the theme  the land of the leal

     filby and mrs watchett come into the room

                         filby
               but it isnt like george  to
               return empty handed  to try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan
                    to mrs watchett
               he must have taken something
               with him

                         mrs watchett
               nothing

     she looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves  she walks to
     them

                         mrs watchett
               nothing except three books

                         filby
               which three books

                         mrs watchett
               i dont know  is it important

                         filby smiles
               no i suppose not  onlywhat
               three books would you have taken

     she looks at him pondering the question as they
     leave the library



     int entrance hall                                     431

     they stop at the door and mrs watchett stands
     beside filby as he opens it  outside the snow
     is falling softly

                         mrs watchett
               mr filby do you think he will
               ever return

                         filby quietly
               one cannot choose but wonder 
               you seehe has all the time in
               the world

     with these words filby turns up his collar pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night  mrs watchett looks after him  she
     hears the sound of his diminishing footsteps
     squeaking in the virgin snow  slowly she closes
     the door

     drifting like a curtain the snow falls quietly
     as filby a solitary figure in the night pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home

                                            slow fade out



                          the end
