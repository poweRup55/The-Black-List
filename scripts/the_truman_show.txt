     a fogged mirror

     behind the fog we hear the sounds of a bathroom  after a 
     long moment a hand wipes the condensation from the glass to 
     reveal the face of truman burbank  he wears a sleeveless 
     hanes undershirt and bluestripe pajama bottoms behind him a 
     white glazed tiled bathroom wall  it is immediately apparent
     that we are viewing him through a twoway mirror

     truman expressionless studies his reflection in the mirror  
     for a long moment he does nothing  he continues to look 
     impassively into the mirror for what becomes an uncomfortably 
     long time  still nothing  finally he speaks talking to 
     himself in the mirror as if participating in a tv interview

                          truman
                personally i think the unconquered
                south face is the only one worth
                scalingof course its a 20000 foot
                sheer wall of ice but then when did that
                ever stop me beforenaturally i
                intend to make the ascent without the
                benefit of oxygen but also without
                crampons or even an ice pickrisks
                     smug tv smiles
                sure im aware of the riskswhy else
                do you think i would spend seven years as
                an adjuster in a life insurance
                company

                          meryl os
                truman youre gonna be late

     truman resignedly opens the door of the cabinet and replaces
     his shaving tackle  it partially obscures the lens of the
     hidden camera  he closes the door and exits


     int  kitchen  morning

     meryl wearing a stylish robe sits at the kitchen table 
     sipping coffee  on the table in front of her lies a parcel  
     truman enters and glances at the gift

                          truman
                whats that

                          meryl
                its a surprise

     truman unwraps the parcel  an expensivelooking set of 
     exercise sweats

                          meryl
                     eager for his response
                well what do you think

                          truman
                theyre
                     the merest hesitation
                perfect  thank you

     truman returns meryls kiss

                          meryl
                     handing him the sweat top
                try it on

     truman pulls the top over his head  as he does so a closer 
     shot focuses on the manufacturers name

                          meryl
                i thought you could wear them when 
                you do your exercises
                     afterthought
                preshrunk  and they breathe


     ext  trumans house  day

     wearing a business suit briefcase in hand truman emerges 
     from his pleasant victorianinspired picketfenced house 
     into an idyllic suburban street of similarly picturesque 
     homes  a neighbor spencer is taking in trashcans 
     whistling a tune  spencer breaks off abruptly as truman 
     approaches his car  his license plate readsseahaven  a

                          truman
                     petting the dog

     truman exchanges a polite nod with the washingtons an

     truman is about to climb into his car when he is distracted 
     by a highpitched whistling sound  suddenly a large 
     spherical glass object falls from the sky and lands with a 
     deafening crash on the street several yards from his car

     the startled truman looks to spencer but he has abruptly 
     disappeared inside his house with pluto  mrs washington and 
     washington junior have also made themselves scarce

     truman investigates  amidst a sea of shattered glass are the 
     remains of a light mechanism

     he looks around him but the street is deserted  he checks 
     that all the surrounding street lights are accounted for 
     even though the fallen fixture is far larger  he looks up 
     into the sky but there is no plane in sight  with some 
     effort truman picks up whats left of the crumpled light and
     loads it into the trunk  a label on the light fixture readssirius 9 canis majoras he drives away we hear the 
     sound of his car radio

     intext  trumans car  seahaven  day

     truman makes his way along the streets of seahaven past a 
     series of quaint pastelshaded cottages


     ext  seahaven island township  day

     a highangle reveals an anonymous midsized town built around 
     a small pretty bay  a cluster of highrise buildings stand 
     at the waters edge overlooking a marina  surrounding the 
     commercial center lie neatly arranged suburbs


     ext  oceanside street  day

     pausing at a traffic light along a seaside road truman looks 
     through a curious wooden arch to the beach and ocean beyond  
     the sight triggers a memory in his headplayback ext  long wide beach  dayunlike a conventional flashback the scene in his memory 
     appears to be playing on a television screenfouryearold truman runs towards a bluff on the beach

     the boys father kirk latethirties beer bottle in hand 
     flirts with two teenage girls at the shoreline  suddenly 
     the father remembers his son  he looks anxiously around  
     the sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him 
     to drop his bottle in the sand and run to truman

     the boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated 
     father comes within earshot

                          father
                     out of breath clutching his side
                truman  truman  stop

     truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his 
     father  but the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the 
     anger and distress on his fathers face

                          father
                come down now

     his fathers unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more 
     tantalizing  the boy considers defying his father  he puts 
     his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek 
     at the other side  one good stretch would do it

                          father
                     reading trumans mind enraged
                no

                          truman
                why  whats there

                          father
                     unconvincing
                nothing  itsits dangerous
                     trace of desperation
                come down now  please

     truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other 
     beachgoers have stopped their activities to stare at him  
     reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks  
     when he finally jumps to the sand his father embraces him 
     and leads him away

                          father
                i told you to stay close  dont ever 
                leave my sight again
                     pause
                youve got to know your limitations  you
                couldve fallen


     int  trumans car  downtown seahaven  morning presentthrough his car window truman buys a cup of coffee from a 
     streetside vendor

                          vendor
                how are ya truman

                          truman
                     placing his fingers to his pulse
                vital signs are good

     he pulls into a parking space and sips on the coffee  as he 
     drinks he becomes aware of a school bell summoning children 
     to class in the adjacent elementary school  the image 
     prompts another childhood memoryplayback int  seahaven elementary school  classroom  dayonce again the flashback appears to be playing on a

     the class titters  marlon sits down and winks to truman

                          school mistress
                what about you truman

     truman rises to his feet gathering his nerve

                i want to be an explorer

                do that truman  you might have to find
                something a little more practical
                     glancing to a pulldown wall
                     map behind her head
                besides youre too late  theres 
                really nothing left to explore

     the class roars with laughter as the crestfallen truman takes 
     his seat


     ext  parking lot  day presenttruman briefcase in hand crosses from the parking lot to 
     the town square surrounded by similarly suited briefcase
     toting office workers


     ext  downtown seahaven  day

     truman walks briskly down the bustling city street  a snarl 
     of taxis buses and commuter traffic  a street vendor
     thrusts a pretzel under trumans nose a career woman tries
     to catch his eye

     truman stops at a kiosk and buys a newspaper the island 
     timesvendor
                is that all for you truman

                          truman
                thats all  thanks errol

     other customers also purchase the morning paper  tucking his 
     copy under his arm truman selects a glossy magazine from a 
     rack quickly flicking through the pages

     glancing in the direction of the newspaper vendor and finding 
     him busy with another customer truman deftly tears a portion 
     of the open page and pockets the cutting  he hastily
     replaces the magazine and departs

     as truman hurries away the vendor exits the kiosk and picks 
     up the magazine instantly turning to the torn page  it is a 
     cosmetics advertisement with the models nose missing  
     however the vendor makes no effort to confront truman 
     almost as if he were expecting it


     ext  seahaven life and accident inc  day

     truman passes along a row of shops and offices finally 
     entering a building that proudly proclaimsseahaven life  
     accident incabove the entrance  he has evidently taken 
     his teachers advice


     int  insurance company  seahaven life and accident inc day

     in a cramped cluttered cubicle truman talks on the telephone

                          truman
                     into receiver

                     into receiver

     the clerk shrugs returns the book to his cart and continues 
     his rounds

                          truman
                     returning to his call
                just think about what ive been saying
                and let mehello

     the person on the other end has hung up  with an apathetic 
     shrug truman replaces the receiver  he looks over his 
     shoulder and places another call

                          truman
                     lowering his voice
                can you connect me with directory 
                inquiries in fiji

     a coworker suddenly pokes his head over the neighboring cubicle

                          coworker
                what do you know truman

                          truman

                     waving off his neighbor pretending

                im sorry maam  if hes in a coma 
                hes probably uninsurable

     the coworker disappears back into his own cubicle

                          truman
                     lowering his voice again
                hello operatoryesfijido you have

     the disconsolate truman replaces the receiver  other 
     insurance agents are heading to lunch  truman puts on his 
     jacket and follows them to the elevators


     int  local italian deli  lunchtime

     behind a deli counter tyrone fifties is having his hair 
     brushed by a young man  the man fusses one final time then 
     swiftly departs through a rear door just as truman enters
     the store  tyrone has anticipated trumans order and has 
     already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on 
     an italian roll  truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully 
     under construction pained by his own predictability

                          tyrone
                     nauseatingly cheerful
                hows it going truman

                          truman
                     deadpan

                          tyrone
                     not listening to trumans reply
                good  good

                          truman
                tyrone what if i said i didnt want

                          tyrone
                     not missing a beat passing
                     truman his wrapped sandwich
                id ask for identification

     truman forces a halfsmile and exits

                          tyrone
                see you tomorrow truman

                          truman
                you can count on it


     ext  secluded park  day

     truman eats lunch alone at a small outoftheway park 
     dominated by a gazebo  from his briefcase he pulls out an 
     old hardcovered bookto the ends of the earth  the age of
     explorationhe reads to himself his sandwich uneaten 
     beside him  struck by a particular passage he reads aloud

                          truman
                with a mutiny but halfrepressed and 
                starvation imminent he pressed southward
                till he found the longhopedfor
                straits

     truman is interrupted by a transient in a wheelchair  it is 
     the mans sneakers truman notices first over the top of his 
     book  they are distinctively initialed ts  still under
     the spell of the account of magellan he hands the grateful 
     man his sandwich


     int  a conference room somewhere  day

     a group of a dozen men and women of varying ages sit around a 
     circular conference table in a sterile windowless meeting room
     all stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the 
     table anticipating a call  on cue the phone rings and one of
     the men after waiting for the second ring picks up

                          man
                helloim sorry ive got more than
                enough life insurance

     he hangs up  after a moment the phone rings again


     int  insurance company  day

     truman sits at his desk making a cold call

                          truman
                     into receiver
                this isnt about insurance this is
                about the great variable  when will

                umbrella no way you can guard against
                that kind of thing no way at all

     the prospect on the other end unimpressed with trumans 
     pitch hangs up  trumans supervisor lawrence younger than 
     truman by several years sharper suit sharper haircut 
     appears around the corner of the cubicle

                          lawrence
                     handing truman some 
                     documentation
                hey burbank ive got a prospect in 
                welles park i need you to close

     trumans face falls  he stares out of his third floor window 
     at the hazy skyline of a nearby island across the bay

                          truman
                     referring to the island
                welles park on harbor island

                          lawrence
                     sarcastic

                i cant do it

                     excuse

                          lawrence
                     insistent

                you dont meet your quota burbank
                     the threat in his voice 
                     is unmistakable
                theyre making cutbacks at the end of the
                month  you need this
                     as he exits the cubicle
                besides a half hour across the bay  sea
                air  do you good

     truman sinks back into his seat and stares out at the distant 
     skyline  the buildings appear very still  truman picks up a 
     photo of his wife meryl deposits it in his briefcase and 
     exits


     ext  seahaven  day

     trumans car heads out of the city on its way to the ferry


     int  seahaven ferry terminal  day

     truman exits his car  mustering all his nerve he marches 
     into the seahaven terminal and buys a token for the ferry

     out of his hearing two ferry workers observe trumans 
     agitated behavior

                          ferry worker 1
                i got a feeling this is the day

                          ferry worker 2
                no way  i say he makes it through the
                turnstiles but he never gets on

     the two men shake on the wager  unaware of the scrutiny 
     truman passes through the turnstiles with a herd of tourists 
     and commuters  he makes his way across the terminal but 
     abruptly pulls up at the gangway

     as the other passengers impatiently brush past him onto the 
     boat truman remains frozen to the spot mesmerized by the 
     scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock  it 
     triggers a memory in his headplayback ext  seahaven harbor  dayas always the flashback appears to play on a television 
     screensevenyearold truman wearing a lifejacket sits alongside 
     his father kirk in a small sailing dinghy sailing into a 
     stiff breeze

     a second sail boat circles them  we observe the father and 
     son from an angle atop the mast of the neighboring vessel

                          truman
                     shouting above the wind
                lets go further daddy  lets go 
                further

                          kirk
                     shouting back
                its getting rough truman

                          truman
                     entreating his father
                please

     kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading 
     towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon


     int  seahaven ferry terminal  day presenttruman turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of
     passengers boarding the ferry emerging back onto the street 
     gasping for air  the ferry workers settle their wager


     ext  roadway adjacent to the ferry terminal  day

     truman stands at a payphone  by stretching the payphones 
     receiver cord as far as it will go he is just able to reach 
     his arm and leg into the drivers door of his car  he 
     punctuates his conversation with blasts on the cars horn 
     while revving the cars engine with his outstretched foot  
     the few passing motorists and pedestrians regard truman 
     curiously

                          truman
                     shouting into phone
                i tell you the traffics insane
                     blasting his horn several
                     times to imitate the sound of
                     of gridlock
                ill never make the ferry in time
                what can i dowhatlawrence i cant 
                hear you

     truman hangs up the phone


     int  trumans car  day

     on his way home a largedetoursign forces him onto a 
     secondary road


     int  trumans car  parkland seahaven  day

     truman drives along a winding road through parkland  he
     pulls up at a red light  no other traffic around  his 
     attention is caught by an attractive young woman sitting on
     a park bench not far from the intersection  she is being 
     taunted by two young thugs  she attempts to ignore the
     youths by concentrating on the book on her lap

                          youth 1
                     to woman
                you wanna read to me

     his companion smirks

                          youth 1
                     more insistent
                you wanna read to me

     the boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp

                          youth 2
                     menacing
                my friend asked you a question

     the woman picks up her bag in a reflex and holds it to her  
     she looks about for assistance briefly catching trumans eye  
     the youths also look in trumans direction staring him down

                          woman
                     reaching for the book
                please

     the boy returns the book to the woman but before doing so 
     rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his 
     shirt pocket

                          youth 2
                now youre gonna have to ask me how 
                it ends

     one of the youths grabs the woman dragging her toward the 
     surrounding woods

                          youth 1
                were gonna tell you how it ends baby

                          woman
                help  please help

     as they drag her towards the undergrowth truman horrified 
     half gets out of the car  fearful of his own safety as much 
     as the womans  truman shouts to the youths his voice 
     cracking with fear

                          truman
                hey  let her go

     a huge truck suddenly appears behind trumans car its horn 
     blasting the driver hurling abuse  truman hesitates as the 
     youths drag the woman into the bushes conflicted over
     whether or not to help  the truck driver keeps his hand on 
     the horn  truman retreats back into his car and reluctantly 
     drives on


     ext  parkland  woods  day

     trumans car safely out of sight the youths promptly release 
     the young woman  she calmly brushes herself off no longer 
     afraid  the young men no longer angry retrieve her bag

                          woman
                thanks

     the threesome walks back towards the roadway as if lifelong 
     friends

                          woman
                     pondering the incident
                he did nothing

                          youth 1
                     shrugs suddenly more couth
                physical violence paralyzes him  always has


     ext  trumans house  dusk

     beyond the pretty picket fence at the end of the property 
     flows a busy highway

     truman is mowing the lawn  from his expression it would seem 
     that hes still reflecting on his inaction in the park  he 
     switches off the mower and leans on the handle

     he is distracted by the arrival of his wife meryl exiting 
     the house  she wears a nurses uniform and carries a curious 
     metal device attached to a card board backing  she kisses 
     truman affectionately on the cheek

                          meryl
                hi honey  look at this
                     proudly referring to the device
                its a chefsmate  dicer slicer and
                peeler in one  never needs sharpening
                dishwasher safe

                          truman
                gee thats great

     looking over trumans shoulder meryl notices a small uncut 
     patch of grass missed by truman in one of his passes

                          meryl
                     referring to the uncut grass
                you missed a section

     meryl enters the house  truman restarts the lawnmower and 
     obediently pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn  as 
     the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of
     grass truman pulls back abruptly  he checks the kitchen 
     window for meryl and wheels the mower away leaving the patch 
     uncut


     int  trumans house  living room  night

     meryl is removing the cap of her nurses uniform when truman 
     enters

                          truman
                how did it go today

                          meryl
                     matteroffact
                a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw
                     shrug
                we got three of his fingers back on

     truman retrieves a bucket of golf balls and a golf club from 
     behind the door

                          meryl
                     disappointed at the sight of
                     the golf equipment
                i was hoping we could have a special 
                evening

                          truman
                i wont be late

                          meryl
                     sensing something odd in his
                     demeanor
                did something happen today

     truman turns to her too sharply his guilt showing

                          truman
                what could happen

     truman exits


     ext  unfinished bridge  night

     a halfconstructed bridge paved but unmarked ends abruptly 
     in midair  reinforcing steel protruding from the concrete  
     truman stands at the end of the unfinished bridge with
     marlon thirties a wellfilled physique  marlon drinks beer 
     from a can while truman addresses a teedup golf ball with a 
     number three wood  the headlights of their two parked cars 
     light the cement fairway  their target is a sign at the
     far end of the bridge proclaimingthe seahaven causeway  
     linking seahaven island with the rest of the world  your tax 
     dollars at work an upturned plastic cone at the foot of 
     the sign is the hole

     truman winds up and swings making a healthy contact with the 
     ball  the ball arches away into the night sky  from a new 
     angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of 
     the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt beyond 
     the sign

     marlon tosses truman another offwhite ball from a bucket of 
     badly scarred golf balls  truman sets the ball up on the 
     makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot  
     with a slight fade the second ball carries even further than 
     the first

                          marlon
                whose nuts were those

     truman hands marlon their sole golf club without comment  
     marlon tees up a ball of his own he uses orange golf balls

                          truman
                im thinking of getting out marlon

                          marlon
                     mild interest only
                yeah  outta what

                          truman
                outta my job outta seahaven off this
                islandoutmarlon takes a practice swing

                          marlon
                outta your job  what the hells wrong
                with your job  you gotta great job  you
                gotta desk job  id kill for a desk job

     marlon addresses the ball and swings  a sweeping hook shot 
     that bounces off the freeway and into the water hazard

                          marlon
                     annoyed by the errant tee shot
                sonofabitch
                     still looking in the 
                     direction of his ball
                try stocking vending machines for a 
                living  my biggest decision of the day
                is whether the almond joys look better
                next to the snickers or the baby ruths

     truman selects another m ball from the bucket and tosses it 
     to marlon

                          truman
                     adamant
                havent you ever gotten itchy feet

     overcompensating with his second shot marlon slices the ball in
     the other direction  a lucky bounce keeps it on the green 
     the ball rolls in the direction of the upturned cone

                          marlon
                     skeptical picking up his beer
                where is there to go

     truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer

                          truman
                     unable to disguise his
                     reverencefijimarlon considers trumans suggestion as he sips his beer

                          marlon
                     impressed
                fiji  where the hell is fiji exactly
                near florida  you cant drive there
                can you

     truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate  he points to a 
     dimple on his makeshift globe

                          truman
                see here this is us
                     sliding his finger around
                     the other side of the ball
                all the way round here fiji  you cant
                get any further away before you start
                coming back
                     tossing the world in his
                     hand warming to his subject
                yknow there are still islands in fiji
                where no human has ever set foot

                          marlon
                     still dubious
                so when are you leaving

                          truman
                its not that simple  takes money 
                planning  you cant just up and go
                     heading off marlons skepticism
                oh im going to do it dont worry about
                that  ive just got to move slow  pick
                my moment  bonus times just around the

                     as if to convince himself
                im going dont you worry about that

     marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is
     beyond his imagination

                          marlon
                i never knew anybody who wanted to leave
                seahaven

     an awkward moment  truman once again not so sure of himself


     int  a dimlylit room somewhere  night

     a man looks up sharply  he stares into camera  christof      late
     fifties  a vitality in his eyes that belies his years  a news
     anchorstyle earpiece disappears down the neck of his suit


     ext  bridge  night

     truman and marlon wander along the empty bridge retrieving 
     the golf balls

     marlon goes to say something to the disconsolate truman but 
     is momentarily distracted  he raises his hand to his ear  
     truman places another of the balls in the bucket

                          marlon
                truman you know i did think about 
                moving away one time

                          truman
                     interest piqued
                yeah what happened

                          marlon
                i figured whats the point  i knew id
                just be taking my problems with me  once
                the kids came along it made me look at
                seahaven with new eyes
                     gazing out at the lights of
                     seahaven
                i realized what the hell could be better
                than this
                     putting a hand on trumans
                     shoulder
                im telling you  what you really need is
                someone to carry on the burbank name

                          truman
                you think so

                          marlon
                trust me

     marlon picks up the last ball at the mouth of the upturned 
     cone  the ball is white

                          marlon
                     checking the ball
                you win

     they approach trumans car  truman opens the trunk to
     deposit their humble golfing equipment  inside are the 
     remains of the fallen light fixture

                          truman
                     referring to the light
                you really think it couldve dropped off
                an airliner

                          marlon
                     unimpressed
                sure  its halogen  shame it didnt hit
                you  you couldve sued
                     quickly changing the subject
                you coming for a drink

                          truman
                i cant tonight


     int  lighthouse  night

     from the pov of the lighthouses lantern room we observe 
     truman sitting on the beach staring out to sea

     closer on truman  he has a portable tape recorder slung over 
     his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf  we 
     watch trumans impassive face as he makes the recording of
     the lapping waves  the lamp from the lighthouse occasionally 
     falls upon trumanplayback ext  ocean  dayas always the flashback appears to play on a television screenthe sky is black with storm clouds  gale force winds lash 
     rain into the faces of sevenyearold truman and his father 
     kirk  as kirk stands up to get his hearings a freak gust of 
     wind catches the sail  the boom whips across the stern and 
     strikes kirk flush in the head knocking his overboard

     truman wearing the sole lifejacket desperately reaches for 
     his father  he momentarily has hold of his fathers hand
     when kirk is abruptly dragged beneath the surface

                          truman
                     crying out
                daddydaddy

     his cries go unanswered  sevenyearold truman finds himself 
     alone  the storm abruptly passed the wind suddenly dropped 
     the water stilled

     the frightened truman examines the ring he holds in his open 
     hand  his fathers ring  wrenched from his finger in 
     trumans fight to keep him afloat


     ext  beach  night presenta close up of truman from kirks ring that truman now wears

     then from the lighthouse pov we observe truman get to his 
     feet and walk towards the dark water  he stands at the 
     waters edge

                     shouting at the surf
                im sorry dad  im sorry

     as if in reply a tongue of lightning flashes across the 
     distant skyline followed by a growl of thunder


     int  a living room somewhere  night

     two old women seventies sit beside each other on a sofa 
     looking directly into camera as they talk

                          old woman 1
                     playing amateur psychiatrist
                it left him with more than his obvious
                fear of the water

                          old woman 2
                he was never the same curious little
                boy again

                          old woman 1
                half the women i know named their 
                children after him


     ext  beach parking lot  night

     truman is forced to leg it through a sudden rain shower to
     his car

     from trumans pointofview the shower appears quite normal  
     however viewed from a distance we see that the shower is 
     extremely localized encircling only him as if a small cloud 
     is directly above his head tracking his progress

     as truman crosses the parking lot the shower crosses with 
     him  sensing something amiss truman dances back and forth 
     across the street intrigued by the curious phenomenon  he 
     hums a few bars of singin in the rain

     the rain becomes heavier covering a wider area  truman runs 
     the remaining distance to his car


     int  trumans house  nursery  night

     the drenched truman enters to find meryl in the unfinished 
     nursery comparing wallpaper samples  meryl wears a robe a 
     glimpse of black negligee beneath

                          meryl
                where have you been

                          truman
                     wringing out his jacket
                ive been thinking

                          meryl
                     rolling her eyes
                oh god

                          truman
                     ignoring the reception
                i figure we could scrape together
                eight thousand

                          meryl
                     exasperated
                every time you and marlon

                          truman
                we could bum around the world for a
                year on that

                          meryl
                and then what truman  wed be back to
                where we were five years ago  youre
                talking like a teenager

                          truman
                maybe i feel like a teenager

                          meryl
                were mortgaged to the eyeballs truman
                theres the car payments  are we just
                going to walk away from our financial
                obligations

     truman still dripping on the floor holds meryl by the arms  
     he talks excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they 
     were courting

                          truman
                itd be an adventure

                          meryl
                i thought we were going to try for a
                baby  isnt that enough of an adventure

                          truman
                that can wait  i want to get away  see
                some of the world  explore

     meryl gives a derisive laugh

                          meryl
                you want to be an explorer  you dont
                even have a passport truman  i bet you
                dont even know how to get one

     the words sting  truman turns away  seeing the pain shes 
     caused she changes tack

                          meryl
                thisll pass  everybody thinks like this
                now and then
                     making an attempt at seduction
                come to bed

                          truman
                i think im going to stay up for a while


     int  an office building somewhere  reception  night

     in the reception area of an office building two uniformed 
     guards drink coffee

     ext  trumans street  dawn

     there is something peculiar about the way the sun rises over 
     seahaven island  the light appears in an arc thats slightly 
     too perfect and welldefined


     int  trumans bedroom  morning

     in front of his bedroom window truman wearing his new 
     sweats performs an exercise routine of his own invention
     he counts off the exercises to himself  cheating as he does 
     so  he counts five leglifts for every two he completes

                          truman
                five
                     two leglifts later
                thenfifteentwo more makes twenty


     int  a bedroom somewhere  morning

     a middleaged married couple in identical matching sweats 
     repeat the same eccentric exercises in perfect sync as if 
     they were in a class led by truman


     ext  car  day

     truman climbs into the car and switches on the radio  he drives
     down the street

                          radio announcer
                another glorious morning in seahaven folks
                dont forget to buckle up

     truman mutters to himself as is his custom


     ext  downtown seahaven  day

     truman emerges from the parking lot and as usual stops at the 
     newspaper stand  he picks up a glossy magazine and flips 
     through the cosmetic ads surreptitiously tearing a pair of 
     eyes from one of the pages  he returns the magazine to the 
     rack  as usual the newspaper vendor fails to intervene  
     truman begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush 
     hour pedestrian traffic

     as he enters the street leading to his office he glimpses a 
     homeless man reflected in the window of a parked car
     truman spellbound by the man suddenly wheels around to face 
     him  the homeless man latefifties more wellgroomed and 
     wellfed than the average vagrant has a serene smile on his 
     face

     the homeless man places his hand ever so gently on trumans 
     cheek  truman makes no effort to withdraw  he is transfixed 
     by the mans eyes  he appears to recognize him

                          truman
                     almost to himself mouthing
                     the worddad

     suddenly an elegant woman shopper walking a small wiener dog 
     and a business executive carrying a briefcase walking in 
     opposite directions along the sidewalk grab the homeless
     man  one under each arm lifting the homeless man off the 
     ground they start to whisk the bewildered derelict down the 
     street

                          truman
                     calling out
                stop  stop

     truman begins to give chase  however the shopper and the 
     businessman are surprisingly fleetfooted  even more 
     surprising as truman embarks on the pursuit is the behavior
     of the pedestrians and commuters  they appear to part for
     the fleeing trio then close ranks in front of him  is it 
     accidental or are the pedestrians working together running 
     interference

                          truman
                     shouting at the pedestrians
                outta the way  outta the way

     they are escaping

     truman finally breaks through the pack bowling over several 
     of the pedestrians in the process  just as he gets within 
     reach of the shopper and the businessman a bus suddenly 
     screeches to a halt beside the abductors doors already open  
     the woman shopper and the executive bundle the homeless man 
     onto the bus  truman lurches after them but he is met by 
     the bus doors closing sharply in his face

                          truman
                     to bus driver
                hey stop  stop the bus

     truman thumps against the doors but the bus driver ignores 
     his cries and the bus roars away  the other passengers in 
     the bus apparently oblivious to the incident keeps staring 
     straight ahead

     truman continues to give chase when a taxi appears out of 
     nowhere and cuts in front of him blocking his path  when he 
     recovers the bus has disappeared  the mysterious crowd of 
     pedestrians has also dissolved as if it never existed

     retracing his steps head reeling wondering if the could have 
     imagined the whole incident truman discovers that the woman 
     shopper has left her wiener dog behind  the dog wanders 
     aimlessly on the pavement its leash trailing behind it


     int  mothers house  day

     truman paces impatiently in the living room of his mothers 
     cramped fussy doilyed little house full of burbank family 
     memorabilia  a cluster of framed photographs is dominated by 
     one of his father trimmed with a black ribbon  a toilet 
     flushes and trumans mother finally emerges from the next 
     room

     she presents something of a contradiction  although she
     walks with the aid of a walker she is actually a well
     preserved sixty  she wears a glamorous nightgown and a full 
     head of bleachedblonde hair

                          truman
                     kissing mother on the cheek
                how are you mother

                          mother
                well i made it through another night

                          truman
                hows your hip

                          mother
                oh just so

     truman supports mother

                          mother
                you know surprises arent good for me
                you should really call before you come
                over dear

                          truman
                ive got something to tell you  youd
                better sit down

     truman helps her into an overstuffed armchair

                          mother
                you look very pale truman  are you
                taking your vitamin ds

                          truman
                     exasperated
                i spend half my life out in the sun
                mother why would i need vitamin d

                          mother
                i feel certain my condition runs in the
                family
                     putting the back of her hand
                     dramatically over her forehead
                cant this wait dear

     he kneels beside her

                          truman
                no im afraid it cant

     truman takes a deep breath as he prepares to give her the news

                          truman
                i know this is going to sound insane
                mother buti saw dad today on
                lancaster circle  hes alive

     mother smiles condescendingly

                homeless man  and you know what else was
                really strange  a businessman and a
                woman with a little dog appeared from
                nowhere and forced him onto a bus

                          mother
                about time they started cleaning up the
                trash downtown  we dont want to end up
                like the rest of the country

                          truman

                          truman
                     already doubting himself

                his twin  did dad have a brother

                          mother

                     placing a comforting arm
                     around him

     mother kisses truman on the cheek

                          mother
                     referring to her platinum 
                     blonde hair
                i was thinking about going lighter  what
                do you think

     truman regards his mother  her hair is already impossibly blonde


     int  trumans basement  dusk

     the basement is cluttered with junk  ships in bottles a 
     train track without trains an oxygen mask a stringless 
     guitar many abandoned projects  the basement is dimly lit 
     by a single naked bulb  truman looks over his shoulder 
     before opening a large walkin cupboard  on the cupboard
     door is a wall map of the pacific ocean  the fiji islands
     are carefully circled  amongst the many tools and household 
     implements inside the cupboard is a trunk under a dusty 
     canvas sheet  he pulls the trunk into the room unfastens 
     the lock and opens the lid

     inside mementoes from his youth  ahow to sailbook a 
     stack ofgreat explorersmagazines and beneath it all a 
     garment in a drycleaning bag  truman carefully lifts up the 
     plastic to reveal a young womans cardigan sweater  he puts 
     the cardigan to his nose and takes in its scent

     footsteps  truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk
     and shuts the lid  meryls legs appear on the stairs

                          meryl
                whatre you doing down here

                          truman
                     turning attention to an upturned
                     mower on the basement floor
                fixing the mower
                     matteroffact
                i saw my father today

                          meryl
                i know

                          truman
                     suspicious
                how do you know

                          meryl
                your mother called  you shouldnt upset
                her like that

     meryls response takes the wind out of trumans sails

                          truman
                what did you want

                          meryl
                i made macaroni

                          truman
                im not hungry

     meryl nods not at all convinced

                          meryl
                we really ought to toss that mower out
                get one of those new elk rotaries

     truman does not reply  after an uncomfortable pause she 
     turns back up the stairs

     truman waits a moment before reopening the trunk  he
     removes the cardigan and holds it up reminiscing


     int  a kitchen somewhere  night

     into camera

     lauren taking truman by the hand runs down various streets 
     and paths through the campus  she occasionally pauses and 
     looks about her often changing direction or looking up at 
     streetlights and the towers of houses along their route as
     if trying to elude an unseen pursuer

     the excited and apprehensive truman runs with her although he 
     is unsure exactly who or what they are running from

     the further they get from the campus the higher wider and 
     less effective the coverage of the scene  some camera angles 
     are even partially obscuredplayback ext  highway  western end of town  night

     truman and lauren eventually cross an empty highway on the edge
     of town

     they run over the dunes onto a strangely deserted beach and 
     down to the waters edge under a hyperreal full moon
     lauren throws off her cardigan and hitches up her skirt 
     wading out into the inviting water without another thought

                thats right  oh god im sorry

     she wades out of the water

                why lauren  youve got nothing to be

     lauren dripping wet stands besides truman at the shoreline  she
     meets his gaze

                my names not lauren  its sylvia

     truman looks into her eyes and believes her  truman wipes

     composite picture of sylvia which truman has constructed by 
     pasting together individual facial features  nose mouth ears
     chin hair  gathered presumably from womens magazines  he 
     attempts to put the jigsaw puzzle together  although he has 
     particular difficulty finding a pair of eyes that match

     from his pocket he takes a recent collection of eyes which

     out the trash

                          spencer
                hows it going truman

     truman hardly acknowledges spencer  pluto the dog fails to 
     receive his usual pat  the wave from the washingtons across 
     the street is also not returned

     truman motors down the street switching on the car radio
     as usual

     the announcers voice slows down  now revealing itself to be 
     a tape that has worn out  truman perplexed looks at the 
     radio and pushes buttons in an attempt to find another 
     station  he finds one

                          female voice
                     from radio
                west on stewarthes making a right
                on holden

     truman glances up at the street signs along his route and 
     finds that they correspond exactly with the streets quoted
     on the radio  distracted he almost bowls over an old lady
     on a crosswalk

                          male voice
                     from radio
                god he almost hit marilyn  hes on
                the move again passing the library

     truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out
     suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback  he looks up 
     and as far as the eye can see every pedestrian motorist
     and shopkeeper along the street suddenly winces in pain and 
     holds their right ear at exactly the same moment

                          male voice
                     from radio in distress himself
                somethings wrong  change frequencies

     truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without 
     success


     ext  parking lot  morning

     truman sits in his car drinking his coffee taking in the 
     recent incident  from inside the adjacent school he hears 
     the familiar excited squeals and chatter of school children  
     truman suddenly throws aside his coffee and sprints across
     the parking lot and into the school


     int  seahaven elementary school  morning

     truman slams through the front doors into the reception area  
     it is deserted no one stationed at the administration desk 
     the corridors empty  he runs down a vacant corridor finally 
     standing outside a classroom  the childrens voices can
     still be heard from inside  truman bursts through the door

     the room is empty save for a large reeltoreel tape recorder 
     on the teachers desk playing a continuous tape of childrens
     voices  the recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands 
     facing the ventilation ducts  truman stares at the machine
     in disbelief


     ext  street  downtown  day

     truman still lost in thought exits the school  he stops at 
     the newsstand and picks up a magazine to resume his ritual 
     search but his heart is not in it  he replaces the magazine 
     without taking a cutting  much to the surprise of the news 
     vendor

     truman starts his trek to work pausing to stare at his 
     reflection in the mirrored building hoping that the homeless 
     man will appear once again at his side  no one joins him

     entering his own building with fellow office workers truman 
     remains in the revolving door and reemerges on the street

     sense truly observing for the first time

     a young woman walks a pair of afghan hounds  an old man 
     answers the incessant questions of his grandchild  nothing 
     appears amiss truman takes a seat at a small outdoor cafe  
     he fidgets with his fathers ring on his finger that contains 
     one large stone still looking for a false move

     a delivery man unloads boxes from the back of his truck and 
     carries them into a store  further down the street 
     construction workers take their time tending to an electrical 
     repair in an exposed manhole  a postal worker does his 
     rounds  an old woman struggles with two heavy shopping bags  
     everybody appears natural places to go

     and speaks

                you are


     ext  cafe  day

     truman turns his attention to a group of cubanlooking men at 
     the only other occupied table at the cafe  we see extreme 
     closeups as truman scans the mens faces for any sign of 
     phoniness  they are talking loudly making suggestive 
     comments to the waitress  their behavior passes the test  
     all seems genuine

     then truman notices two joggers out for a morning run
     making their way down the street towards him  truman happens 
     to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers  he suddenly 
     springs to his feet  truman blocks the joggers

                          truman
                its youisnt it

     the joggers attempt to sidestep truman

                          jogger 1
                excuse me

                          truman
                remember  two days ago i gave you my
                meatball sandwich in the park  you were
                in a wheelchair  same sneakers

     the jogger looks down at his distinctive sneakers bearing the 
     initials ts and visibly blanches

                          jogger 2
                     coming to his companions aid
                get the hell out of here

     the second jogger roughly shoves truman aside  truman calls 
     out after the two men

                          truman
                     ironically referring to the
                     joggers newfound mobility
                its a miracle

     truman picks himself up dusting dirt from his suit  he 
     retrieves his briefcase and continues down the street with 
     renewed purpose


     ext  downtown street  day

     wandering down the bustling street truman suddenly bolts
     into a building at random


     int  office building  day

     an imposing office building clad in the kind of reflective 
     glass that shields its occupants from the world  a building 
     truman passes every day  a steady stream of employees and 
     visitors enter and exit the buildings highceilinged lobby 
     past an intimidating security desk manned by two uniformed 
     guards  beyond security are banks of elevators ferrying 
     executives clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from 
     their floors of business

     truman abruptly enters reception and strides confidently
     past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs

                          security guard 1
                     to truman
                can i help

                          truman
                     sneaking a glance at the 
                     building directory
                i have an appointment at ergable
                enterprises

                          security guard 1
                they went bust

     the second security guard is rising from his seat to block 
     trumans path to the elevators but truman reads his mind and 
     makes a dash for it  into one of the elevators

     a young woman in the elevator looks in horror at truman  the
     cause of her concern all too apparent  looking beyond the 
     woman truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator 
     car  the people truman has just witnessed entering other 
     elevators are milling around a refreshment table primping or 
     sitting on folding chairs  gradually they all turn to gape 
     at truman who in turn stares back appalled  trumans view 
     is abruptly blocked as a rear panel is hastily attached to
     the elevator  a security guard pulls truman from the car

                          truman
                whats going on

                          security guard 1
                     glancing to the lights above 
                     the elevator trying to appear
                     innocent
                nothing

     truman observes the upward progress of the elevator via the 
     light display above the doorway  before he has time to make 
     sense of it the guards drag him away

                          security guard 2
                youve got to leave

     the guards frogmarch truman out of the facade towards an 
     emergency exit

                          truman
                just tell me whats going on

                doing in there

                          security guard 1
                     shrugs
                its none of my business
                     ushering truman off the 
                     property
                none ofyours either

                          truman

                you dont tell me whats really going on
                ill report you

     truman continues to struggle as the guards usher him to the 
     street

                          security guard 2
                for what  youre trespassing


     ext  downtown street  day

     truman continues to struggle as the guards unceremoniously 
     dump him on the pavement  he picks himself up head reeling 
     and starts to run along the street  he suddenly enters 
     another building at random  an office block with a bank on 
     the ground floor

     truman rushes to the elevators  the lights above the doors 
     show all the elevator on upper floors  frantic pressing of
     the elevator button gets no response  a receptionist rises 
     from her desk  truman heads for the stairs but is 
     intercepted by a bank official barring his way

                          truman
                i want to

     the bank official the receptionist and a bank teller back 
     truman towards the door

                          bank official
                open an account

                          truman
                yes  er why not

                          receptionist
                savings or checking

                          bank official
                lets go up to my office

     truman hurriedly exits the bank


     ext  street  day

     back on the street truman feels the eyes of the pedestrians  
     is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior  
     truman wheels around trying to make eye contact with passersby
     they shy away  he continues to run down the street

     finally truman finds himself standing in front of the
     window of an electronics store staring at his own face on a
     tv set  it is taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the 
     store window


     int  a bathroom somewhere  day

     a man stares into camera from a bath of stale water  a layer 
     of soap scum on the top

                          man
                dont look at me pal


     ext  street  electronics store  day

     truman shudders at his video reflection  further down the 
     street he notices marlons van parked outside a supermarket


     int  supermarket  day

     the door of a vending machine is open  marlon half inside 
     the machine loads a stack of baby ruth candy bars into one 
     of the dispensing slots  the paranoid truman appears at his 
     shoulder

                          truman
                marlon

                          marlon
                     startled
                truman what are you doing here

     truman looks nervously around him  even the store owners 
     friendly nod from behind the counter is cause for suspicion
     in trumans mind

                          truman
                     whisper
                ive got to talk to you

                          truman
                theres no point in trying to explain it
                but a lot of strange things have been
                happening  elevators that dont go
                anywhere people talking about me on
                the radio you know what i mean

                          marlon

                your fantasies

                          truman

                          marlon
                     referring to an old couple
                     entering the deli
                how about them

                          truman
                     seriously considering the
                     possibility
                could be  beard looks phony

     out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not 
     to see twentysix years earlier  however the deserted bay 
     beyond is identical to its neighbor  marlon laboring
     crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop

                          marlon

                no

                          truman
                     ignoring the remark
                when you were hauling chickens for kaiser
                poultry what was the furthest you ever
                went off the island

     int  living room  trumans house  night

     truman sits cramped on his sofa  pulling wider we discover 
     the cause of his discomfort  he is sandwiched between meryl 
     on one side and mother on the other  mother the family 
     historian a stack of photograph albums at her feet turns
     the pages of the album on trumans lap

                          truman
                we ought to be getting you back mother

                          mother
                hold on a minute dear

                heres us at mount rushmore  you 
                remember trumanwhen dad was still with
                us  that was quite a drive  you slept
                all the way there

                          truman
                     taking an interest in the
                     monument
                it looks so small

                          mother
                     quickly turning the page
                things always dowhen you look back

     mother skips several pages in the album finally stopping at
     a spread of wedding photos

                          meryl
                look truman theres my cousin errol
                putting the bouquet down his pants  it
                was the happiest day of our lives

                          mother
                     referring to meryl
                didnt she look beautiful truman  she
                still does

     mother turns to a blank page in the album

                          mother
                and theres plenty of room for baby 
                photos  id like to hold a grandchild
                in my arms
                     dabbing her eye with a handkerchief
                before i go

     meryl rises from the sofa and helps mother to her walker

                          meryl
                ill take you home angela
                     referring to the album
                why dont you leave those with us for
                a while

                          truman
                     kissing his emotional mother
                good night mother

                          meryl
                     a wink to truman
                see you in a minute sweetheart

     meryl departs with mother  left alone in the living room 
     truman slumps back down onto the sofa and switches on the 
     television set  an oldfashioned model with rabbitears
     he idly studies the photograph album as an overearnest 
     television host announces the upcoming program

                          tv host
                tonights goldenoldies is the 
                enduring muchloved classic show me
                the way to go home  a hymn of praise
                to smalltown life where we learn that
                you dont have to leave home to
                discover what the world is all about
                and that no one is poor who has
                friends

     however when we turn our attention away from the
     television we find that truman is peering intently at a 
     wedding photograph of meryl and himself taking their vows in
     a civil ceremony in a beachside gazebo  under the scrutiny
     of a magnifying glass he discovers that meryl has her
     fingers crossed


     int  a living room somewhere  night

     the two ladies sit on their sofa a rug across their
     knees sipping a night cap of hot chocolate  they stare into 
     camera

                          old lady 1
                remember at the wedding  that dog

                          old lady 2
                started howling when they took their vows

                          old lady 1
                and the plastic horseshoe fell off when
                they cut the cake

                          old lady 2
                     shaking her head ruefully
                they never had a chance

     preparing an omelette  meryl hurries into the kitchen in her 
     nurses uniform  she gulps down a cup of coffee and reaches 
     for her nurses cap

     however she still has time to adjust the position of a pack offibercon cereal squaring it a little more to camera

                youd been in there for some reason  it
                doesnt bear thinking about

     truman lost in thought picks up the scalding frying pan with
     his bare hand  letting out a howl of pain he drops the pan

                          truman
                arrah

                     hurrying out the door
                oh look at the time

     truman stares after her the pain of his hand forgotten for the
     moment  he watches meryl ride her bicycle down the driveway
     truman exits the house

                fine  ill tell her

     the nurse walks off disappearing through a set of doors  
     truman hesitates before following her


     int  various hospital corridors  day

     the nurse walks briskly  fewer people about truman 
     discreetly following behind  the nurse breaks into a jog  
     truman hurries to keep up with her  dodging around gurneys 
     janitors mopping floors


     int  outside operating theatre  day

     the nurse hastily scrubbed and gowned enters the theatre truman
     hesitates but dares not enter  he grabs a mask of his own

     looking through the glass window in the operating theatre 
     door he sees the young woman seen in the hastily fixed 
     elevator car the day before lying on the operating table a 
     bloodsoaked bandage covering her left leg  meryl wearing a 
     surgical gown and mask assists the surgeon  the sister 
     hovers nervously in the background

                          surgeon
                scalpel

     meryl very slowly selects a scalpel from a tray of instruments 
     and awkwardly hands it to the surgeon

                          surgeon
                im now making my primary incision just
                above the left knee

     the patients eyes blink open in horror  the anesthetist 
     steps in trumans view before he can get a good look  
     suddenly a security guard appears beside truman and takes 
     him by the arm

                          security guard
                     referring to the operation
                this isnt gonna be pretty  unless
                youre family of the patient ill have
                to ask you to leave

                          truman
                no problem  i dont want to cause any
                trouble


     int  travel agency  day

     truman takes a seat at the only desk in an empty travel 
     agency  the travel brochures and posters that adorn the 
     walls all feature destinations that bear a striking 
     similarity to picturesque seahaven  another poster spells 
     out the dangers of travel  travellers beware  terrorists 
     disease wild animals street gangs  a female travel agent 
     enters from a rear door

     ext  city street  day

     emerging onto the street truman looks across to the building 
     which he entered the previous day  it is now cordoned off 
     with police tape after the elevator disaster  flowers have 
     been laid at the doorway


     ext  greyhound bus station  day

     a greyhound bus bound for chicago according to its 
     destination sign sits idling at the stop  just as a burly 
     supervisor is about to wave the bus on its way truman dashes 
     into the station

                          bus driver
                last call for chicago

     truman jumps onto the bus behind the last boarding passenger 
      a young soldier

                          truman
                     to the bus driver as he 
                     boards the bus
                windy city here we come

     int  greyhound bus  day

     truman takes a seat by a window  an awkward silence descends 
     over the bus  the other passengers  a mother with a 
     restless child several tourists an old couple and the young 
     soldier  all stare stiffly straight ahead averting their 
     eyes from truman

     no one is more uncomfortable than the bus driver  beads of 
     perspiration on his head he fumbles for the gear shift 
     apparently unsure how to operate it  the gears grind

     the other passengers try not to notice  the child tugging 
     her mothers sleeve points to truman  her mother makes her 
     face the front of the bus  finally the supervisor enters the 
     bus

                          supervisor
                everybody off  weve got a problem

     the relieved passengers hurriedly exit until truman is the 
     only one remaining on the bus  the bus driver looks almost 
     sorry for truman who sits resolutely in his seat  the hint 
     of a tear of frustration in his eyes

                          bus driver
                     softly
                im sorry son


     int  a bar somewhere  day

     the bar seen earlier  a small group of patrons discuss 
     developments  the waitress seems upset occasionally 
     glancing to camera as she pours a beer

                          patron 1
                why would he want to go to chicago  who
                does he know from there

                anywhere  he has to have it out with meryl


     ext  street  trumans bicycle  day

     as truman rides home on his bicycle he stares wildly about 
     him  the rearview mirror on his bicycle is suddenly cause for
     concern so are the trees and streetlamps lining the roadway


     ext  trumans backyard  day

     truman staring at the highway from the bottom of the garden 
     doesnt bother to look up as meryl still wearing her nurses 
     uniform approaches

                          truman
                     referring to a distant car on
                     the expressway
                see that car way down there  i bet its
                a suburu station wagon

     meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car  
     finally a suburu station wagon motors by  meryl is 
     unimpressed  truman turns his back on the highway to 
     continue his game

                          truman
                i predict the next four cars will be a
                white honda civic a blue and white dodge
                dart with the front hubcap missing a
                volkswagen beetle with a dented fender
                and a motorcycle

     meryl doesnt wish to participate in the game and makes for 
     the house  truman holds her arm forcing her to watch  he 
     turns to check his prediction  a convoy of cars approaches

                          truman
                theres the hondathe dodgehere
                comes that dented beetle

     meryls attention wavers  truman tightens his grip

                          truman
                look

     following the vw is a school bus

                          meryl
                     mocking
                wheres the motorcycle

     truman is momentarily disappointed

                          truman
                dont you want to know how i did that

     a motorcycle putters by  meryl turns and walks back to the 
     house  he hurries after her

                          meryl
                i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque
                sunday  i thought id make my potato
                salad  remind me

                          meryl
                we need more charcoal

                          truman
                are you listening to a word im saying

                          meryl
                youre upset because you want to go to
                fiji  is that it

     truman is puzzled by her conciliatory tone

                          meryl
                okay do it  get it out of your system
                save for a few months and go  there
                happy now  im going to take a shower

     she turns away

                          truman
                     catching her wrist
                lets go now

                          meryl
                what

     despite her protests truman drags meryl towards his car

                          truman
                     as he shoves her into the car
              im ready to go now  why wait


     int  trumans car  day

     truman holds meryls wrist to stop her exiting the car and 
     accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking 
     almost running over pluto the dog and spencer with his 
     garbage can

     truman starts circling a gazebo at the center of a
     roundabout faster and faster

                          truman
                where shall we go  where shall we go
                spontaneity is what its all about
                forget fiji  we cant very well drive to
                fiji can we  what about atlantic city

                          meryl
                     trying to mask her anxiety
                you hate gambling

                          truman
                thats right  i do dont i

                          meryl
                so why do you want to go

                because i never have  thats why you go
                places isnt it

                          meryl
                truman i think im going to throw up

     truman roars off down the street

                          truman
                me too

     almost immediately truman encounters a traffic snarl

                          truman
                     a manic edge to his voice
                so much traffic this time of day  
                does that strike you as peculiar

     without warning truman suddenly dives down a sidestreet  but
     his move is anticipated  at the end of the street a pack of
     cars suddenly appears  other vehicles fill the gap behind

                          truman
                     to meryl marveling
                blocked at every turn  beautifully 
                synchronized dont you agree

                          meryl
                     incredulous
                you blaming me for the traffic

                          truman
                should i

     truman reverses suddenly and makes a uturn

                          truman
                youre right  we could be stuck here
                for hours  could be like this all
                the way to atlantic city  lets go
                back  im sorry  i dont know what
                got into me

     truman starts heading back the way they came the roadway now 
     relatively free of traffic

                          meryl
                would you please slow down truman

     truman floors the car  the car flies past their house

                          meryl
                truman that was our house

                          truman

                          meryl
                     pleading
                let me out truman  youre not right in
                the head  you want to destroy yourself
                you do it on your own

                          truman
                     eerily calm
                i think id like a little company

     as he speeds erratically truman glances at the streets on 
     either side of the main road where he discovers a distinct 
     lack of moving traffic

                          truman
                     to the anxious meryl at his side
                look meryl  no cars  i dont run into
                traffic  the traffic follows me around
                     excited by his discovery
                were in a moving pack dont you see


     intext  trumans car  bridge  day

     but trumans clear path is shortlived  he is forced to slow
     once again behind a line of other cars at a bridge

                          truman
                     to meryl
                its hard to go places isnt it

                          meryl
                     looking up ahead at an
                     overturned car
                theres been an accident truman

                          truman
                uhuh  theres no accident  its just
                more stalling

     truman floors the car again and swerves into the oncoming 
     lane  he roars along the bridge on the wrong side of the 
     road  near the end of the bridge a distraught motorist 
     dashes into the middle of the road waving his arms  truman 
     slams on the brakes

                          motorist
                     pointing to a small boy lying
                     very still on the ground
                     beside a wrecked car
                is there a doctor a nurse

                          meryl
                truman its a child  ive got to help 

                          truman
                     hardly glancing to the boy
                hell be fine

     truman roars on almost bowling over the concerned motorist

                          meryl
                truman i took the hypocrite oath

                          truman
                i bet you did

     truman roars past a sign that readsyou are now leaving 
     seahaven  are you sure thats a good ideaback at the accident scene the little boy apparently 
     uninjured sits up


     intext  car  day

     they roar pass an illuminated sign forest fire warning

                          truman
                im sure theyre just exaggerating

     suddenly a 20foot high wall of flame shoots across the 
     roadway in front of them  as if someone flicked on a gas 
     switch

                          meryl
                what about that  do you believethattruman experiences his first moment of doubt  he looks to 
     the terrified meryl then closes his eyes tightly and

     that they have emerged on the other side singed but 
     unscathed

     however the open road in front of them now disturbs truman 
     for a different reason  its sheer lack of anything unusual  
     signs along the road advertise motels and give directions to 
     other destinations i6211  2 miles notel motel  pool

     truman appears very unsure of himself


     ext  roadway  day

     however there is still a barrier between truman and bourbon 
     street  the highway leading to a cloverleaf freeway 
     junction in the distance is completely blocked off by 
     seahaven police cars  no way past  nuclear silos in the 
     distance spew out an ominous puff of smoke  a sign readsseahaven island nuclear power station  clean safe

     trumans eyes widen at the mention of his name from an 
     apparent stranger  as the officer turns truman bolts from 
     the car leaving meryl in the passenger seat

                          meryl

     truman flees into the forest

     the two old ladies we have observed before are almost overcome
     with tension  one lady reaches out for her companions hand


     ext  forest near seahaven nuclear power plant  day

     truman bursts past the alienlooking hazardous water workers 
     in their protective suits carrying detection instruments  
     the workers give chase in their cumbersome suits trying to 
     cut off his path

     nearing the edge of the forest truman hears the sound of 
     hammers and saws  but before he has time to see the source 
     of the sound he is tackled to the ground

     as seahaven police officers drag him away one of the waste 
     workers walks the remaining few yards pushing aside a wall 
     of tropical foliage  we now see what truman was prevented 
     from seeing

     a polynesian island is under construction by dozens of 
     riggers painters and set decorators  large cranes are 
     lifting palm trees into place a fake volcano is being tested
     in the distance and rehearsals for a firewalking ceremony are

     meryl joins truman at the kitchen table  truman applauds

                not well

                          truman

                why do you want to have a child with me
                you cant stand me

                          meryl

                          meryl
                ive tasted other cocoas  this is the best

     truman rises from the table and backs her around the room

                          truman
                what the hell has that got to do with 
                anything  tell me whats happening

                          meryl

                     kitchen bench
                youre part of this arent you

     meryl grabs the chefsmate from the counter to protect 
     herself  she points the potato peeler at him

                          meryl
                truman youre scaring me

     truman looks into her eyes and with surprising swiftness 
     grabs her wrist and disarms her

                          truman
                no youre scaring me meryl

     truman grabs meryl and turns the chefs mate on her  he 
     stares wildly about him

                          truman
                stop this now  ill do it  i swear

                          meryl
                do something

     upon hearing her remark trumans eyes widen  sensing that 
     she too is addressing a third person he jerks her head 
     around to read her face

                          truman
                     wildeyed
                who were you talking to

                          meryl
                     incredulous
                youre the one talking to the walls

                          truman
                no  you said do something  who were
                you talking to  tell me

                          meryl
                truman stop it

     suddenly the front door chimes

                          truman
                right on time  cops must be telephatic

     truman grabs his peeler and marches meryl down the hallway to 
     the front door  the doorbell chimes a second and third time 
     more insistently

                          truman
                     shouting through the closed door
                stay where you are

                          marlon oc
                truman  its me marlon  i need to talk
                to you

     truman flinches  he was so convinced it would be the police  
     he takes a step back against the hallway wall  before he can 
     decide what to do marlon has opened the unlocked front door 
     to be confronted with the sight of truman holding the peeler
     to meryls throat

     marlon locks eyes with truman  sizing up the situation he 
     slowly but decisively removes the peeler from trumans hand  
     meryl wrenches herself free from trumans now limp grasp and 
     collapses into marlons arm sobbing

                          meryl
                     distraught
                how can anyone expect me to carry on
                under these conditions  this 
                isunprofessionalext  unfinished bridge  night

     marlon and truman both nursing bottles of beer sit on the 
     end of the unfinished bridge

                          truman
                i dont know what to think marlon  
                maybe im going out of my mind but i
                get the feeling that the world revolves
                around me somehow

                          marlon
                its a lot of world for one man  you sure
                thats not wishful thinking you wishing
                youd made something more of yourself
                christ truman who hasnt sat on the john
                and had an imaginary interview on
                seahaven tonight  who hasnt wanted to
                be somebody

                          truman
                this is different  everybody seems to be
                in on it

     marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere 
     in the night

                          marlon
                tru weve known each other since before
                we were in long pants  the only way we
                ever made it through high school was
                cheating off each others test papers
                jesus they were identical  i always
                liked that because whatever the answer
                was

     truman chimes in nodding fondly at the memory

                          truman  marlon
                we were right together and we were
                wrong together

                          marlon
                the only night either of us ever spent
                in jail we spent together and i wet
                myself but you never told anyone  i was
                best man at your wedding and my brother
                was best man at my wedding and you didnt
                talk to me for a month over that and i 
                didnt blame you because youve been more
                of a brother to me than hes ever been

     truman is slowly coming around  marlons speech from the 
     heart soothing away his pain

                          marlon
                i know things havent worked out for
                either of us like we used to sit up on
                monroe avenue all night and dream they
                would  we all let opportunities pass us
                by  none of us asks for the dance as
                often as we should  i know that feeling 
                when its like everythings slipping away
                and you dont want to believe it so you
                look for answers someplace else  but
                well the point is i would gladly step
                in front of traffic for you

     int  a bedroom somewhere  night

     a young woman reclines on a bed her back against the wall  
     propped up on her knees is a book  however shes not 
     reading but staring straight into camera  a look of profound
     sadness on her face  it is sylvia

     from her pointofview we see a portable television set on a 
     table at the foot of the bed

     on the television is a live picture of truman  the first 
     time we have seen him on a television screen  he is sitting 
     at his kitchen table unaware of the cameras recording him

     the shot is static  he just sits there in silence a 
     steaming cup of cocoa in front of him and a plate of 
     untouched cookies

     at one point a sponsors border appears on the screen 
     tastefully framing the action with the messagemococoa 
     cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaraguaafter
     several seconds the border disappears

     suddenly the live picture of truman shrinks into a window on 
     the screen to accommodate a title sequence that begins to 
     play around the edge of the image  the truman show theme 
     music begins

     the camera cranes up and over the hollywood sign the 
     flatlands of burbank stretching into the distance

                her husband kirk

     the music swells as the camera approaches a mammoth structure at
     the base of the mountains  a dome so vast it dwarfs everything
     around it  at the top of the dome is a huge painting of trumans
     face encircled by satellite dishes  inside each dish is a single

                          interviewer
                the catalyst for the recent dramatic 
                events was of course trumans father
                kirk and his infiltration onto the show
                before we discuss that its worth
                reminding viewers that this isnt the
                first time someone from the outside world
                has tried to reach truman

                          christof
                wehavehad our close calls in the past

     behind the two men the constantly playing image of truman 
     engrossed in his book is relegated to a window of the screenplayback int  trumans home  christmas morning

                who can forget the infamous christmas
                present incident in the seventh season

     suddenly a small man bursts from a large christmas parcel

                          christof
                     dismissive
                these people have their own agendas  
                many just want to be on television 
                themselvesplayback ext  city street  day

     the encounter between truman and the homeless kirk is 
     replayed up to the point where kirk is bundled onto the bus

                          interviewer
                of course there hasnt been anything 
                to compare with this  the first time an
                intruder has been a former cast member

                          christof
                a dead one at that

                          interviewer
                and certainly the first time that an
                intruder has been rewarded with a
                starring role
                     gushing
                i really must congratulate you on writing
                kirk back in  a master stroke

                          christof
                     feigning modesty
                since kirk started this whole crisis in
                trumans life i came to the conclusion
                that he was the only one who could end it

                          interviewer
                i understand hes hardly had a life of
                his own since he left the show  how did
                you convince himwas it the opportunity
                to be close to truman again

                          christof
                that and a fat new contract

                          interviewer
                howdoyou intend to explain his twenty
                two year absence

                amnesia

                          interviewer
                     impressed nodding in
                     agreement
                of course

     the interviewer consults his note

                          interviewer
                lets talk ratings  truman has always
                enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge
                over the last few dayshow do you hope
                to sustain that audience now that truman 
                appears to have reconciled himself

                          christof
                as you know ratings have never been our
                primary goal  i imagine well lose those
                voyeurs only interested in witnessing
                trumans latest torment  however im
                certain that our core audience will
                remain loyal

                          interviewer
                but recent events have been so dramatic
                it does raise the perennial question
                what keeps us watching this one man
                twentyfour hours a day  eating
                sleeping working sitting for hours in 
                contemplation

                          christof
                it has to be the reality

     during this segment we cut to a crosssection of viewers  
     the waitress and barman in the bar the two old women on 
     their sofa the two security guards and the man in the bath 
     listening to christofs theories on their viewing habits

                          christof
                weve become tired of watching actors give
                us phony emotions bored with pyrotechnics
                and special effects  while the world he 
                inhabits is counterfeit theres nothing
                fake about truman himself  no scripts no
                cue cards  its not always shakespeare
                but its genuine  thats how he can
                support an entire channel

                          interviewer
                a window onto the human condition

                          christof
                i prefer to think of it as a mirror

     at that moment truman  still live on the screen  
     unwittingly punctuates the pretentious remark with a belch  
     christof and the interviewer try not to notice

                          christof
                not only does he give us a glimpse of the
                truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves

                          interviewer
                but how do you account for the popularity of
                those eight hours a day when truman sleeps

                          christof
                we find many viewers leave him on all
                night for comfort  havent you ever
                watched your child or your lover sleep

                          interviewer
                lets go to some of those viewers calls

     the interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his 
     desks hightech phone terminal  during this segment 
     various windows open on the screen advertising products from 
     the truman catalogue

                          interviewer
                charlotte north carolina for christof

                hello

                          interviewer
                youre on caller  go ahead

                          male caller 1
                christof its a great honor to speak
                with you

                          christof
                thank you

                          male caller 1
                how much of a strain has the last few
                days placed on the actors

                          christof
                working on truman has always been a
                huge commitment for an actor not just in
                terms of separation from friends and
                family but since truman essentially
                drives the plot it is a neverending
                improvisation  witness marlons
                extraordinary performance in the recent
                father and son reunion episode

                          interviewer
                     cutting off the call
                are we talking emmies

                          christof
                certainly a nomination

                          interviewer
                of course truman has always been very
                much in on casting

                          christof
                as with our own lives the only people he
                cant cast are his family  otherwise he
                has final approval able to elevate an
                extra into a lead role as was the case
                with his only real friend marlon or 
                alternatively relegate a star to a bit
                player

                          interviewer

                istanbul turkey youre on with master
                videographer christof

                          female caller 1 os
                christof ive admired your work my whole
                life although i cant say ive seen it all

                          christof
                who can

                          female caller 1
                can you settle an argument for me  
                whats the longest time truman has been
                offcamera

                          christof
                     trace of pride
                in his entire life fortytwo minutes  a
                technical fault in the twelfth season
                accounts for most of that time  the
                remainder generally results from
                blindspots in the early days when
                truman would stray out of range of our
                cameras

                          interviewer
                we should remind viewers that truman 
                especially as a child presented a 
                challenge for the production

                          christof
                     turning to the screen
                let me demonstrate some examples

     footage of truman as a baby appears on the screen  as a 
     newborn infant held in a pair of anonymous latexgloved 
     hands and as a toddler dressed in various baby outfits  
     on one occasion looking through the bars of his crib

                          christof
                he was curious from birth  premature by
                two weeks as if he couldnt wait to get
                started

                          interviewer
                of course his eagerness to leave his
                mothers womb also meant he was the one
                selected

                          christof
                     enthusing
                in competition with five other unwanted
                pregnancies  the casting of a show
                determined by an air date  he was the
                one who arrived on cue

                          interviewer
                who knew that a show originally meant to
                last one year  bringing up baby 
                would turn into a cradle to grave
                concept  he is in fact the first child
                in the world to be legally adopted by a 
                corporation

                          christof
                thats correct

                          interviewer
                and the show now generates a yearly 
                income equivalent to the gross national
                product of a small country

                          christof
                people forget it takes thepopulationof
                an entire country to keep the show running

                          interviewer
                no of course not
                     quickly changing the subject
                and since the show runs 24 hours a day
                with no commercial breaks the staggering
                profits are all generated from product
                placement

                          christof
                yes everything you see on the show is
                for sale  from the actors wardrobe
                food products to the very homes they
                live in

                          interviewer
                all products carefully chosen and 
                tested by you for quality and 
                aesthetic value

                          christof
                theres nothing on the show i dont 
                use myself

                          interviewer
                and its all available in the truman
                show catalogue  operators are
                standing by

     christof nods

                          interviewer
                why do you feel that trumans never 
                come close to discovering the true 
                nature of his world

                          christof
                we accept the reality of the world with
                which were presented  as the show
                expanded naturally we were forced to
                manufacture ways to keep truman in
                seahaven  demonstrating that every
                venture is accompanied by a risk

     the sevenyearold truman we have seen in other flashbacks 
     appears on the screen  wearing a cowboy outfit he goes to 
     cross the walkway of a bridge when he is suddenly confronted 
     by a savage dog wearing a spiked collar

                          christof
                later kirks drowning made much of 
                this kind of intervention unnecessary

     we freeze on sevenyearold trumans terrified face

                          interviewer
                youve never actually met truman 
                yourself  never thought about doing a
                cameoplaying a veterinarian or a
                priest something like that

                          christof
                ive been tempted  but i think its 
                important to retain objectivity  i 
                wouldnt want to get emotionally 
                caught up

                     sensing the thinly
                     disguised resentment in the
                     callers voice
                as the bard says all the worlds a
                stage and all the men and women merely
                players  the only difference between
                truman and ourselves is that his life is
                more thoroughly documented  he is 
                confronted with the same obstacles and
                influences that confront us all  he
                plays his allotted roles as we all do

     the interviewer goes to cut off the call but christof stops him

                          christof
                     rising to the challenge
                and can you tell me caller that youre
                not a player on the stage of life 
                playing out your allotted role  he can
                leave at any time  if his was more than
                just a vague ambition if he were
                absolutely determined to discover the
                truth theres no way we could prevent
                him  i think what really distresses you 
                caller is that ultimately truman prefers
                the comfort of his cell as you call it

                          female caller 2
                     as if trying to convince 
                     herself giving herself away
                no youre wrong  hell prove you
                wrong  he can still do it

     the interviewer hangs up on the caller


     int  a bedroom somewhere  night

     in a darkly lit room we see sylvia  it is she who is the 
     confrontational caller  phone still in her hand

                          christof
                weve learnt about life as truman has
                and despite the complaints of a
                minority its been an overwhelmingly
                positive experience for truman and for
                the viewing public

                          interviewer
                lets take another call
                     pressing a line
                london england youre on tru talk

                          male caller 2 os
                christof  congratulations on the way youve
                always handled trumans sex life  the
                classical music soft lighting and so on
                but has the recent violence caused a problem
                for the shows sponsors

                          christof
                the sponsors know the risks going in
                although we do try to maintain standards
                 a level of decorum  for instance ive
                never put a camera in the toilet

     still in silhouette sylvia turns down the volume on the 
     television  focusing on the window on the screen that 
     displays truman she comes close to the screen catching his 
     melancholy saddened by his regression


     int  trumans basement  morning

     truman breathes in the scent of sylvias sweater one last 
     time before reluctantly replacing it in the trunk together 
     with his bookto the ends of the earth  the age of 
     explorationfor a final time he regards his unfinished 
     picture of sylvia inside  two holes where the eyes should 
     be  as he does so he finds two lost paper cuttings  a pair
     of eyes on the basement floor  he tries them  ironically
     they fit  the picture completed  he closes the trunk
     anyway  with a sense of finality he fastens the lock


     int  control room  night

     the giant onair monitor in the control room plays a closeup 
     shot of truman sleeping

     christof comes close to the monitor and almost touches the 
     screen  as he does so truman twitches in his sleep


     int  bathroom  morning

     truman wipes the mist from the mirror of the bathroom cabinet 
     and stares into it in a way he has never done before


     int  control room  morning

     close up on the giant onair monitor in the control room
     it displays a wide shot of truman staring into the bathroom 
     mirror

     we slowly pull back to reveal simeon and the other video 
     operators sitting at the mixing desks arranged in tiers 
     reminiscent of an auditorium or nasas mission control  
     each mixing desk contains a dozenorso builtin monitors 
     and is designed with a location such astrumans house 
      interior trumans office  cubicle tyrones delithe operator at each desk sitting in a swivel chair and 
     wearing the slimmest of headsets is responsible for 
     monitoring a particular location

     the monitors cover virtually every facet of trumans life  
     camera angles from the interior of trumans house his 
     backyard car office the deli he frequents the seashore 
     to which he is drawn the unfinished bridge where he golfs 
     with marlon  many of the locations strangely devoid of 
     people

     simeon seated in the front row of mixing desks stares back 
     at trumans image on the monitor slightly unnerved

                          simeon
                     to a nearby colleague
                is he looking at us

     as if to reassure the technician truman begins one of his 
     familiar monologues  he talks to the mirror as if being 
     interviewed

                          truman
                what are my plans now  well next im
                thinking of tackling the yuba river in an
                authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe

                class five rapid  only im not goingdownthe yuba im goingupdo you

                          meryl oc
                truman youre gonna be late

     truman sighs as he exits the bathroom


     ext  street  morning

     truman exchanges a cheery greeting with spencer

                          spencer
                how are ya truman

                          truman

                inhaleexhalesame old thing

     he waves to the washingtons across the street  he pets
     pluto the dog


     int  office  day

     back at work at the insurance company truman sits in his 
     cubicle making another of his cold calls

                          truman
                a fortytwo year old woman sitting in
                the second row at an amateur production
                of hamlet hamlets dagger slips from his
                hand and flies into the audience

     a young woman carrying a stack of files catches trumans eye
     as she passes  vivian  she is faintly reminiscent of sylvia
     at the same age  even wearing a similar sweater

                          truman
                     returning to his call
                what im saying is life is a fragile
                thinghullo


     ext  trumans backyard  dusk

     truman wheels his lawnmower deliberately averting his eyes 
     from the back of the house  staring out of the kitchen 
     window a tall glass of iced tea in her hand meryl has been 
     anticipating her husbands appearance  she wears a
     neckbrace we sense more as a reminder to truman than for any
     medical benefit she might derive

     feeling meryls eyes burning into his back truman fires up 
     the mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut 
     section of grass  we focus on the errant blades of grass as 
     they are severed by the mower  a new elk rotary  the lawn 
     is now uniformly trimmed  trumans final act of defiance 
     laid to rest


     int  studio  conference room  night

     christof stands at a large specially screened window 
     silhouetted against the twinkling stars and full moon of a 
     hyperreal nightsky

     members of the cast enter the room  principal characters in 
     trumans life  meryl marlon mother kirk tyrone lawrence
     and the new actress vivian  they take their places around a 
     long oval table for a story conference  vivian sitting 
     slightly apart from the rest of the cast

     we glimpse over christofs shoulder at what he sees  the 
     town of seahaven far below bathed in moonlight  he comes 
     out of his reverie and joins his cast sitting at the head of 
     the table  in front of him a tv tablet plays silently  
     showing truman drinking a glass of milk in his kitchen

                          christof
                     to the assembled cast
                first of all id like to welcome walter
                back onto the show
                     nods in kirks direction
                you may have done us more of a favor than
                you ever imagined
                     turning to meryl using her
                     real name
                regrettably i also have to inform you
                that hannah has chosen not to renew her
                contract

     all eyes turn to meryl  she looks at the floor

                          christof
                im sure we can all respect her reasons

     meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co
     star marlon now out of wardrobe wearing an armani suit

                          christof
                as you all know we have already begun to
                orchestrate her breakup from truman
                     more upbeat
                however on a more optimistic note im
                pleased to announce that televisions
                first onair conception will still take
                place  you witnessed the initial contact
                this morning
                     glancing to vivien once
                     again using her real name
                you all know claudia from her work in
                theatre

                          mother
                i loved your ophelia

                          claudia
                why thank you

     the rest of the cast nod politely in claudias direction  
     chloe passes out a bound document to each cast member

                          christof
                     referring to the documents
                this is a copy of claudias back story
                her characters name is vivien

     the cast idly flips through the documents prominently 
     stamped on the covernot to be taken on setchristof
                we intend to entice truman into the affair
                as soon as possible  claudia will make a
                pass at the insurance seminar trumans
                attending  details are in your schedules
                     pause for effect
                i dont have to tell you how critical the
                next few weeks will be  this takes us
                into the next generation  when trumans
                child is born the network will be
                switching to a twochannel format to 
                chronicle both lives

                          claudia
                what happens when truman and the baby are
                both on camera together

                          christof
                this will simply be duplicate coverage

                          claudia
                     mischievous
                lets just hope we dont have twins

                          marlon
                     uncharacteristically 
                     flippant
                when truman dies do we go back to the
                single channel

     the cast turn in his direction  christof shoots him a 
     disapproving look


     int  trumans basement  night

     truman sleeps on a cot bed in his basement  more cluttered 
     than usual  a virtual bombsite  dozens of cardboard boxes 
     stacked everywhere  although he is covered in bedding his 
     sockclad feet stick out of the bed covers  the outline of 
     his body is still clearly visible  he snores quietly


     int  various viewer locations  night

     the two old ladies have nodded off on their sofa in front of 
     the television their breathing and occasional snores echo 
     those of truman

     in the bar the waitress  normally an avid viewer  only idly
     glances to the screen as she passes with a tray of drinks

     the man in the bath resignedly lets the water out of the tub 
     and goes to get out

     the mother only occasionally glances to the screen as she 
     feeds her baby  her daughter has her eyes closed bopping to 
     her walkman


     int  control room  night

     simeon sits at his control desk directing the nightshift
     he pays scant attention to the big screen giving his 
     instructions in a lethargic metronomic manner

                          simeon
                ready two  go to two

     an operator eating a slice of pizza presses one of the 
     illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes 
     to a close shot of trumans covered head  the camera stays on
     the blanketed head for a long moment

                          simeon
                and back to the medium

     another button is pressed and the angle changed  a trace of 
     frustration is evident in the control room  recording a 
     sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to 
     contend with trumans recently acquired camerashyness

                          simeon
                and wide

                          operator
                     aside to simeon
                what a loser

                          simeon
                who cares  makes life easier for us  
                he is what he is

     at the far end of the control room one of the large double doors
     opens and christof enters dressed in a smoking jacket  simeon and
     the operators subtly straighten in their chairs  christof pretends
     not to notice  he is staring intently at the onair monitor

                          christof
                why is he in the basement

                          simeon
                he moved down there after meryl packed up
                and left

                          christof
                why wasnt i told  any unpredictable
                behavior has to be reported
                     returning to the screen
                is that the best shot we can get

                          simeon
                whats to see

                          christof
                whats on the clockcam

     the operator punches up the camera hidden inside a broken 
     cuckoo clock  a box obscures the view

                          operator
                theres an obstruction

     christof watches truman a trace of concern in his eyes  
     chloe enters

                          christof
                     referring to the debris in
                     trumans basement
                what happened down there

                          simeon
                he was tidying up his garbage
                     sensing christofs concern
                i was going to call you  but halfway
                through he gave up and fell asleep

     apparently satisfied christof turns to an operator

                          christof
                i want to check the setups for 
                tomorrows insurance convention

     reading off the notes in chloes folder the operator punches up
     a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors  they show
     a genericlooking hotel devoid of actors  a banner in reception
     readswelcome seahaven life and accidentthe operator looks to christof for approval and realizes his 
     producers attention has wandered  christof has wandered 
     down to the front of the room to stand beside the giant on
     air monitor still displaying the sleeping figure of truman

                          christof
                give me a shot from trumans ring

                          simeon
                he gave it back to his father

     christof nods

                          christof
                     a trace of concern
                why is he so still

     christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it 
     to his ear

                          christof
                isolate the audio

     an operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel  christof 
     and his colleagues listen to trumans steady breathing in 
     their headphones

                          simeon
                     shrugs
                hes still breathing

     simeon and the operators nod reassured that nothing is
     amiss  christof is not so easily convinced

                          christof
                give me a preview  an ecu on his torso

     a camera hidden in the rooms lamp zooms in to trumans prone 
     outline  while the breathing remains steady the body does 
     not rise and fall  christof still listening to his 
     headphones detects a faint scratching sound followed by a 
     strange thud

                          christof
                     anxious barking a command
                     to chloe
                phone him

     chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials

                          christof
                     anticipating chloes 
                     question
                tell him its a wrong number

     the upstairs phone begins to ring  truman doesnt flinch


     int  an office building somewhere  reception  night

     the two security guards are intrigued by trumans unanswered 
     phone on their television set


     int  control room  night

     christof and simeon concentrate on another separate monitor 
     playing in fastrewind time code in the bottom righthand 
     corner  it is a recording of the nights transmission  
     simeon pauses on the last oncamera appearance by truman

     they watch truman onscreen switch off the basement light 
     and climb into the cot bed fully clothed immediately pulling 
     the covers over his head  as the light is switched off the
     recording camera automatically switches to night vision  
     simeon continues to play at normal speed now and then 
     scrolling forward in fastforward mode  christof suddenly 
     points to screen

                          christof
                there  freezezoom into the chair

     simeon types the appropriate command

     on the blownup screen between a cardboard box and a chair 
     leg it is barely possible to make out trumans hand as he 
     crawls commandostyle from beneath the covers and behind a 
     cardboard box near the large tool cupboard

     simeon points out an angle of the empty staircase

                          simeon
                he hasnt gone up the stairs  hes still
                in the room


     ext  trumans house  night

     marlons car squeals to a halt outside trumans house  
     hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest he 
     dashes barefoot up the porch to the front door  he tries the 
     doorhandle pounds on the door and rings the doorbell 
     simultaneously shouting trumans name all the while

                weve gotta get outside onto the

     frustrated marlon picks up one of meryls carefully nurtured 
     flower pots from beneath the porch window

                          marlon
                     shouting a warning
                im coming in tru

     marlon hurls the flower pot through the window


     int  trumans house  basement  night

     marlon switches on the light and clambers down the wooden 
     stairs to the basement

     he pushes away the clutter and finally stands at his costars
     bedside  he gingerly lifts the covers  beneath the bedding
     clothes have been carefully piled to resemble a sleeping
     figure  socks placed on the end of two tree branches

     buried amongst the clothes is trumans portable tape recorder

     hanging on the door  marlon rips open the door and is hit 
     with a shaft of light  moonlight

     the top of the closet has been removed and a crude tunnel 
     containing a ladder heads almost directly upwards to the

     concealed in a streetlight

                     enraged

     christof lunges forward and presses the button himself  the 
     scene in trumans bedroom playing on the onair monitor is 
     abruptly replaced by the truman logo and the messagetechnical fault  please stand byint  a living room somewhere  night

     the two old women on the sofa are stunned to see their tv 
     screen go blank

     heads also turn in the bar permanently tuned to the truman 
     channel

     alone in her darkened apartment


     int  control room  night

     reminiscent of a military headquarters in wartime the 
     control room is a scene of barely controlled panic  security 
     guards come and go phones ring lights flash every 
     available video mixer is working  the monitors  the eyes 
     of the searchers  are systematically scrutinized for any 
     sign of truman  christof orchestrates operations from his 
     position at the center of the control panel

                          simeon

     ext  seahaven  main street  night

     we pan down one empty street after another  the town center is
     totally eerily deserted  suddenly a line of people comes
     around the corner fanned out cross the street  a manhunt

     people of every description shoulder to shoulder marching 
     down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is 
     conducted at a crime scene  the lines include principals and
     extras lined arm and arm wardrobed for their usual roles as
     executives and secretaries store clerks telephonists 
     maintenance and construction workers waiters and waitresses 
     cooks shoppers health workers security guards postal 
     workers police officers fire fighters and homeless people

     we occasionally glimpse trumans friends and colleagues 
     amongst the searchers  marlon lawrence mother  kirk 
     vivien and tyrone  even the washingtons and spencer and 
     pluto have joined the search  a snarling pluto straining at 
     the leash has now assumed the role of tracker dog  trumans 
     pajamas waved in front of his nose clearly miscast as the 
     friendly neighborhood pooch

     searchlights from seahavens many towers sweep the town  
     once the light falls on a blackened face cowering in the 
     bushes beside a picket fence  the fence now faintly 
     reminiscent of prison bars  even the beam of the full moon 
     appears to be sweeping the town like a searchlight


     ext  bridge  night

     barriers have been erected at the bridge leading out of 
     seahaven guarded by several seahaven police cars

     an extra dressed as a derelict wheels his shopping cart 
     toward the bridge

     the derelict takes a look along the walkway alongside the 
     bridge as if participating in the search  he finds a police 
     officer standing on the walkway

                          police officer
                any sign of him

     a video operator in the sixth row watches the scene on one of 
     his monitors  the derelict standing with his back to camera  
     just as the derelict turns toward camera the operator turns 
     away to take a sip of coffee  he misses what we see on his 
     monitor  the derelicts blackened face belongs to truman

     arms in the middle of a row his disguise still holding up

     to make another sweep

     ext  harborside  day

     however as he bypasses the entrance to a ticket box he 
     hasnt bargained on coming face to face with another 
     straggler from the search

     marlon  truman freezes in front of his childhood companion  
     marlon instantly seeing through trumans homeless disguise

     truman glances nervously in the direction of the searchers  
     their backs to the two men they are beginning their next 
     sweep  one shout from marlon will give truman away  he is 
     at marlons mercy

     without a word marlon walks past truman and rejoins the search

     truman glances back to marlons retreating figure but marlon 
     never looks back


     ext  dockside  day

     truman reaches the edge of the dock  he looks out over the 
     bay  there riding at anchor some two hundred yards out is 
     a sail boat  the same boat that circled kirk and trumans 
     sail boat many years earlier

     we see a closeup of trumans terrified eyes in his blackened 
     face staring down at the lapping water  he steels himself 
     shuts out the doubts and dives into the water

                sweep the harbor

     his colleagues begin to flick through dozens of waterborne 
     hidden camera shots  in moored craft lighthouses and buoys 
      trying to locate truman

     suddenly on one of the monitors there appears a single sail 
     etched against the horizon

                          simeon
                thats got to be him

     instantly transferred to the large onair monitor

     simeon scans a computer shot list  he types in a code

     a camera from the mast of trumans sail boat activates  truman
     unaware of the camera is concentrating on his sailing

     by now the ocean spray has washed most of the dirt from

     suddenly the mast of trumans boat is struck by a bolt of 
     lightning  snapping the rigging and knocking truman 
     overboard  flailing in the tempest truman manages to grab 
     hold of a trailing rope from the mast and handoverhand 
     drags himself back on board  truman takes the rope and 
     lashes himself to the wheel

     monstrous waves continually submerge the boat  with what 
     little is left of his rigging truman continues to head into

     ext  ocean  day

     a series of giant breakers march in formation across the sea 
      arising from an unseen source


     ext  ocean  day

     the waves break across trumans vessel  truman appears to be 
     losing his fight against the storm each successive wave 
     taking its roll on his body sapping his strength his 
     bindings the only thing keeping him upright  his head
     slumps the tiller goes loose in his grasp rocking out of
     control  trumans will is draining away


     int  control room  night

     the control room crew watch the heroic image of truman on the 
     onair monitor awestruck as if they too are now spectators 
     watching a movie


     ext  ocean  day

     as he is about to be overcome by the next wave truman
     clamps the wheel with his whole body and braces for one
     last wave

     but the wave does not come  a strange phenomenon is 
     occurring in the ocean  a distinct division has appeared in 
     the ocean swell  between the large rolling waves lies a 
     corridor of calmer water several hundred yards wide a 
     curious escape lane  the wind and the rain are also 
     subsiding the darkness lifting  a mist clings to the 
     surface of the water  truman steers his sail boat down the 
     eerie corridor

     several large dark shapes emerge on the horizon  land  
     islands  the shapes containing some enormous mechanism 
     including a huge wheel only half exposed above water level 
     appear to be the source of the peculiar wave formations

     truman continues to steer his wrecked sailboat towards the 
     infinitely receding horizon  all is calm until we see the 
     bow of the boat suddenly strike a huge blue wall knocking 
     truman off his feet  truman recovers and clambers across the 
     deck to the bow of the boat  looming above him out of the 
     sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions  the sky he has 
     been sailing towards is nothing but a painted backdrop  
     truman looks upward straining his eyes to see the top of the 
     sky but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight

     clinging to the boat with one hand he tentatively reaches 
     out towards the painted cyclorama  he touches the sky

     he looks about him and simply laughs


     int  control room  night

     christof and his production staff take in trumans reaction
     in stunned silence


     intext  barroomlaundromatstorefrontapartment  night

     trumans laugh echoes around bars offices shops homes and 
     streets  wherever a television is to be found  no viewer 
     speaks  they too are stunned into a hushed expectancy  the 
     collective audience holds its breath


     ext  oceancyclorama  day

     as the boat drifts alongside the seemingly neverending curve 
     of the cyclorama trumans attention is drawn to an outline 
     in the otherwise flawless backdrop  he retrieves the 
     identikit picture of sylvia from his coat pocket and clambers 
     to the prow of the boat

     there camouflaged in the painted skyscape just above the 
     water line is a door  truman grabs hold of the recessed 
     doorhandle and halts the drifting boat  he stands in front 
     of the door and closes his eyes in a silent prayer


     int  control room  night

     the control room crew stare in silence at the monitor  their
     very livelihood on the brink of vanishing  christof opens a
     small panel on his desk breaks a seal and speaks into the
     emergency pa system that is linked to the entire studio

     truman drops the handle as if his hand has been burned  he 
     looks all about him

                          christof oc
                you can speak  i can hear you

     truman takes a moment to overcome his fear and astonishment

                          truman
                who are you

                          christof

     truman struggles to take it all in

                          truman
                nothing was real

                          christofyouwere real  thats what made you
                you so good to watch

     truman takes out the drenched picture of sylvia recalling 
     her words at the beach

                          truman
                     to himself
                the eyes are everywhere


     int  control room  night

     christof picks up a slim flat monitor  he swivels in his 
     chair and gazes intently at the image of truman he now holds in
     his hands

                          christof
                listen to me truman

     on the screen truman again reaches for the door handle


     ext  cyclorama  day

     we focus on trumans hand  christofs voice echoes across 
     the water

                          christof
                you can leave if you want  i wont try
                to stop you  but you wont survive out
                there  you dont know what to do
                where to go

     a wave of doubt washes over trumans face

                          truman
                     referring to the photo
                i have a map

                          christof
                truman ive watched you your whole life

     truman turns back to the sky looking up towards christof

                          christof
                truman theres no more truth out
                there than in the world i created for
                you  the same lies and deceit  but
                in my world you have nothing to fear

     truman seems to be considering the possibilities  he looks 
     to the identikit picture of sylvia in his hand

                          christof
                     suddenly angry
                say something damn it  youre still on
                camera live to the world


     int  a room somewhere  night

     sylvia gazes at the picture of herself on her television 
     screen as if it is her reflection in the mirror


     ext  cyclorama  day

     truman hesitates  perhaps he cannot go through with it after 
     all  the camera slowly zooms into trumans face

                          truman
                in case i dont see yougood afternoon
                good evening and good night

     he steps through the door and is gone  silence  then

      bars homes and offices  we follow the figure of sylvia
     running through the streets  some of the viewers outside an
     electronics store glimpse her as she runs by


     int  control room  night

     even the cynical simeon jumps out of his seat  for the first
     time in the film  and lets out a joyous whoop forgetting
     himself for a moment caught up in the drama

                          simeon
                yes

     selfconscious he takes his seat again almost immediately  
     his colleagues are transfixed by the live onair monitor 
     continuing to play its only available shot the open door in 
     the sky

     gradually the attention of those in the control room shifts 
     from the monitor to christof  he sits slumped staring at 
     the open door in the sky

     eventually moses looks to simeon  moses nods to the on air 
     button  simeon presses the button and the screen  the movie
     screen  goes to static
