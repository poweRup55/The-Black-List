the witching hour 

					screenplay by anne rice



fade in

ext  a scottish moor  night  1670 ad

far off a massive stone castle looms  trees silhouetted an
the horizon against the stardotted qreenpurple sky the branches of one tree seem to reach 
for the stars

tracking in  the tree is a hooded figure suzanne  20 golden hair spilling from her hood 
dazzling green eyes nestled in the folds of her cloak is deborah  5 scarlet curls green 
eyes glowing  she peeks up at the bizarre sky

				deborah a thick scottish accent
		mum  im so scared  look at the color

				suzanne a thick scottish accent 
			entranced soothing
		deborah be still  and listen
			a beat in a chant 
		wind you are a thousand eyes  but never seen  
		a thousand caresses  but never touched  a 
		thousand voices  but never a word  always with me 
		never 

				deborah
			fearful
		mum  oh mum god will surely strike us 

				suzanne
		wind  i love you with that which is endless 
		within me  bring me your eyes  your touch  
		your voice

a wind gathers force the grass sways  leaves twirl

				suzanne
		send me your soul come to me now

the ferocious wind howls  trees bend  the sky darkens suzannes hood is whipped of her 
head a dagger of lightning cuts the sky open  then  a sound like a howl of birth

				a voice
			melodic wondrous 
		suzanne the door is open  call me bring 
		me to you with a name

				suzanne
			ecstatic shouting above the roar 
		for the wind that lashes the trees that brings 
		you to your lover you are  lasher  lasher

thunder rocks her to the ground  rain pours down

				voice
		i am through my love  i have come
			a beat joyful
		lasher

suzanne thrusts her arms out   as if to embrace the wind deborah peeks out from her mothers 
cloak  she looks at the ground  wideeyed  and reaches out

ecu  deborahs clenched fist
the tiny fist opens  a nuge emerald glistens in her palm

fade to black fade up to

day  ecu  the curved runner of a rocking chair

rocking on a wooden floor  a large horned beetle skitters into frame  antenna flicking  
above it the chairs runner reaches its highest point  descends  and just misses it

					womans voice oc
				a southern accent cool 
			do you see the lillies deedee big as soup ladles

tilt up to a pale hand on the chairarm inside a faded pink sleeve  and up to

ecu  a face  skocking in its melancholy visage
a woman  50 a gaunt shattered beauty  not a flicker in her green eyes  her hair is stringy
 in need of a wash

angle  the porch of a large gothic mansion
carlotta mayfair  80 cane in hand rocks diedre mayfair on the porch  her white hair is 
pulled back severely skin tight on her skull  green eyes keen and focused

the house was magnificent  once	tall columnsstained glass  but it is a dying house  
rotted wood peeling paint  you can almost hear it wheeze

angle  the gaden beyond the porch
thick  lush  huge flowers flourish  a flagstone walk leads to a swimming pool filled with 
brackish water and lily pads  a wroughtiron fence encircles the grounds on the other side 
the street seems like another world

back to carlotta and diedre on the porch carlotta takes a syringe from a bag and injects 
diedre who shows no reaction  carlotta feels her pulse

					carlotta
			we numb the body and the mindbut we havent found 
			a needle yat that can prick your soul  that belongs to him 
			doesnt it my beautitul deedee

a breeze suddenly rises  the trees and long grass stir carlotta smiles privately  and 
surveys the garden something there for a moment behind the waving branches

beyond the wrotiron fence
a man  60 white suit fedora and an ivory walking stick  comes down the sidewalk  he tips 
his hat to the women and walks on  carlotta watches him go

					carlotta
				dry caustic 
			well well deedee  both your admirers have paid a call

carlotta looks down at the huge beetle  and crushes it with her shoe  the breeze dies  the 
trees come to rest  but diedres hair still flutters as if stroked by a lovinq hand

int  ecu  a pair of hands rest atop an ivory walking stick

the sticks top is carved into a pair of angels wings the left hand wears an ivory ring  
with a gold t set in it

					mans voice  oc
				an english accent calm sonorous
			diedre was silent  still  as always

tilt up to aaron lightner the whitesuited man who strolled past the mayfair mansion

					aaron
			but there is no question about it she is dying

wide of scene  a magnificent sitting room

aaron stands at a mahogany table where a dozen men and women 	ages 25 to 60 elegantly 
dressed  sit and exchange sober locks at his pronouncement  they all wear the same ring

					aaron
				taps his chest lightly 
			her vibrations were unmistakable  i felt them quite clearly  
				sighs  
			strange to think after thirty yearsi shall walk by the porch 
			and find the chair empty

					woman at the table
			what of the child aaron

					aaron
			the childs life will take its inevitable turn  pause  we 
			will watch and wait and soon  our waiting will be over

ext the pacific ocean day

a sailboat drifts lazily on the flat water  its sails limp in the windless sky  san francisco 
looms in the bg

angel  0n the sailboats deck
rowan  in sweater and shorts  looks at the sky searching for wind and frowns  she strips 
down to a bikini stretches out on the deck and points her face to the sun

ext  the san fransisco coast  a jetty later that day

michael sits out on the rocks sketching a house on a pad  the wind picks up the surrounding 
waters turn choppy  he draws his collar up  a seagull lands near him  michael starts 
sketching the gull

					michael
			the soaring larks lift up aloft with them the sky that to our 
			shoulders was heavy   grins  you like rilke

the bird starts preening  a wave smacks against the rocks spraying michael  he looks around 
at the sea and frowns the wind tugs at him  another wave sprays him  he rises

					michael
			dame weatherman said 

the gull screeches  and suddenly takes off   coming right at him  michael ducks out of the 
way slips on the slippery surface  and falls  his head strikes the rocks a wave pounds the 
jetty and sweeps him into the sea

michael
falling in the water  losing ccnsciousness  being swept out to tea  his eyes closing  hes 
going under   sinking

beneath the sea
michael floats downward  a stream at bubbles squirts from his mouth   then they stop  move in 
to his peaceful face in tighter  into his closed eyes  and through them

pov  speeding through a black night sky with a zillion stars
a fierce roaring  hairpin ttrrns around stars  the cosmic daytona 500  racing toward a huge 
whitehot star smashing through into  silence   freefalling through the richest thickest 
green imaginable

then seeping out off the green phantoms 
shapeless  but the greeness is giving them form suzanne with the emerald round her neck  and 
deborah  a woman now with the scarlet curls  and others  drifting saturated gleaming  
whispering entreating

					suzanne
			go back michael go back

					deborah
			the door michael  find the key

					suzanne
			help us  do what you can

angle  mihael motionless in the green
suspended above a vast blackness  phantoms all around him  and micael starts floating down 
toward it

					suzanne
			michael  no  go back

ext  rowana sailboat in the ocean

rowan is asleep on the deck  the sea is choppy a sudden gust fills the mainsail  it swings 
across the deck  crack  rowan wakes and rises delighted

					rowan
			alright  a little speed

she starts pulling in the mainsail  stops and squints something is out there in the waves  
she dives into the sea   bobbing up to take a look every few strokes

now shes reaching out  grabbing michaels lifeless body her arm slings round him  now 
shes backstroking onearmed

they reach the boat  she grabs the rope ladder  and with remarkable strength  pulls him up  
they sprawl on the deck

she rips his shirt open  pressing her ear to his chest cursing she starts mouthtomouth  
nothing  switching to cpr  pressing down on his chest  rhythmically forcefully

					rowan
			one  two  three  four  five

to fifteen  nothing  she grabs his face  and slaps him

					rowan
			breathe goddamnit 
				slaps him again
			breathe

she starts on his chest again  her pumping is violent now

					rowan
			youre not  pump  gonna  pump
			 die  pump  you sonuvabitch

nothing  shee slumps back  gasping  fury rising  suddenly she rises on her knees  raises 
a fist  and brings it down  striking his chest with all her might  and michaels body jerks 
eerily  water spurts from his south a rasping cough erupts from him  and his eyes open

					michael
				hacking mumbling
			they  they wanted me to come back

and his eyes close  out cold  she nods exhausted  and strokes the matted hair from the gash 
on his forehead then  cocking her head starinq intently at him  the manner of her gesture 
changes  her fingers slide down his cheek  almost a caress



ext  rowans sailboat at sea  later

rowan stands motionless at the railing a blanket wrapped round her  watching michael on a 
stretcher being taken below on the coast guard cruiser alongside her boat  it speeds off  
rowan watches until she cant see it anymore

michael sits before the tvvcr stacked with cassettes  on screen peter lorre  wildeyed 
fingers glowing radioactive and deadly  stalks a victim  oc the howl of a fire engine 
michael cocks his head  and with a dreamy look he stands

int an attic minutes later

michael  gloved and wobbly digs through dusty boxes  his face softens  and he pulls out an 
old singed firemans helmet with the insignia n0 17  he lays it down  hesitates  pulls 
his gloves off reaches out with his hands  and grabes the helmet

a searing flash of white and a roar

int  a fiery flaming buildingg as if michael were there

a fireman  his he1met labelled no 17  races to an open window vith a girl in his arms  
down in the street  other firemen buffeted by a strong wind look up holding a satety net  
the firman tosses the child down to safety  suddenly  the window is blown in shattering  
the fireman falls to the floor  cut and dazed  above hirn  the flames dance  and then 
everything comes down on top of him

back to michael in the attic
as he is jolted to the floor one hand grasping the helmet

ext   a treelined street  as if michael were there

a battalion of firemwn at attention as pallbearers carry a coffin  seated at a reviewing stand 
draped with a black cloth that reads new orleans fire department is a woman  30 siiently 
weeping dressed in widows black  and

a small boy strongly resembling michael
 8 in a black suit  holding a singed firemans helmet with an no 17 insignia  he watches 
the coffin pass fascinated

the boys pov
a tall wavyhaired man in ninteentcentury garb walks solemnly beside the coffin  the 
pallbearers dont seem to notice  he gives the boy a melancholy smile

the boy
pokes his mother and points to the man  but she just pats his hand solemnly  she doesnt see 
what he sees

back to michael on the attic floor
as he drops the helmet  and weeps

int a childrens hospital ward  day

filled with kids  bandages casts eye patches  playing reading watching tv  rowan strolls 
in smiles at the scene  and approaches the boy she saved   his head bandaged he snaps 
together plastic lego pieces  creating a race car

					boy
				looking up smiles 
			reallll fast  seven hundred miles an hour  mmmmm

the boy squints at her  figuring out if shes kidding

angel  michael standing in the doorway 
hes watching rowan  he is holloweyed gaunt  but clean shaven  in clean clothes  rowan is 
unaware at his presence

					rowan
				crouches beside the boy  quite serious 
			thats if i turn on the retroburners

				the boys eyes pop  hes hooked 
			never been caught yet

she offers her palm  and he  slaps her five

					rowan

			in there

he shakes his head no  she affectionately rubs his cheek  then rises and beads toward the door 
michael puts his gloved hands behind his back  and  their alec meet  almost palpable 
electricity  a long beat

					michael

she nods  but her face betrays her shock at his appearance

					rowan

hands she watches him as he stares at the boy

					michael

int rowans office minutes later

					rowan

			where they are

looks her straight in the eye  a wave of current flows

ext a boat dock day  an hour later


rowan and michael walk down toward her boat she glances at his gloves

					rowan

					michael
			as far as touching things yes but the vision  that keeps 
			pouring into my head  stark  it wont go away god  if i 
			could just understand it

they step onto the boats deck  rowan walks to the spot where she revived him and kneels

					rowan
			you had no pulse  you were gone

michael  tightlywound  kneels beside her squeezes his eyes shut  a deep sigh

					rowan
			dont be afraid michael

her tone  and the use at his name  opens his eyes  an electritied sock between them  he 
peels his gloves off steels himself flattens his palms on the deck  and waits

					rowan
			what do you see

					michael
				his face is a blank
			nothing  absolutely nothing

ext an outdoor deck  day  later

michael stands staring down at the dock and rowans boat  the ocean beyond shimmers  he turns 
and walks through open glass doors inside to

a kitchenllving room area
rustic unadorned   halfwalled by the glass doors  michael sits at a choppinqblock island 
and scares at his gloved hands  rowan pours him a scotch and sits across from him

					rowan
			just one  the bars closed

					michael
				gulps down the drink
			 the one time i want it to work

					rowan
			you know  doors and keyholes are common signposts 
			in outofbody 

					michael
				bristles
			youre not gonna give me the textbook analysia are you doctor  
			my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygenstarved 
			brain  and nobody 
	
					rowan
			no im not
				a beat enigmatic
	 		doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about 
			some things

michael  nods in surprise  he tries to pull a cigarette from his pack  his gloved fingers 
fumbling  rowan reaches out and stills his hand with hers  she takes out a cigarette puts it 
in his lips  and lights it  their eyes lock

					rowan
			touch me			
				michaels brow creases
			my hands were all over you maybe something will come from 
			me
				soft soothing
			touch me michael

she holds her hands out to him  he hesitate staring at her offering  he strips off his gloves 
 reaching for her hands  and takes them in his

a flash of white melts to

ext  on the deck of the boat

as rowan slams her fist into michaels chest  and he jolts to life  she caresses his cheek in 
unmistakable longing

the image is sucked through a hole in itself to 

int   rowans kitchenn as if michael were there

where a man  50 in a bathrobe  lies twitching on tfle floor eyes glazing into death  rowan 
is crouched beside him weeping fists clenched mumbling graham

					rowans voice oc
			owwwwwww

suddenly back to rowans kitchen
as rowan  with a yelp  wrenches her hands free or michaels vise girp  he tumbles backwards 
onto the floor  rowan races round to him and kneels  cradling his head geritly

					michael
				eyes opening weakly
			my gloves

she grabs them and slips them on his hands   her lush hair is tussled by a stadden breeze that 
blows in from the deck

					michael
				softly awestruck
			i saw it  on the boat  i was  dead pause  you brought 
			me back

enongh electricity to light a city he takes her hands gently in his 

					michael
			with these

the breeze sends some papers into the air  rowan bends to him  their lips meet in a soft brush 
or a kiss  and then the gates open  lips searching  hands tearing at clothes  limbs 
entwining  a whirlwind of flesh finds a rhythm two pounding themselves into one  rough 
ontheedge

					rowan
			harder

					rowan
			harder

					michael
			like this  like this

					rowan

int rowans living room later

watch theflames

			life and then seduce you

she rises on an elbow  with that enigmatic look

					rowan
			what else did you see michael

					michael
				a curious grin
			whatre you  a mindreader
				a beat turns solemn 
			who was the man on the kitchen floor 

rowans brow knits  stunned  not what she expected

					rowan
				stiff softly 
			my uncle  graham  he and my aunt ellie raised me  
				pause 
			he  he  had a stroke  just before ellie died  of cancer  
			last year

					michael
			you knelt there helpless  you couldnt save him  pause  
			there was so such anger in you   death infuriates you

she puts her head back down on his chest  a long beat

					rowan
			its unbelievable that you can do that

					michael
				a beat turns dark
			it  it feels like  like im being filled up crowded out of 
			myself pause  like im fading away

rowan slides up face to face  her eyes filled with warmth

					rowan
			youre here michael  all of you

she leans in and kisses him deeply  and they start again

ext closeup  michaels face floating underwater

michael lying on his stomach on the dock  daytime
his head out over the edge staring at his reflection

					michael
			ive always loved them  pause new orleans has these great 
			old houses  when i was a kid id look at them thinking   
			somebody dreamed them up put something where there was nothing
			it amazed me

and runs a finger across it

stares at her letters  he eyes her tapping finger and looks up at her

their gazes lock  and  rowans eyes suddenly fill with tears  michaels face creases with 
concern he reactres for her  but she rises  starts pacing

					michael

					rowan

int  michaels house day

rowan wanders wideeyed stunned by its beauty  she enters the bedroom where michael stands 
staring at the mess

shakes her head

					rowan
			were quite a pair you and i

					michael
				matching her grin
			mad for each other

ine  a bedroom  late night

moonlight on a dusty floor  diedre lies motionless in an old brass bed  her open eyes welling 
with tears  her wrists and ankles in leather restraints  the window curtains flutter

closeup  diedres face in the moonlight
as a tear rolls down her cheek  then	 changes direction  moving across her cheek and 
disappears  as if someone had brushed it away  a haunting smile blooms  her eyes close

int an operating room

rowan works feverishly on an out of frame patient thirteen figures  faces hidden by surgical 
masks  encircle the operating table  watching silently  rowan throws her hands up in despair
her confidence failing

					rowan
			i  i cant do it

the others urge her on  imploring encouraging her

					rowan
				pointing out of fram  frantic
			but look  look  how can i do it

rowan shoots up in her bed at night
jolted awake by the rain whipping at her windows  the clock says 3 am  the rain is like a 
whisper  every nerveend at attention  she reaches under the bed and brings up a bat  heart 
pounding  stepping into the hall reaching

the darkened living room
the wind moans  the rain flows thickly down the glass walls giving the sky and ocean beyond a 
weird melted look

					rowan
				tense  but brave
			it somebodys here 

she whirls round  there  on the deck is a man  wavy hair achingly handseme victorian 
clothes  the man at the funeral procession in michaels vision  his hands rest on the glass
the rain seems to go through him  rowan raises the bat 

					rowan
			ill take your goddamn head off

she dashes to the glass doors  yanks them open and steps out  but the deck is empty  
drenched she reaches out  and touches the glass where the mans hands had been  she snatches
her hand away quickly  and stares at her fingertips incredulous

int rowans kitchen predawn

the storm is over  rowan sips from a wine glass staring at her fingertips  she rubs them 
together deep in thought the phone rings once  and the answering machine kicks on

					rowans voice on the message

int  an airliner above the clouds later that morning

rowan alone in her row asleep moving in tight the sounds of the plane fade  her tongue 
darts across her lips sensually  a soft silky moan  her body moves  shifting accommodating
her breath catches  her head arches back

the edge of the gleaming coffin  a deep breath and she walks into

the room
she is alone  slow steps toward the coffin  rowan halts  standing above the coffin  
looking down

diedre lies in a bed at flowers  folded hands on a pale blue gown  rowans hand hesitates 
lightly touchs the gown  and then drops to her side  she stares expressionless

int a backseat of a taxi  same time

lavender  and now  the mayfair mansion in all its tragic glory comes into frame

					michael  oc

michael walks to the gate
runs his finger across it and grins  on the other side bloodred camellia blossoms lie in the 
grass he kneels reaches in and gathers up a few  the rest skirt away in a sudden breeze  he 
rises   and comes face to face with the man  standing on the other side of the fence  
smiling faintly in his victorian clothes

michael drops like a stone  a hand grasps his shoulder  he yelps  turns to see aaron lightner
kneeling beside him  then everything goes black

rowan still stares out the window  a long beat

					rowan
			ive been lied to my whole life

throats clear  bodies shift in seats

int a bedroom same time

michael sleeps in a mahogany bed  eyes opening squinting  he sits up  his suitcase on an 
antique bench  clothes on a valet  a robe at the foot of the bed he gets up  wobbly  puts 
on the robe and wanders into

a beautiful maogany and marble parlor
where the whitesuited aaron lightner sits on a lush leather sofa staring benignly ivory 
walking stick at his side

into the top of the crypt is mayfair  and never die

four men slide the coffin inside the one open vault a breeze kicks up sending flowers into
the air one lands between carlotta and rowan  the old woman bends stiffly and picks the huge
flower up  she smells it  and a private smile blooms  the crowd begins to drift apart

michael turns a page  removes his gloves  rubs his hands

ecu  the page                 						petyr van ables vo
michaels bare hands come    						all that i feared is true  
into fram and hover     						the lady in question is my 
his fingertips descend       					suzanne  and she is to be
and touch the page  							burned at the stake as a 
										witch  i was permitted 
										to see her in her cell

a ferocious roar  and a flash of blinding white turns to

int a dungeon  morning  1683  as if michael were there

petyr van abel  35 scar1et hair grey coat and large black hat  stands in a hall as a hooded
figure unlocks a door petyr steps in  the door shuts  he squints in the darkness

					womans voice 
			youll have no confession from me leave  laughs   or ill 
			turn your teeth into mushrooms

					petyr
			suzanne  it is petyr

chains rattle and suddenly suzanne  ragged fettered in chains  is before him  they embrace
passionately

					suzanne
			oh my love  my	sweet loving petyr
			
					petyr
			i should never have left you  never

					suzanne
			but you are here now  all the years apart are washed away

they sink into a deep long kiss  he holds her at arms length  his face grave and pained

					petyr
			what have you done suzanne  they say 

					suzanne
				her defiance returns
			no  not what they say  pause the baron was beyond medicine  
			my  prayer was to save him not kill

					petyr
			prayer who did you pray to my love

a smile washes over her  she caresses his cheek

					suzanne
			they are already piling the sticks there is no time  pause
			but petyr  you must know this now  i have a daughter  we 
			have a daughter

petyr freezes with astonishment  she smiles sadly

					petyr
			my god suzanne  where  where is  

she silences him with a gentle finqer to his lips  ssshhh

					suzanne
			across the sea in st domingue free from the grasp of fearful men

the clink of a key in the lock  she clutches petyr to her

					suzanne
			it is good to have the one you 1ove with you  when it is time to die 
			pause  it will be a special day

the door opens light pours in and burns everything to white
		
int the mayfair mansion  late night

rowan follows carlotta down a hall the walls hung with portraits like those in the ta1amasca
gallery  carlotta points at a woman  40 a bloodred gown wearing the pendant  standing 
before a pristine version of the mansion

					rowan
				spooked edgy

they reach a winding staircase at the halls end a gust of wind blows the lamp out  darkness

					carlotta
			you can see well in the dark rowan

					rowan
				stiff simmering

					carlotta
			put your hatred for me aside so you can clearly see what is ahead

a match light  and it burns out the frame to a hot white

int an inn  day

petyr hellish and gaunt   				    petyr van abels vo
writes feverishly at a table     			i am lost to all forever
								how to tell what ive seen 
on fresh parchment      				and not sound a madman if 
								only i were   a sailor 
petyr glances out the window 				shall shepherd these pages 
at a ship in the harbor				to you  i dare not board 
								the ship fearing he will 
suddenly he whirls round 				follow and send innocents to 
looking straight to camera				their doom in my wake i 
								have cause for my dread
								
the image shatters into

ext a seventeenth century town square   morning
encircled by shops  a stake at the center sticks piled at its base  a torch burns in a 
stanchion  a church spire towers above it all  petyr is among the large crowd watching two 
columns of priests near the stake between them is suzanne  in a white robe holding a large 
candle  the procession halts  she scans the crowd and finds petyr  she smiles at him  then 
 her face turns fierce

					suzanne
			i never did any of you harm i am unjustly condemned
			i have no love for satan

the crowd jeers  burn her  witch send her ashes to hell  she hurls the candle down

					suzanne
			witch is it  growls come now lasher  come

a rumbling like thunder fills the air  a wind begins to swirl  the sky darkens  curses 
from the crowd as they raise arms and cloaks against the swirling dust

					suzanne
			my beautiful lasher  strike down those who would come to 
			see me die

the wind howls  shutters break free  windows shatter  and from the rooftops tiles  a storm
of them  shower down on the terrorstricken crowd the town is being ripped apart  and at the
eye of the storm suzanne watches eyes burning

panic  people rush madly arms over heads trampling those whove fallen cries in the wind
blood puddles the ground shops burn  bodies piled at every doorway  armageddon

petyr stands in the center of the chaos near a frantic priest

					priest
			where is she find her

					suzanne oc
			petyr

suzanne is high up on the church parapet 
she leaps off  flying down robe rippling in the stort and crashes down atop the priest  
petyr  tears flowing  kneels at her broken body  and gently takes her hand in his

					a mans voice unseen
				powerfull booming
			petyr van abel

petyr looks up  and races away  just as the looming church tower sways  and comes crashing
down

int  diedres room  late night

carlotta and rowan appear in the doorway

					carlotta

mattress is bare

rowan slams the wall  her fury rises  trembling  carlotta suddenly flinches  a hand to her 
forehead  a deep breath

					carlotta

rowan starts for the door  carlotta shuffles after her

					carlotta

			as i have   ive fought his all my life  used my 
			power and anger to turn him away  pause diedre 
			was not so strong  that is why i kept your mother a

rowan freezes at the door  and turns back to carlotta

					carlotta
			and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones 
			even as she had him inside her

					rowan
			youre mad  your mind is sick

					carlotta
			and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster  
			to kill the legacy  pause  you are the sum of his desires 

					rowan

				rowan stands frozen

bullseye  rowan steps back in horror  the curtains flutter  rowan backing up unsteady down
the hall  furious haunted  carlotta advancing  something falls oc  crash

					rowan

she has backed up to the staircase  she trips aver the cat yowl  and grabs the bannister  
carlotta comes face to face

					carlotta
			did you like it looking down at graham and knowing what you 
			could do

					rowan
				erupting out of control
			im not like you  im not youre cruel 

carlotta suddenly winces  eyes squeezing shut in pain

					rowan
			 twisted 
				a jagged moan from carlotta
			 vicious   you vile old 

carlottas hands fly to her head  her cane topples and rattatats down the staircase  she 
wobbles  equilibrium going  rowan comes out of her blind fury and grabs her

					rowan
			oh my god  i  i   pause are you alright
				shakes carlotta
			carlotta  carlotta

and carlotta  wounded stunned  slowly opens her eyes

					carlotta
			youre more dangerous than i knew youre strength will make 
			him more than he has ever been
				cold piercing
			i should have killed you

rowan releases her  pierced rocked by the words and she races down the stairs into darkness

					carlotta
			i should have killed you when you where born

whack  the door to diedres room slams shut  carlotta whirls round toward it  the wind 
moans

on the first floor landing  at tne bottom of the stairs 
rowan freezes in her tracks at the sounds

back on the second floor
a gust of wind whips at carlottas dress  she grabs the bannister for support  a piercing 
whistle in the wind carlotta winces  grabs her head  the cat meows

					carlotta
			so its now when im weakened pause  you wretched obscenity

blood trickles from her nose and mouth  an inner cataclysm jolts her  her grip slips  she 
topples down the stairs

on the first floor landing  the bottom of the stairs
rowan is frozen  katunkkatunkkatunk   out of the dark carlotta tumbles down the stairs 
to rowans feet

rowan stares wideeyed   then quickly kneels beside carlotta grabbing her limp wrist 
checking for a pulse she puts her ear to carlottas chest  shes dead  rowan stares in 
horror  then something shifts in her face something unknowable suddenly known  suddenly 
believed

					rowan
			youre here

silence  she walks slowly down the hall past the portraits  stopping with her back to a huge 
mirror in an ornate frame

					rowan
			i know youre here  pause  you killed her didnt you  pause
			come out you bastard

behind her in the mirror  a foggy phantasm drifts across the glass  and is gone  rowan 
looks down  at her feet is the emerald pendant  she picks it up  oc down the hall  the 
tinkletinkletinkle of glass rowan walks into

the living room
dust and decay  cracked leather chairs  a chadelier of a hundred cutglass pieces  does it 
sway slightly

					rowan
			what did she call you  lasher

she whirls round there in the corner 
the shimering transparent specter  handsom angular  rowan is stunned  but still  they eye
each other

					rowan
			what are you

the specter flickers  and disappears  sfle dashes to where it was  and then  hands are 
clutching her from behind  she shrieks  she is twisted round  and she looks into 
michaels face  and violently clings to him

					michael
			what is it tell me

she tries to find words  suddenly  her head swivels from here to there  looking round the
room

					rowan
			theres something  someone  here

he stiffens  and glances round the room

					michael
			wheres carlotta

rowan shivers  and slowly she points to the hall he takes her hand  shes like a mule 
holding her ground  he has to pull her with him out into

the dark hall
and down to the foot of the stairs there lies carlotta  michael stares dropjawed

					michael
			jesus christ
				a beat
			was it  a man

					rowan
				stunned
			but how did  how could you 

from the dark at the top of the stairs  fffttfffttffftt they freeze and peer into the 
blackness fffttffftt  michael picks up carlottas cane  names it high its coming down 
the steps  closer  and   something leaps out at that trot the dark

					rowan
			michael

michael swings lethally  and the cat soars past him  yeeowwlll  and scampers away they 
both exhale with spent fear  and look at each other

					rowan
				a long beat
			you know
	
					michael
				a slow nod
			i know  its not possible  but i know

a long beat  rowan is starting to tremble she looks down at carlottas crumpled body

					rowan
			she  she said i  i was a 

					michael
			 a witch

rowan looks back up at hit  and nods

int the  mayfair mansion porch  an hour later

rowan sits holloweyed in the rocking chair  michael stands behind her his gloved  hands on
her shoulders

					rowan
				quiet astonishment
			a whole town

me nods gravely  he starts to pace desperate for legic

					michael
			it couldve been a tornado  or a  a hurricane  maybe 

					rowan
			michael  i saw him  twice
				a long beat very softly
			carlotta said i    killed graham  with  with my anger

					michael
			ro  you cant really believe that nobody can murder someone with 
			their feelings  i mean  thats crazy

					rowan

			hands that can see
				that silences him a beat
			god michael  what am i

a coroner comes out the front door with gifford  paramedica carry a body bag out toward an 
ambulance  gifford walks to rowan and michael  they watch the ambulance pull away

			thinking shed live forever  pause  well  
			she made it clear   no ceremony just cremation 
			pause  diedre  now carl  pause you get some

rowan by the hand

					michael
			even if its all true  that doesnt make you a witch   
			its 1992 rowan

					rowan
				her shoulders sag
			but it scares the hell out of you doesnt it michael

he hesitates  and takes her by the hand track with them as they go down the walk and   hold
on the swinging gate as they walk out of frame  track back along the walk up the steps to 
the motionless rocking chair where the cat has curled up  the chair starts to rock

int the operating room in rowans dream

rowan works feverishly on an out of frame patient the masked figures watch silently  rowan 
throws her hands up in despair her confidence failing

on it a tiny hand

staring at juliens portrait  arron refills rowans coffee cup  and nods

					aaron
			many times over the past thirty years why he shows himself to 
			me i dont know but lashers not some mindless wraith

					rowan
			then what is he

					aaron
			a spacial entity  an organized energy  something that precedes 
			our definition of existence

					michael
			a what

			a spirit  perhaps evil  to rowan and he has come to you 
			with diedre gone  youve inherited him

					rowan
			michael  you loved that house as a child  you could

			horror  and lasher with it

michael eyes her  thinking  intrigued in spite of his fear

michael frowns begrudgingly  he rises walks to the window and lights a cigarette  staring at
the night she watches him  he sends a stream of smoke out the window  finally

					michael
			you really felt him  inside you

she comes up behind him  her hands slip round his waist

					rowan
			it was like a dream  it wasnt real

					michaerl
			but it wasnt a dream  and he is real

she takes his face in her hands  and shakes her head

sidewalk michael hesitates  and takes his gloves off

					aaron

he scratches at his cleft  she grins lovingly

					rowan
			why do i love when you do that  

she pushes his gloved hana away  and rubs his cleft atfectionately with her finger  she 
grins

					rowan
			arent we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or 
			their courage or their beneficence 

					michael
			their what

					rowan
			so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin

she gives him a kiss

					michael
			wanna snack

					rowan
			a little wine

and he leaves  rowan smiles to herself  and starts brushing her hair  she picks up a hand
mirror to see the results lashers face locks back at her just over her sholder she jumps
a mile  whirls round  there is no one there she slowly looks back to the mirror  there is
his reflection again with his melancholy smile  her face hardens

					lasher
			i am with you  pause  you yearn to know me  so i am with you
			you call me  and i love you all the more for that
				gentle poignant
			i know how the desert flower feels when it drinks of the rain

rowan is motionless entranced by his words by the music of his voice  translucent hands seep
out of the mirror and frame her face caressing her

					lasher
			you do not love michael   how can you love  if you lie

					rowan
			lie

					lasher
			there are things you will not tell him

she raises an eyebrow  he strokes her  her eyes close in sensual contentment  spectral 
fingers caress a breast

					rowan
			michael is healing  if i hide things from him  its because love him

lasher takes this in  does he smile

					lasher
			then you will lie to him about me  wont you

rowans eyes snap open  narrowed in anger  heating up from within  focused on the mirror 
suddenly the glass shatters  piece falling to the floor

					lashers voice
			you grow stronger

and a spectral image of michael rises in slivers from the scattered chards  1ike a shredded 
willowy phantom

					lashers voice in michaels form
			can he make you feel as i do

michael comes through the doorway
with a sandwich and a glass of wine  and lasher is gone

					michael
				chewing bad french accent
			a chardonnay mademoiselle  pleasantly mild but pretentious

rowan stares at him  between two worlds  he sees the shattered glass  and comes to her  her
hand is bleeding

					michael
			hey  youre bleeding

					rowan
				fuzzy hollow 
			dropped it

michael grabs a tissue  and starts to wrap her hand

int the mansion   a room  the next morning

					stu
			what rings

michael shoots him a look  just to make sure hes kidding

					michael
			get out of here  im gonna have my final cigarette  i promised 
			ro id quit

stu pats him affectionately on the cheek  and leaves

michael lights up a smoke  closes his eyes  takes a deep drag  and exhales  the thick smoke
floats in the air and it coats lashers translucent form  making him visible standing 
inches in front of michael  lasher blows gently at the smoke  and it floats back toward 
michaels face

michael opens his eyes  lasher is gone  michael puts on his coat  and walks out

int the mansion  rowan and michaels room  same time

and he drinks as laughter fills the hall 

int the mansion  the second floor hall  later

diedres room
new studs and sheetrock are up  the cat wanders in

					gifford
				strolls bourbonmellowed
			ahh deedee  fewer and fewer of us left now hmm  pause  what 
			happens to the stories when were all gone

then  he grins  bends down  and rises with the gold saw

					gifford
			two hundred bucks for a saw

he angles the saw so he can see his reflection and in the gleaming gold surface he sees a
hellish face of skull and bloodied flesh  his face

ext the mayfair mansion later that afternoon

as the guests go home rowan and arron lean on the porch railing watching michael on the 
sidewalk putting stu in a cab  a long beat  then rowan grins faintly to herself

watching michael aaron reaches out and takes her hand

before him in a sheer robe  cool seductive  she unties the robes sash and it slips to the
floor  the moonlight washes over her body

					rowan
				soft but alosta command

			michael  dont let anything else in

her face shines with passion and power  she peels his gloves off  places his hands on her  
and buries his face against her  he hesitates then starts exploring her with his hands

she pushes him back onto the bed  a slow sexual ballet begins  and escalates  she straddles
him  and mounts him  gazing down at him she slides into a slow thick rhthym  her eyes 
close  a moan slips from her

					rowan
			yes michael  harder
				michael shifts into a faster gear

she stiffens  her eyes pop open
lasher  spectral his nakedness flickering  appears wrapped round her trorn behind his face
against her flushed cheek  his body moving getting her back into her myths

the bodies move like a fierce machine  rowans climax takes her to speechlessness  she 
collapses onto michael the lovers lie still and silent  lasher is gone

int the hotel room the next morning

michael and rowan in bed asleep  he wakes with a sleepy smile and reaches out to her  she
wakes with a jolt 

					michael

rowan focuses on him  getting her bearings  his hand slides under the covers to her body
she stops him

					rowan
				almost hard
			no  softens  not  not now

she pulls the covers up over her  his grin shows

					michael
			when you get married i thought the sex stopped after the 
			honeymoon

she rolls away from him  he shrugs  and gets out of bed

ext the newlyweds bayou cottage patio  day 

rowan lies in a lounge chaise eyes closed  she looks under the weather  michael sits next to
her sketching  his eyes dart from his pad to rowan  deft quick strokes

					michael

				eyes closed flat
			mmhmmm

					michael

he grins  sketching quickly now finishing  he holds up it is a goofy caricature of rowan 
gaptoothed freckled crosseyed with pigtails going out at angles

					michael
			so  you like your portrait

rowan  eyes closed  gives the slightest of nods  michael smiles mischievously

					michael
			gee  look at that  i didnt know alligators came this far up on shore

sits in the shadows with an accordion playing an eerie tune  a funky pickup truck is parked 
off to the side  the mercedes pulls in at the pumps

inside the car
michael and rowan wait for service  he honks the horn

					michael
			everybody must be out back sacrificing a virgin to the crocodile 
			god

he gets out and walks toward the old man with the accordion who sits with his back to the car

					michael
			excuse me
				taps the old man on the shoulder 
			im trying to find 

the old man turns round  half his face is a mass of ancient scars  thick and deep  winding
all the way down his neck  michael reflexively rears back  stunned  the old man smiles

					old man
			jesus stopped here once  for directions

and out of the office comes an attendant  50 greasy overalls a friendly grin

					attendant
			gator got him nice huh mister

michael stares at the old man  and then  the attenant sees the mercedes  his eyes widen

					attendant
			jesus st cracker  look at that beauty

he walks to the car circling it admiring it  he smiles in at rowan  two men  30s jeans 
and tshirts  come out of the office and stand arms folded staring at the car the 
attendant leans in a window eyeing the cars interior

					michael
			we on the right road to the cajun kitchen

playtng the slow soft tune again

ext  a small dark road  minutes later

michael locks back to the road  the pickup truck is stopptd in the middle of the road

					man  1
			you two lovebirds wanna step outside

and step out onto the road on opposite sides of the car

he hooks his arm round her neck drawing her face to him roughly

					man  2

			get your goddamn hands 

man  1 slams michael against the car  man  2 locks rowan in a grubby kiss  she is solid
stone  her eyes focused on man  2 like a gunsight  suddenly  he breaks off the kiss  and 
releases her  staring at her weirdly

					man  1
				laughs
			shit rollie  she give you a shock

man  2 steps back from rowan his face twisting up wincing  something is happening   
rowan glares at him like a beacon

					man  1
				his smile fades
			rollie    hey man

man  2 goes down on one knee hands going to his head man  1 comes over to him  his alarm
growing

trickle of blood at his nose  man  1 whirls on rowan with the shotgun

knocks him cold with the butt  he whirls to rowan 

					michael
			get in the car
				rowan is entranced
			rowan

shes in another world  he shoves her inside  dives in his side  screeches into reverse 
does a 180 and speeds away

inside the car
michael  freaked  driving like a bat out of hell rowan slumps in her seat slowly coming 
back

ext the mayfair mansion  late night

the mercedes pulls up and parks  michael gets out dishevelled scraped up  rown gets out her

a long beat  they walk to the dark house and enter  a light comes on  stu comes sleepily
down the stairs

					stu
			what are you doing here

they walk past him  silent  exhausted  and step into their room and close the door

int  the operating room in rowans dream 

rowan works feverishly on an out or frame patient  the rnasked figures watching silently 
rowan throws her hands up in despair her confidence failing

					rowan
			i  i cant do it

the others urge her on  imploring encouraging her

					rowan
				pointing out of frame frantic
			but look  look	how can i do it

oc  a muffled cry  tilt down slowly  the operating table comes into frame  and lying on it
a tiny hand  pull out slowly to reveal more of the body on the table the tiny hand and an 
arm joined to a 

rowan sudenly wakes in bed beside michael 
she tosses the sheets back  and stumbles into the bathroom  she closes the door kneels at 
the toilet  and vomits

down

int the mayfair mansion  the living room  same time

rain streams down the windows  rowan sits reading as michael kneels at the fireplace in a 
sweater muttering striking matches trying in vain to start a fire

					rowan
			thats cause were below sea level

					michael
				crabby

			thats not funny

he sighs  walks to the window and stares out at the rain his back to the room

					michael
				sings  half to himself
			i left my heart in ran sanfisco

rowan glances at the fireplace  with an almost mischievous look  she focuses on the logs  
her gaze narrows  as if she is trying to see something that isnt there  shes going inside 
herseif summoning up something  and 

a flame
suddenly flicks out from the logs

rowan
intensitiet her stare and  the logs bursts into flame  she grins to herself  and buries 
her nose in her book
	
					michael
			ro what do you think about  about spending thanksgiving back 
			in 

turning now he stops  seeing the blaze  huh  he does a slow turn to rowan  eyeing her
suspiciously

					michael
			you did that didnt you
	
					rowan
				looks up innocently
			talking to me dear

he shrugs  and walks before the fire staring into it  rowan watches him

					michael
			remember the first time we made love  and then 

					rowan
				smiles
			 we made a fire

a beat  suddenly her smile drops  shes read his thoughts

					rowan
				firm almost defensive

michael whirls round to her his back to the fire 

					michael

rowan gives hi a chastened nod  a beat

					michael

michael hesitates  and nods  he slowly grins

					michael
			just do me a favor  dont start anymore fires  or turn on the
			lights by blinking  or cook with your hands behind your 

and suddenly 

the blaze silently erupts from the fireplace  becoming a demonic fiery virsion of lasher  a
mass of jagged leaping flames  and hovers over them unseen by michael  rowans eyes bulge 
 and she wraps her arm tightly  glaring furiously at the flaming specter lasher dissolves 
into a thousand flames  and disappears michael separates himself fram her  startled

					michael					
			what the hall are you 

and she pulls him back to her  and holds him tight

					rowan
				shaking with emotion 
			i love you more than anything in the world michael
				glances at the room 
			more than anything

ext  the mayfair mansion  day  a week later

they dont see rowan come through the gate and up the walk

					michael
				singing

michael grins  and goes back to hammering  whack whack

					rowan
				brimming with excitment
			michael i spoke to the geneticist from stanford and she 

and  a rung of michaels ladder cracks  he falls grabbing at air  and finally grabs on to
a rung hanging suspended  twisting  nobody breathes and he finally gets his footing

					michael
			goddamn sonuvabitch

sighs of relief all around  he climbs down  bzzzzz 

					rowan

					michael
			a little sore  darm  to stu finish up my section will ya

stu nods  and leans to the spot where michael was working

					michael
				to rowan

whack  something drops free from beneath the eaves  grey round  like a huge melon with 
ridges  landing in front of him on the gutter  bzzzzzzz  two black antennae wiggle out of
a crack in the sphere

					stu
				softly  with realization 
			oh shit

the sphere splits open  and dozens and dozens of wasps swarm out  a black cloud enveloping 
him he screams  topples tram the ladder  and lands with thud rowan and michael rush to 
him  stu lies motionless

int  a hospital room  evening  two hours later

rowan and michael sit at stus bedside  stu sleeps  his arm in a cast  his face and hands 
swollen beyond recognition  michael shakes his head sadly steeped in grief

					michael
			is he  is he gonna die

				her eyes locked on stu 
			lock the door
				michael looks at her  confused
			lock it

he rises and locks the door then turns and watches silent

rowan is still  her eyes narrow into slits of concentration  the air seems to shimmer around
her  she leans to stu  to his grotesque swollen lips  she closes her eyes  and kisses 
him stus deformed face shimmers  the angry flesh lightens and slowly it shrinks back
to his normal visage

rowan opens her eyes  and slowly turns to michael who stands flattened against the wall 
speechless amazed  she turns back to stu grasps his disfigured hand brings his fingers to 
her lips  and kisses them one by one

int the mansion  a first floor room  later that night

the room is unfinished  there is a bed and a dresser  michael sits on the bed staring at the
floor  rowan  in a robe  sits beside him

					rowan
			it was an accident
				michael raises a skeptical eyebrow 
			michael  there isnt a house in new orleans this old that doesnt
			have a wasps nest somewhere

he stares at her  unconvinced  she tries for logical 

					rowan
			michael  why would he want to hurt stu

					michael
			i dont know

he lies back and turns off the light darkness  she lies beside him reaches out and finds his
hand  a long beat

					michael
			you changed him rowan  you went right down to each cell  and 
			changed him

they lie there silently

int the bedroom later that night

michael sleeps  rowan lies beside him staring out the window  a breeze whistles  she rises 
and walks out of the room  down the hallway  out the front door and down into

the garden
she stares at the sky  there is a bright moon but no stars

					rowan
			a moon but no stars

the trees and bushes sway in the breeze

					rowan
			the wasps were meant for michael  but theres only so much you 
			can control isnt there  the great and powerful lasher  undone by 
			a faulty ladder
				silence
			why would you hurt him  answer me

					lasher unseen
			i 1ove you rowan  ive always loved you
				rowan whirls around 
			i only wanted to be in your thoughts to bring myself into your 
			thoughts  so i could be as we are now

					rowan
			you violated me  on my wedding night

					lasher unseen
				curious sincere 
			explain this to me  violated

					rowan
			you bastard

the breeze blows stronger  a huge flower drops at her feet

					lasher unseen
			i made it for you

rowan bends and picks up the bizarre flower  intrigued

					rowan
			made it

					lasher unseen
			it is from love

					rowan
			to love you must be able to feel

					lasher unseen
			if you knew how i yearn for that

and  there in the moonlight lasher materializes shimmering  transparent  spectral  
beautiful  melancholy

					lasher
			if i could feel like you feelbut i have only others feelings    like
			breeres that blow through me  things to be felt yes  but not nine 
			to feel

					rowan
				to be reckoned with 
			it you harm michael i will let my anger loose  and you will feel that
			do you understand

					lasher
				chastened softly

			yes
				a long beat
			my love is as strong as michaels how is it there is love in you for
			one  and not for another

she is stunned by the depth of his question he smiles

					rowan
			youre very clever arent you

					lasher
			i am only what you are  what all of you have been  pause what 
			do you think of yourself now my love

she stares at the flower  feeling its texture  smelling it

					rowan
			how much of it is me  alone and how much is you
				lasher flickers
			lasher  what do you want

and he dissolves nothing  she looks at the flower  it starts to shrivel  and disintegrates
in her fingers

dissolve to

ext  the mayfair mansion weeks later  day

the house is closer to renovations end than the beginning

int the mayfair mansion  diedres room  same time

the room is almost done  michael stands at the empty window frames gloveless with a sketch
pad  bzzzkpit he cocks his head  and looks over at the toy chest he walks to the chest
opens it and takes out the marionette  it dangles from his hand twirling slowly

michael eyes it closely  his face suddenly creasing  the marionette looks like michael  
its dressed like him and it is wearing gloves

					lashers voice
			i love the room michael

and  the marionette starts to grow  michael drops it in terror  it keeps growing  till it
is lifesize its body clattering as it jerks about like a huge wooden puppetversion of 
michael

					the marionette
			michael  youve forgotten your gloves better off with them on 
			dont you think  pause  here

and with a monstrous laugh the marionette pulls off a glove  and his hand comes with it  
blood spurts from the wrist the other glove flies off with the same result

michael stumbles back flailing at the muck  the marionette clatters to the floor in a zillion
sparks of dust  the disembodied gloved hands lie twitching  and 

they mutate  bubbling turning scabrous claws sprout from the fingers they become monstrous
crabs with human eyes scuttling along the floor toward michael at his feet now  climbing up
his legs  up his chest michael swats them to the floor  and stomps on them again and again 
and again turning them to pulp

					rowan cc
			whatre you drawing

michael is standing frozen at the window
pad and pencil still in his hand rowan comes into frame  he turns  in the ozone  she looks
at the pad  he has sketched the marionette dangling from a disembodied hand

					rowan
			thats really good 
				a beat she sighs
			i have to go mleet bea for lunch now
				micael is frozen
			i feel so had for her  theres still no word on gifford  
			shes a wreck

					michael
				soft fuzzy
			give her my best

rowan cocks her head at him  leans and gives a quick kiss and leaves  he looks down at the 
sketch and stares silently

ext the french market  afternoon

an outdoor bazaar  an old black man cataracts fogging his eyes plays guitar while a black 
boy tapdances beside him

rowan and beatrice sit in an open patio cafe
beatrice has a beer and a huge plate of oysterts chewing she points at the plate  rowan 
shakes her head no

					rowan
			that food poisoning did a job on me

					beatrice
			i told you not to honeymoon in the bayou  pause  i remember when 
			giff ate a bad batch of 

her eyes fill with tears  rowan reaches for her hand

					rowan
			im sure hes alright bea theyll find him somewhere

					beatrice
			its over a month  sighs  the police say it happens all the time

she musters a weak smile  her eyes shift to the crowd

					beatrice
			isnt that your friend

rowan turns to see aaron  watching the guitarist and dancer 

					rowan 
			aaron

he turns  blooms in a smile  strolls over  and bows

					arron
			the ladies mayfair  good afternoon

he leans to rowan  and they kiss  me turns to beatrics and kisses her hand  he sits down  
and looks rowan over

					aaron
			are you alright  you look pale

					rowan
				goodnaturedly
			i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health  im the 
			doctor

but aaron is suddenly very focused concentrated staring at her  and finally  he smiles

					aaron
			there are two

					rowan
			two what

					aaron
			two heartbeats

					beatrice
			excuse me

					arron
				points at rowans stomach
			there

rowan looks down at herself  her eyes widen in realization 
	
					rowan
			are you sure

aaron nods calmly  beatrice looks from one to the other

					beatrice
			what are you two talking about

					aaron
				his smile widens
			rowan  is pregnant

rowan looks up at him and beams  beatrice is stunned

					beatrice
			but how could  how can you possibly  

and she sits back  and stares at them 

int the mayfair garden  later that day  dusk

closeup  a bush with large emeraldgreen flowers
has bloomed  extraordinary exotic bizarre oc  joyful laughter  pan to

michael
whirling rowan round in his arms  both of them grinning and laughing  and he smothers her 
with a deep kiss

int  the mansion porch  night

michael and rowan sit side by side rocking in their chairs holding hands staring at the 
garden

					michael
			if its a boy  taylor

					rowan
			a bit much  pause  lucas

					michael
			nah  i had a shmuck of an uncle named lucas  thinks  grayson

					rowan

				thinking her face lights
			aaron  if its a boy

he grins  and nods  they lean to each other and kiss

					michael
			and if its a girl  diedre

she blooms in a painful smile  a tear runs down her cheek

ext the cemetery  the next day  dusk

deserted  rowan with a bouquet of tulips walks past shadowed crypts and stops before the 
huge mayfair crypts the vault marked diedre mayfair  1943 1992 the vaults ledge is 
festooned with flowers  a long beat

					rowan
				a sad smile softly
			im going to have a baby  pause michael wants to name it 
			after you  if its a girl  diedre mayfair curry pretty huh  
			pause funny  i never really thought id ever 

					lasher oc
			i bring her flowers too

rowan whirls round lasher sits crosslegged on a crypt  she glances from side to side

					lasher
			there is no one here but the dead

					rowan
			go away  i dont want you here

					lasher
			if that were true i would not be here

					rowan
			its very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants

					lasher
			from the night on the moor when i was swept into the world and first 
			knew this exquisite pain  it is a mayfair who has wanted me  suzann 
			and deborah  stella  marguerite  antha   diedre   all of them
				a beat his melancholy smile
			and you will have a child

she glares at him  and slowly nods

					lasher
			a girl

					rowan
				eyes him a beatvery cod
			its too soon to know

she turns her back on him and puts her bouquet on the vaults ledge  she doesnt move  lasher
suddenly locks confused

					lasher
			you fear me  why  when you yearn so to know me  pause  you 
			want more from me than the pleasure much more

he glides to her  his spectral face right before hers

					lasher
			you crave what i might show you  what you can learn  what 
			i can give you
				a beat
			so much more than michael can

					rowan
				a powerful smile of strength
			what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever 
			inderstand

					lasher
				pained touching 
			but i could understand i want to understand

					rowan
			i love him

					lasher
				shimmering angered
			do not tell me that

					rowan
			i love michael  michael

lasher flickers furiously  and disappears  rowan scans the cemetery

					rowan
			lasher  lasher

scrrunnch  she turns  the marble lid or a crypt is slowly sliding off and clatters to 
the ground then the lid of a coffin comes into view as it opens  and  a discolored skeleton
rises up and climbs out  and walks toward rowan  she watches wideeyed holding her fear in
check the skeleton stops before her  raises its arm and bony fingers gently caress rowan 
whitened cheek

					lashers voice within ths skeleston
				tender  but menacing 
			michael will look like this one day pause but not i

rowans face suddenly twists in anger  she grabs the skeleton by the ribcage  and slams it 
against the mayfair crypt   it breaks into pieces and crumples to the ground

int  the mayfair mansion living sloom

almost finished  a magnificent design  michael aaron and stu lift champagne glasses for a 
toast

					michael
			to the next mayfair diedre  or  aaron

aarons face creases in affection  stunned  deeply moved they drink  stu examines the empty
champagne bottle

					stu
			anymore of this

michael nods  and heads out the room

					stu
				calling after him casual
			i  uh  i assume either ones middle name is gonna be stu

michael walks down the hallway past the portraits
passing the mirror he stops  and cocks his head  the glass is turning green  he raises a
finger and touches the glass his finger punctures the greenness  and sinks in  up to his
knuckle  re hesitates  and slowiy draws his finger out

the greenness pours out into the hall knocking him down the hall is filling up the greenness
rising  michael struggles as it rises above his head  above the portraits and the witches 
come out into the green  surrounding him

					deborah
			michael  do what you can

					suzanne
			michael  help us  the door

					aaron oc
			michael  michael  look at me

michael is on the floor in the hall
aaron is kneeling grasping him by the shoulders

					aaron
			focus michael 

michael hones in on aaron  and points at the portraits

					michael
			it was them

aaron nods soberly  and helps him to his feet

					michael
			dont tell rowan about this

					aaron
			michael rowan should 

					michael					
			no  shes pregnant aaron  shes got that to deal with  and the 
			clinic she is not to hear about this  pause dont you think i know 
			she spends half her lite worrying about me 	
				a beat cools off 
			listening to my heart arent you
				aaron nods
			the timex still ticking

aaron gives a somber grin  and they walk down the hall 

fade to black

fade up to

int the clinic  week later  late night

microscopes centrifuges test tube racks cubicles and refrigerators fill a large dark 
deserted room  pan to

rowan and lasher standing at a corner lab table 
a single candle flickers  she holds a closed longstemted rose in her hand  lashers 
transparent hand reaches out and melts into bars  rowan shivers from the union

					lasher
				hypnotic
			imagine the sun pause it is morning  it rises  the light wrashes 
			over you  it warms you

rowan looks out the window  shes going far away  outside the room  past the dark night 
outside

					lasher
			now rowan  give me the sun

she almost trembles with concentration  and then  the rose opens  the petals spreading 
wide

int rowan and michaels bedroom  same time

the wind gusts outside the darkened windows  michael lies in bed david copperfield in his
hands   tapping the book uneasy  distracted he glances at the nighttable clock  1245 and 
scowls  he opens the book to the first page

					michael
			it was the best of times  it was the worst of times

a bitter grin darkens his face  he rises and walks into the bathroom  he strips off his 
pajamas and turns on the shower

int the clinic lab  same time

rowan holds the rose in one hand and lights it with a match  it ignites  she drops it on a 
counter and watches it burn  darkening and shriveling to a curled black ash

					lasher unseen
			now my love  see it as it was

her eyes never leave the burnt remains  but brighten in concentration  deep shining tunnels

					lasher unseen
			see the memory of life

her body tingles with a remarkable force  and the blackned petals start to uncurl  and 
brighten to a pink  then a vibrant rich red  alive again rowan shivers  her body goes limp
and she smiles
	
					lasher unseen
				delighted
			you see  you see
				a beat softly
			rowan think what the child might do

int the mansion  the bathroom  same time

michael  naked freshly showered his face lathered with shaving cream  the antique mirror on
the wall is completely fogged from the hot steamy running water in the sink he begins to rub
the mirror clear his eyes widen  as rub by rub he reveals 

a monstrous tableau in the mirrorr  a deep hellish landscape of nightsarish creatures  
parthuman partgrotesqueri  tortured screaming silently they turn and see him and start 
flying toward him at impossible speed

michael squeezes his eyes shut

					michael
				like a litany
			i  am  standing  in  the  bathroom

he opens his eyes  the mirror reflects only his lathered face and the bathroom  a deep sigh  
a long beat he picks up a razor  and starts at his cheekbone as the razor descends shaving
the lather off 

there is nothing beneath the rather in tb mirror  no cheek  just blackness  he stares in
shock  another stroke removes more lather revealing more of the void  he is mesmerized  and
cant stop  shaving faster until all the lather is gone  and the upper half of his face 
floats above a blackt hole in the mirror  and suddenly 

 the grotesqueries are trying to squeeze through the black hole with earsplitting howls  
hands and arms and talons pulling and ripping at each other fighting to be the first to 
escape

michael grabs the mirror off the wall and hurls it to the floor shattering it  silence  he 
steadies himself catching his breath  then he hesitantly brings a hand up and feels his jaw
his cheeks and lip  a deep breath he turns off the water  and walks out of the room

ext the mayfair grounds the following morning

two workmen are inside the dry scrubbed swimming pool on ladders applying a new coat of blue
sealant to the sides

michael and stu on the side porch
sipping coffee  michaei has a distracted frown

					stu
			donnas gonna meet me in key west so ill leave here a week 
			before christmas and be back on the fourth  okay

michael gives a distracted nod  stu eyes him carefully

					stu
			whats wrong mike

michael shakes his head dismissively

					stu
			cmon  you havent been able to lie to me since you asked martha rutledge 
			out behind my back in tenth grade

michael sighs deeply  lips pursed  wanting to speak

					michael
			im getting  left behind

					stu
			left behind  this about rowan

					michael
			yes pause  partly  its  its 
				a beat
			stu  do you believe in 

stus eyes shift to something behind michael  his expressiofl quizzical  michael cocks his 
head at stu  and turns

rowan stands in the porch entrance behind them
stock still  pale  drawn  shes been listening

					stu
			hi there  want coffee

rowan and michaels eyes meet  then  oc  crash rowan and michaels eyes are locked  
stu  turns to the sound

angle  the swimming pool
where a worker  up on a ladder  stares down frowning at the can of sealant that has fallen
 its thick bluegreen contents spreading out on the bottom of the pool

back to the porch

					stu
			what now

he walks toward the pool leaving rowan and michael alone

					michael
				simmering anger 
			when aid you get home last night

					rowan
			what were you talking about

					michael
			yyou look terrible  youre exhausted you practically live at the goddamn 
			clinic  pause  even pregnant women who arent doctors know that you 
			cant 

					stu oc
			mike  better cmere

he stares at her  hurt angry baffled  and walks off 

ext down in the pool  moments later

michael stu and the workers watch as the puddle of spilled blue sealant on the pool floor 
begins to shrink  huh

					michael
			it cracked the bottom  stuffs seeping down through a crack

almost all the sealant is gone  revealing cracks where the can hit  michael taps the cracks
with his foot  and stu grabs him as part of the pool caves in leaving a hole

michael lowers a ladder inte the hole  it hits bottom

					stu
			careful

michael descends out of view  stu glances up and there is rowan  staring down at him 
expressionless

					michael oc
			somebody built a kind ot room down here

int beneath the pool  same time

michael stands in a dark dank enclosure of ancient timbers  three toot square six feet high
he turns  and trips over something

back up top at the hole in the pool  moments later

					michael oc
			hey  gimme a hand

michael appears struggling with an old slimy  wooden crate  stu grabs an end and slides it
onto the poo1

int the mansion  a storage room  minutes later

rowan and michael  crowbar in hand  stand over the crate

					michael
			dovetails  gotta be a hundred years old

					rowan
			go ahead

he looks at her searching her face

					michael
			somethings wrong with you

					rowan
				flaring			
			nothing is wrong with me  i know somethings in there  
			and so do you


she grabs the crowbar  and pries the lid loose  she yanks the lid off  and they rear back 
coughing choking

					michael
			jesus christ

they slowly come back leaning in for a look at the contents a dozen old thick masan jars 
with airtight wax seals

rowan takes them out and sets them on the floor  they are filled with greenish viscous fluid
its hard to see inside  a 100  years of sediment has been stirred up  but things are 
settling it the jars  things are becoming visable

					rowan
			michael  look


the jars are fil1ed with heads  skulls covered with slimy flesh  jellyish rheumy eyes  hair
drifting 1ike seaweed rowan and michael stare  a long beat

					rowan
			marguerite

michael looks at her  uncomprehending

					rowan
			marguerite  carlotta said  margutrite was something of a 
			practitioner herself she meant  like a doctor  like 

suddenly  michael violently twists the top off a jar hissss  they both gag at the fumes

					rowan
			michael  no

he plunges his bare hand into the muck and pulls out a head  his fingers sink into the skin a
searing flash of white  into

int  a room in the mansion as if michael were there

marguerite and julien stand over a mans corpse lying on a table  lasher hovers expectantly
marguerite takes a crude surgical tool servers the head and holds it up by the hair lasher 
is brightening swirling round and round the head

					marguerite
			now my love  now

lasher dives into the head  like a vapor sucked inside the lifeless eyes suddenly glimmer  
and come to life

					lashers voice from behind the eyes
			i am  here marguerite  i can see

but the eyes start to flicker and dim like a dying light

					lashers voice
				a plaintive cry
			nono	pleeeeease  i am going	slipping  the feeling oh 
			the feeling  noooo

and now there is only death in the eyes again

back to rowan and michael
michael drops the head it breaks like a rotten melon  he is horrorstricken wiping his hands
frantically on his shirt

					michael
			he went into the dead  saw with their eyes  used them

rowan  terrified  reaches for him  but he pushes her away me grabs at the jars inspecting
them one after another

					michael
			this one

through the glass a head stares out at him  its state far superior to the others  the hair
brown and wavy the face grotesquely beautiful  he opens the jar  and pulls it out  another
flash of white inro

int  diedres room as if michael were there

a naked male corpse lies on the brass bed  mottled lifeless yet alive pulsing with lashers
spirit  marguerite stands naked at the bedside  julien stands beside her in elegant attire 
with a look of twistad fascination and anticipation

the corpse beckons to marguerite  she climbs on the bed and mounts it  the grey hands move
with clumsy effort pawing at her  she begins to move in a steady rhythm

					lasher voice within the corpse 
			marguerit  i can feel you

					julien
				leaning in face ablaze
			faster marguerite  faster  faster

marguerite speeds up  but soon the corpses hands slip to the bed lifeless  tears fill 
marguerites eyes julien smashes the bedpost in anger and storms away

back to rowan and michael
michael still holds the skull eye to eye

					michael
			jesus  he tried to fuck her and julien  julien was there 
			like like an overseer

rowan suddenly grabs the head  and huris it to tbe floor glass and flesh and bone smash 
against the floorboards

int  the talmasca garden  later that day  dusk

rowan and michael watch aaron as he paces  his face a study in concentraticn  he finally 
turns to michael

					aaron
			what have the witches always asked of you

					michael
			go back michael  do what you can

					aaron
			yes  and you have
				turns to rowan
			do you see  he was passing over into death  but the witches 
			sent him back  to the one person they knew had the power to 
			save him and they gave him the power to show you what no
			 one else could

he grabs michael by the wrists and raises them high

					aaron
			with his hands

					rowan
			but why would they do that

aaron leans and smells a rose  thinking  a long beat

					aaron
			to warn you

rowans face creases in confusion  aaron turns to michael 

					aaron
			youve always said you felt goodness in them  that the witches 
			brought you and rowan together  isnt that right
				michael nods emphatically 
			theyre reaching out to you rowan

					rowan
			but it doesnt make sense  they  they used lasher  they conspired 
			with him

					aaron
			who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath  
			they must see what the legacy has wrought  diedre withered inside 
			herself carlotta killing and stunting her own flesh and blood  surely 
			they sense the child you carry  and the life it might lead in lashers 
			grasp  pause maybe in death they feel remorse for the evil they 
			embraced in life

michael and rowan turn to each other  aaron is pacing again

					aaron
				excited
			it feels right  pause  there is a continuum rowan  youre part
			of them
				halts a long beat 
			they want you to stop lasher

the concept sends them all deep into silence

fade to black 

fade up to

int  ecu  one of the ancient heads

foating in its jar  calipers dip into the jar  pull out to 

rowan in a windowless room at the research clinic
as she extracts a chunk of flesh  she prepares a slide specimen placing it under a large
microscope  she depotits a specimen in a centrifuge and turns it on  whirrrr she programs
the computer  and co1umns of figures and symbols start filling the monitor  she eyes the 
screen and  lashers spectral face appears within the glass

					lasher
			and now  do you know

rowans face hardens  she stares back defiantly

					rowan
			i know that youre evil

					lasher
				poignant
			i only wanted to see as others do feel as others do sighs but 
			marguerite could not help me  nor julien

					rowan
			and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you

					lasher
				his melancholy smile 
			no my love  i want nothing more of the dead
				a long beat
			i want you to  chang me

rowan falls silent  caught offbalance

					lasher
			i have kept this from you until now you had to learn the 
			magnificence of your powers first  you had to see for yourself 
			what you are capable of
				a beat
			think rowan  think of the rose  and the fire  and stu  pause 
			you gave michael life again  you give life to the ehild within you
				a teat
			give me life  make me flesh

shes stunned  he wafts out of the screen  floating round her like a sheath  she backs away
from him  he follows

					rowan
			its impossible  you want me to  to make you into something youre 
			not  you  you have no substance  you have no cells no structure

he circles round her  an unearthly courting dance  she is swaying being swept up

					lasher
			ive waited for you  the one whose science could match her powers
				sighs
			do you know what its like  to sense the majesty of something so 
			sublime just beyond your reach  to float in a dream that keeps a
			promise halfhidden in its shadows
				a forlorn moan
			i did not choose to be such as this  suzanne brought me here  she 
			called to me

					rowan
			but have i  ever

lasher is everywhere  all around her  caressing her

				                  lasher
			not with your voice nobut you do not need a voice for me  
			only the beat of your heart  that is your voice to me 

she is up against the wall nov enveloped by him

					lasher
			 and i have heard you from the beginning from its very first 
			beat

					rowan
				swooning
			i love michael

					lasher
				seductive tinged with menace
			then help me for his sake

his sexual perfection has her floating eyes drooping  he kisses her deeply

					rowan
			you mustnt hurt him mustnt  mustnt hurt

					lasher
			focus all your powers on me rowan until it is done only me

					rowan
			only you

					lasher
			change me rowan and we can change everything

brightening he fuses with her  two entities becoming one  and she surrenders to him

int rowans lab  hours later

rowan lies on the floor  her eyes open  she rises groggily and drops into her chair  cocks
her head her senses keen

					rowan
			lasher
				silence
			lasher  come to me

silence  she smiles cunningly  and nods understanding

					rowan
				thinking out loud
			you cant  you use yourself up in the passion pause	
			you need time

she starts rapidly typing at the computer the screen shows 

hypothesis to examine secondary growth activity 
cells induced by unknown catalyst 
and resultingly deduce nature of catalyst
and its reanimative authority

the computer shuttles  rowan types  

posit if hypothesis is successful
what is probabiliy data will disclose
specific procedure for destruction of catalyst

the computers shuttles  then appearing on the screen  

							75 

she shows a faint smile of tritamph  she sits back  puts her hands on her round stomach  
looks down and smiles warmly

					rowan
			maybe aaron is right  maybe they are trying to help  can you feel 
			them
				her face hardens with resolution 
			i swear to you  you will never know him  when you come into the 
			world he will be gone  this is my promise to you

she rises  flicks switches on some hitech machines turns back to the keyboard  and types 
begin hypothesis

dissolve to

ext  the mayfair mansion morning

the mansion is almost new the trees are turning fall colors  leaves are falling  pan to

the garden
where the emerald bush is blooming again  small crimson buds sprouting from the center at the
bright green flowers

michael and stu on the sidewalk
standing beside a taxi  stu rubs his hands together

link up  he scratches his cleft with his thumb  she grins and steps to him  her arms going 
round him

and she watches him get in the car and speed away 

ext  downtown new orleans  later that morning

michael with a sad grin looking in a department store window at an incongruous christmaas 
display  santa claus in his sleigh saxophone in hand riding down a replica of bburbon street

int rowans lab  same time

rowan stares frowning at a monitor full of symbols she sits back weary  closes her eyes  
rubs them

					lasher unseen
			go on rowan  go on

					rowan
				smacks the desk
			leave me alone

lasher flickers into sight  she turns and hurls a notebook at him  it goes through him and
hits the wall

					lasher
			what is wrong

					rowan
			wrong  science is not magic

					lasher
				a beat sottly
			i do not understand

					rowan
			you went into the cells  and you changed them  how

					rowan
			i dont know what you are

					lasher
				passionate

			with all your power  see me and know what i am

he approaches  she brace herself  holding her ground  not backing off

					lasher
			do not be atraid fear is not for you

she straightens tightening some psychic grip she holds her hands out and frames his head his
face comes to hers  meets it  then merges with hers  and they start to rise  joined as they
are  floating up

rowans  pov  a trillion flecks of colored light
dense dazzling  the pov moves deeper  the density lessensfewer particles frenzied 
darting in a greenish haze  deeper  terrifying speed now  zooming plummeting toward 
nothingness oblivion a piercing scream 

rowan  suspended in the air with lasher
screams  lurches free of him and falls to the floor dazed  lasher swoops down to her 
enfolding her gently

					lasher
			dont stop

she weakly waves him off  gulping for breath

					rowan
			no

					lasher
				intense urgent 
			tell me what i am rowan

she gazes at him painfully shakes her head vehemently

					lasher
			rowan  rowan

she covers her face with her hands and turns away from him lashers face darkens with anger  
and jealousy

					lasher
				cool anger
			you are thinking of him

and she suddenly rises  and storms out of the room

ext the mansion  day  an hour later

rowan comes quickly through the gate  she walks inside the house and down the main hall

					rowas
			michael  michael

passing the living room entrance something out at the corner of her eye stops her  she 
turns

rowans pov  the living room
where a magnificent christmas tree rises to the ceiling covered with globes and stars and 
tinsel so the whole room seems to shine

rowan
walks slowly toward it  overwhelmed tears filling her eyes

					michael oc
			nice huh

she turns and sees michael and rushes into his arms

int  michael and rowans room  later that day

they lie in bed in each others arms  private thoughts a long beat  michael lets out a deep
sigh

					michael

			how to get to

					rowan

michael waits  and  rowan looks away from him

					rowan

					michael
			thats not good enough  why not

					rowan
				suddenly erupting
			i cant leave now  dont ask me to explain  i just cant

pulling them on

					michael

					michael
			how bout a backward hex with a threequarter twist

				flaring

he whirls round and grabs her violently by the shoulders

					michael

				shakes her violently
			tell me the truth  is it lasher  answer me

					rowan
				torn up
			michael  im sorry  just give me 

					michael

they stare at each other  miles apart  a long beat

					michael
			when youre ready to let me back into your heart il1 come 
			back to you

he hustles his shirt and shoes on and storms out rowan watches him go as tears stream down her
face  she runs out after him  down the stairs

					rowan
			michael

the front door slams shut  her face narrows in anger  fury rising as she turns and stares at
the christmas tree  pop   one of the shiny globes explodes  pop  another goes  pop

lasher appears hovering above the tree smiling  the angel at the top of tree flies off and
smashes against the wall

					lasher
			you are magnificent my love

as rowan stands entranced in her powers lasher swirls round the tree  the ornaments sway in
the maelstrom  tinsel and globes and trinkets flying off srashing everywhere  bits of glass
fill the air like colored snow  lasher encircle rowan  she swoons to the floor  and he
joins with her

dissolve to

int new orleans airport terminal  afternoon

michael and aaron sit in a lounge  michael looks drawn and weary  he taket a swig from a 
drink and grimaces

					michael
			ont know what else to do  maybe i just dont belong in her life 
			 bitter well  im already out of her life

					aaron
			nothing was ever more false

					michael
				leaning in almost desperate
			then tell me  is it lasher

aaron starts solemnly  and finally shakes his head

					aaron
			i only know she loves you  desperately

michael fingers his glass  a selfloathing grin shows

					michael
			ill probably be back in a weekbut i cant spend christmas in 
			that house pause  youll check on her  every day

					aaron
			every day grins twice 

					michail
				a beat
			aaron  do you believe in god

					arron
				his benevolent smile
			i believe we all come from the same force  even lasher

he reaches out  and covers michaels hand with his own

					arron
			be we11 michael  be strong

ext san francisco airport terminal  night

micchael wasks out into the fog he gets in a taxi and tells the driver 

					michael
			on the hill  2712 fairmont

ext the mayfair estate  same time

aaron comes through the grate  up to the door  knockknock  knocks again  silence  he 
walks along the porch peering in the windows  he heads back down the walk

the emerald bushs crimson buds have bloomed into huge flowers  he teaches to pick one  and
is pricked by a thorn blood trickles from his finger  he heads toward the gate

int san francisco  michaels house  night

everything covered with sheets  michael wanders a halfempty scotch bottle in his hand 
singing softly

					michael
			i left my heart in 

he stops  his face creasing  gears turrning in his head

int michaels attic  a minute later

michael digging in boxes  he finds what he wants  and yanks his tathers singed firemans
helmet in both hands  the searing whitehot flash  and

int  a fiery flaming building as if michael were there

michaels father tosses the girl to the safety net  suddenly  the window is blown in 
shattering michaels father falls to the floor  above him the flames dance  then everything 
comes down on him

michaels pov swerves up to the rafters  there is lasher hovering in the flames in command 
undulating in the deadly heat  lasher glances to camera to michael  and smiles

michael
drops the helmet  as if burned  and races out

int michaels bedroom  a minute later

michael stands with the phone to his ear  revving like a madman  listening to the ring on the
other end of the line

					michael
			pick up the fucking phone ro

int the mansion  the living room  same time  night

rowan out cold on the floor  the phone is ringing  her eyes open she struggles to her feet
stubling into the hall  toward the phone  and  bzzzkpitkpit  she freezes  
bzzzkpitkpit  upstairs  she turns to the stairs  hesitates  and starts up

int the talamasca headquarters  same time  night

a woman stands with a phone  aaron comes into frme and takes it from her

					arron into the phone
			michael

intercut between aaron and michael in his bedroom at a feverpitch figuring it out as he 
rambles

					michael
			aaron  lieten to me  its been lasher  from the start

					aaron
			what are you talk

					michael
			he chose me for rowan  when i was a child

back to rowan in the mansion
on the second floor outside diedres room  bzzzkpit rts in there   she walks inside  
bzzzkpit

back to michael and aaron on the phone

					michael
			carlotta was too strong for lasher she got rowan away from him  
			to san francisco but that took her away from me too  pause  
			aaron  lasher killed my father  thats what got me and mother out 
			of new orleans  and back to rowan  so we would meet
				chilled to the bone 
			aaron   his power    his control

					aaron
				equally chilled
			rowan

					michael
			you have to warn her  this second im catching the next flight 
			back

back to rowan in diedres room
staring at a sheetrock wall  all senses primed  bzzzkpit suddenly she smashes her fist 
through  and starts tearing the wall away  ripping the last chunk away  and there sits

gifford  decapitated drenched in blood  in his lap is the gold saw like a platter  and 
resting on it is his head  the cat licks at the mouth wide open in a scream

int a cab on a highway  same time  late night

aaron speeds down the road  lasher suddenly appears beside him grinning faintly  aaron 
glances at him stunned

					lasher
			petyr van abel would have been proud of your devotion aaron
			your compassion and i am grateful for them

arron looks back to the road trying to shut out the specter

					lasher
			the talamascas histories made rowans nature clear to her in a way 
			i never could and i am thanktul for that

aarons face sinks in realization of a centuriesold folly

					aaron
			that is our purpose in all this

					lasher
			since the begxnning   sighs  we have been together a long time 
			you and i and now it ends

the car suddenly swerves violently  aaron fights for control  as they skid and sverve down 
the road

					lasher
			rowan fights her feelings for me but her passion  her power  
			they conspire against her love  and i grow stronger 

finally  aaron wrestles back control of the car

					aaron
				triumphant
			but there are still limits to your powers arent there  some of
			us are without desire  and we exhaust you  dont we

the car enters a tunnel  suddenly  up ahead  a brick wall completely fills the tunnel

aaron stiffens  floors the gas  and zooms through the wall  it dissolves as he passes 
through  the car exits the tunnel  arron glances over at laher   and aaron grins  and 

 the steering goes  aaron twists the wheel  but the car wont respond  and hes headinq 
toward a steep embankmen

					aaron
			irn right in the middle of the road theres nothing wrong with 
			the car

					lasher
			yes  let us wait and see

the car swerves off the road  the cliffside looms

					aaron
			im not afraid lasher

aaron stares  unflinching  as the car barrels over the cliff soaring down down  the 
ground racing up at him

					aaron
			i am not afraid

the car plows into the ground  and suddenly  aaron is staring at the highways centerline as
he speeds along

					lasher
			you are strong aaron 
				an evil smile 
			but others are not so strong

and he vanishes  aarons face creases in confusion  huh  a school bus is coming up toward
them in the other direction on the other side of the road  aarons face whitens

					aaron
			lasher where are you  lasher  lasher

					lasher unseen
			if not for yourself  then fear for the children

aaron can see the bus clearly now  packed with children  and he can see the sudden 
uncomprehending look of terror on the drivers face  as he inexplicably loses control of the
bus  it suddenly skids  and swerves out of  lane  heading straight for a headon with aaron

aaron hesitates  uncertain  wavering  seconds to impact  and  he swerves out of the bus
path at the last moment  sacrificing himself  flying off the cliff

int the mansion  same time  late night

rowan stumbles out of diedres room down the stairs freaked looking over her shoulder  and 
 she freeses seeing something that isnt there  her face twists

back to the cliffside  same time
aarons car tumbles down through the air hits bottom  and explodes in a fireball

back to rowan at the bottom of the stairs
as she is sent reeling to the floor  dazed fighting a blackout  sliding down into her 
dream

the operating room in rowans dream
rowan works feverishly on the out of frame patient the masked figures watch silently

					rowan
			i  i cant do it

the others urge her on  imploring encouraging her

					rowan
				pointing out of frame frantic
			but look  look   how can i do it

oc  a muffled cry
tilt down slowly  the edge of the operating table comes into frame  and lying on it a tiny
hand pull out to reveal all for the first time it is a truly bizarre entity the torso of
a man  with the head arms and  legs toes and lingers of a tiny newborn

					masked figure
			go on  help him

					masked figure
			help us

					rowan
			how

a figure removes its mask  it is marguerite  she takes a scalpel and cuts the entity from 
navel to callarbone then folds back the skin  within the chest cavity the emerald pendant
is where a heart should be rowan screams all but one of the figures take off their masks  
they are the twelve mayfair witches  and julien

					julien
			help him  you were made for this

					rowan
			i cant do it   how can i do it

					suzanne
			stop doubting your power

then  the remaining masked figure speaks

					masked figure
			no  dont listen to your words rowan  listen to the feeling 
			behind your words  listen to your heart

he removes his mask  it is arron

					aaron
			it is not your power that you doubt when you say  i cant do 
			it  you are saying  i must not do it you are saying i will 
			not do it
				his warm kind smile
			this is what your heart tells you

rowan on the floor at the foot of the stairs
coming groggily out of the dream  she rises unsteadily  and lasher stands before her  her 
face hardens  he starts toward her  rowan stands her ground  sensing danger

					rowan
			stop

lasher halts  shimmering  staring deep into one another

					rowan
			aaron was in the dream  a dream tilled with spirits  pause you killed 
			him didnt you

					lasher
				a beat
			it was an accident  smiles gifford too

she trembles  her tears come but  she steels herself  a long beat

					rowan
			the portraits lasher  why are the witches always before a door
			tell me lasher  now

					lasher
				his smile flashes
			they want to come back  pause  we have a pact  of mutual desire 
			and  consent  the mayfairs ar a beautiful tapestry  i have weaved 
			you all together  from the start  pause i brought petyr van abel to 
			suzanne  he had genius in him  scientific precise  it was a perfect 
			start and on  it has gone  father to mother sister to brother father 
			to daughter

rowan shudders  turning ghostly pale

					rowan
			oh god

					lasher
			ju1ien was your father   your greatgrandfather  your grandfather 
			 and your father all one in the same  that is why he fought 
			carlotta for your life

rowan is shaken  backing up in horror

					lasher
			the mayfair pact rowan when i am flesh  i will unlock the 
			door  and the witches will come through 
				soaring
			you are the key to the door for the witches  and for me you are 
			the thirteenth witch

laslirn glows brighter

					lasher
			i will be  perfect  pause that is why i chose michael

rowan blanches  thrown for a loop  lasher smiles

					lasher
			the boy who would turn his dreams into reality  the exquisite 
			imagination so aesthetic so vulnerable  the boy so special 
			he could see me  pause and i knew he was the one  for us
				he smilas
			you thought it love at first sight shakes his head  i chose him 
			for you pause  the union is human perfection

she doesnt quite get it  shes revving furious confused

					lasher
			i created you to create me  and you have

and now rowan sees it all  stumbling back terrified

					lasher
			its growing inside you  waiting to change waiting for me

and rowan turns  and runs a door slams shut as she races toward it

					lasher unseen
			did you think you could trick me my  love

she whirls round  lasher floats before her  glowing like never before  a bright pulsating
emerald green

					lasher
			you thought i could not see into your soul  i made your soul

rowan back up against the wall  lasher spreads out  huge dark roiling  towering above her
the clock begins to chime  midnight  gonggonggong

					lasher
			it is christmas eve my love  the witching hour is at hand 
			when christ was born into the world  when the word was 
			finally made flesh  and i would be born too  i am done 
			with waiting

he gathers force funnelling in on himself whirling like a tornado  and streams toward her
like a jet of green vapor 

					rowan
			nooooooooo

 and the whirlwind jets up between her legs   into her  and disappears  she howls in
unearthly pain  and falls to the floor  her water breaks  blood seeping now from between her
legs 

					rowan
				absolutely totally completely freaked
			 oh god  oh my god  no godddd no

she shrieks as a vicious contraction jolts her to her very being  and  something is coming
out of her

out it slides  the entity from her dream  on its back  bloody shining  a mansized head
its infant arms and fingers and legs and feet groping and and moving and  elongating and
growing with each breath as it cries the cry from rowans dream  rowan slumps into 
oblivion

fade to black

fade up to

ext the mansion  early the next morning  christmas day

tracking with mihael
as he barrels through the gate and bursts inside the house

					michael
			rowan  rowan

racing down the hall he freezes  staring into the living room  everything topsyturvy  a 
carpet of broken colored glass and pine needles covers the floor  he races toward the stairs
and skids to stop  a thick pool of blood on the floor there michael races back down the 
hall

					michael
			rowan			

ext the mansion garden  moments later

michael races into frame  and stops  staring at a tall figure  clad only in pants  its back
to him

ther figure
slowly turns round  it is a man  delicate yet muscular but the skin the expression the 
texture ot him is brandnew newborn  and his face is a perfect mix of rowan and michael  in
his hand he holds one at the newlybloomed emeraldandcrimson flowers  he smiles

					the man
			i made these

it is lashers voice  he holds the flower to his nose and inhales deeply  his brandnew face
lights with the most sensual of discoveries

					lasher the man
			ahhh	it is incredible is it not
				holds the flower out to michael
			here  for you father

and michael knows  he howls and stampedes toward lasher who waits with a delighted 
expresslon michael barrels into him  they go sprawling to the ground  michael pummeling him
tearing at him lost to murder and vengeance

					michael
			you fucking bastard  you killed my child

but lasher is laughing  rejoicing in the sensations the pain the movement the flesh

					lasher the man
			but i am your child  i am your son

					michael
			where is rowan  where is she

					lasher the man
			and this is pain  father you cannot hurt me  no one can

and lasher rises lifting michael up like a toy  dangling him in the air

					lasher the man
			i am alive father

and he flings michael across the garden  lasher smiles and heads for michael ungainly on his
new legs

rowan comes carwling out of the house
 weakened haggard bloodied pale

					rowan
			michael

lasher  standing over michael  turns toward the sound  and michael tries to crawl away

					lasher the man
				grinning
			you want michael

lasher struts to michael and picks him up by the collar

					lasher the man
			here  here he is

michael hangs still in lashers grip like the marionette lasher jostles him shakes him with
a smile

					lashes the man
			you could use some strings i think

rowan is trying to crawl but shes so weak

					rowan
			put  him  down  his  his heart

					lasher the man
			how is your heart father is the timex still ticking

he punches michael brutally in the chest  and then strikes him again  michael howls  
breathless eyes bulging  lasher starts parading around the garden holding michael in the air
like a broken marionette

					lasher the man
				mad possessed overdosing on life 
			look at me mother  am i not a wonder  something new under the 
			sun  the world has never seen the likes of me

					michael
				a barely audible hiss 
			a monster among men

					lasher
				suddenly expressionless cold
			rowan and i will be together now my time has come  your time is 
			gone

					rowan
			no   dont  lasher

lasher strikes a deadly blow to michaels chest  michael seems to cave in   and lasher hurls
michael into the pool

michael sinks like a stone beneath the water
sinking into death for the second and last time  and  the witches seep out in the water  
surrounding him

					michael
			let go michael  it is done  and he is beautiful  perfect

					deborah
			we can go through now  lasher will open the door and 
			bring us back  pause goodbye michael let go now  
			let go 

the phantoms fade away  michael sinks to the bottom dead

back at poolside
lasher stands beaming and proud staring into the water  rowan drags herself to the pool 
and stares down in horror

					rowan
			oh god nooooooooo

she tries to slide into the pool  but lasher picks her up gently end deposits her on the 
grass

					lasher the man
			mother  you must rest  youre still bleeding  rest please

the wind suddenly picks up  the trees sway  and then  the witches voices swirl around
lasher and rowan

					suzanne unseen
			lasher  bring us through

					deborah unseen
			now lasher  it is our time

the voices beseech him coax him plead  and lasher smiles up at the sky  a widening 
cunning wicked smile

					lasher the man
			your time  oh my foolish ones  but you are wrong  rt is my time
			mine  i am unto myself  one of a kind  pause  and i have rowan 
			who else do i need

					suzanne unseen
				anger in her voice and panic
			the pact lasher  the pact  we have waited now it is our time

					lasher the man
				a harsh laugh
			i have no time for your time  be gone

					deborah unseen
				desperate
			lasher  please  save us  bring us through

					lasher the man
				suddenly vicious
			be gone  or i will send you where there are no worlds at all
			go

the wind dies  silence  he turns and sees rowan dragging herself toward the pool  he strides
over and drags her away
	
					rowan
				tries to shake free of him 
			let me go  michaelllllll

					lasher the man
			enough  he is dead  you are here for me now  michael is 
			gone

					rowan
				venomous spitting it out 
			ill destroy you  i swear it  if you dont kill me ill find a 

					lasher the man
				stunned sincerely wounded
			kill you  you are my mother  do you think i would hurt you

she twists out of his grasp and sprawls on the ground  glaring up at him  and then 

the wind comes up again  whipping the leaves around gathering force  lasher looks to the 
sky  perplexed surprised  his newborn eyes wide and curious

					suzanne unseen
			rowan  he has cheated us all  pause  you are the thirteenth  
			use your anger  use the power  use us

rowan slowly rises as if pulled up  the sky darkens the wind swirls  lasher watches like a
child turning round and round  and stares now into his mothers eyes

					lasher the man
				soft
			mother

rowan glares it him  her body seems to harden  her eyes flare  lightning flashes  and a
hard rain pours down  lashers expression changes  doubt  fear

					lasher the man
				sott heartrending
			i am your flesh these are your eyes

but she is steel  more than steel  she is an energy the earth has not known before  and he
sees it in her fact  his melancholy smile comes

					lasher the man 
				tender loving
			i am your son  i would not wound you i could not  ever

					rowan
				eerily soft
			i know  pause  you are my son 

lasher almost melts at her words  he reaches out to her 

					rowan
				turning cold as death
			 and may god forgive me

he freezes  arms outstretched mouth agape  she looks to the sky

					rowan
				imperious
			now  now

the wind is whipped into a frenzy  a branch is torn from a tree  and crashes into lasher 
he stumbles  thorned bushes are ripped from the ground and tear at his flesh  his blood 
runs

in the sky a doten whirling funnels appear descending like avenging winds  lasher watches  
his face darkening  rowans arms rise pointing majestically like a conductor directing a 
terrible symphony of destruction the tunnels follow her movements whirling and gliding and
terror rains down on lasher

trees flagstone rocks the wroghtiron fence  everything is being uprooted torn apart  and
sent whirling slashing and crashing down on lasher he falls to the ground

					lasher the man
			mother   my flesh  do not do this

rowan is ominous  eyes riveted on him  she points to the house  and it starts to come apart
shingles timbers windows tearing loose flying through thel air   showering down on  
lasher  ripping him apart


					lasher the man
			the pain  my beautiful flesh

flesh tearing off bones bones pulled from sockets  his very being coming apart 
disintegrating  his cries begin to fade in the cacophony  rowan s eyes never leave him   
her arms swing round and she points at what remains at her son  the funnels descend on 
lasher in a frenzy everything is obscured by the cloud of dust ard matter than  a final 
fading shriek come  and than  silence

rowans hands drop to her side  she seems to lessen to settle back into herself  the 
funnels fade the dust settles and where lasher  lay  nothing the garden is gone  the
mansion is gone  total destruction

rowan comes out of her trance
she races to the pool and dives in and resurfaces with michaels lifeless body  she drags him
up onto the ground  and frantically tries to revive him over and over again

finally  she smashes his chest as she did long ago  but michael lies still  she drops upon
him exhausted  weeping inconsolable then  she looks up to the sky  fury and tears in
her eyes

					rowan
			you betrayed him  all of you  look  look at him  he 
			believed there was goodnese in you  and you betrayed 
			him

she stands seething  like a volcano about to erupt  thinking  focusing  something is 
coming together inside her  she is remarkable  she reaches to the sky  

					rowan
			i am the  thirteenth  i am the key   come through 
			the door  all of you  come  through  the  door

and the fabric of the sky tears an ererald haze shows beyond it arid the phantomwitches
come soaring through the gash in the world  speeding toward their mistress

					rowan
			all of us are one  from  the beginning to now  so i command you 
			come into me  mlake thirteen one

and the witches swoop down  and dive into rowan  fill her  become her  she brims with 
power  almost a celestial glow

she kneels beside michael takes his hands and presses them against her heart  her tears 
cascade down her cheeks

					rowan
			come back to me michael  please michael  come back  i love you 
			i love you michael  oh god  come back to me

she leans down and kissea him  deeply deep as their love  long long long

and 
michael opens his eyes  rasping coughing shaking with the new life rowna has given him
rowan on her knees lifts him up and cradles his head in her chest

					michael
				barely a whisper
			lasher  where  where is 

					rowan
				loving soothing 
			its alrightits airight  hes gone michael  gone

slow zoom into rowans face

					rowan
			everythings gone michael  everything except for us  pause 
			but were here   together  you and i

hold on ecu of rowan

she smiles strangely and  her face flickers  and then from some new inner current her
face strobes b1zarrely with the faces of twelve others who came long before her

					rowan
				very very softly
			just you and

fade to black

the end
