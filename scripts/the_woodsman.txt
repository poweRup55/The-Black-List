                         bad idea

                         i thought a journal would encourage 
                         you to reflect

                                     walter

                         you think reflection is good

                                     rosen
                         by reflection we can derive a deeper 
                         meaning from our experience in life 
                         we gain greater understanding about 
                         ourselves that can lead to making 
                         better choices in our relationships 
                         our careers and our goals

               walter looks at him flatly

                                     walter
                         you read that in a book

               she reads the prescription glances at walter over her 
               bifocals then back at the prescription walter has not missed

                         can you read the prescription

                         ass because if i dont get my 
                         medication i get extremely violent

               the male pharmacist scrambles to fill the prescription

               the shopper gasps walter looks at her and smiles the shopper

               the two men laugh but the laughter quickly fades

                                     carlos
                         but maybe its not so healthy being

                         sorry bad joke

               ext schoolyard  dawn

               close on a mans feet slowly walking heel to toe the ground 
               is covered in frost tilt up to reveal walter counting his 
               footsteps as he walks towards the school across from his 
               apartment building the schoolyard is empty

                                     walter

                         eleven one hundred and twelve

               a birds cry pierces the sky walter looks up to see a hawk 
               circling above he watches for a moment then continues 
               walking

                                     walter
                         one hundred and thirteen one hundred 
                         and fourteen one hundred and 
                         fifteen

               he reaches the school entrance and touches it

                         one hundred and twenty

               walter looks at the hawk still circling above and hollers 

                                     walter
                         how about that

               slowly the sound of children fades in and a red ball bounces 
               to walters feet he looks in the direction the ball came 
               from

               nothing is there

               walter looks back down at his feet the ball is gone the 
               sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a 
               rhythmic squeak walter looks towards the playground where 
               an empty swing sways back and forth in the wind the chain 
               squeaking in its hinges

               the hawks cry pierces the silence walter looks up to see 
               the hawk being chased by two smaller birds

               int warehouse  day

               there is a tremendous crash as logs are dropped near the 
               wood chipper forklifts move and stack wood

               walter stands at the end of a wood chipper pushing a long 
               piece of wood through suddenly above the din of machinery 
               there is the sound of raised voices

               walter looks across the way to see vicki yelling furiously 
               and smacking a guy around the head with her work gloves the 
               man cowers protecting his head from the blows some other 
               men nearby are doubled over in laughter

                                     vicki
                         god damn it pedro what the fuck do

                         your sister you wouldnt think it 
                         so funny then would you

               she backs off out of breath pedro straightens up having a 
               very hard time keeping a straight face

               the other guys start to applaud

               vicki looks around and storms off kicking a piece of wood 
               into one of the men hard she brushes past walter on her 
               way to the exit he watches after her

               int warehouse cafeteria  day

               vicki sits alone at a table eating a sandwich she takes 
               large bites and eats fast

               walter approaches carrying a tray of food he pauses across 
               from where vicki sits

               vicki ignores him

                                     walter
                         you okay

               vicki looks up

                                     vicki
                         what

                              pause
                         yeah im fucking fantastic

               walter nods and keeps on walking vicki returns to her food

               after a moment she steals a glance up at walter

               across the way marykay watches walter as he sits down to 
               the table neighboring vickis

               bob sits down across from marykay with a tray of food and a 
               newspaper he opens the paper and starts to read

               bob looks across the room at walter

                                     bob
                         mind your own business marykay

               bob ignores her and reads the paper

               advancing towards her

               who sits motionless on the bed she leaves

               int vickis car  day

               her fingers tears stream down her face she comes to a stop 
               light and sits completely still staring ahead without 
               blinking suddenly cars honk she snaps out of her stupor 
               and keeps on driving

               walter sits on the couch writing in his journal the tv is 
               on a baseball game in progress sound on low abruptly 
               walter throws the journal across the room then he lies back 
               and stares at the ceiling

               suddenly there is a loud thump outside of the apartment

               walter picks up his journal and puts it in a drawer then 
               walks quietly to the door and opens it a crack

               something grabs candys attention and walter follows his 
               gaze

               kids pour off a school bus candy waves to one angelfaced 
               boy of ten or eleven

                         but what if candy seduces one to go 
                         for a ride

               boy accepts

                                     walter vo

                         shit

               beat lucas taps walter on the forehead and smiles

                                     lucas
                              feigning kindness

                         okay

                                     walter
                              flatly
                         okay

               lucas rises spits his gum in the sink and leaves

               walter leans over squeezing his head tight between his hands

               the sound of children fades in and walter looks up the girl 
               with the red ball stands across from him in the doorway to 
               his bedroom she smiles and bounces the ball

               walter folds over cradling his head in his arms

               ext walters apt  day

               walter stands alone at his bus stop as he waits he sees 
               the white volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the 
               school

               the bus pulls up to the stop obscuring walters view he 
               quickly gets on and moves to the back looking for candys 
               car it is nowhere in sight the place where it had parked 
               empty walter sits down and stares ahead numb

               ext mall  day

               its a bright saturday afternoon a city bus turns into the 
               parking lot of a large mall passengers exit the bus and 
               pour into the malls entrance walter is among them

                                     walter vo
                         i followed a girl

               int mall  day

               music blares from speakers packs of teenagers cruise the 
               mall it is alive with chatter

                                     walter vo
                         i dont know why i did it

               walter is frequently jostled as if he has forgotten how to 
               navigate crowds

                                     walter
                         there were all of these people

               he passes many stores and snack shops then sees a barnes  
               noble and enters

               int bookstore  day

               the bookstore is two floors and vast walter looks lost as 
               he moves through the crowds

                                                                    cut to

               walter rides an escalator three girls stand ahead of him

               the girl closest to him wears a short skirt which flutters 
               above walters face he looks up

                                     walter vo
                         she was pretty very pretty

               they reach the next level and walter watches the girl walk 
               away with her friends suddenly the girl looks back their 
               eyes lock  briefly she turns the corner

                                     walter
                         she gave me a look if she hadnt 
                         given me that look

               walter pauses then follows

               the girl separates from her friends and goes down an aisle

               walter follows her she goes down another aisle he follows

               in the middle of the aisle the girl bends down looking at 
               titles from the end of the aisle walter pretends to be 
               looking for a book as he edges closer to her hes now a few 
               feet away the girl pulls out a book and opens it walter 
               gazes at the nape of her neck

               walter turns startled

               behind the salesman walter sees a security guard exit the 
               rest room area

               he turns the girl is gone he bolts the other way through 
               the aisles down the elevator through the mall as fast as 
               possible the faces are a blur sound becomes distorted 
               then we hear

                         perhaps you wanted to see what it 
                         felt like after so many years  maybe 
                         unconsciously you were testing 
                         yourself you followed her and nothing 
                         happened and here you are talking 
                         about it with me this is positive

               there is a pause walter looks down unconvinced rosen checks

                         idea of normal was

               int busstop  day

               walter rides the bus staring out the window sensing 
               something he looks up

               a girl sits across from walter she is about twelve years 
               old she wears glasses and a pair of binoculars hangs around 
               her neck she casually nibbles on food she produces from her 
               backpack she glances at walter briefly then looks back out 
               the window

               walter turns away

               int walters kitchen  night

               walter and vicki sit at his table eating chinese takeout

               walter glances at vicki who is devouring her food

                                     walter
                         maybe this isnt a good idea

                                     vicki

               sink vicki looks at him

                                     vicki

               there is the usual morning chaos in the locker room walter 
               opens his locker but stops abruptly

               taped to the inside of his locker is a magazine ad of a young 
               girl joyfully swinging on a swing scrawled over the image 
               in red marker is a circle with line across it and the words

               walter quickly tears down the picture and looks around the 
               men are all oblivious

               int warehouse  day

               walter works at the saw watching closely every person that 
               walks by him no one pays him any mind

               bob the boss walks into the space and stops to have a few 
               words with a worker who points in walters direction bob 
               heads towards walter

               walter sees him coming and pauses in his work bob walks 
               right by to talk to another man working behind walter

               walter watches for a moment then continues working

               int warehouse  later

               walter exits the mens room and stops to drink from the water 
               fountain marykay is walking down the hall and pauses

               lucas spits his gum into the garbage can and sits down across 
               from walter

                                     lucas

                         sodomized almost in half

               walter shakes his head

                                     lucas
                         she looked so small and broken i 
                         saw hardened twentyyear veterans

                         there aint no fucking woodsman in 
                         this world

               lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his mouth 
               then he rises

                                     walter
                         you knew her

                                     lucas

                                     walter
                         the girl

               lucas stares coldly at walter his face red he looks 
               dangerous

                                     lucas
                              seething
                         i dont know why they keep letting 
                         scum like you return to the streets 
                         it just means weve got to catch you 
                         all over again

               he slaps walter on the back of the head

                                     lucas
                         see ya walter

               and exits

               walter rushes to the blinds drawing them down then scrambles 
               to get his journal from the drawer he drops to his knees 
               tearing the pages from his journal tearing them to bits

                                     walter
                         you have no right to talk to to 
                         speak like i am not i am not

               the sound of children fades in and walter looks up

               in the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown 
               sitting on the red ball rocking back and forth her chin in 
               her hands

                                     girl
                         wallie what are you doing

               walter squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his 
               ears the sound abruptly stops

               int bus  morning

               walter rides the bus he is unshaven and looks exhausted he 
               is jostled by the crowds but seems oblivious

               int warehouse  morning

               duffle bag

                                     lucas

               lucas pops the gum in his mouth and heads towards the door

               walter pauses in his folding

                                     walter
                         think youll catch this guy

               lucas turns

                         in addition to his other injuries 
                         his jaw is broken

               walter is silent

                                     lucas

                         turns out hes wanted in pennsylvania 
                         he raped a boy there

               lucas watches walter who impassively unrolls and rolls the 
               same pair of socks

                                     lucas

               lucas looks at walter for a moment

               he exits

               walter realizes he unrolled the socks he tosses them in the 
               duffel bag

               int vickis car  late afternoon

               vicki drives walter stares out the passenger window the 
               sun is low on the horizon walter wears a pressed button
               down shirt he is cleanshaven and his hair neatly combed 
               his hand fidgets in his lap

                                     vicki
                         you okay

                                     vicki
                         fucking liar

               vicki reaches for his hand then something catches her eye

                                     vicki
                         hey look

               walter follows her gaze

                                     vicki
                         starlings

               on the horizon a flock of starlings whirl and turn as if 
               one huge body a dancing cloud against the sky

                                     walter
                         i heard they were filthy birds

                                     vicki
                         not when they fly

               vicki looks at him and smiles there is a long beat as they 
               drive

               ie vickis car reservoir  day

               vicki sits in her car smoking she stubs out her cigarette

               the ashtray is full she looks out the window

               vickis pov walter and a woman stand in the distance near 
               the water the woman looks a few years younger than walter

               there is space between them walter faces her but she looks 
               out at the water after a long moment he reaches to touch 
               her arm

               the woman pulls away and yells something at him walters 
               head drops

               vicki lights another cigarette she flips on the radio to 
               country music blocking out all sound she looks back out 
               the window

               the woman yells angrily then falls quiet  staring at walter 
               after a long moment she turns and walks back up the hill to 
               her car where carlos waits leaning against the car

               annette gets in the car slamming the door carlos pauses 
               looking at walter then gets in the car and turns on the 
               engine to leave

               walter stays standing near the water

                                     walter vo

                         it was hard

               walter nods

               walter looks at rosen who nods there is a moment of silence 
               between them

                                         the end
