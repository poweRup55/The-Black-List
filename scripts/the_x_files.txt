     fade in


     ext snowscape

     a blinding white screen under which we hear an ominous
     low end dolby thx big screen rumble were not in 19
     television land anymore toto as the rumble builds two
     black figures appear on what now has resolved into a
     distant horizon from their movements we can shortly see
     that the figures are men moving along a windswept ice
     sheet in an otherwise featureless land

     a legend appears north texas 35000 bc


     closer on the two men

     continuing toward us we can now see that they are
     dressed in crude garments made of animal skins if we
     squint we can see their hair is long their jutting
     foreheads significant of primitive homo sapiens they
     continue toward us the wind beating against them
     camera is craning down to the snow that lies before
     them to large threetoed tracks


     following the primitives

     as they track the threetoed prints to a rocky crevice in
     the hardpack ice the prints stop here and so do the
     men dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their
     quarry

                                             cut to


     int ice cave

     dark in here except where the sunlight penetrates the
     thick glassy ice walls the silhouettes of the
     primitives stark against the glistening cavern the
     sound of flint being struck then a torch catches fire
     illuminating their faces and

     a creature

     deeper in the cave fleeing the light and the men we
     get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light
     seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray
     dinosaurlike skin and large black eyes but it moves
     quickly enough away that any other identifying feature
     is lost in the deeper shadows

     the primitives

     removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under
     their thick fur garments and scrabbling into the
     constricting cavern giving chase

     following them as they moves with animallike agility
     through the tightening space predatory hunters their
     torchlight catching

     the creature

     as it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller
     crevice leading off the main one the primitives
     entering frame after a moment only a few steps behind
     the lead primitive dropping to the cave floor
     pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit
     splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on
     the run


     int smaller ice cave  high angle down

     the fiery torch comes through first held by the lead
     man throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what
     appears to be a box cavern

     close on lead primitive

     rising quickly to his feet not seeing what the torch
     illuminates just behind him the face of a dead
     primitive man his body frozen into the ice he does
     finally notice this turning to see it when hes
     attacked viciously from behind

     the torch falls to the floor so that the fight is
     difficult to see but it is loud and cruel the creature
     squealing wildly as the grunts of the primitive now turn
     to the sounds of painful struggle until

     the second primitive man

     suddenly appears driving his bone weapon into the body
     of the creature again and again until the creature is
     driven away into the shadows

     the second man grabs the torch now not to see if his
     hunting mate has survived but in pursuit of the
     creature in the light we see that he and his weapon are
     covered with spatters of oily black blood as is the
     first primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor

     the second primitive stepping over his hunting mate
     stalking the creature into the shadows where it has
     collapsed the torch finally landing for the first
     time on its face

     when the torchlight hits its face the creature attacks
     but the primitive prevails he drops his torch and
     dispatches the already wounded creature with strong
     hard stabs of his weapon one of which penetrates the
     creatures eye


     low angle on the dead creature

     the torch which lies on the ground illuminates the
     dead creatures face its wounds are flowing with the
     oily black blood which oddly now begins to pool as
     if it has intelligence sentience pooling and traveling
     into a fissure in the cave floor and disappearing


     angle on the second primitive

     watching this unknowing his chest heaving from the
     fight as the spots of oily black blood which have
     spattered onto him begin to crawl crawling toward his
     eyes and mouth causing him to let out grunts of fear

     which are the sounds we hear as the camera slowly cranes
     up past the struggling primitive to the roof of the
     cave where the dancing shadows of the torch fade away
     with the sounds of struggle moving into darkness and
     silence but only for a moment until


     sunshine breaks through the roof of the cave  present
     day

     along with the spade of a shovel and then  the
     earthen cave ceiling gives way and a boy wearing nikes
     and an old tshirt falls through it falling past
     camera we hear a yell then a thud and a clattering of
     the shovel thats fallen in with him then a pained
     gasping

     then several heads appear in the opening these are boys
     of ten to eleven staring down into the cave hot
     sunlight blazing in we have traveled far far forward
     in time

                            2nd boy
               hey stevie you okay


     int cave  present day

     their pov of stevie

     on the floor below covered with dirt in his nose and
     mouth spitting out all these boys have texas in their
     voices

                            stevie
               i goti goti got
                      straining
               the wind knocked out of me

     this draws no sympathy from above only laughter

     the boys up above

     staring excitedly

                            3rd boy
               looks like a cave or something

                            2nd boy
               whats down there stevie anything

     over the boys above

     stevie has gotten up moving out of the patch of
     sunlight disappearing from view for a moment then
     reappearing still spitting out dirt but holding

                            stevie
               human skull

     one side partially missing from the cranium but it
     brings whoops of delight from the boys above

                            3rd boy
               toss it up here dude

                            stevie
               no way buttwipe i found it its
               mine

     angle up on stevie

     the other boys looking down at him stevie looking at
     the skull strangely the light shines through it it is
     milky opaque as if its bone thats turned somehow
     glassy in places then

                            stevie
               anyways theres bones all over the
               place down here

     stevie looks down at his feet camera following his look
     down to where there are indeed more human bones and
     something else he takes a couple of steps in place
     standing in a familiar black oily substance  which is
     climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor over
     the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself then
     the skull drops in the frame clattering on the hard
     floor of the cave

     camera slowly rising up from stevies shoes

     following subcutaneous worms which have begun locomoting
     aggressively up his legs as his whole body is wracked
     by a shivering seizure of some kind

     camera rises following the path of the worms as they
     move up the legs of his shorts some appearing on his
     bare arms but the great majority continuing up to
     stevies neck toward his face stevie stands paralyzed
     letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the
     wind was knocked out of him

                            3rd boy os
               hey stevie

     but stevie cannot answer him camera continuing up to
     the boys above looking down at their friend their eyes
     go wide

                            2nd boy
               you okay

     but what they see next answers that question for them

     their pov of stevie

     his face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms
     moving toward his eyes which begin filling with black
     oil looking much now like alien eyes

     close on the boys above

     freaked by what they see and doing what any kid would
     do now

                            3rd boy
               hey man lets get outta here

     and they do bolting from the hole in the top of the
     cave camera pushing up through this hole to reveal we
     are


     ext small dirt field  northern texas  day

     in a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids
     rising up out of the hole to reveal the parched dirt
     patch where three kids are running away from us as fast
     as their feet will take them toward a new housing tract
     five floorplans to choose from including the model
     home disappearing into the neighborhood a legend
     appears north texas 1998

     camera continues rising above the rooftops to see the
     surrounding expanse of empty texas flatland and in the
     distance the dallas skyline

     as camera settles there are a few moments of nothing
     but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the
     landscape in which we bury a short time cut


     ext neighborhood  northern texas  day

     then we hear it before we see it fire engines pulling
     into the neighborhood sirens wailing camera dropping
     again as the lead engine pulls up firemen are hopping
     off moving to the hole the boys dug

     low angle up from below ground level in the dugout
     hole

     two firemen carrying a ladder clamber down past camera
     three others appearing on their heels the other two
     firemen clamber down too the captain at the edge of
     the hole watching them holding a radio

                            fire captain
               this is captain miles coolesweve
               got a rescue situation in progress


     int cave  continuous

     as the lead fireman steps down the ladder into the cave
     he scans the darkness illuminated only by the shaft of
     light permitted by the hole above as the 2nd fireman
     drops down next to him the both stand motionless now
     as if sensing something

     their pov

     stevies feet are just visible on the floor of the cave
     a short distance away

     resume firemen  low angle

     they start cautiously toward stevie camera finding
     their feet tracking through the same oily black
     substance we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five
     thousand years ago as they move into the shadows we
     hold on the substanceand see it move its alive

                                             time cut to


     ext dirt field  short time later

     camera rises out of the dirt hole finds a group of
     neighbors

     concerned parents kids including stevies friends
     theyre held at a distance by the remaining firemen
     everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward looking
     at

     a medevac chopper

     coming off the sunsetting horizon moving toward us at
     high speed the whop whop of its blade soon shaking the
     neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just
     over the dirt field landing gently on the parched hard
     scrabble

     the side door flies open and five hazmat rescue
     paramedics jump out carrying a bubble litter camera
     pans them to the dirt hole past the fire captain the
     hazmat paramedics moving down into the hole the fire
     captain watches this then stares toward 

     dr ben bronschweig in shirtsleeves tie exiting the
     chopper following up the rear the captain meeting him
     in route

                            bronschweig
                      over the chopper
               keep those people back get them out
               of here

                            fire captain
                      to his men
               move them all back
                      dogging bronschweig
               i sent four men down after the boy
               theyre not responding

     dr bronschweigs focus is elsewhere though hes
     making a bee line to the earthen hole where young stevie
     is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed
     quarantine bubble litter by the rescue squad
     bronschweig watches with great concern getting a good
     look now at stevies paralyzed body as it passes him

     angle on chopper

     as stevies body is loaded aboard the side door is slid
     shut the engine throttles up and the chopper takes
     flight again almost as quickly as it arrived the prop
     wash blowing

     dr bronschweig

     and the gathering crowd bronschweig watches the chopper
     bank away then turns his look to

     the neighborhood

     where a series of unmarked cargo vans trucks are
     rolling in a fleet of vehicles driven by what looks
     like military personnel most conspicuously two white
     unmarked tanker trucks there are no markings on these
     vehicles

     resume bronschweig

     as the fire captain moves around to face him off

                            fire captain
               what about my men

                            dr bronschweig
                      brusquely
               were doing all we can

     and he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the
     military personnel are pulling out tents tent poles
     scientific equipment leaving the captain to wonder what
     the hells going on watching the first of many
     refrigeration units being unloaded the personnel
     carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him
     moving right to camera and plunging us into black

     hold then over black a familiar sound again the
     sound of a chopper auguring in as we fade up revealing
     we are


     ext top of a skyscraper  day

     the chopper is banking over the side of the building
     preparing to touch down on the rooftop where fifteen fbi
     agents in dark id windbreakers are standing a legend
     appears federal building dallas texas one week
     later

     the chopper touches down and again the side door is
     thrown open but now only one man exits special agent
     in charge sac darius michaud

     michaud moves with the measured pace of authority
     approaching the waiting fbi agents one of whom steps
     up

                            fbi agent
               weve evacuated the building and been
               through it bottom to top no trace of
               an explosive device or anything
               resembling one

                            sac michaud
               have you taken the dogs through

                            fbi agent
               yes sir

                            sac michaud
               well take them through again

     this is given as a nonnegotiable order to the somewhat
     weary fbi man who turns back to his charges michaud
     does not register this attitude though something else
     has caught his attention causing him to walk to the
     edge of the building camera following him seeing what
     he sees now

     on an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be an fbi
     agent in an id windbreaker exiting onto the roof camera
     continuing around into a close up profile of sac
     michaud staring at this his jaw set he doesnt like
     what he sees and what he sees is


     ext rooftop opposing skyscraper  day  continuous

     special agent dana scully is coming out the door leading
     onto the roof the door slams shut behind her she too
     is dressed in an fbi windbreaker shes dialing her
     cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for
     something dialing the number of

               ive just climbed twelve floors im
               hot and thirsty and im wondering to
               be honest what im doing here

               in for the federal building across the
               street

                            mulder filter

                      impatience
               mulder when a terrorist bomb threat
               is called in the logical purpose of
               providing this information is to allow
               us to find the bomb the rational
               object of terrorism is to promote
               terror if youd study model
               behavioral pattern in virtually every
               case where a threat has turned up an
               explosive device if we dont act in
               accordance with that data  if you
               ignore it as we have done  the
               chances are great that if here
               actually is a bomb we might not find
               it lives could be lost 

     scully engrossed in her own argument realizes shes
     been the only one speaking for the last short while she
     stops walking

                            scully
               mulder

                            mulder
               what happened to playing a hunch

     scully almost jumps out of her own skin the voice has
     come not over the phone but from two feet away where

     angle to include agent mulder

     standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit
     cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth
     clicking his cell phone off moving out

                            scully
               jesus mulder

                            mulder
               the element of surprise scully
               random acts of unpredictability if we
               fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
               expect the unexpected in a universe of
               infinite possibilities we find
               ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
               anything that cannot be programmed
               categorized or easily referenced

     mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he
     sails his sunflower seeds into the air dusting his
     hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a
     moment

                            mulder
               what are we doing up here its hotter
               than hell

     and hes on the move scully moving to catch up

     new angle

     mulder is moving toward the stairs scully catching him
     mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps

                            scully
               i know youre bored in this
               assignment but unconventional
               thinking is only going to get you into
               trouble now

                            mulder
               hows that

                            scully
               youve got to quit looking for what
               isnt there theyve closed the
               xfiles theres procedure to be
               followed here protocol

               threat for houston i think its free
               beer night at the astrodome

     scully gives him a look its no use she reaches the
     door first grabs the knob but it wont open turning
     to mulder

                            scully
               now what

                            mulder
                      suddenly nervous
               its locked

     she wiggles the knob again

                            scully
               so much for anticipating the
               unforeseen

     scully squints into the sun staring at mulder but hes
     quick on the draw and realizes what shes up to he
     grabs for the door and it opens looking to scully
     whose hard look of mockscolding has become a smirking
     smile

                            scully
               had you

                            mulder
               no you didnt

                            scully

                            mulder
               she was with me

     skinner studies mulder shaking his head

               in damage to the city of dallas lives
               have been lost no suspects have been
               named so the story being shaped is
               this could have been prevented that
               the fbi didnt do its job

                            mulder
               and they want to blame us

                            skinner
               agent mulder  we both know that if
               you and agent scully hadnt taken the
               initiative to search the adjacent
               building you could have multiplied
               the fatalities by a hundred 

                            mulder
                      grasping the irony
               but its not the lives we saved its
               the lives we didnt

                            skinner
                      reciting the dictum
                if it looks bad its bad for the
               fbi 

                            mulder
                if they want someone to blame
               they can blame me agent scully
               doesnt deserve this

                            skinner
               shes in there right now saying the
               same thing about you

                            mulder
               i breached protocol i broke contact
               with the sac i ignored a primary
               tactical rule and left him alone with
               the device

                            skinner
               agent scully says it was she who
               ordered you out of the building that
               you wanted to go back

     mulder doesnt get to respond because the door opens
     again and agent scully exits she looks like shes been
     through it

                            scully
                      to skinner
               theyre asking for you sir

     skinner gives one last look to mulder then reenters
     leaving mulder and scully alone scully wearing a pained
     look

                            mulder
               whatever you told them in there you
               dont have to protect me

                            scully
               all i told them was the truth

                            mulder
               theyre trying to divide us on this
               scully we cant let them

                            scully
               they have divided us mulder theyre
               splitting us up

                            mulder
                      beat
               what what are you talking about

                            scully
               i meet with the opr day after tomorrow
               for remediation and reassignment

                            mulder
               why

                            scully
               i think you must have an idea they
               cited a history of problems relating
               back to 1993

                            mulder
               they were the ones that put us
               together

                            scully
               because they wanted me to invalidate
               your work your investigations into
               the paranormal but i think this goes
               deeper than that

                            mulder
               this isnt about you scully theyre
               doing this to me

                            scully
               theyre not doing this mulder
                      off his look
               i left behind a career in medicine
               because i thought i might make a
               difference at the fbi when they
               recruited me they told me women made
               up nine percent of the bureau i felt
               this was not an impediment but an
               opportunity to distinguish myself but
               it hasnt turned out that way and
               now if i were to be transferred to
               omaha or wichita or some field office
               where im sure i could rise it just
               doesnt hold the interest for me it
               once did not after what ive seen and
               done

                            mulder
               youre quitting

                            scully
               theres really no reason left for me
               to stay anymore
                      off his look
               maybe you should ask yourself if your
               hearts still in it too

     the door opens to the hearing room again now ad
     skinner steps part way out gesturing to him

                            skinner
               agent mulder youre up

                            scully
                      regretfully
               im sorry good luck

     mulder rises scully studying his poorly disguised hurt
     before he turns and goes into the room

     scully watching the door close behind him her feelings
     poorly disguised too

     adjusting to reveal the attractive barmaid tipping the
     bottle pushing it across the bar to where two empty
     shooters sit making the exchange

               gotta train for this kind of heavy
               lifting

     mulder tosses back the shooter anyway she watches him
     as she retrieves the small shot glass intrigued by his
     dark silence

     mulder nods pointing to the tequila bottle again the
     barmaid agrees to pour another one reluctantly

     angle over to a man at the end of the bar

     staring at mulder intently hes older than mulder
     dressed in an old brooke brothers light summer suit
     mulder notices him feels his gaze but doesnt give it
     thought

               when he was a kid who now chases

               gun shouting to the heavens and

                            mulder
               well if youve got something to tell
               me youve got as long as it takes me
               to hail a cab

     mulder starts out the door but kurtzweil grabs his
     arm

                            kurtzweil
               theyre going to pin dallas on you
               agent mulder but there was nothing
               you couldve done nothing anyone
               couldve done to prevent that bomb
               from going off because the truth is
               something youd never have guessed
               never have predicted

     mulder pulls away from kurtzweil but kurtzweil dogs him
     to


     ext street outside downscale bar  night

     the street is empty the hour is late mulder moves to
     the curb

               and whats that

                            kurtzweil
               sac darius michaud never tried or
               intended to defuse the bomb

                            mulder
                      rhetorical disbelief
               he just let it explode

                            kurtzweil
               whats the question nobodys asking
               why that building why not the federal
               building

                            mulder
               the federal building was too well
               guarded

                            kurtzweil
               no they put the bomb in the building
               across the street because it did have
               federal offices the federal emergency
               management agency had a provisional
               medical quarantine office there which
               is where the bodies were found but
               thats the thing

     mulders got his hand up for a taxi coming its pulling
     over as mulder steps from the curb stepping away from
     kurtzweil

                            kurtzweil
               the thing you didnt know that
               youd never think to check

     mulders got the taxi door open turning to kurtzweil

                            kurtzweil
               those people were already dead

                            mulder
               before the bomb went off

                            kurtzweil
               thats what im saying

     mulder stares at kurtzweil for a moment

                            mulder

     the moon is rising over the horizon across the
     curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush
     when flying objects cross between it and us their forms
     unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth
     but they are moving towards us silhouettes in the
     background of the moon

     they move silently their size increasing as they move
     closer and then we hear them moments before they
     arrive at our position unmarked helicopters just
     overhead hugging the ground as they blast across the
     dark texas night

     flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost
     featureless night landscape heading for something that
     we see ahead in the distance what looks like a large
     glowing dome surrounded by the lights of a residential
     area weve already seen on the edge of suburban dallas

     the field where the kids had been digging has been
     transformed into some kind of worksite

     a large white domed tent has been erected over almost
     the entire patch of ground surrounded by the cargo
     trucks that we saw earlier and more unmarked vans and
     trucks there are men in black fatigues moving about
     and scientists in hazmat suits

     as the unmarked black helicopters bank overhead coming
     in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents camera
     moving toward one of the helicopters as it lightly
     touches down and its black door swings open a man
     stepping out and as camera pushes up into his face we
     recognize him as the cigarette smoking man

     the figure that weve come to know as an assassin and a
     model of modern selfinterest and amorality one of the
     central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth
     from the american people about the existence of
     extraterrestrial life

     something known only as the project

     he walks out from under the whirring prop just far
     enough to get a flame from his lighter to get a

     of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within
     the tent areas where scientists are working at tables
     doing what appears to be some kind of hightech
     archeological work it is a hive of activity within as
     the scientist leads us past the refrigeration units to
     the earthen hole where dr bronschweig weve met him
     earlier coming out of a medevac chopper that landed
     when the tent city was erected appears out of the
     earthen hole which is reason for all this excitement
     climbing out a clear hatch which has been fashioned to
     cover the hole seeing

     bronschweig pushes away the plastic revealing a man
     lying on a gurney draped in plastic he is hooked up to
     various and sundry machines which are monitoring his
     life signs

     his skin has turned almost translucent the veins and

               life energy digesting bone and
               tissue weve just slowed the

     bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard
     into the mans face and then we see it movement

     close on mans face

     though the mans eyes still blink occasionally we can
     actually see through his tissue and the bones in his
     skull to see something is living inside him

     angle up on csm and bronschweig

     the cigarette smoking mans mind is working intently on
     all the possibilities and consequences

                            dr bronschweig
               do you want me to destroy this one
               too before it gestates

                            kurtzweil
               i picked up the historical document of
               the venality and hypocrisy of the
               american government the daily
               newspaper

                            mulder
               you said the firemen and the boy were
               found in the temporary offices of the
               federal emergency management agency
               why

                            kurtzweil
               according to the newspaper fema had
               been called out to manage an outbreak
               of the hanta virus are you familiar
               with the hanta virus agent mulder

                            mulder
               it was a deadly virus spread by field
               mice in the southwest us several
               years ago

                            kurtzweil

               the federal emergency management
               agencys real power is fema allows
               the white house to suspend
               constitutional government upon
               declaration of a national emergency
               to create a nonelected government
               think about that
                      beat
               what is an agency with such broad
               sweeping power doing managing a small
               viral outbreak in suburban texas

                            mulder

               recruited for a project they told us
               it was biological warfare a virus

               god we cant even wrap our minds
               around something as obvious as hiv
               we have no context for what killed
               those men or any appreciation of the
               scale in which it will be unleashed in
               the future of how it will be
               transmitted of the environmental
               factors involved

               cure theyve been working on this for
               fifty years while the rest of the
               world was fighting gooks and commies
               these men have been secretly
               negotiating a planned armageddon

                            kurtzweil

               been set it will happen on a holiday
               when people are away from their homes

               emergency at which time all federal

     job in the world

                      voice lowering pointedly
               something i couldnt show to anyone
               else not without more information
               and not without causing the kind of
               attention id just as soon avoid right
               now
                      off mulders look
               the virus those men were infected with
               contains a protein coat ive never
               seen before what it did to them it
               did extremely fast and unlike the
               aids virus or any other aggressive
               strain it survives very nicely
               outside the body

                            mulder
               how was it contracted

                            scully
               that i dont know but if its through
               simple contact of blood to blood and
               if it doesnt respond to conventional
               treatments it could be a serious
               health threat

     mulders reaction is postponed or at least subdued by
     the reappearance of the field agent

                            field agent
               like i said these are fossils and
               they werent near the blast center so
               they arent going to tell you much

                            scully
               may i

     fragments have been separated she takes them looking
     at them on her way over to the microscope tapping out a
     tiny fragment onto the viewing bed she puts her eyes
     down to the stereoscope eyepieces then almost
     immediately looks up at mulder who translates this look
     almost instantly

                            mulder
               you said you knew the location of the
               archeological site where these were
               found

                            field agent

     their business here however doesnt represent anyones

               kurtzweil we think

                            strughold
               weve allowed this man his freedom
               his books have actually helped us to
               facilitate plausible denial has he
               outlived his usefulness to us

                            wellmanicured man
               no one believes kurtzweil or his
               books hes a toiler a crank

                            strughold
               and mulder

                            elder
               our new situation makes us vulnerable
               if he learns information as we do he
               could jeopardize the projects
               secrecy

                            2nd elder
               control of information means control
               of mulder

                            cigarette smoking man
               i can control mulder ive always
               controlled mulder

                            strughold
               this may take another approach

     he says this casting his look toward the wellmanicured
     man a look of cold malevolence the wmms reaction
     is disdain

                            wellmanicured man
               you cant kill mulder hes got too
               much light on him

                            strughold
               you need not kill a man to destroy
               him

                            wellmanicured man
                      personalizing the
                      inference
               no you need only take away what is
               most precious to him

     she stands against a backdrop of texas flatland
     squinting into the sun shaking her head

                            scully
               i dont know mulder

     we are

     wide angle reverse to include mulder standing in the
     middle of a park replete with jungle gyms playground
     equipment all brand spanking new they are standing
     right where there had once been a hard scrabble parched
     and barren little field where the earthen hole had been
     dug by the young boys and what had later been the site
     of so much activity by the group of scientists but
     where theres now a park thick green grass covering the
     parch of ground including the spot where the hole had
     been

                            scully
               he didnt mention a park

                            mulder
               this is where he marked on the map
               scully where he says those fossils
               were unearthed

                            scully
               i dont see any evidence of an
               archeological or any other kind of
               digsite not even a sewer or a storm
               drain

     mulder scans the area confounded shaking his head as
     they walk

                            mulder
               youre sure the fossils you looked at
               showed the same signs of deterioration
               you saw in the firemans body in the
               morgue

                            scully
                      nodding
               the bone was porous as if the virus
               of the causative microbe were
               digesting it

                            mulder
               and youve never seen anything like
               that

                            scully
               no  it didnt show up on any of the
               immunohistochemical tests 

     mulder is listening to all this while looking down at
     his feet

                            mulder
               this looks like new grass to you

                            scully
               it looks pretty green for this
               climate

     mulder stops kneels touches the thick green carpet of
     turf he digs around lifting up a corner of a new
     square

                            mulder
               grounds dry about an inch down
               somebody just laid this down very
               recently id say

                            scully
                      looking off
               all the equipment is brand new

               no irrigation system somebodys
               covering their tracks

     they both turn looking at something thats caught their
     attention on the street where their rental car is
     parked three kids all of whom we recognize from
     earlier stevies friends

     tooling down the street on new bmx bikes reacting to
     mulders loud whistle this stops them staring at
     mulder blankly across the distance

                            mulder
               hey

     they dont answer just keep staring squinting into the
     sun mulder and scully start walking toward them

                            scully
               do you live around here

                            2nd boy

                            mulder

     the kids dont answer quickly

                            2nd boy
               not supposed to talk about it

                            scully

                      off the boys guilty looks
               they buy you these bikes

     the kids shift uncomfortably

                            scully

               find myself standing right where i am
               right now at another dead end 

     as she says this a bell starts to sound a flashing
     light hits mulder and scully they both turn to see

     high angle over a railroad crossing sign

     sitting all by its lonely self no swinging arms or
     gate just one little sign between mulder and scully and

     camera panning to the light of a locomotive speeding
     toward us

     wide angle over tracks to mulder and scully

     they move toward their car but the train is coming
     fast mulder and scully stop and wait watching the
     train as the engine breaks frame eclipsing mulder and
     scully from view and as it passes by we see two very
     familiar white tankers loaded piggyback atop flat bed
     cars

     the train which is not much longer than this passes
     and mulder and scully make a mad dash for their car the
     lights come on and mulder swings the vehicle into a hard
     accelerating turn taking the spoke of the intersection
     that parallels the tracks as the car hauls ass after
     the train we

     question

     reverse angle  mulder and scullys former pov

     the agents are moving off the tracks now picking their
     way toward the horizon where at the edge of the great
     plateau that lays out before them there are two giant
     glowing white domes

     it is otherwise pitch dark out almost giving the
     impression that the domes are floating

     it would give the distinct impression of
     otherworldliness if we hadnt seen a similar smaller
     glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found
     the skull and if we could not see the lights of the
     train rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes

     jump when large fans just overhead hit them both with
     hard blasts of air

     stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air into
     the still silence of the space beyond

                            scully
               cool in here temperatures being
               regulated

     high overhead angle

     our view is down through the crosswires and cables that
     create the tension support the effect is a combination
     of simplicity and perfect function stark and high tech
     the flooring is gray and flat featureless but we dont
     yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed
     tent houses

     though the air is still and there is no movement of any
     kind there is a sound that permeates the interior a
     steady hum almost electrical hum but different

     mulder and scully move together toward the middle of the
     space

     wide on tent  mulder and scullys pov

     laid out in a grid low to the ground are what look
     like boxes fixed in place like roof vents except these
     are on the floor no more than three feet tall and
     about the same measure square

     new angle  tracking with mulder and scully

     as they continue to move cautiously walking out into
     the grid of boxshaped objects coming to the center of
     the capacious arenasized space standing over one of
     the mysterious boxes which we now see have louvered
     tops the louvers however are shut so that whatever is
     inside the boxes cannot be seen

                            scully
               i think were on top of something i
               think these are some kind of venting

     mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box

                            mulder
               you hear that

                            scully
               i hear the humming like electricity
               high voltage maybe

                            mulder
               maybe maybe not

     scully looks skyward

                            scully
               what do you think those are for

     mulder takes his ear off the box looking up now too

     their pov

     at the top of the dome are two large corresponding
     louver vents

     resume mulder and scully

     looking up at these vents

     int white dome tent  night

     high wide angle over mulder and scully staring up just
     past camera at the louvered vents at top center of the
     tent when a loud metallic noise makes them jump

     agents pov the louvered vents above them

     one of the vents is opening automatically its large
     metal louvers straining from their flat closed position
     into an upanddown open position when this is
     complete the second louver does the same

     the straining sound of galvanized metalonmetal

     low angle on mulder and scully

     as mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to
     the mysterious box theyre standing next to something
     occurs to him something frightening

                            mulder
               scully

                            scully

                            mulder
               run

     mulder grabs her hand pulling her along though she
     doesnt know why or whats about to happen tracking
     fast with them as mulder leads her back toward the door
     they entered which is a good hundred yards away

                            scully
                      yelling on the run
               what are you doing

                            mulder
                      yelling back
               come on

     when the louvered vents on all the low gridarranged
     boxes open in dominolike succession  out of them
     pouring thousands and thousands of bees rapidly filling
     the atmosphere of the domed space

     as if the insects are being shot out of nonstop
     cannons

     high angle

     thick streams of bees head right at camera flying for
     the open louvers at the top of the dome as mulder and
     scully run for it down below

     tracking with mulder and scully

     scullys hand slipping from mulders as she pulls her
     jacket up over her head mulder doing the same now
     ducking his head inside his own jacket the agents are
     slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way
     toward the door  bees clinging to their clothes but
     motion seems to be the key

     as mulder runs toward camera  where the downward blast
     of air knocks all the bees off him in the bg we see
     that scully has fallen behind still running but losing
     her way in the process losing her bearings as the
     thickening swarm of bees descends

     close on scully

     when mulder enters frame jacket pulled over his head
     again taking scully by the back of her coat and
     swinging her toward the direction of the door
     whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the
     doorfans following right behind her as the fans
     blasting them and the agents continue right out the
     doors to


     ext white domed tent  night

     scully and mulder comes blasting out themselves now but
     they havent even had time to catch their breaths when
     they react to movement something coming at them in the
     night

     their povs  straight down the rows of domed tents

     where bright beams blast on moving fast toward them
     the rushing whir of the turbine engines of the unmarked
     choppers the bright beams skimming across the ground
     toward mulder and scully traveling right along the
     edges of ends of the white domed tents threatening to
     spot the agents unless they  run

     and they do  bolting just as the beams and the
     helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments
     before running to


     ext acres of corn  night  mulder and scully  various
     handheld

     running flat out now knocking away the stalks and
     leaves that block their way

     following and leading shots

     povs and tracking shots

     and chasing angles as the agents run through the only
     cover theyve got as

     angle just over the top of crops

     the unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead their
     bright spotlights searching and cutting through the
     cornrows as the agents zig and zag just out of the
     discovering beams as the choppers zoom right over their
     heads

     reverse on choppers

     traversing the field then doing sharp banking turns and
     swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers
     the wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down
     so as to reveal anything hidden within

     the bright spots making sure that nothing might escape
     detection

     low angle  camera searching and finding scully

     as she runs up into frame shes lost sight of

               scully


     resume scully

     reacting to the sound of her name but theres no time
     to find her bearings on mulder not before she has to
     take flight again as one of the choppers appears
     overhead hovering into view knocking the corn down in
     a path moving straight toward her

     camera leading her as she runs from the oncoming craft
     passing camera to the left as the chopper passes camera
     right

     tracking fast with mulder

     beating his way through the corn like bomba through the
     jungle

     matching this action as mulder runs toward us when one
     of the unmarked helicopters breaks into frame in an
     intersecting path its beam passing right over mulder
     and illuminating him but while it doesnt slow mulder
     down the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn
     sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading
     right back at mulder  at us

     new low angle on edge of corn field

     where mulder bursts out of the perimeter turning on a
     quick dime and running an out pattern just before the
     chopper bursts into frame overhead its search beam
     narrowly missing mulder

     new angle on mulder

     running the corner of the field looking frantically
     down each corn row until he comes to a stop no sign
     of

                            mulder

               mulder


     new angle on scully

     shes exiting the field behind him running toward him
     and when she gets to him they both break into a run
     across the desert camera following them as they sprint
     away

     following them until they both start to slow slowing to
     a stop in the darkness turning to see

     their pov

     the helicopters have disappeared

     resume mulder and scully

     reacting to this

                            scully
               whered they go

                            mulder
               i dont know

     then they both turn again and continue running as fast
     as their feet will take them back towards the bluff
     where their car is parked


     ext bluff overlooking corn fields  night

     where mulder and scullys car is parked stillness
     until mulder and scullys heads appear as they climb up
     from the direction of the corn fields they get in their
     car and start it quickly mulder turns the ignition but
     the car doesnt start immediately he turns it over and
     over but it wont kick

     as he does this unbeknownst to the agents one of the
     black helicopters rises up from below the bluff
     appearing in their rear windshield hovering just behind
     the car like a giant bumblebee just as

     mulder gets the car started throwing the
     transmission in gear and spinning the tires as they
     head off back in the direction they came without their
     lights on as they do this the black chopper continues
     to hover for a moment then banks off and away into the
     night

     mulder and scully speed off in the opposite direction
     as we

     close on a file

     being leafed through by a womans hands camera tilting
     up to special agent cassidy the woman we met earlier
     running the opr hearing she takes a quick glance at her
     watch looking up when

     the door to the room

     opens a beat then skinner enters with a wearied look

                            skinner
               shes coming in

     skinner ducks his head back out to look at

     int hallway outside opr hearing room  day

     where scully stands looking into the glass of a display
     case trying to put her hair and clothes and person
     together shes still in the same clothes we saw her in
     seeing skinner now moving toward him

     resume opr hearing room

     scully enters past skinner though she has straightened
     them and her hair there is no mistaking that shes
     been to the dust bowl and back to get here her manner
     is chastened

     scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where shell
     be sitting venturing only a brief polite look to

     angle to include cassidy and the other panel members

     they reshuffle their papers pulling up their chairs
     ready to get down to business now

               i apologize for making you wait 
               ive brought some new evidence with me
               

                            cassidy
               evidence of what

     close profile on scully

     reaching into her satchel pulling out an evidence bag
     whatever shes reaching for shes reluctant to present
     with confidence

                            scully
               these are fossilized bone fragments
               ive been able to study gathered from
               the bomb site in dallas

     as scully speaks we see a bee crawl out from under the
     collar of her suit jacket crawling toward the back of
     her neck crawling slowly as if stretching its legs
     from its long journey camera dollying around scully as
     the bee does moving into an over to

                            cassidy
               youve been back to dallas

               yes

                            cassidy
               are you going to let us in on what
               exactly youre trying to prove 

                            scully
               that the bombing in dallas may have
               been to destroy the bodies of those
               firemen so their deaths and the
               reason for them wouldnt have to be
               explained

                      challenging
                those are very serious allegations

                            scully
               yes i know

     there is a hush of murmured responses to this the panel
     members speaking to one another assistant director
     skinner shifts uneasily in his chair hes been here
     before with agents mulder and scully hes sensing
     something outrageous

                            cassidy
               and you have conclusive evidence of
               this something to tie this claim of
               yours to the crime 

                            scully
                      grudgingly
               nothing completely conclusive 

     we have returned to the over angle on scully where we
     see the bee just below her jacket collar on the back of
     her neck

     it crawls back under her collar disappearing from
     sight

                            scully
               i hope to were working to develop
               this evidence

     sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the

     from him kurtzweil is jumpy but he sees from mulders
     expression that somethings up

                            kurtzweil
               you found something

                            mulder
               yes on the texas border some kind of
               experiment something they excavated
               was brought there in tanker trucks

                            mulder
               there were bees and corn crops

     kurtzweil smiles at mulder laughs with nervous
     excitement mulder doesnt quite realize it yet but

               a transportation system transgenic

                            kurtzweil
               that would be my guess

                            mulder
               your guess

     but kurtzweil doesnt respond to this hes moving

     mulder is getting heated rough with kurtzweil when
     unexpectedly a man suddenly exits the bathroom reacting
     to this scene kurtzweil uses the moment to break from
     mulder slipping out the back door mulder takes a beat
     then goes after him

     pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness

               youd be shit out of luck if not for
               me you saw what you saw because i led

               mulder

     and with that he turns now striding off leaving mulder
     to deal with the excellent logic of this when suddenly
     mulder reacts to a noise somewhere above him

     up on a fire escape a man is moving mulder can only
     see his feet and legs from this angle but it is clear
     he has been watching mulder upon being spotted the

     we get a glimpse of the man who was watching him a face
     we recognize as that of the man who brushed past mulder

     and with that she exits his apartment the argument too
     painful and her ability to be persuaded too clear to
     herself


     int hallway outside mulders apartment  night

     wide angle from end of hall where we see scully
     leaving mulders apartment moving at a hurried clip to
     the elevator  toward camera as if anticipating her
     own impulse to turn around and go back as she moves
     into fg mulder exits his apt door

                            mulder

     she is silent moved in spite of all her desire not to
     be she moves to mulder holds him they break slightly
     and she looks up at mulder with deep respect admiration
     and kisses him on the forehead when

     suddenly a physical intimacy weve never seen a
     heat and passion that cant be denied the opportunity
     for the inevitable has presented itself

     the moment of truth has arrived mulder is staring at
     scully as shes looking back at him his head moves
     slightly toward hers  as one of his hands moves up to
     her neck drawing her to him where there is hesitation
     on her part there is also desire when

                            scully
               ouch

     scully pulls away from mulder rubbing at her neck where
     his hand had been

                            mulder
               what what happened

                            scully
               i think something stung me

     scullys hand comes out with the squirming bee which
     she holds in her hand while mulder moves around her
     checking her neck

                            mulder
               it must

     but he doesnt finish his sentence before he has to
     catch scully from falling her head bobs and she has to
     catch it

               of her throat  there was no
               preexisting allergy to beestings 
               the bee that stung her may have been

     they get her to the back of the vehicle guiding the
     gurney in with experienced hands scullys eyes are on
     mulder as shes slid into the brightly lit interior

     the 1st paramedic blocks mulder somewhat as he steps
     toward the van anticipating that hes going with them
     to the hospital but the doors are closing on him before
     he gets an opportunity

     following mulder around to the drivers side of the van
     now moving to the drivers window where the driver can
     be seen in the rear view mirror his eyes watching
     mulder

     on mulder

     a moment of vague recognition  a catch in his step

     resume

     as mulders momentum carries him to the drivers window
     where se see again the man from the vending room who
     was also surveilling mulder and he has a handgun
     pointed at mulder which he fires through the window
     the glass shattering

     throwing himself away backward but the bullet catches
     him in the head blood and glass spraying onto the side
     of the van he goes down to the ground  as the
     paramedic van accelerates fast away

     refrigeration unit a selfcontained life support

     thin layer of frost through which we can see agent
     scully

     she lies as if in a state of paralysis but a blink of
     her eyes is enough to tell us that she is alive

     tracking with the men moving the container as they
     hustle it to the waiting jet as the cigarette smoking
     man is descending the steps of the plane onto the
     tarmac watching as the container is moved to the cargo
     hold and loaded inside

     the hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up as
     the cigarette smoking man reboards the aircraft and it
     taxis away

     ext alley behind downscale dc bar  night

     a figure appears at the end of the alley moving toward
     us it could be mulder from this distance but as the
     figure comes closer we recognize him as kurtzweil
     moving into the fg checking behind him ahead of him
     jumpy

     he takes a cautious beat then moves to the door leading
     into the bar established reaching for the knob
     opening it finding the wellmanicured man standing
     there

                            wellmanicured man
               dr kurtzweil isnt it dr alvin
               kurtzweil

                            kurtzweil
               jesus christ

     kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man
     backpedaling a bit looking around and behind him for an
     ambush

                            wellmanicured man
               youre surprised certainly youve
               been expecting some response to your
               indiscretion

     the wmm steps out of the doorway following
     kurtzweil

                            wellmanicured man
               im quite sure whatever you told agent
               mulder you have your good reason
               its a weakness in men our age the
               urge to confess
                      stopping his walk
               i forgive you that

     kurtzweil is thrown by the words and the delivery
     stopping his backward progress studying this upright
     and civil man

                            kurtzweil
               what are you doing here what do you
               want from me

                            wellmanicured man
               you must try to understand what im
               here to do is only to protect my
               children you and i have but short
               lives left i can only hope the same
               isnt true for them

     on this note kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the
     direction from which he came tracking back with him
     until headlights hit his face

     reverse angle

     a town car has pulled into the alley behind him
     accelerating fast down the narrow corridor effectively
     trapping kurtzweil in as he squints into its
     headlights then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
     wmm

     moderately crowded as mulder enters stopping to catch
     his breath moving to the back of the bar looking for

     the booth where he met kurtzweil earlier

     moving through the bar  real panic in his expression
     he heads to the back


     int rear of downscale bar  night  continuous

     mulder passing the bathrooms moving to the door where
     we saw the wellmanicured man standing just a short bit
     ago but there is no one back here now mulder moves to
     the back door the one leading to the alley pushing it
     open and finding

     the wellmanicured man stands with his driver closing
     the trunk on the idling town car which has been turned
     around the wmm turns to see

                            wellmanicured man
               mr mulder

                            mulder
               what happened to kurtzweil

                            wellmanicured man
               hes come and gone

     the wmm moves to mulder who doesnt trust him for a
     second mulder is still breathing hard sizing up this
     scene

                            mulder
               wheres scully

                            wellmanicured man
               i have answers for you

                            mulder
               is she alive

                            wellmanicured man
               yes

     mulder stares at the wmm  measuring him

                            wellmanicured man
               im quite prepared to tell you
               everything though there isnt much
               you havent guessed

                            mulder
               about the conspiracy

                            wellmanicured man
               i think of it as an agreement a word
               your father liked to use

                            mulder
               i want to know where scully is

     the wellmanicured man suddenly reaches into his jacket
     pocket without warning or explanation mulder tensing
     slightly he removes a thin felt envelope

                            wellmanicured man
               the location of agent scully and the
               means to save her life
                      off mulders look
               please

     he gestures toward the car where the driver stands with
     the back door open mulder hesitates then steps from
     the doorway moving past the wmm sliding in the
     wmm gets in after him closes the door the car pulls
     away

                                             cut to


     int limousine  night  continuous

     we see mulder in the back seat reflected in the
     rearview mirror where we also see the eyes of the
     driver watching him mulder is handed the felt envelope
     by the wmm

                            mulder
               what is it

                            wellmanicured man
               a weak vaccine against the virus agent
               scully has been infected with it must
               be administered with ninety six
               hours

                            mulder
                      beat
               youre lying

                            wellmanicured man
               no though i have no way to prove
               otherwise the virus is
               extraterrestrial we know very little
               about it except that it is the
               original inhabitant of this planet

                            mulder
                      dubious to say the least
               a virus

                            wellmanicured man
               a simple unstoppable lifeform what
               is a virus but a colonizing force that
               cannot be defeated living in a cave
               underground until it mutates and
               attacks

                            mulder
               this is what youve been conspiring to
               conceal a disease

                            wellmanicured man
               no for god sake youve got it all
               backwards

     this outburst comes suddenly unexpectedly

                            wellmanicured man
               aids the ebola virus  on the
               evolutionary scale they are newborns
               this virus walked the planet long
               before the dinosaurs

                            mulder
               what do you mean walked

                            wellmanicured man
               your aliens agent mulder your little
               green men first landed here millions
               of years ago those that didnt leave
               have been laying dormant underground
               since the last ice age in the form of
               an evolved pathogen waiting to be
               reconstituted when the alien race from
               which it came returns to colonize the
               planet using us as hosts against
               this we have no defense nothing but a
               weak vaccine
                      beat
               do you see why it was kept secret why
               even the best men  men like your
               father  could not let the truth be
               known

     the force and conviction of his delivery leave mulder
     shaken

                            wellmanicured man
               until dallas we believed the virus
               was simply a controlling organism
               that mass infection would make us a
               slave race

                            mulder
               thats why you bombed the building
               the infected firemen the boy 

                            wellmanicured man
               imagine our surprise when they began
               to gestate my group has been working
               cooperatively with the alien
               colonists facilitating their
               programs to give us access to the
               virus in false hope we might be able
               to secretly find a cure so that we
               might save ourselves as the last of
               the species
                      beat
               your father wisely refused to believe
               this choosing hope over selfishness
               hope is the only future he had his
               children
                      beat then selfrevealing
               the only future any of us have

     this draws a look back in the mirror from the driver

                            mulder
               but he sacrificed his own daughter
               my sister samantha

                            wellmanicured man
               the only true survivors of the viral
               holocaust will be those immune to it
               those vaccinated against it and
               humanalien hybrids your father
               arranged for your sisters abduction
               he allowed her to be taken to an alien
               hybrid program so that she would
               survive as a clone
                      beat
               he had different hopes for you that
               you would uncover the truth about the
               project that you would stop it that
               you would fight the future

     mulder sits stunned by this as if somehow his destiny
     has been validated if not preordained or maybe just
     justified

                            mulder
               why are you telling me this

                            wellmanicured man
               i thought it only fair you should
               know given how hard youve worked

                            mulder
               what happened to kurtzweil

                            wellmanicured man
               as your father knew things need to be
               sacrificed to the future

                            mulder
               where is he

                            wellmanicured man
               dr kurtzweil is in the trunk

     mulder stares at the wmm at his coldblooded
     expression

                            mulder
               let me out stop the car

                            wellmanicured man
                      motioning
               driver

     mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop
     trying the door but the door is locked when he turns
     back to the wmm he has produced a handgun which is
     now pointing at mulder laid casually across a folded
     arm mulder reacts on seeing it

                            wellmanicured man
               the men i work with will stop at
               nothing to clear the way for what they
               believe is their stake in the
               inevitable future i was ordered to
               kill kurtzweil a necessary action to
               protect my grandchildrens lives
                      beat
               i might just as easily kill you

     mulder is recoiling as he says this then without
     hesitation in one quick move he shoots the driver in
     the head

     the blood spattering on the front windshield  and on
     mulder who has barely had a chance to react

                            wellmanicured man
               trust no one mr mulder

     mulder looks at the wellmanicured man expecting to be
     next and for a moment we do too but the wmm simply
     opens the door and steps out of the car holding the
     door open for mulder who is still frozen by the actions
     that went just before


     ext desolate dc street  night

     mulder steps out of the car holding the felt envelope
     the wellmanicured man stands with a sober intense
     look

                            wellmanicured man
                      with quiet force
               you have precious little time what
               ive given you the alien colonists
               have no idea exists you hold in your
               hand the power to end the project

                            mulder
               how

                            wellmanicured man
               the vaccine you hold is the only
               defense against the virus its
               introduction into an alien environment
               may have the power to destroy the
               delicate plans weve so assiduously
               protected for the last fifty years
                      beat
               or it may not

                            mulder
               what alien environment

                            wellmanicured man
               find agent scully save her only her
               science can save the future

                            mulder
               what about you

                            wellmanicured man
               my life is over
                      beat
               go

     mulder stands speechless for a moment until the wmm
     points the weapon hes still holding at him

                            wellmanicured man
               go now

     and mulder does moving away from the car looking back
     over his shoulder as the wellmanicured man gets back
     into the limousine closes the door a moment later
     the car explodes into flames knocking mulder to the
     ground

     angle on mulder

     the felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp its
     contents loosed from inside a piece of paper with
     coordinates on it and an ampule and syringe

     mulder gets up looks back then he picks up the
     envelope and its contents  and begins to run running
     as fast as he can go until far down the block he
     disappears

     as the screen dissolves to whiteness  under which we
     hear an ominous low end dolby thx big screen rumble the
     same sound that opened our story

     then there is movement as the curvilinear line of a
     horizon becomes visible bisecting the screen between
     the white of the earth and the white of the sky we
     are


     ext pole of inaccessibility  antarctica

     across the expanse of whiteness a dark image appears on
     the long flat horizon moving toward us as a legend
     appears to establish

     closer on a snow tractor

     crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed
     insect


     int snow tractor

     agent mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed
     cabin several days growth on his face dressed in
     thick bundled outerwear he maneuvers the vehicle to a
     stop reaching for a handheld gps monitor to check his
     position catching his breath for a moment  all
     movement is exertion in this climate mulder stares hard
     out the front window the wipers beating time but there
     is nothing out there but whiteness he wipes the fog
     from a side window with his gloved hand seeing nothing
     but more whiteness checking the gps device again then
     reaching for the door latch

     resume wide exterior

     agent mulder exits the vehicle hopping down onto the
     snowscape crust setting out on foot with the gps device
     held before him in this forbidding environment he might
     as well be taking a space walk  without the security
     of a lifeline which is the impression we get as his
     tiny figure trudges across the ice increasing the
     distance between himself and the snow tractor

     moving with mulder

     up a gentle grade the snow tractor now behind him
     moving into tight fg where he stops seeing something
     now which allows him to pocket the gps device dropping
     instinctively to his knees so as to avoid being seen
     by

     mulders pov

     in the distance is an ice station a row of
     interconnecting white dome tents whose design is now
     familiar to us there are what look like snow tractors
     and other snow vehicles parked alongside the
     structures

     resume mulder

     pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his
     deep jacket pockets training them on

     the ice station  bino matte

     panning across the domes and vehicles where there is no
     sign of personnel  until mulder pans off the building
     finding in his field glasses an approaching snow
     tractor moving across the landscape toward the ice
     station when it pulls to a stop a man exits out of one
     of the domes the cigarette smoking man moving to the
     vehicle and getting in

     the vehicle reverses now transporting the csm back
     away from the ice station

     close on mulder

     taking the field glasses away from his eyes the
     excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing
     which has become harder and shallower mulder rises
     beginning to move the still great distance between
     himself and the ice station

                                             cut to


     wide on screen

     mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the
     domed tents


     low angle on mulders feet

     moving cautiously and with effort on the snowscape
     crust camera rising up to mulders face determined and
     watchful


     following mulder

     the ice station still several hundred yards in the

     somewhat reminiscent of stevie at the beginning of the
     picture wincing through the pain until he turns over
     regaining his wits and his bearings

     new angle

     mulder has fallen on a hard narrow metallic structure
     its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice
     its encased in the bubble has been created by air
     coming out of vents in the structure carving out
     corresponding patterns in the ceiling softening the ice
     and snow above

     closer on mulder

     rising to his knees the air from one of these vents
     blowing onto his face pulling off the hood of his
     jacket looking deep into the vent which is open
     ungrated

     and big enough for a man to crawl into which after
     considering the hole hes fallen through high above him
     is really mulders only choice

     mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka
     snicks it on its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths
     of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor

     new angle on mulder

     training the light down the corridor which curves away
     in both directions then pointing it at something right
     in front of his nose something that gives him a start

     reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the
     lith finding a man frozen in ice naked his eyes
     staring into some longforgotten distance his hair is
     dark his flat features familiar to us he is the
     prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie
     his flesh has the opaque seethrough quality that weve
     seen before inside of which frozen along with the man
     is an embryonic creature

     pulling himself to his feet beholding the space before

     them the sound deafening

     new angle over mulder and scully

     pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind
     them in the distance the ice station can be seen through
     the atmosphere of condensed air when suddenly the ice
     beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away
     caving in to the center of the radius which is what
     begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that
     spreads out to where mulder and scully are standing
     causing mulder to realize

                            mulder
                      over the din
               weve got to run

     she is weak but is able to find her footing dragged
     behind mulder as the ice behind them begins to break
     away falling down into an everexpanding center and
     sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the
     superheated surface below


     wide on scene

     mulder and scully running at camera just ahead of the
     collapsing center the mass of ice around them beginning
     to break up steam vents erupting instantaneously
     everywhere

                                             cut to


     high angle on scene

     a black dome is becoming visible through the giant
     circle of steam in the everwidening center hole that
     mulder and scully are running from which is chasing
     them to the edge of the radius

                                             cut to


     angle following mulder and scully

     as mulder struggles to pull scully fast enough to
     outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind
     them large chunks falling and bouncing off the
     superheated surface below blown back up like water
     being dropped onto a hot skillet

                                             cut to


     extremely high and wide

     the agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning
     ice and steam as it cascades away in three hundred and
     sixty degrees from here the deafening sound if absorbed
     into the vastness tricking us of the reality of the
     massive movement of frozen material down below

                                             cut to


     angle leading mulder and scully

     as scully loses her footing falling to the ground
     mulder dragging her back up to her feet though
     maintaining forward momentum while behind them the
     thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice
     is moving in on them

     and then suddenly  mulder and scully are gone

     the radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a
     few feet beyond where they disappeared the violent
     upheaval of snow abating but slightly beat beat

     then the agents appear again thrust upward by a rising
     black precipice which catapults them off its leading
     edge as they fall the distance to the sheet of ice
     below

                                             cut to


     low angle on ice sheet

     where the agents hit hard on the ice sheet the rain of
     ice chunks pounding all around them as the monolithic
     wall of the craft continues to rise

     mulder trying to get to scully in this hail of debris
     which he shields his face from


     wide on leading edge

     rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to
     increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it
     carried until the bottom of the edge of the wall
     appears lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater
     that held it

                                             cut to


     extreme high wide angle on space ship

     where now we see the scope and shape of the ship which
     is breathtaking the domed center sloping off to a
     gentle gradient which is the surface that mulder and
     scully were running on the ship is now slowly rotating
     as it moves upward in a gently rising hover

     mulder and scully are on the ice sheet below


     resume mulder and scully

     scully face down on the ice mulder lifting his head
     when the heavy shadow of the ship comes over them
     looking up from this position to see

     the space ship

     moving slowly laterally just overhead thunderously
     rumbling the dark detail of its underside visible in
     this angle as it continues to rise the shadow passing
     over mulder and scully

                                             cut to


     new angle over mulder and scully

     scully is still face down on the ice as mulder watches
     the ships shadow cast over mulders snowcat which is
     still parked in the distance moving up and off

     the ship continues up into the antarctic sky where it
     rises toward the sky where it begins to get whitehot
     transforming itself into pure energy it is visible for
     several moments during transformation then it
     disappears completely as it does the rumble which
     dopplers across the white barren landscape then it is
     gone


     mulder

     watches this then lays his head down on scullys back
     he is spent at the brink of complete exhaustion his
     whole body heaving but now starting to shiver and to
     lose consciousness

     scullys body is motionless beneath him for a moment we
     might believe that this is the way it might end out
     here on the ice with mulder and scully freezing to
     death a chill wind blows off the antarctic plain the
     same low rumble the only taint of silence in vastness
     of this literal end of the world

     then scully coughs  the same hoarse cough shes
     alive struggling to consciousness her head lifting
     slightly turning to camera her eyes blink open and she
     coughs again feeling mulders weight on top of her
     unaware of his condition or even where she is

                            scully
                      weakly
               mulder

     there is no answer scully struggling to pull herself
     out from under the weight of his body rolling over so
     that her face is opposite mulders now seeing that he
     has lost consciousness finding the strength to roll him
     over so that she can cradle him and warm him

     high wide angle on this scene

     with the snowcat a short distance away mulder and
     scully in each others arms the way it should end

     fade to black

     silence longer than we would like long enough to make
     us nervous then certain then angry thenwe fade up
     a prelap of the sound of a crackling fire

               before me in light of the narrative
               im now hearing


     int fbi office of professional review  day

     jana cassidy sits at the head of the desk just as when
     we first met her

     she is flanked by the other members of the review board
     including ad skinner who sits at the end of the
     table

     cassidy flips through a file shes referred to before
     she continues looking up with consternation as she
     resumes

                            cassidy
                my official report is incomplete
               pending these new facts im being
               asked to reconcile agent scully

     agent scully

     sitting where she last sat at the small table the seat
     next to her conspicuously empty her face bears the
     signs of slight frostbite somewhat healed her
     expression is even her attitude composed but her eyes
     are filled of dark restrained defiance

                            cassidy
               while there is direct evidence now
               that a federal agent may have been
               involved in the bombing the other
               events youve laid down here seem too
               incredible on their own and quite
               frankly implausible in their
               connection

     panning the other board members  curious bemused like
     cassidy skinner shifts uncomfortably

                            scully
               what is it you find incredible

                            cassidy
               wellwhere would you like me to
               start antarctica is a long way from
               dallas agent scully i cant very
               well submit a report to the attorney
               general that alleges the links youve
               made here bees and corn crops do not
               quite fall under the rubric of
               domestic terrorism

                            scully
               no they dont

                            cassidy
               most of what i find in here is lacking
               a coherent picture of an organization
               with an attributable motive i realize
               youre very lucky to be alive agent
               scully the ordeal youve endured has
               clearly affected you  though the
               holes in your account leave this panel
               with little choice but to delete these
               references from our final report to
               the justice department until which
               time hard evidence becomes available
               that would give us cause to pursue
               such an investigation

     scully has her hand in her coat pocket now moving
     around the table and approaching cassidy removing
     something which she puts on the desk in front of her a
     small vial

                            scully
               i dont believe the fbi currently has
               an investigation unit qualified to
               pursue the evidence in hand

     cassidy picks up the vial studying the contents of this
     vial the dead bee that stung scully studying it as
     scully turns and moves to the door without permission
     no further adieu

     angle to include ad skinner

     watching scully exit

               please ask agent scully to come back
               to this hearing were not quite

     we are just above the treetops the capitol dome is in
     the far distance camera craning down to find mulder
     sitting by himself on a park bench we are wide there
     is no one else around

     until the cigarette smoking man appears walking through
     the otherwise deserted park joining mulder on the park
     bench

     closer on mulder the cigarette smoking man

     they do not speak for several moments a quite tension
     as the csm lights up a trademark smoke inhaling
     exhaling then

     watches from the distance their eyes meet an unspoken
     restored bond exchanged in this moment before mulder
     takes scully by the arm leads her off leaving the csm

     tracking low with a pair of feet

     the wearer of them sporting peasant sandals we realize
     shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy
     ground that the foliage in the near bg is corn and
     that the person we are tracking with is passing row
     after row of stalks

     camera rising as it tracks

     revealing a tunisian man dressed in peasant clothes he
     is carrying a piece of paper moving with hasty purpose
     stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn
     where conrad strughold is coming toward him making his
     way between rows of stalks the peasant waits patiently
     as strughold approaches handing him the piece of
     paper

     strughold reads it his otherwise steely countenance
     reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight
     narrowing of his eyes

     he looks up at the peasant and says something to him in
     tunisian arabic said as command which causes the
     peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came

     strughold stands for a moment then crumples the paper
     slightly and drops it moving off down the same corn row
     in which he approached

     camera dropping to the ground where we find the paper on
     which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we
     cannot read the words xfiles reopened stop please
     advise stop

     camera rising now rising up past the stalks where we
     can still see strughold walking rising up and up to
     reveal acres and acres of corn many times more than we
     had seen previously stretched out across the tunisian
     desert ending only where three white domes stand on the
     distant horizon
