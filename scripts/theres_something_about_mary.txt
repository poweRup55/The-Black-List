                         can find some cookies

               as magda starts to go through the cupboards

               int marys family room  same

               a panicked healy is giving the little mutt mouthtomouth 
               now

               then back to the heart the mouth the heart the mouth

                                     healy
                              quietly desperately 
                              to puffy
                         come on man stay away from the 
                         light

               healy resumes blowing into the dogs snout pumping his chest 
               with no results desperate he picks up the cheese knife and 
               quickly slices the wires on two table lamps

               healy grabs the two wires and touches them together like a 
               defibrillator on the little poochs chest

               zzzzztttttt  the dog bounces a couple feet off the couch 
               as sparks fly

               healy takes his pulse again nothing he zaps him once more 
               with the live wires

               zzzzzttttt  still nothing healy gets to his feet and peeks 
               into the kitchen when he turns his back we see puffy ignite 
               in flames

               when healy turns back hes horrified at what he sees he 
               grabs a vase of flowers and pours the water on the burning 
               dog

               with this puffy flinches and comes to gasping for air

                                     magda
                         all i had was some funny bones  
                         how does that sound honey

               healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket 
               as magda enters the room followed by mary

                                     healy

                         not to concern yourself with the 
                         pieces  look at the building in 
                         its totalitarianism

               mary gives him a look suddenly healy draws a couple of

               as ted sits back down the detectives just stare at him 
               finally ted thinks he gets it

                         first tell us why you did it

                         i dont know i guess it just 
                         seems that women today are more 
                         impressed by the mighty buck than by 
                         some schmo who spent the last 
                         seventeen years scraping by on peace 
                         corp wages

               the girls all seem moved by this

               int healys car  night

               healy is parked out front the phone in one hand a script 
               in the other as he listens to sully read the following words

                                     sully vo
                         but jesus pat if shes as special 
                         as you say shes going to want to 
                         hear about the things you did

                                     healy
                              dismissing this
                         ahh

               int sullys apartment  same

               a disheveled and wiredlooking sully is sitting on the couch 
               in his underwear reading from the same script theres coke 
               on the table dog shit on the floor and flies everywhere

               in the bg we see the great dane sniffing at his empty bowl 
               and the boa constrictor sprawled out on the floor barely 
               moving

                                     sully
                              reading
                         come on you could tell her about 
                         the irrigation ditches you dug in 
                         sudan the orphan babies who cried 
                         in your arms in romania
                              does a line of blow
                         the hope you gave freddie the 
                         leper in calcutta

               suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and starts 
               to eat it

               back on mary and friends

                                     joannie
                              welling up

               magda folds her arms and gloats

               int healys car  night

                                     healy

                         honest to goodness high

               just then healy sees a bug on the car window and 
               instinctively squashes it

               on sully  he has the phone wedged between his cheek and 
               shoulder as he struggles with the dog to get the script

               sully still cant retrieve the script nor his next line

                                     sully

               on healy  he stares at the phone horrified

                                     healy vo

                         illnesses in thirdworld countries

               on mary and friends  as they let out a sigh

                                     healy

                         i gotta go

               on sully  as he hangs up the phone and does another line 
               we pan to the great dane hal as he looks around for something 
               anything to eat he sniffs at a sock then a beer bottle 
               before finally setting his sights on the boa constrictor 
               bill bill glances the dogs way nervously senses trouble 
               and wiggles his way into another room as hal takes off after 
               the snake we

                                                                    cut to

               int marys hallway  night

               healy starts to knock on marys door but before he can 
               the door suddenly swings open revealing a beaming mary

                                     healy
                              startled
                         oh mary look theres something i 
                         have to tell you im not

               before he can finish mary steps forward and their mouths 
               meet in a passionate kiss

                                                               dissolve to

               montage of mary and healy courting

                as mary watches healy plays touch football with warren 
               and a few of his friends healy catches a pass then trying 
               a little too hard to impress mary he delivers a forearm 
               shiver to his defender and gives warren a vicious straight
               arm when healy gets into the end zone he spikes the ball 
               and starts talking trash to another defender

                healy shows up at marys door sporting a set of oversized 
               incrediblywhite capped teeth he gives her a big horse smile 
               and she reacts uncertainly

                healy is in marys apartment as mary finishes dressing 
               for a night on the town

                                     mary
                         all set

                                     healy
                         you look great
                              beat
                         hey mare do i have a rip in the 
                         back of these pants

               when she puts her head close to inspect his pants he lets 
               fly a thunderous fart she pulls her head away repulsed 
               but healy just laughs

                mary and and the horsetoothed healy are having dinner in 
               a romantic restaurant as he eats he tells an animated story 
               but hes having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of 
               food are spraying out of his mouth with every word mary has 
               to bob and weave to avoid being covered with debris

                healy and warren are playing monopoly when warren isnt 
               looking healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on boardwalk 
               in the bg we see one of warrens buddies fall out of a 
               palm tree

                                                               dissolve to

               ext marys apartment  day

               a lovesick healy is mauling mary out on the sidewalk in front 
               while warren stands off to the side listening to a walkman

               reverse angle reveals a devastated ted and dom watching this

               healy makes a beep sound and then holds his breath

               on mary  she stares at the phone feeling cornered

                                     mary

               on healy  he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun 
               then he sits back and smugly listens to her dial the phone 
               but then he hears something that concerns him  a knock on 
               the door and the dog yapping

               on mary  she puts down the phone and answers the door 
               its tucker the architect

                              stunned

                              sheet
                         after a short stint as a petty thief 
                         patrick r healy graduated to armed 
                         robbery by the age of fourteen at 
                         sixteen he committed his first murder  
                         a pretty teachers aid named molly 
                         pettygrove he was incarcerated until 
                         age twentytwo when despite a grim 
                         psychological profile the state was 
                         forced to release him in his mid
                         twenties and again in his early 
                         thirties he was suspected of homicides 
                         in the states of utah and washington  
                         unfortunately the bodies were so 
                         badly decomposed that there wasnt 
                         enough evidence to hold him and on 
                         and on and so forth and so on

               we hear the television and see magda dozing on the couch 
               with a watery cocktail in her hand and the dog puffy at her 
               feet

               suddenly a doggie treat flies through the window landing on 
               the rug puffy snaps to attention and approaches the treat 
               he sniffs it then gobbles it up another doggie treat lands 
               beside him and he eats that too then another

                         magda what are you doing

               magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a banging sound coupled 
               with the os muffled yapping of puffy

                         yeah sure

               ted walks down the hall following the yapping and banging 
               sound until he comes to the bathroom door the yapping is 
               much louder now and he notices something that makes him 
               hesitate

               teds pov  the bottom part of the door is being dented 
               outward from the force of something battering it from within

                                     ted
                              calling out

               ted thinks about this shrugs and opens the door

               baring his teeth like a rottweiler puffy springs at teds 
               jugular

               int marys living room  continuous

               ted stumbles back into the living room with the hoppedup 
               dog on his face he knocks over a lamp tumbles onto the 
               floor and fights for his life

               mary and magda scream as ted and puffy mix it up on the floor 
               ted tries to crawl toward the door but puffy grabs the cuff 
               of his pants

               door pov of teds anguished face as he gets pulled back into 
               the room

               ted manages to get the dog in a headlock

                                     magda
                         stop it youre hurting him

                              out of breath
                         tell him to calm down

               puffy gets a piece of teds wrist and ted screams and drops 
               him

               both man and toy poodle spring to their feet

               they start circling one another puffy leaps at ted and ted 
               smacks him into a wall unfazed the dog gets a running start 
               and leaps at teds neck

                                     mary
                         ted

               ted stops and looks across the street at her he wipes his 
               eyes hopeful

               they remain across the street from one another

                         did you mean what you said back there

                         really

               the beaming ted starts walking across the street suddenly a 
               bus whizzes by and smacks ted broadside he bounces around 
               under the bus like a rag doll then finally squirts out the 
               back end and tumbles to a limp stop

               mary screams and runs toward the body as a crowd begins to 
               gather

                                     mary
                         ted no no

               she starts giving him cpr somebody covers him with a blanket

               just then another car whizzes over his feet like speedbumps 
               the crowd winces

                                     mary
                         somebody hold up traffic
                              beat
                         come on ted come on tell me youre 
                         going to be okay

               then ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open

                                     ted
                         mary oh mary i love you

               marys smile is as bright as the light from heaven

                                     mary
                         i love you too ted
                              beat
                         i think i always have

               as the two lovebirds kiss a lady calls out

                                     lady
                         over here i found his foot it was 
                         in the storm drain

               on the lady as she holds up a severed foot in a cloth

                                     mary
                         all right everyone lets fan out 
                         and look for the penis

               as ted reacts to this we pull up up up and

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
