                         our analysis at npic indicates the 
                         soviet union has followed its 
                         conventional weapons buildup in 
                         cuba with the introduction of surface

                         missiles or mrbms our official 
                         estimate at this time is that this 
                         missile system is the ss4 sandal 
                         we do not believe these missiles are

                         i have to stress that there may be 
                         more missiles that we dont know 
                         about we need more u2 coverage

               kenny lets out his breath he catches bobbys eye this is 
               unbelievable

                                     the president
                         is there any indication  anything 
                         at all  that suggests they intend 
                         to use these missiles in some sort 
                         of first strike

                         not at present sir but i think the 
                         prudent answer is we dont know

                                     the president
                         do we have any sort of intelligence 
                         from cia on what khruschev is 
                         thinking

                                     general carter
                         no mr president we dont we just 
                         dont know whats happening inside 
                         the kremlin at that level

                                     bobby
                         they lied to us two weeks ago 
                         dobrynin told me to my face khurschev 
                         had no intention of putting missiles 
                         into cuba they said themselves 
                         this is our backyard

               theres angry agreement the president cuts it off

                                     the president
                         gentlemen i want first reactions 
                         assuming for a moment khruschev has 
                         not gone off the deep end and intends 
                         to start world war three what are

                                     rusk
                         mr president i believe my team is 
                         in agreement if we permit the 
                         introduction of nuclear missiles to 
                         a soviet satellite nation in our 
                         hemisphere the diplomatic 
                         consequences will be too terrible to 
                         contemplate the russians are trying 
                         to show the world they can do whatever 
                         they want wherever they want and 
                         were powerless to stop them if 
                         they succeed

                                     bobby
                         it will be munich all over again

                                     rusk
                         appeasement only makes the aggressor 
                         more aggressive confidence in our 
                         security commitments around the world 
                         will falter allies will become unsure 
                         in the face of soviet pressure and 
                         the soviets will be emboldened to 
                         push us even harder we must remove 
                         the missiles one way or another it 
                         seems to me the options are either 
                         to build up the crisis til they 
                         give in or we hit them an air 
                         strike

               theres silence at the table some nods understanding

                         weve worked up several military 
                         scenarios before i ask general taylor 
                         to lead us through the various 
                         options id like for us to adopt a 
                         rule if we are going to strike we 
                         must agree now that we will do it 
                         before the missiles become 
                         operational because once they are 
                         i dont think we can guarantee getting 
                         them all before at least some are 
                         launched

                         decide to act theres a good chance 
                         well end up in a general war

               the room falls silent the president leans back in his chair 
               studying the circle of men around the table weighing them

               kenny and the others watch him in silence a long dramatic 
               pause a course that will change history is about to be 
               chosen the president leans forward folds his hands on the 
               table fated grave

                                     the president
                         its clear we cannot permit soviet 
                         nuclear missiles in cuba we must 
                         get those missiles out

               kenny and bobby follow the president down a path through the

                                     the president
                         i dont think its going to matter 
                         what khruschevs intentions are i 
                         tell you right now i dont see 
                         any way around hitting them

               a long moment of silence as they move along again

                                     kenny
                         if we hit em kill a lot of russians 
                         theyll move against berlin they

               over everything its only a couple of steps away steps

                         no choice this is going to cost 
                         lives any way we go do nothing and 
                         it could be 80 million of ours we 
                         have to get rid of those missiles

                         thereve got to be alternatives to

                         so if there are alternatives that

                         scattered across the country for the

                         expanded air strike option
                              beat
                         the problem mr president is that 
                         its a shortterm solution khruschev 
                         can send more missiles next month 
                         the chiefs and i believe we should 
                         follow up the air strikes with the 
                         full version of oplan 316

                         the missiles and we remove castro

                                     general taylor
                         yes sir our best option is to 
                         commence the strikes before the 
                         missiles are operational the invasion

               acheson arches an eyebrow and when he speaks his voice 
               resonates throughout the room powerful smooth hypnotic

                                     acheson
                         mr president you have rightly 
                         dismissed the diplomatic option the 
                         soviet will only tie you down in 
                         negotiation and leave us short of 
                         our goal the removal of the missiles 
                         negotiating will do nothing more 
                         than give them time to make the 
                         missiles operational complicating 
                         the necessary military task we have 
                         at hand

               everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention his 
               presence overshadowing the room oracular

                         for the last fifteen years i have 
                         fought here at this table along side 
                         your predecessors in the struggle 
                         against the soviet gentlemen i do 
                         not wish to seem melodramatic but i 
                         do wish to impress upon you one 
                         observation with all conceivable 
                         sincerity a lesson i have learned 
                         with bitter tears and great sacrifice
                              beat
                         the soviet understands only one 
                         language action it respects only 
                         one word force

               kenny stares at the old man achesons gaze finds his through 
               the cigarette smoke achesons eyes travel to the president

                                     acheson
                         i concur with general taylor i 
                         recommend sir air strikes followed 
                         by invasion perhaps preceded by an 
                         ultimatum to dismantle the missiles 
                         if military necessity permits

               taylor nods vindicated the others murmur their approval

                         then it appears we have three options  
                         number one a surgical air strike 
                         against the missiles themselves 
                         two a larger air strike against 
                         their air defenses along with the 
                         missiles

                         were certainly going to do number 
                         one were going to take out these 
                         missiles so it seems to me we dont 
                         have to wait very long we ought to 
                         at least be making those preparations

               kenny gives bobby a curt nod bobby tilts his head at the 
               president pass the note on to him kenny rises slips the 
               note in front of the president

               the president unfolds the note and we hold on it and his 
               reaction as in the bg out of focus taylor speaks

                                     general taylor
                         yes sir were preparing to implement 
                         all three options though i must 
                         stress again sir there are risks 
                         to the strikes without the followon 
                         invasion

               bundy clears his throat speaks from somewhere down the table

                                     bundy
                         you want to be clear mr president 
                         that we have definitely decided 
                         against a political track

               the president folds the note away glances at bobby a beat 
               the president looks from bobby to acheson

                                     the president
                         dean how does this play out

                                     acheson
                         your first step sir will be to 
                         demand that the soviet withdraw the 
                         missiles within 12 to 24 hours  
                         they will refuse when they do you 
                         will order the strikes followed by 
                         the invasion they will resist but 
                         will be overrun they will retaliate 
                         against a target somewhere else in 
                         the world most likely berlin we 
                         will honor our treaty commitments 
                         and resist them there defeating 
                         them per our plans

                                     the president
                         those plans call for the use of 
                         nuclear weapons
                              beat
                         and what is the next step

               acheson sits back in his chair smooths his moustache a 
               dramatic beat and then his ominous pronouncement rings out

                                     acheson
                         hopefully cooler heads will prevail 
                         before we reach the next step

               a chill runs down kennys spine he looks in shock to the 
               president the president remains calm but in place of the 
               fated look the president has had theres a hesitation

               int west wing halls  night

               acheson strides down the hall taylor sweeney carter and 
               bundy swept along behind him bundy is on the defensive the 
               others grim

                                     general taylor
                         if mcnamarad get off the fence

                                     bundy
                         we have time

                                     general carter
                         goddamn it its obvious its the 
                         only option that asshole stevenson 
                         we cant let this drag out or we 
                         lose our shot

                                     bundy
                         bombing them

                                     acheson
                         remember that the kennedys father 
                         was one of the architects of munich 
                         the general is right there is only 
                         one responsible choice here

               bundy just nods taylor grabs a door ahead for acheson

                                     acheson
                         lets pray appeasement doesnt run 
                         in families i fear weakness does

               and the men head into a stairwell going down

               int oval office  night

               grimacing in pain he opens a pill bottle takes two pills 
               out he takes a whiskey in a shot glass from kenny

               resume

               kenny finishes pouring him and bobby a couple of more shots 
               discreetly turning a blind eye to the presidents pain

               the president returns from his desk shirt untucked 
               disheveled back stiff he eases into his rocking chair 
               bobby lies sprawled on the couch kenny sits down they all 
               look at each other a beat something like shock

                                     kenny
                         jesus christ almighty

               they burst out laughing an absurd tension draining moment 
               they shoot their drinks kenny refills

                                     kenny
                         call me irish but i dont believe 
                         in cooler heads prevailing

                                     the president
                         achesons scenario is unacceptable 
                         and he has more experience than 
                         anyone

                                     kenny
                         there is no expert on this subject 
                         no wise old man

               the president stares kenny in the face understanding

                                     the president
                         the thing is achesons right talk 
                         alone wont accomplish anything

               kenny considers the president his face straight as he says

                                     kenny
                         then lets bomb the shit out of them 
                         everyone wants to even you even 
                         me
                              theres a point
                         it sure would feel good

               the president sees what kennys saying itd be an emotional 
               response not necessarily the intelligent one

                                     bobby
                         jack im as conniving as they come 
                         but a sneak attack is just wrong

                                     kenny
                         hes right and things are happening 
                         too fast it smells like the bay of 
                         pigs all over again

               bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table

                                     bobby
                         as if dealing with the russians wasnt 
                         hard enough we gotta worry about 
                         our own house

                                     the president
                         tonight listening to taylor and 
                         acheson i kept seeing burke and 
                         dulles telling me all i had to do 
                         was sign on the dotted line the 
                         invasion would succeed castro would 
                         be gone just like that easy

               the president is rendered mute by a wave of pain kenny and 
               bobby aver their eyes when it passes the president is 
               hushed grave

                                     the president
                         theres something immoral about 
                         abandoning your own judgment

               kenny nods moved the president reaches out for the 
               reconnaissance photos bobbys flipping through bobby hands 
               them to him the president looks them over and when he 
               speaks theres humility and resolve

                                     the president
                         we cant let things get ahead of 
                         themselves weve got to control 
                         what happens were going to do what 
                         we have to make this come out right 
                         excom is our first weapon
                              beat

               int oval office  day

               kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of 
               a debate military uniforms dominate the room general taylor 
               general sweeney and a host of briefing officers

                                     general taylor
                         the situation is worse than we 
                         thought we count 40 missiles now 
                         longer range irbms they can hit 
                         every city in the continental us

               the president stares out the window at the rose garden his 
               back to air force chief of staff general curtis lemay 60 
               beetlebrowed arrogant the archetypal cold war general 
               yet there is something about him his intelligence perhaps 
               that suggests hes playing a role he knows and believes in

               the only other civilians in the room are bobby bundy and 
               mcnamara the pressure from the military is almost physical

                                     lemay
                         mr president as of this moment my 
                         planes are ready to carry out the 
                         air strikes all you have to do is 
                         give me the word sir and my boys 
                         will get those red bastards

               the president continues staring out the window kenny eases 
               over to the desk leans on it arms folded interposing 
               himself between the president and the soldiers bobby joins 
               him sidebyside

                                     the president
                         how long until the army is ready

                                     general taylor
                         weve just begun the mobilization 
                         under cover of a prearranged 
                         exercise sir were looking at 
                         another week and a half mr 
                         president

                                     lemay
                         but you can begin the strikes now 
                         the plans call for an eightday air 
                         campaign itd light a fire under 
                         the armys ass to get in place

               that makes the president turn around stare at lemay

                                     the president
                         general lemay do you truly believe 
                         thats our best course of action

                                     lemay
                         mr president i believe it is the 
                         only course of action american is 
                         in danger those missiles are a threat 
                         to our bomber bases and the safety 
                         of our nuclear deterrent without 
                         our deterrent theres nothing to 
                         keep the enemy from choosing general 
                         nuclear war its our duty our 
                         responsibility to the american people 
                         to take out those missiles and return 
                         stability to the strategic situation 
                         the big red dog is digging in our 
                         back yard and were justified in 
                         shooting him

               taylor steps in softly smoothly good cop to lemays bad

                                     general taylor
                         sir we have a rapidly closing window 
                         of opportunity where we can prevent 
                         those missiles from ever becoming 
                         operational the other options

               he spares a look at mcnamara who watches the fireworks 
               arms folded serious

                                     general taylor
                         do not guarantee the end result 
                         we can guarantee however the more 
                         time that goes by the less reliable 
                         the choice we can offer you becomes

               the president partially defused looks from taylor to 
               mcnamara lemay steps forward softer now sincere

                                     lemay
                         mr president the motto i chose for 
                         sac is peace is our profession  
                         god forbid we find ourselves in a 
                         nuclear exchange but if launched 
                         those missiles in cuba would kill a 
                         lot of americans thats why im 
                         being such a pain in the ass about 
                         destroying them destroying them 
                         immediately hell even mac agrees

               bundy is uncomfortable everyone turns to him he nods kenny 
               realizes hes been coopted by the military mcnamara does 
               too lets out a deep breath the president eyes bundy then 
               paces out from behind his desk walks up to lemay

                                     the president
                         general what will the soviets do 
                         when we attack

                                     lemay
                         nothing

               kenny bobby and the president look at each other unable to 
               believe what they just heard

                                     the president

                                     lemay
                         nothing because the only alternative 
                         open to them is one they cant choose

               his pronouncement hangs there in the air ominous dangerous

                                     the president
                         those arent just missiles well be

                         respond if they killed ours no 
                         they will do something general i

               their staffers

                                     lemay

                         destroy this country if we dont do 
                         something about this

               there are dark looks on the faces of the other officers  
               they agree

               int kennys office  day

               as the meeting next door disperses the president rummages 
               through kennys jacket which hangs on kennys chair kenny

               is looking for

               the crowded busy hallway

                                     salinger

                         theyre planning to shave you bald

               the press corps throngs kennys tiny office pushing and

                         are they going to discuss the military 
                         exercises going on in florida

               kenny doesnt even blink but sorensen does a poorer job at 
               hiding his reaction

                                     kenny

                         relations

               fortunately the conversation is cut short as a dozen 
               flashbulbs suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters 
               crush in on the oval office and reston is swept forward

               kennys pov

               over the reporters the president unsmiling enters the 
               room beside soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko gromyko

               kenny reacts at last the face of the enemy

               int oval office  night

               the camera picks up the darkened windows the meeting has 
               gone long the camera moves past kenny and sorensen standing 
               in the doorway to kennys office finds the president in his

                         so that there should be no 
                         misunderstanding the position of 
                         the united states which has been 
                         made clear by the attorney general 
                         to ambassador dobrynin here i shall 
                         read a sentence from my own statement

                         should missiles or offensive weapons 
                         be placed in cuba it would present 
                         the gravest threat to us national 
                         security

               the president stares at gromyko as the translator finishes 
               translating gromyko sits there enigmatic cold unreadable 
               the translator finishes and gromyko stops him with a gesture 
               so he can answer in his own accented english

                                     gromyko
                         mr president this will never be 
                         done you need not be concerned

               the president hides his fury masterfully and gazing over 
               his glasses asks

                                     the president
                         so i do not misunderstand you there 
                         are no offensive weapons in cuba

               a beat and gromykos response is flat sure steady

                                     gromyko
                         no mr president we have sent

               gromykos head his gaze swings to the presidents desk

               him with bobby rusk rises from his seat formal

                                     rusk
                         mr president our deliberations 
                         have led us to the conclusion that 
                         for the moment a blockade of 
                         offensive weapons to cuba is our 
                         best option but well still need a 
                         strong showing of support from the 
                         organization of american states to 
                         give us an umbrella of legitimacy

               at long last kenny looks at bobby relieved theyve bought 
               time to find a settlement bobby smiles a small smile what 
               were you so worried about

                                     mcnamara
                         a blockade is technically an act of 
                         war therefore we recommend calling 
                         the action a quarantine

                         a quarantine prevents more missiles 
                         from reaching cuba but it doesnt 
                         remove the ones already there it 
                         gives the soviets a chance to pull 
                         back without war if they refuse to 
                         remove the missiles before theyre 
                         operational we retain the option to 
                         strike or invade

                                     bobby
                         we believe that a surprise attack 
                         would be counter to what the united 
                         states stands for we believe that 
                         an attack leaves us no room for 
                         maneuver and the inevitable soviet 
                         response will force us into a war we 
                         do not want a war that this time 
                         will really end all war

                         mr president there are still those 
                         of us who believe we should proceed 
                         with the strikes with the blockade 
                         we lose strategic surprise and we 
                         run the risk of a first strike if 
                         the soviets decide they have to use 
                         the missiles or lose them

               the president gazes from one expectant face to another but 
               he himself remains unreadable

               adlai clears his throat everyone looks over at him he stares 
               down at his clasped hands for a beat hes anguished about 
               what hes going to say

                                     adlai
                         there is a third option with either 
                         course we undertake the risk of 
                         nuclear war it seems to me maybe 
                         one of us in here should be a coward

               he smiles weakly but gets no response from anyone

                                     adlai
                         so i guess ill be our third choice 
                         is to cut a deal we trade guantanamo 
                         and our missiles in turkey get them 
                         to pull their missiles out we employ 
                         a back channel attribute the idea 
                         to u thant u thant then raises it

                         this is a setup the chiefs want to 
                         go in its the only way they can 
                         redeem themselves for the bay of 
                         pigs they have to go in and they

                         and one of our planes gets knocked 
                         down or one of the ships wont stop 
                         for inspection the chiefs will have 
                         us by the balls and will force us to 
                         start shooting they want a war and

                         something about it

               the president understands he shakes his head paces away

                                     kenny
                         maybe its harder for them to say it 
                         than they let on at the very least 
                         they believe its in our best 
                         interest and at the end of the day 
                         they may end up being right

               the president turns away considers then turns back

                         mcnamaras on his way back here now 
                         we need to pick the right ship no 
                         subs no armed boarding parties 
                         either we need a little more time 
                         to figure this one out

                                     kenny
                         then lets move the quarantine line

               its a simple suggestion the president considers him a beat 
               and then mcnamara emerges from the white house heads for 
               them the three friends assume their more reserved political 
               faces as he comes up

                                     mcnamara
                         mr president bobby kenny the 
                         essex battle group has the gagarin 
                         kimovsk and the sub escort under 
                         their thumb weve got a few hours 
                         now before we need to worry about 
                         any more flashpoints on the line
                              beat
                         we could use a few more hours i 
                         think we should consider moving the 
                         quarantine line back to 500 miles

               bobby and the president look at kenny like hes some kind of

                         escalation which i had no wish to 
                         signal and which i did not approve

               but taylor knows this very well and the way hes suffering

               a godlike view of the flag plot covered with hundreds of 
               ships planes and markings

               mcnamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols 
               living men behind each one each tangle of red and blue 
               symbols a powderkeg a godlike view indeed and it is far 
               more than any one mere man could keep control of and he

               and not only that in his bleary sleepdeprived fog he 
               begins to understand something happening down there

               the camera moves over the enormous map over the scrolling 
               cryptic numerology the buzz of radio communications bleeds 
               in from the background the overhead platform swivels on its 
               motor like the vast arm of some fatewriting god as the 
               watch officer on it updates the movements of the ships

               mcnamara stares at the verge of grasping something through 
               the doorcrack of genius he has the glimpse of some grander 
               thing some grander design

                         get out of our way mr secretary 
                         the navy has been running blockades 
                         since the days of john paul jones

               mcnamara turns back and all trepidation embarrassment 
               hesitation are gone he coldly appraises anderson

                                     mcnamara
                         i believe the president made it clear 
                         that there would be no firing on 
                         ships without his express permission

                                     admiral anderson
                         with all due respect mr secretary 
                         we were not firing on the ship firing 
                         on a ship means attacking the ship 
                         we were not attacking the ship we 
                         were firing over it

                                     mcnamara
                         this was not the presidents intention 
                         when he gave that order what if the 
                         soviets dont see the distention 
                         what if they make the same mistake i 
                         just did
                              beat
                         there will be no firing anything 
                         near any soviet ships without my 
                         express permission is that 
                         understood admiral

                                     admiral anderson

                         instructions when ordered to by the 
                         president

                                     mcnamara
                         this isnt a blockade

               mcnamara trembling with anger awe whirls to anderson  
               and his burgeoning insight is born  clear hard and cold

                                     mcnamara
                         this all this is language a new

                         president kennedy communicating with 
                         secretary khruschev

               mcnamara jabs his finger out at the plot and 

                the camera races down tracking over it across the vast 
               ebb and flow of information the delicate ballet of symbols 
               and numerology this language of steel and human life

                         i think this may be our first 
                         real message from khruschev

                                     mccone
                         the alternative mr president is 
                         that this could be a trap

                                     kenny
                         dangle a settlement tie us down in

                         why else would they approach us in 
                         this way its deniable the soviets 
                         have done nothing but lie to us 
                         this could be more of the same

                                     kenny
                         that may be why khruschevs 
                         introducing this guy weve been 
                         burned by his usual players in the

                         that may be what they want us to 
                         think

                         the truth is mr president we dont 
                         even really know whom fomin speaks 
                         for it could be khruschev it could 
                         be some faction in the politburo or 
                         the kgb itself we just dont know

               he is in his boredom a spys spy

                                     scali
                         i am instructed to tell you that the 
                         american government would respond 
                         favorably to an offer along the lines 
                         you have discussed if this solution 
                         were raised at the un by ambassador 
                         zorin he would find a favorable 
                         reply from ambassador stevenson

                                     fomin
                         so i understand you correctly if 
                         the missiles in cuba were dismantled 
                         returned to the soviet union and a 
                         guarantee was made not to reintroduce 
                         them the united states would be 
                         prepared to guarantee that it would 
                         never invade cuba

                                     scali
                         that is correct

                                     fomin
                         this is from the highest authority

                                     scali

                         there are two conditions the un 
                         must be allowed to inspect the removal 
                         of the missiles

                                     fomin
                         and of course the un must be 
                         allowed to observe the redeployment 
                         of forces from the american southeast

               scali demurs he has no instructions on this count

                                     fomin
                         and the second condition

                                     scali
                         time is of the essence

               from a cluster of folding metal chairs kenny bobby rusk 
               and sorensen watch a teletype hammer out the message as it 
               comes off the wire its painfully slow like watching a bad 
               typist type a manuscript ten pages of this is an eternity  
               to top it off its in russian a translator reads it off 
               word by word to a transcriber

                                     translator
                         two of us pull on

               int cabinet room  night

               kenny slams a page of khruschevs letter on the table he 
               jabs his finger at it excom listens intent

                                     kenny
                         its ten pages of sentimental fluff 
                         but hes saying right here hell 
                         remove the missiles in return for a 
                         noinvasion pledge it looks like 
                         fomins overture was genuine

               the president turns to mccone

                                     mccone
                         our early analysis says this was 
                         probably written by khruschev himself  
                         its a first draft and shows no 
                         signs of being polished by the foreign 
                         ministry in fact it probably hasnt 
                         been approved by the politburo they 
                         wouldnt have let the emotionalism 
                         go by the analysts say it was written 
                         by someone under considerable stress

               excom chuckles

                                     the president
                         glad to hear were not alone

               the president eyes the excom members one by one an incipient 
               smile on his face

                                     the president
                         well gentlemen i wasnt planning 
                         on invading cuba anyway i think we 
                         can live with the terms of this deal

               there are mostly nods of assent big smiles around the table 
               except from  mccone and taylor the president takes his copy 
               of the letter flips through it he shakes his head almost 
               unable to believe that khruschev has given in a long beat

                                     the president
                         ted i want you to draft our

               a long black car stops at the end of kennys driveway the 
               door opens and kenny steps out he says an inaudible 
               goodnight to the driver and the car pulls off he turns 
               facing the white twostory house with the neat front yard 
               the lights out and he smiles home at last

               ext odonnell patio  night

               a screen door squeaks open kenny steps out into the darkness 
               of the back yard and there in her robe sitting startled 
               on a lawn chair lit only by the dim glow of the kitchen 
               window is helen kenny stands there tired his coat slung 
               over his shoulder

                                     kenny
                         hi

               helen rises her own careworn face turned to his for a 
               silent moment they gaze at each other searching in the lines 
               of each others face for the changes of a long separation  
               they see them but theyve been married a long time and the 
               awkwardness passes

                                     helen
                         hi odonnell you look old

               kenny drops his coat on a table as helen comes up and folds 
               herself into his arms

                                     helen
                         this jobs going to kill you if i 
                         dont first

               they kiss comfortable but not too long and he lets her 
               go she looks at him again sees hes suppressing a smile

                                     helen
                         if youre home it means either jack 
                         and bobby have finally figured out

                         just a little while ago in a letter 
                         to the president i think weve won

                         they want us to take our missiles 
                         out of turkey along with the no 
                         invasion pledge it looks like fomin 
                         was a ploy after all and they were 
                         just stalling for time

               kenny is stunned

                                     bobby
                         it gets worse

               kenny gives bobby a sharp look as they enter 

               int cabinet room  continuous

               the president in shirtsleeves no tie glances up at kenny 
               as he and bobby enter kenny can only bear his look for a 
               second he blew the call on fomin but the president is 
               clearly relieved to see him gives him a faint smile half 
               of excom including mcnamara mccone rusk and taylor barely 
               notice them as theyre already there arguing

               kenny sits down hurriedly shucks off his coat as he joins 
               the conversation in midstream

                                     mccone
                         my specialists are in agreement 
                         this mornings letter is not 
                         khruschev last nights letter was
                              beat
                         the evidence supports only one 
                         conclusion there has been a coup 
                         and khruschev was replaced overnight

                                     kenny
                         jesus christ

               bobby gives him a look told you things got worse

                                     the president
                         dean

                                     rusk
                         it doesnt necessarily mean theres 
                         been a coup khruschevs name is 
                         signed to the letter

                                     mcnamara
                         aw come on dean

                                     rusk
                         but at the very least it does 
                         suggest hes been coopted by hard 
                         line elements

                                     mcnamara
                         which at the end of the day is the 
                         same thing as a coup a puppet 
                         khruschev and a hardline soviet 
                         government pulling the strings no 
                         deal and the missiles are almost 
                         operational

               bitter silence they all look to the president imminent 
               victory has turned to ashes the president studies his own 
               folded hands ball and thompson enter take seats one by 
               one throughout the scene other excom members join the group

                                     the president
                         you know the problem we have is 
                         that this is latest offer of theirs 
                         will seem reasonable to everyone we 
                         remove our missiles they remove 
                         theirs our jupiters were scheduled 
                         for removal anyway theyre obsolete 
                         after all

               kenny shakes his head in mute anger mcnamara and rusk seem 
               to sense the presidents feelings too

                         mr president agreeing to such a 
                         trade would be tantamount to paying 
                         ransom theyll put a gun to our 
                         head again and expect us to pay 
                         again

               kenny looks the president in the eye

                                     kenny
                         we cant sell out one of our friends 
                         for our own safety nato wouldnt 
                         trust us anymore and theyd be right 
                         not to

               the president sighs in the face of the stern advice he nods 
               expecting as much bobby still cant look at anyone

                                     the president
                         so which one of you geniuses can 
                         tell me how to explain ourselves to 
                         the world how do we work with them 
                         if theres been a hardline coup

                                     general taylor
                         mr president there is another 
                         possibility we havent considered 
                         this may not be a coup at all

               everyone of kennys instincts jumps his head snaps up to 
               listen to taylor taylor pauses

                                     general taylor
                         its possible that the backchannel 
                         overture last nights letter and 
                         this letter today along with 
                         everything the soviets have said all 
                         along is nothing more than a lie  
                         disinformation

                         action

               kenny hears the fatalism in mcnamaras voice a long beat 
               everyone stares at mcnamara

                         i hate to say it but if i had to 
                         bet id bet max is right what if 
                         they have no intention of honoring 
                         this deal either then tomorrow 
                         they add another condition meanwhile 
                         the quarantine isnt working and 
                         theyre continuing to work on the

                         i think we have to consider issuing 
                         warning orders for our forces

               they were so close last night and suddenly lundahl and 
               lemay enter the room with the days briefing boards

               lundahl stands there at the end of the table gray he almost 
               cant say it cant look the president in the face

                                     lundahl
                         this mornings photography is in it 
                         appears the soviets have commenced a 
                         crash program to ready the missiles

               the missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing 
               equipment its an armed camp with missiles fuel trailers 
               erectors spaced every few hundred yards missile technicians

                         the first missiles became operational 
                         last night

               with a barrage of shouted orders in russian and a whine of 
               the erectors engines the missile begins to rise

                                     lundahl
                         we expect theyll all be operational 
                         in 36 hours monday morning

                         then were out of time we have to

                                     lundahl
                         that may not be as easy as we thought 
                         either weve gotten confirmation 
                         that the soviets have also deployed 
                         battlefield nuclear weapons to cuba

               a pall falls over the room as lemay explains

                         our capability to get all the missiles 
                         has eroded during our delay with the 
                         quarantine the good news is that 
                         for the moment we know where the 
                         frogs are and we can target them 
                         too but the longer we wait the 
                         hard its going to get

               they all look to the president kenny stares in a private 
               hell blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know

               in that shocked silence each man grapples with failure the 
               best and the brightest could not prevent what must come next

                                     the president
                         then we have no choice
                              to taylor
                         general issue the warning orders to

               the camera begins its photography

               anderson watches the number on the filmremaining counter 
               spool down he stares out the window the towering clouds 
               below rise up magnificent glorious a glimpse of heaven

               rapt anderson stares and then suddenly a blaring alarm 
               goes off in the cockpit it shocks anderson around to the 
               controls its his missile warning light

               anderson hands flash out to the joystick turning off the 
               cameras disabling autopilot he banks the u2 hard

               ext u2  continuous

               as the u2 turns far far below emerging from the clouds 
               barely visible rises a contrail it arcs lazily toward us 
               a beat and then another contrail

               then another the antiaircraft missiles creating them are 
               too small to be seen with the naked eye

               int u2  continuous

               the cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights the horizon 
               outside tilted andersons breath comes fast rasping as he 
               does his strains going into the highg turn

               he looks out the cockpit window finds the first sa2 missile 
               in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now he waits 
               waits waits still in the turn the black head of the missile 
               now visible

               he puts the plane over rolling out into an opposite bank

               ext u2  continuous

               the spy planes long flimsy wings werent made for 
               dogfighting they bend terribly in the rollout and then the 
               first missile streaks past tries to correct its miss but 
               cant and vanishes into the distance at a 90degree angle

               int u2  continuous

               andersons breath comes faster and faster as the second 
               missile rises up now visible he puts the throttle as far 
               as it goes trying to outrun death every second is a tenth 
               of a mile and every mile shortens the missiles life span

               the rising missile drafts aft closing on the u2 from behind

               ext u2  continuous

               the second missiles contrail rises up behind the plane 
               levels off and closes on it at a tremendous rate

               the third missile rises up in the far distance behind the 
               second

               the second missile races up on the u2 closer right behind 
               it cant miss then at a hundred yards the contrail suddenly 
               peters out and the missile out of fuel drops away

               but the third missile closes

               int u2  continuous

               anderson glances out the window sees the spent missiles 
               fall away and spots the third missile still seeking him 
               aft hand pinning the throttle forward he prays under his 
               breath

               ext u2  continuous

               the third sa2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight 
               for the tail of the u2 this one is not out of fuel

               int u2  continuous

               major anderson opens his eyes he stares out the window at 
               the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below

               ext u2  continuous

               and the missile looms we have time to realize its almost 
               as big as the plane itself before it shears right into the u 
               2s tail and explodes in a blinding flash

               int hall outside bundys office  day

               kenny jogging down the hall hears form an open door

                                     bundy os
                         kenny

               kenny goes over to the threshold inside the office bundy 
               stands up from behind his desk grave and kenny knows

               int cabinet room  day

               all of excom is there except for bundy kenny sits behind 
               the president deeply distraught over major anderson

                                     the president
                         does this attack on our plane 
                         represent a definitive intentional 
                         escalation on the part of the soviets

                                     general taylor
                         the soviets are in control of the 
                         sams its hard to believe with their 
                         centralized command structure that 
                         it could be an accidental launch

                                     mccone
                         mr president taken with the events 
                         of the past few hours i believe 
                         this confirms our worst fears were 
                         now dealing with a hardline soviet 
                         government perhaps with khruschev 
                         as a puppet head perhaps not

               in the silence kenny reads the faces around the room theyre 
               convinced by mccones pronouncement kennys not

                                     kenny
                         it could be a mistake

               mccone gives him a getserious look but kenny presses on

                                     kenny
                         we need to be positive before we 
                         react

               bundy enters the room everyone looks up he stands there in 
               the doorway his face tight

               kenny sags in his chair bundy of course has more bad news 
               and they all know it a hopeless beat the president just 
               stares at bundy unable to ask bundy nods affirming what 
               everyone is thinking

                                     bundy
                         a u2 on a routine airsampling 
                         mission over siberia got lost and 
                         penetrated soviet airspace the 
                         soviets scrambled migs in pursuit 
                         thinking it was a bomber it got out 
                         okay somebody forgot to cancel the 
                         mission

                                     the president
                         goddammitt theres always some 
                         sonofabitch who doesnt get the word 
                         all we need is the soviets thinking 
                         were bombing them
                              facetious
                         anybody else

               the humor falls on a cold audience

                                     general taylor
                         mr president our pilots are in 
                         danger we must order punitive 
                         airstrikes against the sam site that 
                         shot down major anderson per our 
                         rules of engagement

               and finally the moment kenny has dreaded all this time has 
               come to pass he looks at bobby then at the president the 
               president stares at the cup of coffee in his hands as if 
               trying to read the fates design in it a long beat and 
               everyone holds their breath

                                     the president
                         no i want confirmation there wasnt 
                         some sort of accident first

               lemay clears his throat everyone looks at him expecting 
               him to scream or jump up and down

                                     lemay
                         i think thats a good idea mr  
                         president itll be safer for my 
                         boys to get those sams on monday 
                         when we get the rest of the bastards  
                         i can wait a day and a half

                                     the president
                         very well then

               but he says it without any belief in the words realizing 
               theyre being tied fast to the train tracks of war

               int kennys office  day

               alone in his office shattered kenny stares out the window 
               viewing the distant ellipse through a gap in the trees kids 
               are out there playing football he glances at his watch and 
               grabs his jacket

               kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the

               ext ellipse  day

                         listen to me what if there hasnt 
                         been a coup at all what if its you 
                         two who invited that second letter 
                         by raising the possibility of a trade

               bobby is speechless with rage

                                     kenny
                         and if the two of you are thinking

                         youre so wrong its a deuce

                         and its not just me who thinks that 
                         everyone on this socalled excom is 
                         telling you exactly the same thing 
                         make the trade and theyre going to 
                         force us into trade after trade until 
                         finally they demand something we 
                         wont trade like berlin and we do 
                         end up in a war
                              beat
                         not to mention that long before 
                         that happens this government will 
                         be politically dead

               bobby simmers for a long beat thinking and boy does this 
               guy hate admitting hes wrong

                                     bobby
                         all right so maybe we overestimated 
                         how reasonable this trade would look 
                         okay you happy so now what

                         so now youve got to talk him out of 
                         it and then weve got to figure out 
                         an acceptable political solution

                                     bobby
                         and if there has been a coup and 
                         there is no acceptable political 
                         solution

                         whatever response we send it will 
                         take several hours for the wire to 
                         be received by our embassy and 
                         delivered to the kremlin so were 
                         looking at early tomorrow morning at 
                         the earliest before khruschev could 
                         respond

               as rusk talks kenny passes close by bobby bobby whispers

                                     bobby
                         he gets it but hes pissed

                                     the president
                         thats all well and good but what 
                         do we say to em

                                     sorensen
                         it depends on if we really believe 
                         theres been a coup

               that strikes a cord with kenny

                                     kenny
                         i agree if there has been a coup 
                         and theres a hardline government 
                         in power now then it doesnt matter 
                         what we say the end of the day well 
                         either agree to their terms theyll 
                         agree to ours or well go to war 
                         but what if there hasnt been a coup  
                         what if what if what is happening 
                         is a series of accidents

                                     sorensen
                         the second letter is an accident

                                     kenny
                         no the letter is an intentional 
                         but its having an effect far greater 
                         than its authors intended
                              beat
                         what if our jupiter missiles are 
                         just a last minute haggle to salvage 
                         something maybe a bone khruschev is 
                         throwing to the hard line not really 
                         caring if we reject it or not
                              beat
                         and then these accidents have 
                         happened

                                     bobby
                         making the second letter and the 
                         overall picture look worse than it 
                         really is

                                     sorensen
                         the guns of august

                                     kenny
                         exactly
                              beat
                         if theyre sane and human like we 
                         are then maybe we just refuse and 
                         theyll let it slide like weve 
                         been letting things slide

                                     sorensen
                         so we reject the second letter

               and kenny looks at bobby the world stops

                                     kenny
                         no we dont reject it

               it hits bobby like a lightning bolt

                                     bobby
                         we accept the first letter and 
                         pretend the second doesnt exist

               the president rusk and sorensen stare at him mute

               int cabinet room  night

               hold on the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled 
               excom finally mccone breaks the spell

                                     mccone
                         it wont work 

               bobby kenny and sorensen start to object but mccone raises 
               his voice over theirs

                                     mccone
                          because its wishful thinking 
                         its the same wishful thinking that 
                         blinded us all these months while 
                         the soviets were sneaking those 
                         missiles in under our noses

               mcnamara shakes his head intrigued but skeptical

                                     mcnamara
                         ignore the second letter agree to 
                         the conditions of the first

                                     general taylor
                         theres no reason to believe the 
                         soviets will let it go

                                     rusk
                         max is right why will they accept 
                         it

                                     mcnamara
                         it can work if if they believe 
                         well hit them

               kenny bobby and sorensen look at mcnamara grateful

                                     mcnamara
                         weve only got time for one more 
                         round of diplomacy the first 
                         airstrikes start in less than 36 
                         hours

                                     rusk
                         but we have to make them agree to 
                         it so how do we do that

               the president leans forward sensing hes about to speak 
               all eyes turn to him

                                     the president
                         we give them something we tell them 
                         well remove the missiles from turkey 
                         say six months from now so that 
                         there appears to be no linkage we 
                         also tell them if they go public 
                         about it we deny it and the deal is 
                         off

                                     kenny
                         and we do it under the table so we 
                         can disavow any knowledge of it

                                     mccone
                         its transparent the pressll be 
                         all over it

                                     kenny
                         six months from now im not going 
                         to care are you well deal with 
                         it

                                     mcnamara
                         at least it will expose whether 
                         khruschev has been overthrown well 
                         know what were dealing with

                                     kenny
                         and if this is a move to appease the 
                         hard line then it may just be the 
                         bone he needs to regain control of 
                         his own house

               most excom is nodding agreeing mccone shakes his head in 
               disgust taylor sits in silence

                                     rusk
                         whoever carries the message has to 
                         hit the nail on the head come across 
                         as too soft theyll push us too 
                         hard theyll be cornered and even 
                         more dangerous

                                     mccone
                         they could preempt

               its a terrible responsibility to bear the room is silent 
               at last bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother 
               the president stares back there is nobody else who can do 
               this only bobby his brother

                                     the president
                         bobby you know dobrynin best

               bobby nods taking up the gauntlet

                                     the president
                         ted you get working on the draft

               sorensen and bobby rise as one head for the doors

                                     the president
                         and make sure he knows we have to 
                         have an answer tomorrow
                              beat final
                         because on monday we begin military 
                         action against cuba

               bobby and kenny exchange a look

               ext west wing driveway  night

               a long shot bobby emerges from the west wing in his overcoat 
               briefcase in hand he pauses tiny alone the west wing  
               and all its imposing spotlit power behind him  reduced to 
               this insignificant man on his eleventhhour mission

               and then out of the shadows in the fg steps kenny in 
               his own coat his breath frosting in the latenight air  
               bobby sees him and knows he is not so alone anymore

               on the driveway

               they meet in front of the limo bobby stops shuffles his 
               things awkward

               kenny opens the drivers side door the secret service limo 
               driver peers out

               hops out and kenny gets in bobby stands there outside for 
               a beat he tries to hide how touched he is but cant 
               completely

                                     kenny

                         jesus you rich people

               kenny starts up the engine bobby smiles a twisted smile as 
               the car pulls away the two men sit in silence neither 
               willing to admit how glad the other is there

               ext pennsylvania ave  night

               into the darkness

                         because we knew we could do a better 
                         job than everyone else

               and bobby in the silence and closeness of the car turns on 
               kenny  anguished knowing his life is at its climax

                                     bobby

               the camera lifts away from the limo turning toward the

               embassy of the united soviet socialist republics up and up 
               to the roof where black reeking smoke billows from all of 
               the embassys several chimneys

               the camera races into it it engulfs us all

               ext justice department  night

               bobbys staffers greet them as they stride down the hall 
               staffer 1 taking bobbys coat

                                     staffer 1

                         here we have him waiting in your 
                         office

               they reach the double oak doors to bobbys suite and stop 
               bobby faces kenny

                                     kenny
                         ill whistle up some luck for you

               and before kennys eyes all of bobbys doubt vanishes in 
               its place a severe confidence a grandeur kenny has never 
               seen

               it makes kenny pause he beholds his best friend become a 
               man of the ages and then bobby smoothly opens the door

               int bobbys waiting room  night

               and a door shuts oc like a threshold of history hold on 
               bobbys waiting room silent cavernous dim plush carpet 
               heavy drapes framing dark windows and abandoned secretarys 
               desk a row of sofas and chairs on either side of the room 
               two doorways one at either end of the room

               a woman sits in one of the chairs for visitors dressed in 
               gray prim but beautiful a secretary of some sort

               one of the double doors to the hall swings silently open 
               kenny glides in he sees the other door shut at the far end 
               of the room kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait

               hold on the scene motionless silent

               kenny whistles two notes stops and then he begins to whistle 
               the irish tune odonnell aboo he gets a bar into it  and 
               theres a polite soft cough

               kenny stops then notices the woman in gray across the room  
               he didnt see her its dim over there she looks at him 
               expressionless

               the camera finds a pin on her lapel a red hammer and sickle

               kenny reacts dobrynins assistant his opposite number a 
               friend or more than a friend

               here is the face of the enemy not a smile between them 
               kenny resumes his ease and begins to whistle again

               the haunting irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling filling 
               the dim room strange sad beautiful the woman listens 
               and her face begins to soften

               kenny stares at the dark lonely windows his song striving 
               to fill the empty room

               kenny sinks deeper in the chair his tune allconsuming 
               and the womans voice breaks in kenny stops looks over 
               her voice is tremulous and beautiful just a snatch of some 
               song in russian she stops awkward

               kenny stares the woman stares back no smiles but in their 
               eyes they each see the others fear the others beauty 
               the others humanity

               so this is the enemy

                                     the woman
                         who are you

               kenny glances to the door he considers for a long moment

                                     kenny
                         the friend

               kenny breaks the gaze he begins to whistle again the camera 
               drifts away finding the far door to the inner office kennys 
               tune stronger carrying with it hope

               int bobbys office  night

               to the other side of that door dobrynin sits in a chair 
               opposite bobby behind his desk the room is equally dim  
               and far more tense

               silence and then the faintest strain of odonnell aboo 
               dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door

               but bobby unseen by dobrynin cant help the flicker of a 
               private smile its kennys presence and bobby is the 
               stronger for it and then the tune is gone

               bobby leans forward cool controlled masterful

                                     bobby

                         my brother my friends my countrymen 
                         and i cannot and will not permit

                         then i fear our two nations will go 
                         to war and i fear where war will

               bobby acknowledges him with a nod

                                     bobby
                         if the missiles do not become 
                         operational if you remove the

                         immediately removes the missiles 
                         and submits to un inspection the 
                         united states will pledge to never

                         if your jupiter missiles in turkey 
                         were removed also such an 
                         accommodation could be reached

               the two men move their argument forward with the deliberation 
               and formality of chess masters

                                     bobby
                              tired sounding
                         the united states cannot agree to 
                         such terms under threat any belief

                          was in error

               dobrynin reels internally the only sign on his face is a 
               slight tremor bobby looks up registers the calculated 
               effect and to dobrynins horror the russian believes

                                     dobrynin
                         you want war

               but not so fast bobby folds his hands and he smoothly goes 
               from hardass brinksman to sensitive dealmaker

                                     bobby
                         however while there can be no quid 
                         pro quo on this issue the united 
                         states can offer a private assurance

               dobrynin holds his breath

                                     bobby
                         our jupiter missiles in turkey are 
                         obsolete and have been scheduled 
                         for withdrawal for some time this 
                         withdrawal should be completed within 
                         say six months

               dobrynin lets out his breath

                                     bobby
                         of course any public disclosure of 
                         this assurance would negate the deal 
                         and produce the most stringent denials 
                         from our government

               dobrynin grasps the move immediately understanding the 
               ramifications still he hesitates a moment

                                     dobrynin
                         this private assurance represents 
                         the word of the highest authority

                                     bobby
                         yes

                                     dobrynin
                         and it can be relayed beyond comrade 
                         khruschevs ears to the top circles 
                         of my government

                                     bobby
                         of course our pledge can be relayed 
                         to any government official secretary 
                         khruschev sees fit to satisfy

               meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line dobrynin 
               struggles internally knowing what bobby has done wanting 
               to hug him it comes across as agitation

                                     bobby
                         with the caveat that it is not made 
                         public in any way shape or form

                         point enough

               dobrynin rises from his chair bobby rises with him

                         then you must excuse me and permit 
                         me to relay the substance of our 
                         discussion to my superiors

               dobrynin heads for the door half way there he turns back to

                         other good men let us hope the will 
                         of good men is enough to counter the 
                         terrible strength of this thing which 
                         has been put in motion

               kenny enters the oval office through his side door the office 
               is dark only the desk lamp on kennys gaze moves over the 
               trappings of power the carpet with the presidential seal 
               the rocking chair by the fireplace the desk

               and on the desk tucked almost out of sight sits a small 
               humble wooden plaque its turned to face the occupant of 
               the chair behind the desk kenny reaches out turns it around 
               it is the bretons fishermans prayer

               it reads oh lord thy sea is great my boat so small

                                     bobby os
                         were out here

               kenny holds on the plaque a beat and looks up at the open 
               french door to the rose garden the curtains swirl around 
               him in the wind as he goes through the door and out 

               ext portico  continuous

                onto the portico standing there in the dark by the white 
               neoclassical pillars of the cloister are bobby and the 
               president theyre holding drinks kenny joins them

               the president gestures out across the south lawn to the 
               gleaming washington monument

                                     the president
                         we were just debating who had it 
                         worse us or george washington and 
                         his guys

                         he didnt have to worry about nuclear 
                         weapons

                                     the president
                         yeah but the country didnt even 
                         exist as a country yet it was a 
                         mess and he didnt have a leg to 
                         stand on

                                     kenny
                         all he had was his character

               the president and bobby nod at the justice of that remark

                                     bobby
                         how does a guy get a rep like that

                                     the president
                         doesnt matter to me if i went down 
                         in history like adams id die happy 
                         all they say about him today is 

                                     kenny
                          he kept the peace

               kenny looks at the president the president feels it and 
               gazes back to him

               the three of them stare out at the glittering city the 
               grandness of the world lies before them and they are deciding 
               its fate and are humbled by the awfulness of it the silence 
               is beyond power

               and for a long moment they know not to disturb it there is

                         be no attack no invasion of cuba
