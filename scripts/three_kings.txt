                only one way for this situation to be
                satisfactorily resolved  the belligerent
                forces from the republic of iraq must be
                removed from kuwait be it by choice or

                          jaeger

                          wes

                the tanks  come on  pack up  weve got
                a whole lot of nothing to patrol 

     as they pack up and get ready to roll on jaeger says almost
     to himself

                          jaeger 
                we ought to kick their asses  either way

     ext street bazaar  evening 

     the bazaar is loud and colorful a cacophony of arabic fills 
     the air  the bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling
     their wares to each passerby literally shoving them in the
     faces of prospective customers 

     epps wes and jaeger walk along side by side looking almost
     like the three musketeers except that wes is droning on 

                          wes 
                and its very important when you sit
                down never to point the soles of your
                shoes at anyone  its considered
                offensive 

                          epps

                you know where we can get something to
                eat 

                          jaeger 
                when do you ever point the soles of your
                feet at people

                          jaeger 
                oh yeah  accidently 

     jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of
     his foot at a vendor 

                          jaegercont 
                im sorry  my foot accidently jumped up 
                in the air where you could see the bottom
                of it  i hate it when that happens

                personality as a form of birth control

     as epps and wes walk on jaeger notices something on a 
     vendors table  it is a small square box  slightly larger
     than a mans palm  fashioned of wood and metal  it is not
     particularly ornate but eye catching in its own way  the
     instant jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the
     vendor is giving him the hard sell in arabic  jaeger holds
     the box up to the vendor 

                          jaegercont

     wes says something to the vendor in arabic  the vendor
     answers back 

                          wes 
                he says its a box

                you could turn on a light if someone put 
                your hand on the switch 

     decisively without even haggling about price jaeger whips
     out some money and pays the vendor for the box

                          eppscont 
                well that showed me  now can we eat 

     the three men walk on jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box

     int barracks  night 

     its filled with young soldiers messing around playing 
     cards listening to music whatever  jaeger lays on a bunk
     holding the puzzle box probing it with his fingers trying
     to find a way to make it open 

     wes crosses over 

                          wes

     a dialogue with him  dig it  it is talking  a voice only
     jaeger can hear  right now its just a little whisper but
     the voice is getting louder

                just listen to me  ive been doing some
                reading  in the sixteenth century this
                region was invaded by the turks  it 
                became part of the ottoman empire  when
                the turks rolled in they raped they 
                pillaged the usual stuff  anybody who 
                had anything wanted to hide it from these
                bastards  they buried their treasures
                drew maps and hid the maps in puzzle 
                boxes  i read about this man  i read
                about it

                that doesnt mean what was in that box

                brother doesnt play ball or deal drugs

                around and im not particularly 
                interested in spending the rest of my 
                life fighting the oil companies wars

     comes with it  all three men just stare at the plume as it
     drifts closer  finally

                          epps 
                we run theyll shoot us anyway  if we
                keep driving they might think we 
                friendlies iraqis  or even if they know
                were americans they might get scared 
                think were part of a detachment and keep
                on going 

                          jaeger 
                theyre not going to 

                          epps 
                its the only way  we drive

     epps is right  jaeger and wes know it  they shut up and 
     ride  dig that tension  wes sweating epps giving the wheel
     a white knuckle grip  jaeger reaches down and readies his m
     16  when he chambers it it sounds like thunder cracking 

     the plume draws closer and closer until its not just a 
     plume but two dots  then its two jeeplike vehicles  next
     we can even make out the passengers

     that doesnt do much to relax our boys

     us the iraqis were almost on top of each other now  the
     vehicles are going to pass within feet  epps throws in one
     more thing

                          epps 
                wave at them  dont look just wave

     all three throw up some weak forced waves  the vehicles
     pass  look at that  the iraqis are waving back  and thats 
     all theyre doing just waving

     our boys break out into cheers 

                          jaeger
                yeah  yeah 

                          wes
                i think im going to throw up  i am
                im going to toss 

                          jaeger 
                you see that  right by us  they went 
                right by  you had them epps you called
                it 

                          epps 
                figure they dont want to mess with us 
                anymore than we want to mess with them 

                          jaeger 
                look at you not even breaking a sweat
                youre cool boy  youre cool 

     they all have a good laugh but wes brings that to a crashing
     halt  looking back at the iraqis in a voice dead with fear 

                          wes
                they stopped 

                          epps
                wha 

                          wes 
                oh jesus theyve stopped 

     epps and jaeger look behind them

                          wescont 
                they stopped and theyve turned around 

     the two iraqi vehicles have stopped theyve turned and now
     theyre racing towards our boys  epps momentarily freezes
     jaeger helps him right out of it 

                          jaeger 
                go go go 

     epps punches it and the hummer takes off  the iraqis are
     right behind them 

     the vehicles all do same hard driving  they twist and turn
     like wild snakes over the loose sand hit dunes take 
     flight its the open desert and our boys have nowhere to
     hide 

     inside the hummer its a rough rough ride  our boys are
     thrown violently about the cabin  for epps controlling the
     hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse 

     the iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire
     our way  bullets kick up around the hummer like angry 
     little bees with a hell of a sting  epps yells at jaeger 

                          epps
                shoot them 

     now its jaeger whos freezes  epps returns the favor

                          eppscont
                shoot em 

     jaeger climbs back to the humvees machine gun works the
     action and starts firing  unlike before when he was playing
     the real thing is much wilder  the humvee bounces around 
     like a cork in the ocean  taking aim is nearly impossible
     the best jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the iraqis
     general direction 

     all wes can do is cover his head and stay down like a scared
     little girl 

                          jaeger
                steady it out 

                          epps 
                i steady it out they blow us out of the
                sand 

     its like a dog fight in the dirt  the vehicles weave
     cut one of the iraqis starts to cut across jaegers firing
     line  jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets
     loose  a hail of bullets rips into the iraqi vehicle just
     above wheel level  it kicks the vehicle up and back 
     whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time
     then smashing it back into the ground 

     jaeger is beside himself

                          jaeger 
                i got him  you see that i nailed him 

     as if in answer the remaining iraqi vehicles gunner tears
     off a salvo that eats up the space right around jaeger  hes
     not hit but it kicks him back down into the humvee screaming
     with fear 

                          epps
                damn it

     the boys are running out of options and epps knows it 

                          eppscont
                wes take the wheel 

     no good wes is too scared to move  epps reaches back and
     literally pulls him up and over into the front 

                          eppscont
                take it 

     with little finesse wes takes the wheel as epps slides over
     epps takes up an m16 with a grenade launcher  he loads it
     up and readies the weapon  crawling to the back he takes
     aim 

                          eppscont
                keep it steady 

     wes does his best to give a level ride but the iraqi bullets
     coming at them dont help much 

     epps zeroes in on the target  he takes aim and starts to
     squeeze back on the trigger  he almost has a shot off when
     wes hits a dune rocking the hummer violently  epps loses the
     target 

                          eppscont
                damn it  i said keep it steady 

     epps tries to take aim again  careful aim  one shot is all
     he gets  the bullets keep coming but hes in no hurry
     waitingwaiting  the iraqis are only getting closer 

                          wes
                shootshoot 

     waiting

     closer 

                          wes
                shoot 

     epps fires  the grenade rips from the launcher riding a 
     trail of white smoke and slams into the iraqis  you know 
     the story  huge explosion car parts flying a hundred feet
     into the air bodies whipping through space stuff bob dole
     would hate  but maybe he would like it  they were just
     iraqis

     wes brings the hummer to a halt  a spastic scared relieved 
     laugh escapes him  jaeger checking himself for wounds and
     epps m16 still in hand get out  epps makes his way to the
     wreckage sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any
     survivors  yeah like somebodys walking away from that
     bang 

     wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and
     stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was

                          wes
                i thought we were dead 

                          jaeger 
                yeah well were not 

                          wes 
                we got to get out of here 

     nobody says anything  this really scares wes

                          wescont
                we have to go back 

                          jaeger 
                were not going anywhere  not til we
                get what we came for 

                          wes 
                     incredulous 
                we just about got killed  you know what
                happened  we just about got killed and 
                you want to go on 

                          epps 
                jaeger go check out the hummer for
                damage

     jaeger starts to cross back to the hummer  wes gives him
     something to take with him 

                          wes 
                youre crazy you know that  youre
                insane 

     jaeger goes leaving epps and wes all by their lonesome  wes
     turns to epps

                          wescont 
                you know that right  you know hes
                sick 

     with a flip of his head epps indicates the dead iraqis

                          epps 
                they shouldnt have been here

                          wes 
                we shouldnt have been here epps  there
                is a war going on 

                          epps 
                this is miles from the battle lines
                they were probably deserters 

                          wes 
                deserters would have run they wouldnt
                have engaged 

                          epps 
                they shouldnt have been out this way
                thats all im saying 

     wes starts to get it  it really doesnt matter what he has
     to say 

                          wes 
                were not going back are we 

     epps has got nothing to say to the truth  he turns and
     starts to walk to the hummer

                          wescont 
                you bastard  youre trying to get us
                killed 

     like a whip epps snaps around  he grabs up wes and pulls him
     close 

                          epps 
                im trying to get us paid  im trying to
                get us all paid  as long as theres a 
                chance something is out there we go on
                theres not going to be anymore trouble
                if there is we go back but there wont
                be 

     almost as an afterthought epps realizes hes got wes and
     lets him go  gently he puts it 

                          eppscont 
                youll feel different after we find the
                treasure  money has away of making
                people feel different 

     nobodys got anytbing to say to that so they say nothing
     epps heads back to the hummer  a beat later wes follows

     jaeger is already behind the wheel  epps rides shotgun this
     time  once again wes is in back  to jaeger epps ask 

                          epps
                she okay 

                          jaeger 
                yeah  yeah shes fine 

                          epps
                lets go

     jaeger fires it up and pulls out  as they head off we 

                                                           fade to

     black

                                                           fade to

     ie humvee  later 

     the sun beats down violently as the hummer rolls along
     epps jaeger and wes all ride along in an angry silence
     jaeger starts to smile  he chuckles to himself  epps 
     looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit 
     himself 

                          epps
                what 

                          jaeger

                of the boys knew what were doing  i
                mean if they knew what we were coming
                back with 

                          epps

                knew  were going to be millionaires
                man  millionaires 

     epps joins in cackling like a hyena 

                          epps 
                itd make their heads explode

                          eppsjaeger 
                money money money moneymoney 

     epps starts to slow down 

                          wes 
                what are you doing

                          epps 
                low on gas  got to refill 

     a nervous look punches it way onto jaegers face  epps
     stops  he and wes jump out of the hummer and go around back 
     to the reserve tanks

     jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense  after a beat
     epps screams for him 

                          eppsoc
                jaegerjaeger 

     time to face the music  jaeger hauls himself out of the 
     hummer and goes around to epps whos got a look on his face
     like hes just had a spoonful of steaming shit  he points
     angrily at one of the reserve tanks 

                          epps 
                look at it  look at it  shot to hell
                its been leaking gas since the fire 
                fight  i told you to check for damage 

                          jaeger
                i know 

                          epps 
                and you missed this  how are you going
                to miss something like this 

                          jaeger 
                i didnt miss it  i figured if you knew 
                one of the reserves got hit youd want to
                turn back 

                          wes 
                so you just let us drive on knowing we 
                were losing fuel  knowing we were going
                to run low in the middle of nowhere 

                          jaeger 
                i figuredi figured youd turn back 

     wes gets a slow boil on 

                          wes 
                you stupid son of a bitch 

     wes lunges for jaeger but doesnt have the speed or the
     skills  jaeger counters and sinks a fist into wes jaw 
     wes goes down but he manages to take jaeger to the sand with
     him  they start to scrape but its obvious jaeger has got
     the upper hand

     epps reaches down and yanks jaeger off of wes

                          epps
                get off him 

     jaeger comes up to his feet  wes wipes some blood from his 
     lips  he looks down at his bloodied hand then sneers at
     jaeger 

                          eppscont 
                you two fightings not going to get us 
                anything

                          wes 
                him getting us stranded out here doesnt
                do much good either

                          jaeger 
                were not stranded  weve got enough gas
                in the other reserve to get us back

                          wes 
                then lets go back while we still can

                          jaeger 
                as soon as we hit the mountain we would 
                have had to go on foot anyway  were not

                          wes 
                what if someone takes it 

     jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert

                you have to go with us  you cant walk
                back 

     jaeger dangles the keys to the humvee from a finger

                          jaegercont 
                and you sure as hell arent going to
                drive 

     wes burns a hole through jaegers head with his eyes  epps
     steps to him

                          epps 
                load what you can water tools weapons
                anything you think we might need 

     wes burns on a bit more then turns and heads for the hummer
     jaeger watches him go then smiles to himself

                          jaeger
                whos he kidding  he wants it as bad as
                we do  were going to be fat epps  as
                soon as we get back to saudivillie you
                and me are going to 

     epps gets up in jaegers face  the menace he projects is
     very real 

                          epps 
                were going to keep going cause i want
                some of whatevers out there  but you

                ass stranded out here again and ill
                kill you myself  you got that 

     jaeger just stands there his fear swelling 

                          eppscont
                say it 

                          jaeger
                i got thatsir 

     epps storms over towards the hummer leaving jaeger to be all
     scared with himself 

                                                            cut to

     ext desert  later 

     a long line of footprints works their way through the sand up
     to epps jaeger and wes  epps and wes trek side by side

     jaeger is behind them having trouble keeping up  between
     pants he gasps

                          jaeger 
                heyhey  slow up  you dont have to
                go so fast 

                          epps 
                faster we get there faster we get back 

                          jaeger 
                yeah  i know  im with you 

     jaeger struggles on just a bit more then

                          jaegercont 
                im gonnaim just gonna stop for a
                little water 

                          epps 
                dont drink up all of yours cause you
                arent getting any of ours

                          jaeger 
                im just going to have a little sip
                thats all  just a sip 

     jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand  he looks up
     epps and wes are still walking 

                          jagercont
                wait for me 

                          epps
                you can catch up 

                          jaeger 
                yeahim right behind you 

     wes looks back at jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his
     water 

                          wes 
                thanks for straightening out jaeger

     epps shrugs like hitting jaeger wasnt much of anything

                          epps 
                maybe we are crazy for doing this  but
                if we do it we do it right  i just
                needed to explain that in a way i
                wouldnt have to do it again 

                          wes
                not much chance of that  jaegers an
                idiot 

                          epps
                hes not so 

                          wes 
                hes an idiot and hes not nearly as
                hard as he thinks

                          epps 
                how tough you have to be to make the 
                army  all youve got to do is shoot a
                gun and stop a bullet

     again epps looks behind him as jaeger struggles to his feet
     and stumbles after his two comrades

                          wes 
                look at him  we ought to just leave him
                behind 

     epps gives a little laugh like hes just heard a mildly
     amusing punchline

                          wescont 
                like he said  people get lost in wars
                all the time  and out here  out here
                there are eight million ways to die 

     all this talk starts to creep out epps a little 

                          epps 
                okay so he was riding you  get over it

     wes smiles a little smile 

                          wes
                im just talking 

     they walk on

     jaeger works to catch up muttering to himself as he goes

                          jaeger
                cant even slow up for me  wasnt for me
                they wouldnt even be here  im the one
                that found the map  should have just 
                come by myself  shouldve  shouldnt
                even cut them in  shouldnt 

     as jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come 
     from under his boot  he goes dead still  panic races up and
     down his spine  in almost a whisper be says

                          jaeger
                epps 

     again louder 

                          jaegercont
                epps 

     like he couldnt be more annoyed epps turns around

                          epps
                what 

                          jaeger
                mine 

     epps isnt sure of what hes heard 

                          epps
                what 

                          jaeger
                mine  land mine

     epps doesnt say anything he just keeps on staring  scared
     angry they dont get it 

                          jaegercont 
                i stepped on a land mine

     epps and wes look at each other then back to jaeger  like
     hes got no time to mess around 

                          epps 
                you didnt step on any mine 

                          jaeger
                i heard it click 

                          epps 
                if you stepped on a mine youd be dead by
                now  nobody uses delayedfuse mines
                anymore 

                          jaeger
                i heard it

                          wes 
                maybe its just a can or something 

     jaeger loses it 

                          jaeger 
                jesus christ im standing on a mine
                shut up and get over here 

     just plain sick of all this epps and wes trudge back over to jaeger 

                          epps 
                paranoid thats your problem  youre
                just paranoid  whyd the paranoid one
                have to find the map 

     epps pulls a knife from his belt  he sinks to the ground and
     probes the sand under jaegers foot  nothingnothing 
     we hear the sound of metal against metal  epps goes white
     for a second he doesnt move  tension falls like a steel
     curtain  slow careful epps withdraws the blade and stands
     jaeger reads the expression on epps face 

                          jaeger
                oh god  oh god 

                          epps

                jaeger down off there all well have to
                worry about is finding the pieces 

     behind them pathetically jaeger cries 

                          jaeger
                epps 

                          wes

                alive 

     epps eyes narrow  he doesnt want to hear this kind of
     talk 

                          epps 
                i said nobody dies  nobody dies

                          jaeger 
                epps my leg is falling asleep 

     epps thinks and thinks hard

                          epps
                     to wes 
                weve got rope 

                          wes

                          epps
                break it out 

     epps crosses back over to jaeger

                          jaeger
                my leg is falling asleep 

                          epps
                its not falling asleep  youve only
                been standing there for three minutes 

                          jaeger 
                im the one who can feel my leg and its
                falling asleep 

                          epps 
                it falls asleep and you die so wake it
                the hell up 

     wes crosses over with climbing rope  very very gently epps
     wraps the middle of the rope around jaegers waist leaving
     several feet dangling off each end 

                          jaeger 
                hows this going to work 

                          epps 
                me and wes each going take an end of the 
                rope run our asses of and yank you off
                the mine 

                          jaeger 
                thats going to do it right  im going
                to be okay

     not too convincingly 

                          epps
                youre going to be fine 

                          jaeger
                youre not going to let me die are you
                dont let me die 

     ignoring the question

                          epps 
                when we start running suck up your 
                breath  youre going to get the wind
                knocked out of you 

                          jaeger 
                dont let me die epps  i dont want to
                die 

     epps and wes pick up separate ends of the rope and take up 
     positions behind jaeger  epps waits a beat afraid of what
     might happen but there is no choice  he digs in ready to
     take off running  wes whispers to him

                          wes 
                what if its a valloro 69  just going to
                bounce right up out of the ground 
                explode in the air kill him and us 

                          epps
                you just go when i say go 

                          wes 
                should have at least gotten the map off
                of him  blows up with him then we did
                all this for nothing 

     ignoring him 

                          epps
                ready 

                          wes
                yeah 

     epps takes a couple of deep breaths holds one 

                          epps
                go 

     wes and epps are off the the races churning up sand as they
     race away from jaeger  they scream like banshees as if to
     draw strength

     jaeger does a little chant 

                          jaeger 
                oh god  oh god 

     the rope goes taught  jaegers body jerks violently backward
     as he gets the air punched out of him  as his feet leave the
     ground the mine detonates

                                                            cut to

     pov  jaeger 

     a fireball blossoms and eats up the air towards the camera
     as the camera itself rushes away from the belching fire and
     smoke 

                                                            cut to 

     jaeger 

     his feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball but still
     get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground
     several feet from the explosion 

     epps runs to jaeger  wes takes a casual stroll back over 

                          jaeger 
                im all right  oh jesus im all right 

     all casual like wes says 

                          wes
                the map okay 

                                                            cut to

     ext desert  later

     we see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground  it
     looks like something has been dragged through the sand  the
     camera follows the tracks to epps wes and jaeger who crawl
     on their bellies  they thrust knifes into the sand before 
     them searching for mines  we get the feeling theyve been at
     this for awhile

                          wes
                how long we going to keep this up 

                          jaeger 
                until were out of the mine field is how
                long 

                          wes 
                havent found a mine for half a mile or more

                          jaeger 
                that dont mean nothing  iraqis could 
                have just spread them out like that make
                us think were in the clear 

                          wes 
                you want to crawl crawl 

     wes stands and starts to walk  epps waits a beat and follows
     suit  only jaeger stays down 

                          jaeger 
                youre going to blow yourselves up 

                          epps 
                wes is right  if there were any more 
                mines we would have found them  hell 
                that one you stepped on was probably old 
                anyway left over from the war with iran

                          jaeger 
                you dont know that  it could be a trick 

                          epps 
                if we step on a mine well know it was
                let me see the maps

     jaeger stays down afraid to get up 

                          eppscont 
                get up and give me the maps

     after a beat jaeger stands and hands over the map from the
     puzzle box and a recon photo  epps compares the two then
     takes out the navicom 

                          eppscont
                were on course  northeast twentyeight
                degrees  when we hit the base of the 
                mountain well find a pass  i can see it
                on the recon photo  shouldnt be too 
                hard to traverse  thatll take us to the
                top and 

     epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a
     smaller white dot in the middle 

                          epps 
                this  whatever it is 

                          jaeger 
                its the treasure thats what it is 

                          wes
                it better be 

     epps starts to pack away the map  real plain jaeger says

                          jaeger
                the map 

     epps stops like he almost not sure what jaeger is talking
     about  jaeger extends a hand 

                          jaegercont
                the map 

     epps gets it  he hands the map back to jaeger who tucks it
     away  our boys walk on 

                          epps 
                youre not losing trust are you 

                          jaeger
                just figure its my map i ought to hang
                on to it 

                          wes 
                if all we wanted was the map out of you
                we could have taken it while you were
                standing on that mine pissing on
                yourself 

                          jaeger 
                probably wouldve too if epps wasnt
                around to stop you 

                          epps 
                i didnt have to stop anything cause 
                nobody was going to do nothing  were in
                this together understand 

                          jaeger 
                yeah i understand  wes doesnt want to
                come along in the first place but he 
                gets a third of the find  thats a sweet
                deal 

                          wes 
                im getting tired of you riding me
                jaeger 

                          jaeger 
                anytime you want to do something about it
                just let 

     epps stops dead in his tracks

                          epps
                quiet 

     they all go quiet epps cocks an ear to the air and listens
     they all listen  wind but thats about it 

                          jaeger 
                i dont hear any 

                          epps 
                shut up and listen

     again they listen  again they hear wind  then there it is
     the sound epps is looking for  a pop like a big balloon
     being burst just over the next rise 

                          wes
                gunfire 

     quick like that jaeger grabs his m16 down off his shoulder
     and is about to ready it when epps slaps down the muzzle

                          epps
                dont 

                          jaeger 
                its a fire fight 

                          epps 
                single shots doesnt mean a fire fight
                thats not a battle going on 

                          wes
                what is it 

     epps thinks  yeah what the hell is it 

                                                            cut to

     ext desert  rise 

     epps jaeger and wes edge carefully up to the lip of the 
     rise on their bellies  theyre barely visible against the
     sand  epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on
     the ground below 

                                                            cut to

     pov  epps 

     through binocular lenses we see a shiite camp  a tent city 
     really  there are several uniformed iraqi soldiers who are
     roughing up the shiite men

                                                            cut to

     epps wes jaeger 

                          jaeger 
                what is it 

     epps hands the binoculars over to jaeger  who looks down at
     the scene on the ground

                          epps 
                iraqis  a bunch of them 

                          jaeger 
                what are they doing here 

     jaeger hands the binoculars to wes

                          epps 
                well its iraq  im not sure but im
                guessing that has something to do with
                them being here

                          jaeger 
                what are they doing in the middle of
                nowhere 

                          wes 
                maybe theyre looking for gold 

                                                            cut to

     pov  wes 

     again we see through the binocular lenses  one of the iraqi
     soldiers is pushing around a shiite having a good laugh 
     about it then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a
     bullet gift wrapped straight to the brain 

                                                            cut to

     epps wes jaeger

                          jaeger 
                jesus  what the hell did he do that for
                theyre iraqis  why are iraqis killing
                iraqis 

                          wes 
                those people down there are shiites
                youve got shiites in the south of iraq
                and khurds in the north  neither of
                themve got much love for saddam 
                probably figured once the war started 
                there might be an uprising so he sent
                his soldiers out to slap them around some 

                          epps 
                theyre doing more than slapping

                          jaeger 
                the shiites are on our side  i didnt
                know that 

                          wes 
                is there anything you do know 

                          jaeger 
                i know youre a pussy  i know that 

                          epps 
                all right  lets get out of here 

                          wes 
                the soldiers are going to kill those
                people 

                          jaeger
                so 

                          wes
                we have to do something 

                          epps
                theres nothing we can do

                          wes 
                we can fight  thats what were here 
                for  to fight the iraqis  to help the
                shiites and the khurds 

                          jager 
                i didnt sign up to help any shiites
                all we were supposed to do is get the 
                iraqis out of kuwait and if we arent
                doing that then all bets are off 

                          epps 
                we carrying any ordinance 

                          wes 
                some extra grenades  a claymore 

     epps thinks then shakes his head

                          epps 
                not enough  were out numbered and out
                gunned  theyd cut us to shreds

                          jaeger 
                so good bye shiites  thanks for 
                playing  we have some lovely parting
                gifts for you as you go 

                          wes 
                were american soldiers  we dont
                abandon people 

                          jaeger 
                funny you should say that while were out
                looking for gold 

                          wes 
                youre the one wanted to kill iraqis so
                bad 

                          jaeger 
                ive got a new agenda now its get rich
                the only way the iraqis figure into that
                is not at all 

                          epps
                     to wes 
                i dont want to see people killed any 
                more than you  but we try to help out we
                die and all we do is die 

                          wes 
                we cant just go off and 

                          epps 
                theres nothing we can do  we shouldnt
                even be here in the first place 

     theres a big loud quiet as our boys just hang there  from
     down below comes another balloon burst another gun shot

     epps lowers his head  he wants to fight but its like he 
     said  theres nothing they can do  epps slides back away 
     from the rise then jaeger and finally wes disappears back
     the way they came

                                                            cut to

     ext desertmountains  later 

     its the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find 
     in a desert not too steep or rough but it looks as though
     they will definitely takes more than a little physical
     exertion to navigate 

     epps wes and jaeger approach a path at the mesas base
     jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over

                          jaeger 
                this is it  were right on target 

     epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa

                          epps 
                all weve got to do is make it to the
                top

                          wes 
                and find the treasure and get it and 
                get back to the humvee and get the hell
                out of iraqi without getting our heads
                blown off but thats about it 

                          epps 
                were not going to find anything standing
                here  lets get to climbing 

     they ready their packs and weapons then start up the mesa

                                                           fade to

     our boys trekking along the pass  they push onward and
     upward

                                                           fade to

     the pass has narrowed and become more treacherous  the
     rocks are loose and the footing unsure  the going has slowed
     considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their
     steps

                                                           fade to 

     our boys stop  the pass has seemingly came to an end  for a
     short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer  the three
     soldiers take it in 

                          epps 
                not much of a pass

                          wes 
                probably was a couple of hundred years
                ago when whoever drew the map came 
                through here  worn down to nothing now

                          epps 
                picks up again just on the other side 

     they all take a good look at what little there is to cross 
     on and how far down it is to the hard jagged rocks below 

                          jaeger 
                think we can make it 

                          wes 
                we make it or we go back empty handed

                          epps 
                looks like we make it 

     epps and wes edge their way towards whats left of the pass
     jaeger just stands there staring down  way down

                                                           fade to 

     epps wes and jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of
     the mesa  small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to
     the ground below  no man says a word theyre too busy 
     trying to keep alive and the air is filled with the sounds
     of labored breathing

     each step so very careful  testing the pass for purchase
     making sure the footing is solid  they inch one foot
     forward then slide over the next  their hands probe the
     cliff face fingers crawling like spider legs looking for
     something anything to take hold of 

     sweat drips into epps eye  he blinks hard and fast trying to
     clear his vision  right now he cant really afford
     distractions 

     slowly carefully inch by inch the little death dance goes
     on 

     jaeger steps  he steps wrong  the pass gives way under his 
     foot and begins to slide down  instinctively wes rockets out
     an arm grabbing jaeger by the uniform  at first jaeger 
     smiles glad for the save  but then he realizes something 
     wes is literally holding his life in his hands  all wes has
     to do is loosen his grip and

     the color drains from jaegers face  wes stares back blank
     as a bowl of water 

     eternity goes on for a second 

     finally wes yanks jaeger back up against the mesas face
     then slides on  jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat
     clutching the rocks for dear life

                                                           fade to

     epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass  he holds
     out a hand to wes and reels him in  together they both help
     bring in jaeger  wes looks back over the path theyve just
     crossed 

                          wes 
                the us army  always an adventure

                          epps 
                let me see the map

     jaeger hands the map to epps who gives it a going over  they
     walk as they talk

                          eppscont 
                should be easy going from here  stay on
                the pass straight to the dot 

                          wes 
                what do you figure it to be 

                          epps 
                got to be some kind of landmark
                something distinctive

                          jaeger
                x marks the spot

                          epps 
                something like that

                          jaeger 
                but the white dot in the middle thats
                got to mean something

                          epps 
                i hope it means something otherwise

                          wes 
                otherwise whatever were looking for
                could be anywhere

                          epps 
                basically  but the map has been pretty
                precise so far  i dont think itll be
                too hard to 

     our boys step past a grouping of rocks  they stop dead
     sitting before them in what looks like a small camp is five
     iraqi soldiers  time clicks by real slow for an instant
     its a delayed reaction like the beat it takes after you
     pick up a hot pan before you realize that yeah it is
     burning the flesh from your hand 

                          eppscont
                take cover 

     our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came
     they run like wild rabbits for a bit jumping over a rock
     formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover 
     like welltrained warriors they peel their weapons from their
     shoulders lock and load and stand ready  they wait a bit
     taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under
     finally epps gives the order 

                          eppscont
                lets hit em 

     simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear
     down on the iraqis with their m16s ready to blow them to
     kingdom come 

     one problem  no iraqis

     for a beat our three dont move  they hold position breath
     coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race  theyre 
     eyes flint back and forth scanning for somethinganything
     theres nothing 

                          eppscont
                cover me 

     m16 still at the ready epps raises up taking a tactical
     stance  he inches forward sweeping his weapon back and 
     forth before him for any potential target  there is none
     the iraqis have vanished  epps lowers the m16 but does not
     shoulder it 

                          eppscont
                clear 

     wes and jaeger come up from their cover and cross to epps
     they keep their weapons ready  eerily they all look around
     as if trying to spot ghosts

                          wes 
                whered they go 

                          epps 
                i dont know  theres a lot of space up
                here  they could be just about 

                          wes 
                weird they didnt chase us

                          jaeger 
                maybe theyre as scared of us as we are
                of them 

                          wes 
                just seems weird they didnt chase us

                          epps 
                whats weird is how they disappeared 
                doesnt make sense  doesnt

     there is a sound a steady swooshing that starts faint and 
     grows closer like a rolling thunder  our three start looking
     around turning where they stand trying to find the source
     of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch  theres
     nothing  they see nothing  still the sound races closer and
     closer  epps jaeger and wes raise up their weapons in
     preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast

     from below the edge of the mesa a helicopter gunship 
     probably a mil mi24 hindd armed assault helicopter if you
     want to be technical  raises up very dramatically into
     sight  it hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers
     on board are the vanished iraqis wearing nasty grins  the
     pilot brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine
     cannons at our boys

                          eppscont
                scatter 

     wes and jaeger dont have to be told twice  they bolt from
     their spots and not an instant too soon  the gunner lets
     fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground
     where our boys were just standing  we see what the chopters 
     weapons will do to rock  we can imagine what they would do
     to flesh 

     epps jaeger and wes take cover behind some rocks  the 
     gunship swings around picks up speed and bears down on them 

     more shells fired  they punch into and through the rocks our
     boys use for cover  again the three scatter and just in
     time as the shells rip their way through the rock

     our three go sliding down an embankment crouching low
     their heads whip around looking for the gunship

                          jaeger 
                where is it  whered it go 

                          epps
                stay low 

                          jaeger 
                where the hell is it 

                          epps
                just stay down 

     in answer to jaegers question the gunship comes swooping up
     behind them like a bird of prey  our three have all of about
     a second to get running before the iraqis send more shells
     their way  they kick up chunks of rock as they ping ping 
     ping around epps wes and jaeger who make a wild evasive
     run

     dig it  up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face
     they race for it hurl themselves into it as the gunship
     sends a special delivery of whitehot metal their way 

     once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space
     its too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through 
     our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck
     air

     beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and
     forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom 

     jaegers worked up a real scare 

                          jaeger 
                what are we going to do  what the hell
                are we going to do 

                          epps 
                were not going to do anything

                          jaeger
                     panicked 
                theyre going to kill us

                          epps
                they cant shoot us in here

                          wes 
                and they cant fly around out there
                forever

                          epps
                so we wait 

                          jaeger
                if they land 

                          epps 
                if they land we can take them  if they
                dont land then weve got nothing to
                worry about 

     wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air
     it floats very steady as if  wes eyes key in on 
     something  the gunships missile pods rotating slightly 
     coming in line wes eyes go wide like someone just jammed
     an electric cattle prod in his ass 

                          wes
                missile 

                          epps
                move 

     epps wes and jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of
     the passage as a missile rockets from the gunships pod
     with a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow
     straight into the passage  slamming into the ground it
     sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive 
     explosion  it races through the passage lifts our boys from
     the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were
     nothing more than discarded ragdolls

     jaeger takes cover and cowers  he puts his panic into
     overdrive 

     wes pulls his rifle  grunting like an animal he sprays 
     bullets at the chopter but its like throwing snowballs at
     an elephant  the gunship turns on wes and fires in his 
     direction  it doesnt hit him but it sends him running

     epps has had enough of this shit  he scrambles to load a 
     grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about  it races 
     for him cannons at the ready  this one is going to be 
     close  epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down 
     on him  epps fires but the gunship simply jukes up and away
     from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug  the
     grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding
     harmlessly  the chopter returns the favor by reining down a
     hail of shells that kicks epps back flipping him up and over
     the edge of the plateau  his m16 goes flying smashing into
     the ground far below  epps manages to grab hold of the 
     plateau lip with one hand  it swings him around slamming 
     him hard against the cliff face  he hangs there suspended by
     his weakening grip far above the ground

                          jaeger
                epps 

     jaeger and wes run to him grabbing him by his arm  they
     pull and pull hard until epps can get some kind of purchase
     and crawl his way back up to the plateau

     at the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers
     above and beyond our three  it rotates so that the bay doors
     are facing epps wes and jaeger  three iraqis are inside
     weapons trained on our targets  one of them yells something
     wes translates

                          wes 
                they want us to surrender

     the three share a nervous look  epps fairly growls

                          epps 
                yeah ill surrender 

     jaeger and wes watch as shielded by their bodies epps palms
     a grenade from his belt  wes and jaeger dont quite smile
     but they know now they at least have a chance  as epps
     stands the other two turn to face the iraqis  they all fold
     their hands behind their necks which for epps hides the
     grenade from view  slowly they walk towards the gunship
     one of the iraqis starts to yell something  he lifts his
     weapon and aims it at our boys  with his thumb epps yanks 
     the pin from the grenade and lets fly  its a perfect toss
     landing in the chopters bay  the iraqis see the grenade 
     land they scramble for it  one of them grabs it up and is
     about to throw it back out of the gunship 

     too late 

     the grenade explodes in the iraqis hand killing him
     instantly  it also touches off a fire ball that severely 
     damages the gunship  it rocks lists spins wildly out of
     control 

                          eppscont
                get down

     our three hug the ground as the chopters rotors go whipping
     through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among
     them  worse still the gunship now a lame bird drops from
     the sky towards epps jaeger and wes  all they can do is 
     cover their heads as if that would do any good against two
     tons of crashing steel  the chopter rushes downdown but
     it just misses them  it slams into the ground skipping over
     the edge of the plateau to the rocks below 

     our three pick themselves up  they walk to the edge of the
     plateau and look down on the crash 

     jaeger scared painted all over his face sinks to his knees
     and looks as if hes about to go into shock

                          jaeger
                oh god 

     wes looks down at jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer 

                          wes 
                yeah  just keeps getting better and
                better doesnt it 

     they stare for awhile then one by one move off  us  we

                                                           fade to

     black 

                                                           fade to

     ext desertmesa  later 

     epps wes and jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs 
     straight down into the ground  jaeger takes out his maps and
     photos  epps consults the navicom

                          wes 
                what do you think 

                          jaeger 
                lines up with the map and the photos

                          epps 
                were right where we should be 

     epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look
     around  not much to see

                          eppscont 
                i sure dont see much place else around
                here to hide anything

     wes pulls a lanternflashlight from his pack  going to his
     belly he shines it down into the crevice

                          wes 
                cant see anything

     he tosses a rock into it  we can hear it hit the ground below

                          wescont
                its got a bottom 

                          jaeger 
                guess we know what the next stop is 

                          epps 
                all right  lets break out some utility 
                shovels lanterns and a claymore in case
                we have to do any blasting  me and 
                jaegerll climb down and see what we can
                see 

                          wes 
                what am i supposed to do 

                          epps 
                got to have someone here in case we need
                help making it back up  doesnt hurt to
                have a look out either 

                          jaeger 
                think there might be more iraqis 

                          epps 
                right now i wouldnt be surprised if 
                eartha kitt showed up singing send in the
                clowns 

                                                            cut to 

     we see a few quick shots of wes securing a line down into the
     crevice epps and jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses the
     two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown

                                                            cut to 

     int crevices  continuous 

     the lantern punches a hole through the darkness as epps uses
     it like a machete to blaze a trial  he sinks downdown 
     until finally they touch bottom  he unclips himself from the
     rope and jaeger starts down

     the space isnt that big like a small cave really  its 
     tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole
     of it  but its big enough that one wouldnt have any idea
     where to start digging 

     jaeger makes it to the bottom  wes yells down 

                          wes
                you down 

                          jaeger
                yeah were down 

                          wes 
                what do you see 

                          epps
                nothing 

     more to himself

                          eppscont 
                a whole lot of nothing 

                          jaeger 
                so where do we start 

     epps takes a look around then shrugs

                          epps 
                wherever you want 

     epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack  jaeger
     follows suit  he looks around picks a spot and starts
     digging

     he sits up top weapon in hand standing guard

     epps and jaeger  later

     they dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave  they dig
     with a determination to find something

     still up top hes given up on standing guard  now he
     stretches out on the ground sunning himself

     epps and jaeger 

     their shirts are off and theyre caked with sweat and dirt 
     they look like theyve been digging for quite some time 

     they certainly dont have the same enthusiasm they displayed
     previously  now they just seem to dig by rote 

                                                           fade to

     wes  later 

     the sun has begun to sink noticeably  wes leans over the 
     crevice 

                          wes 
                heyhey  suns going down  epps
                jaeger  its getting dark up here

     epps and jaeger  simultaneous 

     its obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come 
     up with nothing  epps keeps digging but just barely 
     jaeger doesnt even bother anymore  he just sits on the
     ground sulking

                          wesoc
                epps

                          jaeger

                          epps

                im not  and im not doing anything
                because theres nothing down here 

                          epps
                get up and dig

                weve been digging  weve been digging
                for hours  if there was anything here to
                find we would have found it 

                          epps 
                get up off your ass and dig 

     sounding defeated as all hell and very whiney

                          jaeger 
                whats the point  theres nothing here
                the maps a fake  christ even i see 
                that now  were just wasting our time
                we might as well give up and 

     epps spins  like a bolt of lightning hes on jaeger
     grabbing him up and pulling him close 

                          epps 
                you listen to me  the whole reason were
                here is because of you and that map of 
                yours  i didnt do all this for nothing
                and im not leaving with nothing  if you
                think for a second im giving up just 
                cause youre too tired to turn over some
                dirt then you dont know john epps too 
                well do you  so you dig and you keep
                on digging til i say you dont have to
                dig anymore

     epps pushes jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard
     a fire burns inside him  a fire that burns out of control
     before he even knows what hes doing jaeger springs to his
     feet shovel in hand bringing it down in a long arc for
     epps head

     epps bears him coming  he deftly side steps the blow grabs
     hold of jaeger and forces him down  they roll around
     violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the
     other into a choke hold 

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     he can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down

                          wes
                what are you doing  what the hell are
                you doing down there 

                                                            cut to

     epps and jaeger 

     they fight on down and dirty  locked together they roll
     around the ground each trying to get the upper hand  they
     smash into the lantern sending the cave into near darkness
     at the same time epps works himself on top of jaeger  he
     lands a couple of solid punches takes a rock from the ground 
     and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into jaegers
     skull  all jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow 

     something catches epps eye  a glint of light flashes across
     his faces  he stares at it at an opening a bare seem
     really in the side of the cave wall where light seeps 
     through  the rock slips from his hand  forgetting all about
     jaeger epps goes to the opening  jaeger himself as if what
     just happened hadnt really happened comes up along side
     epps

                          jaeger 
                must be a compartment 

                          epps 
                i feel air  probably opens up outside 
                somewhere  thats where the light comes 
                from  couldnt see it with the lanternon 

     jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now 

                          jaeger 
                the white dot light in the dark 

     thats all epps needs to hear  he starts clawing at the
     opening with his bare hands  that gets him nothing 
     grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it  jaeger gets 
     the lantern working again then picks up his shovel and joins
     in  they keep hitting and hitting picking up a rhythm like
     a southern chain gang 

                          jaeger cont
                maybe we should blast it loose with the
                claymore 

                          epps
                its giving 

     the rock gives way enough for epps to pry it free  theres
     just enough space for a man to reach his arm through  for a
     beat epps and jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid
     of what mayor may not be in there

     with some trepidation epps begins to move his hand towards 
     the opening  slowly it extends closercloser  just as
     it moves beyond the opening vthere is a wild screeching 
     hiss as some small hairy thing leaps for epps

     both epps and jaeger recoil jaeger going nuts with fear 

                          jaeger
                jesus christ 

     jaeger grabs up his m16 and takes aim atwhatever it is

                          epps 
                no dont shoot 

     too late jaeger squeezes off a few rounds  a couple of
     bullets hit the thing but the rest ricochet wildly about the
     cave and around epps and jaeger  all the two men can do is
     duck and cover  squeezing themselves into tight fetal balls
      as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of
     random death 

     eventually the bullets lose speed and die off  jaeger and
     epps raise up off the ground  they walk to the dead thing
     that jumped from the opening

                          epps 
                its just a mongoose 

                          jaeger
                is it dead 

                          epps
                yeah bwana you got it 

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     yelling down 

                          wes 
                what the hell are you doing

                                                            cut to

     epps and jaeger 

                          jaeger 
                i think we found something 

     they go back to the opening  epps shines a light inside to
     make sure there are no more surprises then reaches an arm
     in  jaeger looks on with great anticipation licking his
     lips like a hungry jackal as epps twists his arm in the
     opening  searchingsearching 

     epps face freezes  he goes perfectly still for a beat then
     slowly draws his hand from the opening  it clutches a wooden
     box  it is similar to jaegers puzzle box but slightly
     bigger  the instant epps sets the box on the ground jaeger
     smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood  from
     the splinters pours a river of gold coins  jaeger and epps
     are too stunned to do anything but look at it 

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     he leans over the crevice

                          wes
                what is it  whatd you find 

                                                            cut to 

     epps and jaeger 

     incredulous himself

                          epps 
                gold  its gold

     jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs

                          jaeger
                its gold 

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     his lips flutter a bit before they land on the word 

                          wes
                gold 

                                                            cut to

     epps and jaeger 

     they scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through
     their fingers

                          jaeger 
                its not like i figured  its cold  and
                its heavier than i imagined 

                          epps 
                i wouldnt know  i never imagined this
                not in my whole life did i ever imagine
                this 

                          jaeger 
                you dont have to imagine it  not 
                anymore  now all youve got to think up 
                is what its going to buy you

     epps grabs up one coin and stands

                          epps
                wes 

     with all his strength epps gives the coin an underhanded toss
     straight up 

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     wes catches the coin  he turns it over in his fingers  he
     smiles and theres nothing pleasant about it

                                                            cut to

     jaeger and epps

     epps yells up 

                          epps 
                wes thrown down a pack

     a beat later an empty pack comes falling down  epps picks it
     up and takes it over to jaeger  the two of them start
     loading the coins into it 

                          eppscont 
                i dont think the line will take the
                weight of a man and the coins
                     yelling up 
                wes  well send the gold up then me

                          wesoc
                ready when you are 

     epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line
     when jaeger grabs his arm 

                          jaeger
                wait 

                          epps

                someones got to send the gold up  it
                cant get on the line by itself 

                          jager 
                whys it got to be me 

     a tense moment passes

                          wes
                what are you doing  you ready 

     another moment then

                          epps

                gold then follow 

                          jaeger 
                yeah  yeah thatll work 

     jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on  hes just
     about ready to climb up when epps stops him  serious as a
     heart attack he says

                          epps 
                if youre even thinking about leaving me
                down here you better think again 

     jaeger stares at epps for a beat then laughs himself a
     little laugh  he yells up

                          jaeger 
                wes im coming up

     jaeger starts to climb as wes helps out by pulling on the 
     rope 

     epps watches him for a bit then looks at the pack of gold
     and the rest of the equipment  suddenly he scurries about
     gathering up all the things theyve brought down

     jaeger continues his climb disappearing up into the crevice
     a few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from 
     above  epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to
     the rope  yelling up

                          epps
                okay 

     the rope goes taught slowly drawing the pack up up into the
     crevice finally to be swallowed from view 

     epps waits for the rope to come back down  he waits  he
     waits a beat more  no rope 

                          eppscont
                wes  jaeger 

     he tries to keep the apprehension from his voice but it
     creeps in anyway  he tries it again

                          eppscont
                jaeger 

     still more nothing  whats that sound  its epps breath
     getting heavier and faster 

                          eppscont
                jaeger 

     nothing  then something  the rope snakes its way back down
     epps cant help but let go of a little laugh like a guy
     whos just been given a scare by his own shadow  taking up 
     his own pack epps hooks up then starts the climb to the top

                                                            cut to

     jaeger and wes 

     they work the rope helping epps up  he gets to the lip of
     the crevice and pulls himself over  hes breathing hard
     and lets his pack slide to the ground  trying not to sound
     too rattled

                          epps 
                what the hell took so long

                          jaeger 
                just had to get the pack unhooked from
                the line  it didnt seem that long

                          epps 
                not when youre up here with the gold i
                guess not 

     throwing epps own words back at him 

                          wes 
                not losing trust are you 

     epps lets this go

                          epps 
                itll be too dark to make our way back
                now  lets bed down for the night and
                head out at first light 

                          wes 
                what about the gold 

                          epps
                what about it 

                          wes 
                maybe we should split it up now 

                          epps 
                we started this together and were 
                staying together so theres no point in
                splitting things up now 

                          wes 
                what if we get separated  way i see it
                if something happens i want to be
                carrying my share

                          jaeger 
                wes might be right about that 

                          epps 
                it stays as it is  were halfway home
                now  lets not blow it by people getting 
                ideas 

                          wes 
                youre the one with all the ideas

                          epps 
                youve had your say wes  now leave it

                          wes 
                maybe youve got ideas of your own for
                the gold  maybe youve already got
                things worked out

                          epps
                maybe i do

                          wes 
                maybe i dont need your ideas  maybe i
                can do better on my own 

     epps sees trouble coming and deals with it the only way he
     knows how  casually he turns from wes as if hes about to
     let things go  suddenly he spins back around throwing a
     punch to wes jaw that sends him to the ground

     wes puts a hand to his mouth  it comes back stained red
     wes goes on the boil 

                          wescont
                you got no reason to do that

                          epps 
                i told you  when i straighten someone 
                out they stay straightened  this is how
                it works  nobody touches the gold
                except when were on the move and 
                someones carrying it nobody so much as
                opens the pack to get an eyeful of it
                agreed 

     jaeger wastes no time jumping in 

                          jaeger 
                yeah  sure  that sounds like a plan to
                me 

     wes still on the ground fumes 

                          wes 
                you got no reason to hit me  im getting
                tired of you and jaeger pushing me around 

                          epps
                then get up and do something about it

     wes thinks about it but thats all he does  hes not ready
     to cross that line yet 

                          eppscont
                then just lay there and bleed 

     epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down  jaeger
     does the same  wes just lays on the groundand bleeds

                                                           fade to

     black

                                                           fade to

     ext mesa  early morning 

     the first light of day barely begins to fight its way through
     the dark  our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled
     with gold  surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well but
     then the last twentyfour hours has taken a lot out of them

     there is a slight sound rocks crunching underneath a foot
     someone stirs someone moves  its hard to tell who it is in 
     this bad light  they creep towards the pack inching their
     way closer and closer  they reach out a hand just about to
     grab the pack

     wes who obviously wasnt asleep at all lunges for the 
     person and takes them down hard  theres the ugly crunch of
     body against stone as they hit the ground  m16 in hand wes
     straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle
     against his head 

                          wes 
                stay down  stay the hell down or i will
                rip your stinking head off 

     underneath him an iraqi soldier  who already looks very
     badly injured bloody cut slightly burned  babbles back in
     high pitched and frightened arabic

     this is enough to wake jaeger and epps 

                          jager
                what the hell

                          wes 
                i caught him  i caught him trying to
                steal the gold 

                          epps
                get off him 

                          wes 
                     slightly crazed 
                he snuck in here thinking we were asleep
                only i wasnt sleeping  would have slit
                our throats if i hadnt stopped him 

                          epps
                get off him 

     epps reaches down and physically pulls wes from the soldier
     who still rattles on 

                          eppscont
                what happened

                          wes 
                i told you  he tried to steal our gold
                he tried to kill us

                          jaeger 
                with what  he doesnt have a weapon 

                          wes 
                hes a soldier  he doesnt need a 
                weapon  hes got rocks  hes got bare
                hands 

     the soldier goes on babbling  wes has had just about enough
     of that  he gives the soldier a kick to the ribs 

                          wescont
                shut up 

     epps gives wes a hard push 

                          epps
                stop it 

                          wes 
                i told you dont push me around 

     even now frightened but more calmly the soldier goes on

                          epps 
                tell me what hes saying

     wes listens but with disdain  he translates

                          wes 
                says hes one of the soldiers that was in
                the helicopter 

                          jaeger 
                he lived through that 

     the soldier goes on and so does wes

                          wes 
                says they were deserters they were 
                afraid to fight dont believe in saddam
                anyway  they flew the gunship up here to
                hide out  when they saw us they figured
                we were going to kill them so they shot
                first 

                          epps 
                whyd he come in our camp 

     wes asks him the question in arabic and gets an answer  its
     enough to give wes a bit of a laugh 

                          wes 
                says he wanted food  liar  he wanted
                the gold 

                          epps 
                hows he going to want the gold  he
                couldnt even know we had it

                          wes

                          jaeger

     jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier

                          wescont 
                i dont care what he says he wanted our
                gold  would have slit our throats if he
                had the chance

                we dont leave him we dont take him
                with us  what does that leave 

     by way of answering wes lifts his m16 and works the action

                          eppscont 
                youre out of your mind

                          wes

                          wes
                were at war 

     the discussion starts to get real heated

                          epps 
                we are not at war  you and i and jaeger
                are awol  we have no authority 

                          wes 
                he tried to kill us  if not just now
                then in the helicopter  thats all the
                authority i need 

     jaeger goes somewhere near panic

                          jaeger
                we dont need to do this  we got the 
                gold all right  lets just get out of
                here 

     the iraqi may not speak the language but hes got a pretty
     good idea what they are arguing about  he starts to plead
     for his life

                          wes 
                im not going to leave him be just so he
                can stab us in the backs the minute we
                turn around  i have been through too
                much to lose it all now just because the
                two of you dont have the stomach to do
                what has to be done 

                          epps 
                ive got no stomach for murder 

                          wes 
                its a combat action 

                          epps 
                its murder and i wont be any part of
                it 

                          wes 
                then step aside 

                          epps
                no 

                          wes 
                get out of my way 

     the iraqis begging goes into over drive  jaeger just about
     loses it

                          jaeger 
                for christs sake we dont need this
                lets just go  lets justlets just
                get out of here 

     wes yells down at the iraqi 

                          wes 
                shut up  shut the hell up 

     wes moves menacingly for the iraqi  he thrusts his m16
     forward  epps grabs it and throws a punch  unlike before 
     with jaeger this time wes ducks the blow and swings the butt
     of the m16 back at epps  its not much of a blow though 
     and epps keeps on coming  he barrels into wes and takes him
     down 

     as the two men tussle the iraqi sees his chance to get away
     he springs up knocking jaeger to the side and bolts past
     him

                          jager 
                hes getting away 

     epps turns and sees this  maybe hes not for killing this 
     guy but he certainly cant just let him get away  he takes
     off running after the iraqi jaeger a step behind 

     the iraqi face flush with fear eyes filled with terror like
     a hunted animal makes it to the rock face and starts to 
     climb to the plateau above  he knows if he can make it he at
     least has a chance of getting away  it shows in the
     desperation he climbs with 

     epps and jaeger are right behind him  they claw at the
     rocks but cant gain ground

     the iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau to freedom
     our two soldiers scramble up right behind him

     the iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau  hes just
     about to pull himself up  hes just about to get away 

     we hear a short burst of gunfire  three large bloody holes
     mushroom open in the iraqis back

                                                            cut to

     wes 

     he stands smoke curling from the muzzle of his m16 like a 
     white snake having just send the iraqi some bullets special
     delivery 

                                                            cut to

     the iraqi 

     he arches stiffens then falls like a stone past epps and
     jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes

     as the two climb down wes goes to the body and stands over it
     like the great white hunter standing over his kill  all
     business like he says

                          wes 
                i had to  you saw how he ran  would
                have given us away  i had to 

     theres a beat of quiet then 

                          jaeger 
                maybe we ought toyou know bury him
                say some words over him 

                          wes 
                you want to say some words 

     he sneers down at the body

                          wescont 
                go to hell  how are those words 

     wes moves off  a beat later jaeger walks away  epps just
     stands there looking at the body 

                                                            cut to

     ext mesa  later 

     wes epps and jaeger are making the trek back down  jaeger 
     is shouldering the pack with the gold  wes has got his m16 
     epps stops and puts his pack down  he takes out the navicom
     and a recon photo 

                          epps
                we should head northeast 

                          jaeger 
                northeast  thats away from the hummer
                further into iraqi

                          epps 
                theres another pass on the photo  we 
                can avoid that narrow one we had to cross
                on the way up and it should get us back
                down 

                          jaeger 
                it should or it will  least going back
                the way we came we know what were up
                against 

                          epps 
                you think you can make that pass weighted
                down when you almost fell the first time
                youre wrong and youre not going to 
                take my share of the gold with you trying
                it  were heading northeast 

     really calm cold and direct wes says

                          wes
                youve got an awful lot of orders in you
                always giving orders 

                          epps 
                i out rank you thats why 

                          wes 
                in the service you do but were not 
                particularly in the service right now
                way i see it what were doing that 
                doesnt particularly give you the right
                to toss orders around 

     epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring wes 

                          epps 
                we been down this road  i told you how
                it is  unless you feel like theres
                something you want to do about it 

                          wes
                what if i do 

     epps says nothing so wes tries it again a little harder 

                          wescont
                what if i do 

     he works the action of his m16 

                          wescont 
                you talk loud and dont even have a big
                stick to back it up with 

     real casual epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the
     pin loose  he stands with the grenade in one hand and the
     navicom in the other  real calm like he was talking about
     the weather

                          epps 
                something happens to me i let go of this
                grenade  i go and i take the navicom
                with me  and how do you suppose youre 
                going to find your way back to the hummer
                when you wont even know whats up or 
                down  its a big country and you could
                be heading for the allies or wandering 
                right into bhagdad  thats if you dont
                die of thirst before you even get that
                far  how you like my stick now 

     epps and wes have a stare down  jaeger whos getting really
     good at freaking out jumps in 

                          jaeger 
                why dont you put the gun down all 
                right wes  you put the gun down and 
                eppsll put the pin back in the grenade
                wont you epps 

     the stare down goes on a beat longer  finally wes lowers his
     rifle  he turns to jaeger and vents what anger he can 

                          wes 
                im starting to think youre a real
                bitch you know that

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  later 

     the camera pans over the vast expanse of nothingness  smoke 
     begins to drift into frame  the camera finally lands on the
     shiite encampment or at least whats left of it  tents are
     torn down and burned goods scattered  it looks like a ghost
     town  epps wes and jaeger wander into it  they look
     around but see no signs of life 

     wes grabs up some shiite garments white robes and starts
     to put them on 

                          jaeger 
                youre going to burn up in those 

                          wes 
                the white reflects the sun it keeps you
                cooler  thats why they wear them 

     jaeger looks to epps who just shrugs  jaeger gets some robes
     and puts them on  epps follows suit 

                          jaeger 
                think the iraqis killed them all

                          wes 
                probably shot a few  scattered the rest
                murderers 

                          epps
                     pointed 
                murder or a combat action  its hard to
                tell them apart 

     they keep on moving passing straight through the camp  epps
     marches ahead not wanting to even deal with the other two 
     men  wes talks after him  really he talks more to himself
     and hes not sounding too lucid 

                          wes 
                you saw how he ran didnt you  first
                chance he got he ran out  would have
                gone straight to his co told him all 
                about the gold  what do you think would
                have happened then huh  then what do 
                you think would have happened  two 
                thousand screaming iraqis bearing down on
                us  you ought to thank me for killing 
                him  ill get a medal for it  watch and
                see if i dont get a medal 

     epps isnt even paying attention hes just walking on 
     almost as if he senses something is wrong he stops in his
     tracks  he looks down at his feet and sees the most curious
     thing  sand is rushing away from his feet almost as if its
     going down a drain  he looks at it with the same wonderment
     that a dog watches television 

                          epps 
                what the hell 

     epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a
     moment later the earth literally drops from beneath his feet
     hes standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in
     loose sand  immediately he sinks to waist level  he slows
     there but still goes down with rapidity  he screams to 
     jaeger and wes

                          eppscont
                help  help me 

     jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole  wes
     doesnt move 

                          eppscont
                help me

     jaeger is paralyzed by indecision  he doesnt want to let
     epps drown but if he gets too close he could easily get 
     sucked into  he flirts back and forth between rescue and
     safety 

     sand continues to pour in on epps 

                          eppscont 
                for christs sake jaeger  help me
                help me 

     jaeger cant fight himself any longer  he lowers himself
     halfway into the hole stretching spread eagle trying to keep
     some kind of grip on the firmer ground and reaches for epps 

     their arms twist and strain for each others  first their 
     fingers meet then they grab hands  they work a grip down to
     their wrist but thats all they can get  jaeger strains 
     like a field horse pulling epps against the sand  it may not
     be enough as he begins to slip down himself  jaeger twists
     his head and looks up at wes  straining to say anything he
     pleads 

                          jaeger
                weswes 

     his words fall on deaf ears  wes just takes a step closer to
     the pack of gold coins 

     this only serves to energize jaeger  he digs deeper within
     himself finding an untapped reserve of strength  he grunts
     and pulls the veins on his neck puffing like balloons 

     epps finds same purchase  he pulls swims his way up from
     the sand  a little at first but like hitting shallow water
     hes able to lift himself up 

     jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground  they
     collapse chests heaving like pistons as they suck air 

     as epps regains strength he pats himself down  suddenly he
     goes back into a panic 

                          epps
                the navicom

     epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft
     sand frantically looking for the lost computer  jaeger joins
     in  they dig and scrape as best they can but daring to
     venture only so far into the soft sand  it doesnt matter
     the navicom is lost 

                          jaeger 
                what are we going to do  how are we
                going to find our way back 

                          epps 
                well find our way 

                          jaeger
                how 

                          epps 
                well find our way  well 

     epps wants to say how but hes got no idea  wes grows a
     smug smile 

                          wes 
                no navicom  a lot of good you are now
                epps 

                          epps 
                lot of good you were when i was sinking
                in the sand 

                          wes 
                without that navicam looks to me like you
                forfeit the right to be in charge 

                          epps 
                and let me guess who is 

     wes casually slides out his m16

                          wes 
                im the ones got the big stick 

                          epps 
                suppose i dont go for that 

                          wes 
                then i suppose itd be insurrection and
                i suppose id have to kill you
                     beat
                i suppose 

                          epps 
                what about jaeger 

                          wes 
                nothing about him unless hes got a
                problem about me dealing with you 

                          jaeger 
                yeah i got a problem with you killing epps 

     wes turns and glares at jaeger who backs down 

                          jaegercont
                i mean in principle 

                          wes 
                     sneering 
                you know jaeger you really are a bitch 

     epps isnt wasting anymore time  when wes turns to glower at
     jaeger he lunges up for him  wes side steps epps and lands 
     the but of his rifle into the side of epps head  it opens a
     wound and sends epps back down to the ground 

     epps looks up right into the muzzle of west m16  full of
     poison 

                          wescont
                you die 

     wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot 
     rings out  wes body jerks like hes just been hit in the
     back with a truck  the way cut timber falls he slams to the
     ground motionless 

     epps and jaeger stare at the body for a beat then snap their
     heads in the direction of the shot 

     up on a dune behind them are a group of shiites on 
     horseback  one of them has a high powered rifle which he has
     just used to drill wes  he fires another shot  it pings to
     the ground between epps and jaeger 

     our two remaining men scramble  jaeger dives for the gold 
     and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it
     the two take off running as best they can in the sand  they
     run wildly erratically without looking back  they run
     until their bodies scream no more then keep going on 
     inertia  reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and
     collapse in a heap at the bottom  they take a moment to
     catch what breath they can then 

                          epps 
                we got to go back  we got to go back for
                wes 

                          jaeger
                forget wes 

                          epps
                we cant just leave him 

                          jaeger
                wes is dead 

                          epps 
                what if hes not 

                          jaeger 
                then he will be when those iraqis get to
                him  he was going to kill you  he was 
                one blink away from it  hes dead epps
                and im sure as hell not getting my head
                blow off over his carcass 

     they sit there trying to catch their breath  as they do a
     sound comes from the distance  they freeze ears cocked
     trying to figure out what it is 

                          jaegercont
                its a helicopter 

     quickly desperately as the sound of the chopter draws 
     closer they scan the horizon looking for it  jaeger spots
     it and thrusts a finger in its direction 

                          jagercont
                there 

     epps scrambles out his binoculars  he targets the
     helicopter  jaeger waits in high anticipation 

                          jaegercont
                ours or theirs 

     epps cant make out for sure  jaeger asks again with growing
     anxiety 

                          jaegercont 
                ours or theirs

     epps takes a long hard stare

                          epps 
                ours  its one of ours  weve got to
                signal them let them know were down
                here 

     the instant jaeger hears this his face twists up like hes
     thinking something and he doesnt like what it is hes
     thinking  quietly almost to himself 

                          jaeger
                no

                          epps 
                we need something  a flare a signal
                mirror 

     again jaeger says it this time including epps too 

                          jaeger
                no 

                          epps 
                what do you mean no  they can fly us home 

                          jaegercont 
                theyll ask questions want to know why
                we were out here 

                          epps
                well lie 

                          jaeger 
                theyll search the pack 

     epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets  he stands ready
     to signal the chopter 

                          jaegercont
                theyll find the gold 

     epps turns sharply back to jaeger

                          epps 
                were lost you understand that  weve
                got no navicom and no means to find a
                way back  so right now i dont give a 
                damn about the gold because if we dont 
                get off this desert and out of iraqi all
                its going to be good for is buying us
                tombstones 

     epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter  hes
     about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an m16
     action being worked  epps turns to face jaeger 

                          jaeger 
                i cant do it epps  not when were so 
                close  i cant let you ruin everything 

     epps just stares at jaeger not frightened but surprisingly
     calm

                          epps 
                first wes now you 

                          jaeger 
                im not like wes  wes was crazy

                          epps 
                     sarcastic 
                and you youve got it all together 

                          jaeger 
                i dont want it this way  i wouldnt 
                kill you just to kill you but i cant 
                let you lose the gold for me  not when
                were so close 

                          epps 
                that helicopter passes and the only
                thing were close to is death 

     jaeger is unfazed  very politely he says

                          jaeger
                sit down epps 

     epps takes him up on the offer  what choice does he have
     the camera stays tight on the two men  they dont talk
     they dont move  they just sit as we hear the sound of the
     helicopter getting closer and louder  it reaches a
     crescenoo then begins to fade until it disappears  the
     chopter is gone along with epps and jaegers best chance of 
     getting out of the desert alive 

     jaeger lowers his rifle  very genuinely he says

                          jaegercont 
                im sorry about that epps 

                          epps
                is it all right if i stand up 

     like he didnt know he was keeping epps from something 

                          jaeger 
                oh yeah  go ahead 

     epps stands  he looks around trying to figure things out 
     not much to figure  there still in the middle of a desert in
     a hostile country same as they ever were 

                          jaegercont 
                im glad i didnt have to kill you  im
                glad it didnt come to that 

                          epps 
                yeah  well me too 

                          jaeger 
                i never killed anybody before  i talk a
                good game but im not like that 

                          epps
                sure 

                          jaeger 
                really im not  remember how i was 
                talking i wanted to blow away all those
                iraqis  thats all it was was talk  i
                was scared out of my mind to go to war
                i still havent gotten over stepping on
                that land mine 

                          epps 
                you still got a map on you 

                          jaeger
                what  yeah 

     jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to epps 
     epps looks them over then looks over the terrain  without
     any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be
     finger paintings

                          jaegercont
                epps 

                          epps
                yeah 

                          jaeger 
                i dont want to die 

                          epps 
                makes two of us 

                          jaeger 
                i know what i did just now was crazy but
                you got to understand how much i want
                that gold 

                          epps 
                its all right  i dont like it but
                its over now 

                          jaeger 
                i never had anything before epps  i
                never was anybody  not the kind of 
                somebody you can be with a pocket full of
                gold coins  when i was in high school i 
                used to 

     fed up with jaeger epps turns on him hard

                          epps 
                hey you know what  can i be honest with
                you  right now im not all that 
                interested in how youre messed up cause
                you didnt get the bicycle you wanted for
                your thirteenth birthday  what im 
                interested in is how i can keep from
                getting dead  and listening to sob 
                stories from some           about how the
                system wasnt good to him because he had
                to work like everybody else instead of
                being born a kennedy doesnt do a damn 
                thing to help keep me alive  so do me a 
                favor either shut up orjust shut up 

     jaeger isnt sure what to say 

                          jaeger
                sorry 

                          epps 
                damn 

     epps sits down in the sand all out of ideas  theres a long
     quiet before jaeger says

                          jaeger 
                what do you think our chances are 

                          epps 
                if we can find the hummer or some 
                friendlies by sundown we might be okay 
                weve got enough water for that  but we
                wont make another day otherwise 

     again they sit for a beat

                          jaeger
                wonder how the wars going 

                          epps 
                its got to be going better than this 

     epps stands and has a last look around 

                          eppscont 
                all right  pick a direction 

     jaeger just gives a surprised look 

                          eppscont 
                we cant just sit here  weve got to
                start moving so pick 

                          jaeger 
                you sure you want me too 

     epps nods  jaeger stands and takes a good look around  he
     considers things although there isnt much to consider
     finally he decisively points in a direction 

                          jaegercont
                i pick that way 

                          epps 
                okay  then we go this way 

     epps heads off in the opposite direction 

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  later 

     epps and jaeger make the long march across the sand  theres
     so much nothing out there its maddening 

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  later 

     epps drops down in the sand  he lets his pack slide fram his 
     back then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig  he puts
     his pack back on and struggles to his feet  as jaeger
     crosses he takes epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him
     up  the two wade on 

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  evening 

     epps and jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day 
     they look worn out but they keep moving  jaeger is several
     paces behind epps 

                          jaeger
                getting cold

                          epps 
                its a desert  thats what deserts do at
                night they get cold 

                          jaeger 
                eppsepps  im gonna stop for a
                second 

                          epps
                no 

                          jaeger 
                just let me rest for a second 

                          epps 
                weve got to keep moving while theres
                still light 

                          jaeger 
                you know what im going to do  im just
                going to take a second  i want to look
                at the gold 

                          epps 
                dont you touch it 

                          jaeger 
                i just want to look at it  remind me of
                what im dying for 

                          epps 
                the deal was no one touches it until we
                get out of here 

                          jaeger 
                yeah but we made that deal while wes was
                still alive  hes gone  time for a new
                deal 

     jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it
     epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist
     and forcing jaeger to let go of the pack 

                          epps 
                you listen to me  ififwe get out of
                this i dont care what you do with your 
                share but until then youve only got one
                thing to think about and thats staying 
                alive  so you leave that gold alone or
                you and i are going to have to have a
                serious talk 

     epps waits for a response from jaeger but gets none 

     jaegers eyes seem to be glazed and his stare fixed on a
     point well beyond epps  he raises a hand points off into 
     the distance 

                          jaeger
                look 

     epps turns and looks  off a ways is a light in the window of
     what looks to be a shacktype building  epps stares at it as
     if it were the holy grail 

                          jaegercont 
                what do you figure it is 

                          epps 
                place all alone like that  must be a
                boarder check point 

                          jaeger 
                which boarder  saudi  kuwait  syria 

                          epps 
                couldnt be syria  we couldnt have gone
                that far north  its got to be saudi
                come on 

     epps heads for the shack doing double time  jaeger puts the
     pack back on and races to catch up 

                          eppscont 
                theyve got to have water  well get 
                same water some directions maybe they
                even have a vehicle 

                          jaeger
                epps 

                          epps 
                we can head back for our lines and they
                dont even have to know about the gold 

                          jaeger 
                epps  what if theyre not saudi 

     epps stops dead now not more than one hundred meters from
     the shack 

                          jaegercont 
                if its a checkpoint it could be iraqi 

     epps considers this

                          epps 
                weve got no cboice  either way weve
                got no choice 

     epps and jaeger keep on for the shack walking with
     apprehension now instead of running  epps stops less than
     fifty meters away 

                          jaeger
                well 

                          epps 
                well we should identify ourselves 

                          jaeger 
                yeah i guess we should 

     epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack
     instead he turns to jaeger 

                          epps 
                even if they are iraqis probably all
                theyll do is take us prisoner for
                awhile  got to figure were still 
                kicking their asses in the war  they
                dont want any trouble

                          jaeger 
                hell theyll probably just surrender to
                us  probably 

     again epps takes a deep breath  and again just as hes about 
     to cry out he turns to jaeger 

                          epps
                thats if the war is even still going on
                way things were shaping up its probably
                long over 

                          jaeger
                probably 

     epps takes a beat then sucks in a breath  he yells for the
     shack 

                          epps
                hellooooo 

     before epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun 
     fire erupts from the house and burns towards epps and jaeger
     they dive for cover hugging the ground as bullets whistle 
     and ping through the space around them  they are forced back
     and down against a narrow stretch of rock but it offers 
     little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead  its 
     just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them
     and death  at the top of his lungs jaeger starts yelling 

                          jaegerashra ka mahari dahra sahib  ashra ka
                mahari dahra sahibjust as quickly as it began the shooting stops  from the
     shack we hear some chatter in arabic then the door opens  a
     few men appear in the doorway  they laugh and beckon for
     epps and jaeger to join them 

                          epps 
                what did you say 

                          jaeger 
                i dont know  something wes had taught
                me  i think it means dont shoot
                were your friends 

                          epps 
                they must be saudis  its a saudi 
                checkpoint  oh sweet jesus  come on
                come on 

     epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack  jaeger is
     just steps behind him 

     they enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the four
     men inside  epps and jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and
     go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on
     chattering behind them 

                          jager 
                oh man this is good  what do you think
                the chances are theyve got a whirlpool
                in this place 

     as they rub their hands together epps looks up  he freezes
     hanging on the wall is a very handsome nicely framed 
     portrait of saddam hussein  epps nudges jaeger who also
     looks up  he also freezes 

                          jaegercont
                oh god 

                          epps 
                they must have thought we were iraqi when
                you yelled to them  they couldnt tell
                in the dark 

                          jaeger
                what are we going to do 

     epps thinks  what are they going to do

                          epps 
                slip out your m16 

                          jaeger
                and then what 

                          epps 
                and then shoot them 

                          jaeger 
                ii never killed anyone before  i told
                you that 

                          epps 
                well youre going to start with a bang
                cause youve got four of them to take down 

     behind epps and jaeger one of the iraqis asks a question of
     them in arabic 

                          jaeger 
                cant you 

                          epps 
                i dont have a weapon 

     again the iraqi asks the question  we can tell by the tone
     of his voice he expects an answer 

                          eppscont
                dont go bitch on me now  you were going
                to kill me  kill them 

                          jaeger 
                i just said i would  i dont think i 

                          epps
                shoot them 

     the iraqis sense that something is wrong  they move
     menacingly for their weapons 

                          eppscont
                shoot them jaeger  shoot them 

     jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his m16  he 
     jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth back 
     and forth 

     dig it  the iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of 
     the muzzle flashes  they do the twist they do the jerk
     then they all fall down 

     the bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the
     place shredding walls eating up wood 

     jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty  he stands 
     huffing eyes glazed like hes a million miles away from what
     he just did  epps steps up and takes the weapon from jaeger
     thats like an alarm clock that brings jaeger back to the 
     land of the living  jaeger takes one look around at all the
     carnage then doubles over and gets to puking 

     epps just watches this pathetic sight  when jaeger is all
     done 

                          eppscont
                lets get some sleep 

                                                           fade to 

     black 

                                                           fade to

     int shack  morning 

     the sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as 
     jaeger comes awake  the second he does he sees a man  arab
     wearing white robes  peering through the window  jaeger 
     gives a start and the man disappears  jaeger quickly shakes
     epps awake 

                          jaeger 
                eppepps  theres someone at the
                window

     this wakes epps up quick 

                          epps
                an iraqi 

                          jaeger 
                i dont know  he didnt have a uniform 
                on  hehe had on white robes like the
                guys who killed wes

     epps does some quick figuring then staying low scrambles
     across the floor to one of the dead iraqis and grabs up his
     weapon  he grabs another one tosses it to jaeger

     carefully still low epps creeps over to the window  slowly
     he raises up and looks out 

                          jagercont
                see anything 

                          epps
                nothing 

     epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking 

                          jaeger
                what do we do 

                          epps 
                we cant stay here  even if that wasnt
                an iraqi soldier its only a matter of
                time before some show up  get all the 
                water you can carry and well head out
                on foot 


                          jaeger 
                to where 

                          epps 
                sun rises in the east  we go the
                opposite direction  may not find 
                anything but at least well know were
                heading towards saudi arabia 

     as jaeger gathers up what water he can find creeps for
     the door  with the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a
     crack and peers out  still nothing  its like the man
     vanished into thin air 

     jaeger stocked up on water comes over with the gold and
     epps pack which epps shoulders

                          eppscont
                ready 

     jaeger nods  epps opens the door and the two men carefully
     snake their way out weapons at the ready  it seems though
     there is nothing to be ready for  there is no one around 

     suddenly the man appears from around the shack  epps and
     jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons but
     they do not fire  the man just stands  he doesnt say
     anything he makes no threatening moves  the three stay 
     still as statues for several beats until epps jerks his head
     indicating to jaeger they should move on  that they do
     weapons still on the man until they are beyond his range

     they walk on a little ways  jaeger spots something and
     thrusts a finger in its direction

                          jaeger
                look 

     mounted on a horse riding on a dune that runs parallel to
     them is another arab man  he makes no effort to draw nearer
     to epps and jaeger but nor does he lose them

                          jaegercont
                what do we do 

                          epps 
                we keep going thats what we do  we
                ignore them maybe they ignore us

     as if to be contrary to epps statement another two arabs on
     horse back appear up over a dune before them

                          jaeger
                jesus  how many of them are there 

     epps doesnt know and he doesnt want to find out  they 
     change direction heading away from the arabs  but again more
     arabs ride up over a dune  epps gets the feeling he and
     jaeger are about to be boxed in 

                          epps 
                i dont like this  lets go 

     epps breaks into a run  jaeger is only steps behind him 

     like something out of an old john ford western dozens of 
     mounted arabs suddenly appear over a dune  they ride fast 
     and hard for epps and jaeger like apaches heading for a wagon
     train  they easily overtake our two momentarily swallowing
     them amongst the thundering hoofs and ride on a bit as if
     playing with them 

     epps and jaeger stop then bolt in the other direction  the
     arabs ride back again past epps and jaeger swiping them to
     the ground the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over
     them  it looks like a cattle round up and our two are the
     cattle 

     epps and jaeger get up to make another run of it and again
     the arabs bear down on them  this time they mean business
     they completely surround them cutting off all means of 
     escape  the arabs start screaming something back and forth
     in arabic  we dont know what but it sounds unpleasant 

     epps and jaeger come skidding to a halt  they turn in their
     tracks digging in the scene  it goes like this  they are
     completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force
     doesnt get any simpler 

     epps and jaeger drop their weapons  their hands go in the
     air 

                                                            cut to

     ext shiite camp  later 

     the mounted arabs lead epps and jaeger hands tied before 
     them and almost literally being towed by the horses into 
     their camp  it is similar to the shiite camps weve seen
     before with several tent dwellings 

     as the party enters groups of shiites come over to stare at
     epps and jaeger  they chatter amongst themselves but our 
     boys have no idea what theyre talking about and that just
     makes things all the scarier

     from our boys point of view this is all like an unending
     nightmare  being dragged along through a desert not knowing
     the language not knowing whats going to happen  their 
     world skews and slides as if they were on a tiltawhirl 

     finally they reach a tent  one of the arabs tosses epps and
     jaegers packs on the ground just before it  another cuts
     them loose and shoves them inside the tent then yells 
     something at them in arabic  he leaves and our two are
     alone 

                          jaeger 
                what do you make of them 

                          epps 
                shiites i think 

                          jaeger

                know

                maybemaybe if we traded them the gold
                if we gave it to them they might let us
                live they might not kill us 

     from oc we hear a voice

                          voiceoc
                i always knew you were a bitch

     epps and jaegers hearts seize up and stop  its as if
     theyve heard the voice of a ghost and they have  its wes
     he carries with him the pack of gold  epps can barely get
     his name out

                          epps
                wes

                          jaeger
                you were shot  we were standing right
                there you were shot

                          wes
                in the flack jacket  still like getting
                hit in the back with a baseball bat
                took the air right out of me but i was
                just unconscious for awhile  course
                you didnt stick around to find that out
                you left me for dead

                          epps
                we thought

     like a guy who just took two steps over the edge

                          wes
                you left me for dead

     ohhh shit  somebodys crazy  epps gets the feeling theres
     not going to be much dialog going on here  wes gets real
     calm again which is almost as scary as him acting nuts

                          wescont
                when my shiite friends saw that they had
                shot an american they were very
                apologetic  turns out weve been kicking
                ass in this little war  they figure
                weve finally gotten saddam off their
                backs  they brought me to their camp
                cleaned me up fed me im their new
                best buddy  america number one joe
                but theres something the shiites cant
                figure out  they cant figure out why my
                two buddies two fellow americans left
                me out in the desert  they cant seem to
                figure out what those same two guys were
                doing in an iraqi outpost  its almost
                as if they were iraqi spies or
                something  and ive got to tell you they
                hate anything thats got to do with the
                iraqis  see how i mean

                          jaeger 
                we had to take shelter in the checkpoint
                jesus wes i killed the iraqis in there 

                          wes 
                you actually got around to killing 
                someone  im impressed  i guess youre
                only half a bitch 

                          epps 
                wes we thought you were dead and we 
                thought we were next  hanging around to
                get killed wouldnt have done anyone any
                good 

                          wes 
                sure and i guess it was just convenient
                there was one less person to split the
                gold with 

                          epps
                wes 

                          wes 
                look i know you guys are telling the 
                truth  its just the shiites dont know
                that  i guess you could tell thembut 
                then you dont speak the language do you

     wes gets right up into jaegers face 

                          wescont
                do you 

     of course wes knows they dont  he allows himself a very
     sweet shit eating grin 

                          wescont 
                theyre going to kill you slow  ill see
                to that 

     he steps away and starts to open the pack of gold 

                          wescont 
                thanks for taking care of this for me

                          epps 
                tell me something wes  are you crazy
                greedy or just stupid  jaeger says
                youre crazy 

                          jaeger 
                i didnt say that  i never said 

                          epps 
                me  i say you dont have enough brains
                to be stupid 

     for a second wes is taken by surprise by the statement but
     he smiles at epps boldness  he sets down the pack of gold
     and gets right up into epps face 

                          wes 
                you disappoint me epps  always figured
                you to be a man a real bright guy  i
                had respect for you 

                          epps 
                that why you tried to put a bullet in my
                head in the middle of the desert

                          wes 
                thats just what things came to 
                sometimes you cant help that  it 
                doesnt change me respecting you  and
                now you let me down  i expected more
                from you you know  i really did  i 
                expected you to 

     a knife slides up into frame until the the tip rests just
     under wes throat choking off his words 

     now its epps turn to go smug 

                          epps 
                you expect this 

     wes got nothing to say  to jaeger

                          eppscont
                get the gold 

     jaeger grabs up the pack 

                          eppscont
                     to wes 
                now lets try things another way  lets
                try this  you and me and jaeger are
                going to walk out of here  were going
                to walk out all smiling and friendly so 
                your little shiite buddies wont suspect
                a thing  then were going to hop on some
                horses and ride away and live happily 
                ever after  its all going to happen
                just like that because if it doesnt 
                then im going to gut you like a fat pig
                you understand mesoldier 

     wes says nothing

                          eppscont 
                ill take that as a yes 

     epps gruffly spins wes around and presses the knife up
     against his back so that it is hidden 

     epps marches wes outside the tent stopping momentarily to
     grab up his pack with his free hand  to jaeger he says 

                          eppscont
                get the water

     jaeger does as hes told 

                          wes 
                theyll kill you  you wont make it ten
                feet before they cut you down 

                          epps 
                you dont know john epps very well do
                you

                          jaeger 
                can you ride a horse 

                          epps 
                no but i figure nows a real good time
                to start 

     they walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses
     they pass a shiite who says something to wes in arabic
     epps gives wes a poke in the back with the knife 

                          eppscont
                dont say anything 

     the shiite obviously expecting an answer says whatever it
     was he said again 

                          eppscont
                just keep quiet 

                          wes 
                i have to answer him

                          epps
                so you can give us away 

                          wes 
                if i dont answer hell know somethings
                up

     epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time

                          epps 
                you answer him but you answer him wrong
                and youre going to be staring at your
                insides while youre dying 

     wes very calmly says something to the shiite  the shiite 
     just stands there for a beat looking at the three men then
     suddenly explodes in screams  no way of knowing for sure
     what hes saying but since hes going off like a westec
     alarm its a pretty good bet hes been tipped of

     epps rears back a fist and slams it into wes face

                          eppscont
                bastard 

     epps and jaeger take off running for the horses practically
     leaping into the saddles as shiites come pouring out of 
     their tents  forgetting himself wes screams in english 

                          wes
                stop them 

     jaeger and epps spur their horses and take off riding hard
     its amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry shiites
     are chasing you

     wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by shiite and mounts
     up with blood in his eyes  he leads a charge of armed 
     mounted shiites that looks like a posse going after some bad
     men 

     out front epps and jaeger pull up for a second

                          jaeger
                they coming 

     epps takes a look behind him  he cant hardly miss the
     sandstorm wes and the shiites kick up as they ride for them 

                          epps 
                oh yeah  theyre coming 

     epps points off to some foothills in the distance  its the
     only thing close to cover for miles around

                          eppscont 
                ride for the hills  well try to lose 
                them

     they take the reigns to their horses and get to riding

     behind them wes yells to his riders and signals for them to
     split up and try to cut off epps and jaeger

     epps and jaeger hit the hills  they ride up for a bit then
     stop to spot wes  wes and his crew are better riders and 
     have closed the gap  all the two can do now is try to lose
     them in the terrain

     epps and jaeger ride as best they can and somewhat 
     erratically to cover their trail  they head up a ways then
     cut across in a parallel direction  jaeger looks back but
     sees no sign of wes 

                          jaeger
                we lost them 

     just as the words leave jaegers mouth a hail of bullets 
     explodes the ground before them  their horses rear up and
     its all they can do to fight them  just ahead are the
     shiites who split off from wes having circled around epps
     and jaeger 

     the two yank their horses back and ride hard in the opposite
     direction with the shiites just behind  they fire on epps
     and jaeger the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them 

     epps and jaeger are little more than passengers on their
     horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs  and good
     for it too otherwise they might be dead by now  they break
     for a trail that leads further up the mountain but it
     does little to shake loose their pursuers 

     as epps and jaeger level out they can see the trail below
     them and wes and his posse riding for them  our two start
     back the way they came but the other shiites crest the
     hill

                          jaegercont
                which way 

     epps looks from side to side  either way is certain death
     then he looks off towards an embankment  it is very steep
     very treacherous 

     it would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment 
     safely  all epps knows is there arent any gun totting
     shiites in that direction 

                          jaegercont
                which way do we go 

                          epps
                we go this way 

     fear gives way to desperation  both men whip their steeds
     hard  the beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild
     ride down  both epps and jaeger have to lean back in their
     saddles until theyre almost parallel to the ground just to
     stay on their horses 

     wes sees this and swears  he signals to his men to cut back
     the other way 

     epps reaches the bottom of the embankment  jaeger is almost
     there when he looses control of his horse  both rider and
     animal go tumbling in an ugly fall 

                          eppscont
                jaeger

     the horse gets up and bolts off before jaeger can get to her 

     just then wes and his men make it back down the trail and
     start riding hard for jaeger

     epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen
     comrade  as he rides in he leans to the side and low
     stretching out an arm epps literally scoops jaeger and
     swings him up behind him  a couple of rodeo performers
     couldnt have done it better 

     problem is with the extra weight they cant go very fast
     wes and his men close hard now  the bullets fly fast and
     furious swarming all around our boys

     epps whips the horse trying to get everything shes got to
      give  this is it  they get away now or not at all  their
     horse finds a little something extra  she goes faster
     faster

     suddenly epps pulls up hard on the reins  the horse rears
     up she goes wild  it takes everything epps has to control
     her  but better that than if shed taken another stride
     theyve come to the edge of a very very sharp cliff  epps
     may be a good rider for a novice but no way he could get
     this beast to fly 

     finally he calms the horse down but it doesnt matter  wes
     and the shiites ride up behind them cutting them off  wes
     stands down from his horse

     epps and jaeger with nowhere to go do the same 

                          wes
                the gold give it to me

     epps takes the pack from jaeger but doesnt throw it to wes

                          wescont
                give it to me 

                          epps 
                if i give it to you will you let us go 

     wes smiles and lies so badly he doesnt even bother trying to
     fake it 

                          wes 
                sure  whatever you want  for old time
                sake

     epps has got no choice really  he tosses the pack to wes 
     feet who stoops to pick it up  wes starts to open the pack

                          wescont
                looks like at the end of the day we 
                finally find out whos better than who 
                dont we epps  like i said i expected
                more from you 

                          epps
                its like i said you dont really know
                lieutenant john epps very well do you 

     wes rips open the pack  hes got about one second to see
     whats inside  no gold  just a booby trapped claymore mine

     epps grabs jaeger and yanks to him to the ground 

     there is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily
     destroys wes and a few of the shiite standing next to him
     the rest along with the horses scatter for dear life

     epps stays down until the coast is clear then gets up
     jaeger to say the least is stunned 

                          eppscont
                damn it  we lost the horses

                          jaeger
                thethe gold 

                          epps 
                it wasnt the gold  it was the claymore
                mine  the golds in my pack

                          jaeger
                when did you make the switch

                          epps 
                its always been like that  when you 
                left me down in the crevice to send the
                gold up i figured id bettertake 
                precautions  i rigged it to blow if 
                anyone opened the pack  just in case 
                somebody thought they could do better on
                their own 

                          jaeger
                but

                          epps 
                we had a deal  no one touches the gold
                until were out of here  no one breaks
                the deal no one had anything to worry
                about

                          jaeger 
                what if it hadnt been wes  what ifi
                mean accidently what if i had 

                          epps
                you shouldnt think about things like
                that  itll just make you crazy

                          jaeger
                well 

                          epps

                like youre hurt  when the car stops i
                run over to the driver and put a gun to
                his head

                          epps

                doesnt stop 

                          epps 
                then im a rich man 

     epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car  the
     only thing he gets is more quiet  jaeger sits next to him
     after a couple of beats 

                          jaeger
                epps 

                          epps
                yeah 

                          jaeger 
                i want you to know i dont know  i
                just think youre a hell of a guy 

                          epps
                thanks 

                          jaeger 
                this whole time youve kept your head
                you didnt go money simple like me and 
                wes  youve just been trying to figure
                how to get us out of here  and youve
                been fair too  i mean even after 
                iyou know 

                          epps 
                threatened to blow my brains out 

                          jaeger 
                yeah  even after that  you didnt take
                it out on me except for maybe making me
                lie in the middle of the road now  but
                id say youve been very fair  i just 
                think its a hell of a man who can keep
                from going money simple 

                          epps 
                dont make so much out of it  only
                reason i havent figured a way to get all
                that money for myself is because ive
                been too busy figuring ways to stay 
                alive  believe me if i had a minute to
                catch my breath i might have played 
                things the way you and wes had  im no 
                better than anybody else  ive just been
                busier

                thats what i hear  dont matter  girls
                go crazy everywhere for a man with gold 

     from the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor  it
     draws closer and closer 

     epps and jaeger stand  knowing theyre so close to the end
     of a long adventure they become very business like

                          jaeger 
                well this is it  we get the car find 
                some americans  we find americans well

                well make up some kind of lie  they
                wont find the gold 

     epps and jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car
     draws closer 

                          jaeger
                okay  see you in a minute

     jaeger goes out and lays in the cars path  epps goes to
     hide behind some rocks

     the car keeps getting closer and closer

     jaeger yells over to epps 

                          jaegercont
                epps i dont think hes slowing down 

                          epps 
                hell slow down

     the car gets closer 

                          jaeger
                hes not slowing 

                          epps 
                hes going to slow down 

     the car gets closer 

                          jaeger
                eppsepps 

     the car barrels right for jaeger  forget what epps says
     its not slowing down and jaeger knows it

                          jaegercont
                aw damn

     at the last possible second jaeger rolls out of the way  the
     car doesnt slow tearing across the stretch of road where
     jaeger lay but swerves to avoid him  the driver loses 
     control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt

     epps runs to the car rips open the drivers door and
     presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head

                          epps 
                you speak english  do you speak
                english 

                          driver
                     frightened 
                yyes 

     jaeger runs over and jumps in the car  epps gets in behind
     the driver keeping the gun pressed to his head

                          epps 
                where were you going 

                          driver
                baghdad 

                          epps 
                whats in the other direction 

                          driver
                this road it leads straight to kuwait 

                          epps 
                turn the car around

                          driver 
                please i beg of you  the american army
                is there  i am iraqi  they will kill
                me 

                          epps 
                nobodys going to hurt you

     epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver

                          eppscont 
                you see that  gold  you take us to the
                americans and well give you another
                one  now drive 

     the driver turns around the car and starts back in the
     direction he came 

     they drive on for awhile mostly in silence  epps and jaeger
     are too anxious to have this all over to say much and the
     driver is too scared  finally the driver starts to talk 

                          driver
                you are americans yes 

     neither jaeger or epps answer 

                          drivercont
                we didnt not all want this war do you
                know  we didnt not all want to invade 
                our brothers and sisters in kuwait  now
                your army crushes us  so few days and 
                so many have died  and many fear we will
                all die  please tell this to your
                people  we did not want this war

     still jaeger and epps say nothing  outside the car the 
     traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets
     thicker and thicker

                          drivercont
                i have a brother in our army  when i 
                take you back will you look for him  if
                he is still alive will you look for him
                and take care of him 

     this last bit gets to epps

                          epps 
                yeah  well look for him

     outside the traffic away from kuwait has gotten so thick 
     everything is at a stand still  there are iraqi military
     vehicles pulling out as well as a good many civilian cars
     and trucks  it clogs up both lanes and envelopes the car
     some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much
     faster

                          jaeger
                look at this

                          driver 
                iraqis  they are fleeing from kuwait
                from your military

                          epps 
                see if you cant drive around this

     the driver tries to work the car free of the congestion but
     hes wedged in and not going anywhere

     from out of the sky swoop down a flight of american f15e
     fighter jets  they swing down on the far end of the highway
     engines roaring like angry lions  for a second time stands
     still  everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets

     time starts again and with a deadly vengeance

     the fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway  vehicles and
     people civilian and military alike  there is no
     distinction only carnage

     this is the infamous al jahra highway from basrah to kuwait
     city that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on
     the last day of the war by american forces  it became known
     as the highway of death 

     the huge shells rip a bloody path shredding cars and trucks
     igniting explosions straight towards the car with epps
     jaeger and the driver  with barely seconds to go before they
     are shot to pieces as well  they dive from the car epps
     dragging the driver out and scramble for cover along the
     side of the road 

     the planes turn back for another pass

                          jaeger 
                what the hell are they doing  therere 
                civilians in there

     not even thinking about what hes doing jaeger jumps up and
     screams at the jets

                          jaegercont 
                dont shoot  dont shoot  theyre
                civilians 

     epps jumps up and drags jaeger back down to cover as the
     shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them 

     the jets bank and swoop for another run

     epps realizes there is something wrong  he looks around
     desperately but doesnt seethere back in the car 

                          epps
                the gold 

     epps runs for the car trying to beat the jets

                          jaeger
                no

     jaeger lunges for epps but misses him  epps snakes his way
     through the burning hulks towards their car  he dodges
     jukes and weaves among shells shrapnel and explosions that 
     go off all around him  he just makes it to the car grabbing
     up the gold as the fighters once again swing low and cut
     loose 

     a wicked hail of shells reigns down  it sets off a series of
     violent explosions that knocks jaeger off his feet  it takes
     him a beat to recover  by then the fighters have done their
     job and fly off 

     jaeger stands  he walks towards the road over the plaintive
     wails of the barely living  the car the gold epps they
     are essentially disintegrated

     as the camera pulls back and up we see that it isnt just
     their car and epps that are gone  there isnt much of 
     anything left on this road  just death destruction and
     bloodshed

     int military courtroom  months later 

     jaeger is cleaned up in dress uniform and sitting at a 
     table before a military tribunal  he looks very sullen as
     if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul 

     the members of the tribunal just look pissed 

                          chief justice 
                the members of this tribunal have reached
                a verdict  based on the evidence 
                presented we find the defended guilty as
                charged of desertion insurrection 
                insubordination and conduct unbecoming
                further the tribunal will recommend that
                the defendant be sentenced to life 
                imprisonment and that from this day 
                forward he shall no longer walk as a free
                man  you should consider yourself quite
                fortunate son  there was a time when 
                lesser crimes would have found you before
                a firing squad  i dont know that a 
                person like you has much to say for
                himself but it is your right say
                something 

     jager doesnt stand  he doesnt look at the tribunal  he
     just begins to talk 

                          jaeger 
                im sorry i guess  not for looking for
                the gold or leaving my post  you know
                what its like to have gold raining out 
                of your hands  thatll give me enough to
                think about the rest of my days in the 
                brig  im just sorry about wes  he was
                all right  it was the gold that made him
                what he became  if i hadnt found that
                map if i hadnt talked them into going 
                searchingwes just might have made it
                home after all  i guess i feel
                responsible for him 

                          chief justice
                the way i view things youre responsible
                for the lives of two men  private first 
                class wes hanmond and second lieutenant 
                john epps 

                          jaeger 
                yeah well ive been thinking about 
                that  see there was an explosion and 
                everything but i never really aaw epps 
                get killed  and nobody ever found the
                gold  i guess they both could have been 
                burned to slag  i guess  but there were
                a lot of bodies out on that road  a
                smart man could have found some 
                identification to use  a smart man could
                have made his way up to syria or turkey
                a smart man could have gotten himself
                right out of the middle east  a smart
                man with enough gold  way i figure 
                right about now old epps is sitting in a
                bar in sydney or melboure or maybe 
                brisbane telling stories to one of the
                prettiest aussies you ever saw 

     the members of the tribunal just scoff

                          chief justice 
                i find it highly unlikely that anyone
                could accomplish such a thing

                          jaeger 
                well sir i guess you dont know second 
                lieutenant john epps very well do you 

     jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the
     tribunal with this question
