               a drum beating slow and deep like a heart

               fade in

               ext the great plains south dakota  dawn

               something is rising from the black hills a sphere of light 
               too red to be the sun a sphere of contained fire undulating 
               in crimson and ochre and rising slowly majestically to 
               the pulse to the drum it is the sun but it is a paha sapa 
               sunrise a black hills sunrise and it is spectacular

               the drum pounds deeper bigger as the sun gets higher 
               stronger igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and 
               foothills throwing shadows on the plains that look like as 
               the indians say an old man dancing the grass is golden 
               and high the wind moves through it snakes through it 
               slowly

               begin credits

               voices a traditional indian song lakota summoning wakan 
               tanka  the great mystery

               and now rising up over one of the small land waves a head 
               comes into view shoulders a man running in ghostly slow 
               motion his long black hair trailing in the wind the indian 
               man wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his 
               neck

               legs and arms churning the man runs with antelope grace 
               backlit by the sunrise bounding toward us running his 
               heart pounding song rising drum pounding five more 
               voices in highpitched tremolo join the song

               and then the runner soars like an eagle from a bluff 
               airborne flying over a small dip arms outstretched and it 
               would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine crimson 
               mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly 
               overtaken by live speed revealing the brutal force of gunfire 
               which has slammed the indian into the air throwing him 
               slamming him hard into the grass and it is over as quickly 
               and violently as a deer shot dead

               lakota song ends abruptly

               long shot  the great plains

               the sun burns like lava at the horizon drum beats like a 
               heart and somewhere off in a distant cottonwood an owl 
               then silence deep disturbing stillness

               ray gestures to carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on 
               the counter fumbles with the first latch the second he 
               flips it open

               the fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of grade a 
               treasury a lot of it then his eyes rise to carl

               louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big colt python 
               from his lap just as 

               a section of sheetrock kicks open and three federal officers 
               bust out each clutching a handgun shouting inaudibly

               knee but that knee is swept out from under him slapping 
               him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by 
               the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun but the white 
               collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that 

               ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets 
               over to the mr coffee he pours one and adds some milk 
               turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of sweet

               ray rests his weight against the coffee station takes a 
               careful sip carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and 
               he stands there looking at ray baffled completely shocked

                         the main problem is ray these people 
                         are extremely distrustful of 
                         outsiders nonindians relations 
                         have not been amicable

                         the indians dont like white cops 
                         poking around and thats why were

                         gonna ask you to weave baskets or 
                         make it rain

               ray sits before the files and photos looking unsure he has 
               come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to the 
               graveyard or in the fbi argot indian country

               tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an

               of the distant silhouette like a waking god heartbeat drum 
               hypnotic

               and then a car blows by throwing up gravel and agate and 
               gypsum zoooom right by us gone

               when a dense screen of red dust clears an old bent metal 
               sign at roadside becomes visible it reads through punched 
               and rusted bullet holes entering bear creek indian 
               reservation

               heartbeat drum calls in the highpitched mournful voices of

               cooch is at the wheel ray passenger his lap is a desk for 
               several folders and he works through them as they drive

               cooch opens a folder that sits between them and taking his 
               eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds locates some 
               photos and hands them to ray rays expression tells us 
               they are not pretty

                         those are two agents who went into a 
                         reservation a few years ago to serve 
                         a warrant they were executed at 
                         close range that one there is a

                         the agents who have worked out here 
                         say its like going into nam

                         foreign customs and you never 
                         know when you might walk into a few 
                         rounds they hold a lot of old anger 
                         for the white man out here

               ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain 
               while on the radio a dj speaks in lakota language ray 
               back at cooch studying his face

               cooch and ray each lower themselves to their haunches to 
               study the strange sight cooch puts his reading glasses on 
               stares at it then lights a cigarette

               ray hefts up a camera and begins clicking off shots he starts 
               moving around it taking shots at different angles and then 
               the sound of a distant motor draws both agents attention

               pov

               way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth a 
               lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds born out of 
               a silvery heat mirage its fifty yards off but heading 
               straight for us the heartbeat drum

               reverse  ray and cooch try to make the figure out

               in the badlands

               the archaic mudcaked harley chugs and stalls spits and 
               choices and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep 
               side of this natural wonder at the throttle is an imposing 
               figure

               walter crow horse is a portly indian in his latethirties 
               with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems 
               to have been cast from a bust of sitting bull sitting bull 
               with aviator shades denim jacket over checkered shirt faded 
               jeans well broken ducttaped boots his hair is worn long 
               in tight duel braids

               the rusted bike bajas up and down slopes finally stalling 
               out twenty feet or so from the murder site crow horse swings 
               his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse he looks 
               around suspiciously then pulls a rolledup blanket from the 
               carrier rack

               leo little sky

               lies in death crow horses boots move in stealthily creaking 
               like saddle leather

               he squats and looks at the corpse then looks around with 
               animal alertness he reaches into the front pocket of his 
               jacket and pulls out some bull durham tobacco he pinches 
               some and offers it to the four directions around the body

               he then unrolls the blanket begins to move the dead man 
               sense something and wheels to see cooch standing behind him 
               one hand behind his back where his gun must be and the other 
               hand holding up open wallet the sun hits his badge

               crow horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock a full second 
               before ray steps out his 45 drawn but held at ease

               crow horse slowly raises his arms as ray moves up to him 
               studying him

                                     cooch

               crow horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly 
               he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead mans 
               head he cuts away a patch of hair

                                     cooch

               cooch and ray stand there watching crow horse mount his 
               bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the 
               badlands he starts his motor it dies then starts again

                         beats the hell outta me

               ray and cooch look off across the badlands as far out of 
               their element as they can be

               close on  the white eagle plume

               in the circle in the sand fluttering in the wind

               the gold spitshined le baron eases to a crawl passing an 
               old wooden sign leaving bear creak indian reservation

               and immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a

               faded white letters painted across the front read no indians

               this sign actually exists today in the resline border town 
               of scenic south dakota the car pulls up beside a pickup 
               and parks ray and cooch step out careful to walk wide around 
               a pitbull in the bed of the truck

               a white local walks out of the bar and looks askance at the 
               suits as the two feds approach the bar cooch looks up at 
               the warning sign ray sees it too

                                     cooch

                         a cheeseburger

               the young agent smiles amused starts to enter the bar but

               indians say

               clear moon is walking away from a parked pickup truck toward 
               the white men eyeing the two with deep curiosity

               cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the 
               man

               in a respectful doubleclutch and grips him tightly almost

               old station wagon drives slowly toward the reservation

               then suddenly someone steps in front of the car a big man

               file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos 
               and memorandums and then he hears laughter outside and 
               glass break

               he gets out of bed quickly snatching up his pants putting 
               their on and going to the window

               another white man as a little game of catch takes place 
               cooch stepping into the circle shirt half unbuttoned hair 
               a mess looks on then steps in front of a big local and 
               catches the indian as he comes stumbling he holds onto him 
               looking at the faces that turn his way ray steps up beside 
               him looking tense

               and then cooch shoves the indian with all his might back 
               across the road the locals resume their fun and cooch looks 
               at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes ray 
               do a serious take

                                     cooch

                         wants a kiss 

               the indian ends up stumbling back toward ray and ray catches 
               him this time the man maintains a perfect vacant expression 
               and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening 
               but he is dizzy and exhausted and ray keeps him from 
               falling

               cooch looks at ray their eyes meet ray shoves the man 
               forward this time instead of catching him the local on 
               the receiving end hauls off and punches him in the face 
               the indian drops

               back to his car

               they dont see cooch throw the wheel stick in drive and 
               lean into the mans ear

               hole in it he knocks above the hole

               after a moment the door opens a crack a dark weatherbeaten 
               face barely shows

                                     ray

               ray stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look

               a tattered chair is pushed against the door covering the 
               hole ray stands up turns on the steps and before he can 
               let out a flustered sigh he spots something across the dirt 
               road something that makes him remove his shades look again 
               whatever it is it doesnt make him happy and he is hurrying 
               across the road

               ext badlands  day

               a motorcycle parked between the road and the badlands weve 
               seen the ancient bike before ray walks past it looking at 
               it

               he pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks 
               down into the moonscape

               walter crow horse is down there on his haunches feel 
               tracking laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them

               ray just stands frozen blown away crow horse rises dusting 
               off his hands and heading to his vehicle

                                     ray
                         crow horse

               the indian turns the wind moans ray scrutinizes him 
               deliberating

                                     ray
                         fuck you

               crow horse grins and waves and ambles away down in

               the badlands

               ray stands sweating under his suit jacket and not sure if 
               hes amazed or pissed off

               ext maisy blue legs house  black tail district  day

               a trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude there 
               are two junked cars and one burned black

               wind blows across deep bald tire tracks ray walks slowly 
               beside them surveying following them to a place where they 
               become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse 
               there is a shotgun blast in the side of it ray studies it 
               enters the outhouse exits and walks the rutted gumbo earth 
               to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass he stands 
               here mesmerized

               chickens scratch around in the dirt

               like so many faroff res homesteads this is a haunting place 
               made more so by a persistent squeaking a rusty metallic 
               squeal coming from 

               a water pump

               across the yard where maisy blue legs a sioux elder works 
               the handle she wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under 
               a bandanna no water comes forth from the pump and she tries 
               again and again until she breaks a sweat and then she sees 
               the waalcu standing out there

               urgently she turns and starts back to her trailer with an 
               empty coffee can

               ray starts after her

                                     ray

               she mounts the metal steps ray is losing her he gets a 
               foot on the bottom step and attempts something he does not 
               want to do

                                     ray
                         mrs blue legs im indian

               halfway through the screendoor maisy turns and looks at the 
               young man in suit and shades

               maisy lowers her bifocals studies him then walks in slaps 
               the door shut and locks it a towel hung as a shade folds 
               down

               ray lingers at the bottom of the steps

                                     ray
                         yeah right

               and he walks around the side of the trailer looking at the 
               ground in the gaping space between the trailer blocks and 
               the grass there is much junk stored and ray kneels to look 
               he is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots caked with dried mud 
               he picks up a boot looks at the sole then touches the mud 
               his fingers break through the hardened crust and come back 
               moist and blue he looks at this sniffs it there is a tense 
               watertorture like tempo coming from the old pump where water 
               barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt ray sets the boot 
               down goes to grab the other boot and 

               a western diamond back rattler coils out from the shade of 
               the boot rattling and hissing from white mouth and three
               inch fangs and ray has done a backflip and roll slapping 
               his shoulder holster and pulling lead and blam blaaam he 
               unloads two and the reptile is so dead theres not even 
               enough snake left to make a truckstop key chain

               he kneels there flushed in the face holding his breath and 
               doubleclutching his gun the shots echo through the badlands 
               like the aftermath of dynamite from inside the trailer he 
               can hear crying a low moaning praying softly

                                     ray
                         shit mrs blue legs its okay

               recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at looks twice 
               although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more 
               youthful look despite a face like a map of the badlands

               he wears a vest over a western shirt baggy work slacks old 
               cowboy boots

               his brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the marlboro 
               pack as if hes reading braille

               time but one gets the feeling hes doing an incredibly deep 
               reading of the young man slowly he sits up  focusing 
               intensely on ray

               he begins to speak a hoarse strained string of lakota 
               spoken like it used to be gesturing toward ray when he 
               finishes he sits back in his chair ray looks intrigued

                         he says he saw you in a vision some 
                         time ago

               crow horse stops translating suddenly even though the old 
               man continues speaking crow horse looks concerned and asks 
               a question in lakota we dont know what hes asking but the 
               tone is absolute amazement

               this question triggers an exchange between he and grandpa

               rays brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old indian 
               absorbing the translation grandpa speaks more fervently 
               now incorporating indian sign each time grandpa does the

                         symbol of truth so that there will 
                         be no lies between us

               the old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone 
               bowl from a beaded pipe bag he joins the two together then 
               begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the four directions 
               while this goes on ray fidgets

               horse the big indian takes it from ray giving him a long 
               eye then offering the pipe to the directions before smoking

               crow horse puffs hard eyes closed then slowly releases 
               some smoke upward ray watches it climb and fade the old 
               man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle he speaks

               he shakes the rattle very slightly moving it in front of 
               ray he speaks just above a whisper

                         he says it is good the spirits are 
                         here the spirits want to know what 
                         youre doing here

                         if he knows where he is

               crow horse asks the old man in lakota no answer the pipe 
               is back to grandpa and he offers it to the directions to 
               the earth then upward before smoking himself he begins to 
               speak again

               passionately in long glottal sioux sentences adding sign 
               fingers crossing brushing an arm a slap here and there

               he is working himself into an excited state and ray keeps 
               looking at crow horse very interested in the old mans 
               answer

               finally grandpas breath comes up short and wheezing he 
               ends his oratory with a solid hand slap

               language

               the old man is staring at ray while whispering to crow horse 
               he strokes his badger claw necklace

               crow horse looks at ray and seems hesitant to translate this 
               new piece of information

                         in the old indian barter he uh

               grandpa smiles toothlessly ray who has his driving glasses 
               in hand lifts them to say these but grandpa sees it as 
               an accepted deal and swiftly removes his necklace he holds 
               it out

               ray slowly hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses and takes 
               the necklace crow horse bursts into laughter and so does 
               grandpa enjoying a good trade he draws a hand through the 
               air in a sort of horizontal karate chop meaning done deal 
               ray looks confused out of his element and out of his shades

               on blankets or in lawn chairs watching the dancing a group 
               of singers sit around a big drum beating on it and wailing 
               the song that keeps the dancers hopping

               that is there statement but yellow bird stops cranking the 
               wheels of his chair and stop long enough to look up at ray

               ray turns to cooch who is lighting a cigarette and

               carefully removes a white eagle feather he gingerly tucks 
               it in a plastic bag

               crow horse stares at the approaching vehicle his eyes hidden 
               behind rays former shades he cracks a slow smile because 

               ray is stepping quickly from the van and carrying two packs 
               of marlboros

               grandpa sits in his chair his black eyes moving smoothly 
               from side to side smoke enshrouds his ancient face giving 
               the sense of another time and place he speaks lakota

               crow horse sitting on a stool across from him holds the 
               pipe he passes it to ray who sits in a busted lawn chair

                         who will kill anyone who crosses 
                         into this place

               ray looks at crow horse searching for a hint of lightness 
               but there is only great reverence as he watches ray blow 
               smoke upward

                                     crow horse

               metal glass catches sunlight and makes prisms a car an

                         because this isnt a dry wash

               standing over the booth is a long tall ranchers son rangey 
               with red curly hair tucked under a black hills classic cap 
               and arms built by tractor work and behind him two older 
               ranchers fall in and another young man grinning with 
               amusement

               ray and crow horse look up

                                     crow horse

               ray realizes now that they think hes indian too crow horse 
               sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking 
               lakota to ray

               the rancher grabs ray by the cheeks

                                     ranchers son
                         im talkin to 

               ray decks him backhands him in the solar plexus then lays 
               a burner of a quantico roundhouse to his ear knocking him 
               across the bar over a mop and bucket and into sawdust

               the others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in 
               holding them back and sticking himself in the way it is 
               brooks the old timer ray met his first night here

                                     brooks

               the ranchers son who is coming back with a broken beer 
               bottle slows his step and shifts his eyes from brooks to 
               the young fed there is a lot of heavy breathing but no 
               talking just yet the young rancher eyes ray

                                     ranchers son

               ray just stands tense staring at him and its strange 
               because he hasnt really looked like he has any indian blood 
               up to this moment but dressed the way he is and his eyes 
               glaring face drawing tense he might pass for a breed 
               although thats probably the italian but ray doesnt answer 
               the question crow horse starts laughing drunkenly

                                     older rancher

                         come from fat red

               crow horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor 
               leaving the bar brooks is whispering to the others 
               apparently about who ray is the bar man comes up to ray 
               holding a tray on which sits a shot and a beer ray looks 
               at it for a moment

                                     bar man
                         sorry on the house

               ray knocks the tray out of his hand spilling beer and whiskey 
               all over the bar man and the locals around him

               and he walks out leaving the locals confused

               int le baron  traveling  res  day

               ray looks strungout as he drives if its not the conflict 
               at the butte its the dangerous seed crow horse planted 
               and it is playing with his mind he is on his radio

               there are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on 
               the fence and on the monument

               it is a quiet place still

               maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket 
               her hair blowing across her face in the wind she prays in 
               lakota

               behind her ten children from the bear creek school stand 
               heads bowed respectfully two of them sit on the lap of

               ray stands watching maggie walking into the wind toward 
               him behind her an honoring song sung by ten children haunts 
               the still air

               he doesnt budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins

               as if exhausted by the thought maggie sits down on the bluff 
               looking out at the children who are still singing the song 
               as she speaks she begins digging her fingers in the earth

               ray just stares at her struggling with what hes feeling 
               what hes hearing what hes supposed to be feeling silence 
               hangs between the two of them

                                     ray

               maggie looks at him considering then toward the long dark 
               silhouette of a mountain range across the plains

                                     maggie

                         in 1868 the government took 
                         everything but those hills they 
                         allowed us to keep those black hills 
                         to live there signed a treaty until 
                         they found gold then they told us 
                         we had to leave because of national 
                         interest they broke that treaty

                         it wound up dead or in jail and 
                         the people wound up here on a 
                         reservation

               while she looks off at paha sapa ray stares at her profile

                         while up there in the black hills 
                         they carved the faces of four 
                         presidents

               she looks at ray with an ironic smile and she catches him 
               transfixed

                                     maggie

                         indian blood but he still used a

               maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are 
               no longer singing ray reaches inside his jacket and takes 
               out five polaroids he shuffles them as he ponders he hands 
               one to maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to 
               the wasicu

                                     ray
                         you ever see that car before

               maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing she hands 
               it back quickly ray wont take it

                                     ray

               maggie ignores him ray studies her reaction

                                     ray
                         help me maggie

               maggie is looking away she picks a long blade of grass and 
               smoothes it in her hands

               ray looks at her a moment longer then rises dusting off his 
               jeans and standing there he thinks for a long moment 
               pinches the bridge of his nose then looks out at the black 
               hills pensive

                                     ray
                         i didnt see you today maggie

               maggie watches him go looks away then watches him again

                         goodbye washee

               ray stops she stands on the bluff her hair riding the wind 
               and her eyes searing and then her lips do something that 
               might qualify as half a smile a sense of humor rising up 
               through anger survival humor

               ray looks at her for a long moment and then he walks on 
               leaving her there

               ray sits behind the wheel going through files on his lap

                              to himself flustered
                         that was 1868 maggie

               exhausted ray lays his head back on the seat and lets a 
               long constricted breath free thunder rolls like the slow 
               deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills he opens his 
               eyes looks out the window

               pov rain is coming down and maggie is getting the children 
               into the back of her truck she helps them get a tarp over 
               their heads then as yellow bird pulls himself into the cab 
               of the truck she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it 
               in

               she gets in starts up and rolls off down the sloping road

               ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door 
               he stares at the burial grounds then slowly he starts toward 
               them as if magnetically drawn heartbeat drum

               a shroud of mist lays over the cemetery growing thicker as 
               the rain falls harder drum beats deeper ray is walking 
               toward the memorial getting drenched then he hears something 
               strange hoofbeats

               rays pov

               coming down the dirt road toward him a horseman drives his 
               mount at a fast trot the rider is only a vague image in the 
               mist his face hidden as he rides closer we can make out a 
               shotgun in his hand and he throws it up takes aim

               paralyzed for a moment and then going for his gun but its 
               not there hes left it in the car he breaks into a run 
               but theres a shorter distance now between the horseman and 
               the car and ray has no choice but to turn and flee

               his boots slap wet pavement and his breath draws heavy and 
               desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy 
               slope looking over his shoulder panicking

               his legs and arms churning his face contorted and then 
               someone passes him out running just as hard an indian woman 
               in 1890 winter rags clutching a baby to her breast and 
               crying screaming ray looks at her incredulous as he runs 
               but he keeps running

               the rider is right behind him he fires the gunshot cracks 
               the sky like thunder boooom

               ray grabs onto these words rolls them silently on his lips 
               and now yellow bird is getting suspicious of the fed

                                     yellow bird

               and then headlights pierce the gaps in the boarded windows 
               yellow bird collapses against the wall bangs his head off 
               it he lets a long pained cry escape from under his breath 
               and he begins a slow slide down the wall to the floor

               ray peers out the cracks in the boards

                                     yellow bird
                         man i dont know who the fuck i am

               ray gets up putting his gun away and heading to the door 
               he stops and looks back at the indian sitting on the floor 
               clutching his knees staring into the kerosene flicker

                                     ray

               there with a high aerial ray raises a hand in a slight 
               wave walks on at the fed car a regional agent behind the

               ray gets in the car and takes off

               ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation 
               through miles of open land and strange rock formations and 
               he looks trapped headlights flicker in his rearview he

               then makes a sudden sharp turn

               he pulls off the road quickly throwing up dust into the 
               already foggy night the car goes out of control

               ext wounded knee memorial  night

               the car that was following drives right past the narrow layby 
               hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long 
               stretch

               ray skids through the dirt trying to stop  he cant  
               and the le baron fishtails smashing into a chainlink fence 
               and coming to a stop

               breathing as if hes been running not driving ray looks 
               behind him to make sure he lost the car he did when he 
               turns back to his wheel he sees 

               through the chainlink fence

               lit by his headlights the wounded knee gravesite he is 
               right up on the arch and the tall stone marker beyond it

               the le baron just sits parked headlights making the night 
               fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb along the fence

               the drivers door opens slowly and ray steps out he walks 
               through the arch into the small fenced area up to the stone 
               which is overgrown with stubborn weeds halfhidden in mist 
               ray studies the tomb

               pov the names on the stone are chiseled vertically

               chief standing bear

               thunder heart

               moving down and then suddenly back up to the name

               reverse on  ray

               kneeling in the weeds the wind getting restless around him 
               screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are 
               filled with a whistling what sounds like eagle bone whistles 
               piping shrill

               ray kneels before the marker staring at the name on the 
               stone his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across 
               the grass whistling eagles building to an unbearable pitch

               ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small 
               hole into another world a world that frightens him he gets 
               up and backs away from the stone through the gate and gets 
               back in his car quickly he takes off

               starts around the back of the house and something attacks 
               him leaps at him from the dark knocking him off his feet 
               into the grass hits him again

               but as quickly as he falls he rolls throwing up his hands 
               and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face he traps the 
               boot twists it and drops the attacker onto his back in a 
               matter of seconds he is on top of the man sticking his gun 
               in his throat he grabs a flashlight from his jacket and

               by a few rutted old wagon roads at a place between two 
               grotesque buttes crow horse stops looking uneasy

               he digs into his pocket pulls out some loose tobacco and 
               spills it on the ground then he walks on

               ray observes this starting forward then stopping long enough 
               to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to 
               crow horses offering

               through the badlands

               ray and crow horse walk carefully under a full moon scanning 
               the area crow horse stops checks out some tracks ray walks 
               on looking up at the table he shines his flashlight up and 
               it illuminates 

               a red ribbon tied on stakes on a ridge ten stakes twenty 
               stakes ribbons blowing in the wind

               ray sweeps the light along walking faster and then something 
               frightening occurs something some unseen thing snags him 
               by the leg sucking him into the earth with a horrible gushing 
               sound

               ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips a bluishblack slime 
               oozing out around him crow horse grabs him struggling to 
               pull him up he does stumbling back and stepping into a 
               hole himself

               the two men are wheeling throwing flashlight beams around 
               slapping through a wet jelly and finally getting their 
               bearings

               ray touches the ground where a blueblack chemical solution 
               oozes out with water from the aquifer below his flashlight 
               scans

               something strange in the moonlight coyotes some forty yards 
               away on a flat stretch of stoney ground six coyotes dancing 
               in the shadows of rock formations moving in on them as ray 
               walks forward they circle scatter run back circle 
               again look straight at ray eyes glowing

               a body

               lies there face down denim jacket and a shock of black 
               hair thrown into tangles and dirt it was buried until the 
               coyote caught wind crow horse bends down touches the

               and soiled water he covers his mouth stopping himself from

               ray steps away from the door looking around the vast plains 
               as the sun comes up out of the black hills he is roadblocked 
               and it shows in his eyes its all getting too big

               crow horse leans against the shack watching ray and then 
               radio static from inside the le baron ray pivots and stares 
               at it as if someone is inside the car his call signal is 
               being paged but he just stands there looking at it

               ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset he takes a 
               breath before pressing it to his lips

               ray looks at crow horse who looks equally spooked the agent 
               clears his throat

               ray holds the handset down at his side looking over the top 
               of the car toward the black hills

               ray swings in behind the wheel starts the car and barrels 
               off recklessly down the rutted road leaving crow horse 
               behind

               front of the joint

               ray approaches room 13 looking shellshocked his boots

               walks in the sac is freshly showered and he is fidgeting 
               with a windsor knot he studies his number two man says

               his face is a red hue

               cooch crosses the room and picks up rays jeans which look 
               like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole 
               ray tucks his clean shirt in watching cooch

                         horse

               cooch walks up to ray slowly and takes his face in his hand 
               turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his 
               left eye a residual from a crow horse hook

                                     cooch

               ray nods and cooch slowly breaks a smile an insecure smile 
               but a smile just the same he starts to laugh

                                     cooch

               cooch laughs in amusement and rays face crinkles into a 
               grin as he lowers his eyes wiping a paper towel over his 
               face and then suddenly ray lunges at cooch

               he slams the agent in charge against the hollow wall and 
               holds him there his eyes wild

                                     ray

               at the place in the road
