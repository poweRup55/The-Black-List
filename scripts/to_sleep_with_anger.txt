	since she was a child 
		beat
	in my travels i misplaced it i
	have been looking over my shoulder
	ever since

			linda

			babe brother 
	did you ever have to use this
	thing

			harry 
	that is called a crab apple switch
	its for those bad acting monkeys
	and just the thing for a mean dog
	now i dont know if i actually did
	what i did or got my life and story
	mixed in with other folks stories
	but i seem to recall that i had to
	use my crab apple on a boy from
	back home i was up in memphis
	working on the railroad like your
	daddy who had an easy job he would
	sing a song that had a cadence and
	we would lay track anyway i was
	coming down beale street and i
	heard this music coming from a
	saloon sure enough it was emory
	my daddy taught both of us to play
	but emory was natural at it got in
	a blues band and what not he and
	another boy had killed a boy named
	hocker sometime back and they
	balled the jack leaving town emory
	had lost one eye and had a scar
	running down his face bad luck i
	would say he got to drinking that
	corn liquor we went to his girls
	room and he wouldnt stop drinking
	he started talking about the old
	days and he went mad he pulled his
	knife and i got to mine first the
	lights went out

linda picks up a card and looks at it there is a naked woman
on the back

			babe brother
	dont pick up the cards if you are
	not in the game did he die

			harry 
	i dont know what happened to him
	he just ran out into the streets 
		beat
	i got some old records i want you
	to hear i like the blues sung
	simply man and a guitar or sung
	by a woman who had bad luck all her
	life dont ever let anyone tell
	you his lifes story if it is of a
	weary life full of sadness when i
	was a boy a man told me a story of
	how he lost all of his sons and
	ill be damned if the same thing
	didnt happen to me

sunny is busy playing in the curtains

the sound of gideon and suzie arriving makes them scurry to
get the cards put away harry puts his knife away just as

	overseas

			gideon 
	you and babe brother hit it off so
	well

			harry 
	course it is your business but i
	feel obliged to tell you that maybe
	you have not been fair with the
	boy

			gideon 
	i tried to teach him right from
	wrong just like i did his junior

			harry 
	everyone has to follow his own
	plough a man doesnt have to know
	how to cut a wick and clean a
	chimney nowadays city people dont
	give a hoot and a holler about the
	shape of the moon nowadays you
	dont plant old ways
		beat
	 but at the end you find
	yourself doing what your father did
	but you have to have the land in
	you
		beat
	its when you want to give the
	house or farm to the kids and they
	dont want it you sell it to a
	stranger you worked your whole
	life for what
		beat
	i doubt if people nowadays have
	knowledge of a victory garden or
	seen an inch worm all what weve
	experienced has no meaning

			gideon 
	youre suppose to teach your
	children what you know junior i
	dont have to worry about babe
	brother is a different story

			harry 
	you still call him boy you call
	babe brother boy in front of his
	wife and son

			gideon 
	my daddy called me boy up to the
	time he died i was always boy to
	him

			harry 
	course you could be right your
	sons are alive all my sons are
	dead

	child you never take the boy to
	the park circus or anything if we
	did not take him to church he
	wouldnt have any sense of
	religion

			linda 
	i think forcing him to go to church
	when he really doesnt understand
	is not saving his soul when he
	gets old enough to make up his own
	mind about religion that will be
	better it will be his intellectual
	decision

			gideon 
	is that the way your parents raised
	you

			babe brother 
	why you dont want us to bring him
	over

			gideon 
	no its that when do you have time
