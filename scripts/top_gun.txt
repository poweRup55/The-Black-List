	my answer is the dangerous thing 
	is being unprepared you want 
	trouble thats what you get when 
	things dont work out when you 
	cant do what you say you can when 
	you dont know what you can do and 
	when your opponents arent sure 
	either we are not policy we dont 
	make policy elected officials 
	civilians do that we are the 
	instrument of policy the tip of 
	the spear so we had best be sharp
	
	maverick has turned to look at ice ice glances back in his

	maverick knows hes in trouble considers the social

	a couple of ooos and aahhs from the guys the instructors 
	stare the challenge at him he slides lower in his seat

	its okay to be confident you have

	insult mavericks about to take the whole conversation too far 
	when somethingsomeone catches his eye she catches quite a few 
	eyes in this room she is very pretty and shes walking in on the 
	arm of a commander maverick turns back but the moment has 
	passed ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile goose pulls 
	him away

	cougar quit
	
			goose
	pay no attention to it theyre 
	just trying to rattle you its all

	he deposits maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
	cluster watching and listening to bugs shoot down his wristwatch 
	maverick broods
			bugs

	then we were right over downtown

	she has turned toward them she passes by they start to make a 
	move for her but just then she finds her date at the bar a 
	distinguished man with captains stripes their smiles freeze and 
	they slide back in their chairs maverick cant stop looking at 
	herafter a while the intensity of his gaze draws her 
	attention she feels him she is nodding and smiling to her date 
	but her eyes scan the room like radar a warning tone goes off in 
	his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him he feels that 
	thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know youre 
	targeted in someones scope her eyes hold on him for a long 
	momentlong enough and then sweep by the rest of the room she 
	turns her attention back to the captain and laughs at something 
	he says
	
	
	over in a corner goose chats up a couple of san diego girls
	
			goose
	the family unit  thats the most 
	important thing its the only 
	thing you can count on im married

	to the woman he tries not to stare she seems to know a lot of 
	people in the club he looks away hollywood is chatting up a 
	girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught his line is just as 
	polished as his appearance
	
	
			hollywood
	you dont think about death up 
	there but you think a lot about 
	the danger one mistake and youre 
	a smoking hole in the ground
	
			girl

			hollywood
	oh yeah it makes everything down 
	here more meaningful you feel a 
	certain intensity of life and you 
	want to grab onto every moment
	
	maverick looks up at the bar again a shock she charlie is 
	staring right at him intensely as her date whispers something 
	in her ear she notices him staring back quickly looks away 
	embarrassed she says something to the man he nods and turns 
	away as someone else grabs his attention the woman now wouldnt 
	look this way for anything she picks up her purse from the bar 
	and walks through the crowd and out of the room impulsively 
	mavericks up he follows 
	
	
	46  int hallway  outside the bar
	
	he breaks out looks around doesnt see her someone disappears 
	around a corner he moves after
	
	corner  a door slams shut impulsively before he realizes what 
	he is doing hes through it 
	
	
	47  womens room 
	
	a feminine gasp  he should have looked at the sign on the door 
	the realization of where he is hits him too late she is standing 
	by the mirror with her makeup out looking back at him hes 
	not quite sure what to do a hasty retreat would be appropriate 
	if embarrassing ah what the hell he is a fighter pilot  he 
	just walks right over to herno idea what he will say shes 
	got her lipstick out twisting it she looks over at him with an 
	amused smile

	she hands him a makeup mirror starts redoing her lipstick he 
	just stares at hershe looks up at him than back to her 
	warpaint finally when it comes it is cool and amused

			viper
	now to continue in this class we 
	will be dealing with f5s and 
	a4s as our mig simulators 
	technically the f5 does not have 
	the thrust to weight ratio of the 
	mig21it also does not bleed 
	energy below 300 knots like the 
	mig21 does the a4 does not turn 
	as well as the mig17 but has 
	significantly better visibility

	the inverted flight tanks it wont do a 
	negative g push over even below one g 
	they risk a flame out operationally 
	they will do a zero to one g only
	
	a snicker from the audience she hesitates momentarily goes 
	on

	the latest intelligence shows that 
	the most they will do in operation 
	is oneis there something wrong

	says it calmly she doesnt want to embarrass him any more 
	than he is but she has to get the facts straight

			maverick
	you know the finger
	
	he shows her but she can handle this 
	
			charlie
	so youre the reason those
	salt talks failed
	
	the room breaks into laughter at him now he grows red 
	goose puts his hand on mavericks arm shakes his head as if 
	to say let it go pal she got you 
	
	she looks at viper he doesnt know whether to laugh or cry 
	he knows theres something here he doesnt control

	she studies him coolly for a moment like a specimen
	
			charlie
	it never came up
	
			maverick
	you let me make a fool of myself
	
			charlie
	you seemed determined to do that 
	anyway why didnt you tell me you 
	were a famous mig insulter

	would it have made a difference 
	
			charlie
	no
	
			maverick
	what would
	
			charlie
	you know im assigned to this 
	school i see sixteen new hotshots 
	every eight weeks your attention 
	is flattering but not really 
	productive why dont you keep your 
	mind on flying
	
	she reaches over and aligns his collar insignia
	
			charlie
	why cant you keep this straight
	
	she smiles at him and walks away maverick turns sees the 
	others sizing him up most of them grin maverick moves down 
	the corridor past the cos office viper leans against the 
	
	doorsill he lights a pipe laconically eyes maverick his 
	tone gives away nothing like an elint probe eliciting a 
	response
	
			viper
	maverick whered you get that 
	call sign
	
			maverick
	ahhh runs in the family sir

	slowly steadily viper swings his door closed54  int

	he moves over to face maverick there is a silence like 
	after a train wreck nothing but the popping of sprung metal 
	and the low gasp of escaping steam viper speaks quietly 
	like a funeral director consoling the living makes you want 
	to scream
	
			viper
	wellthat about covers the

	jester almost breaks into a grin

	thats not good
	
	
	maverick gives no response viper continues
	
			viper
	lieutenant candela lost sight of

	failed to respond 
	
	he stops and looks at maverick a beat maverick finally 
	nods 
			viper
	why
	
	
	maverick is exhausted its been a long rough day his 
	voice is a horse whisper
	
			maverick
	i had him in view i was peeling 
	over the egg into a dive he saw 
	me when i moved in for the kill 
	there wasnt any danger
	
			viper
	    to goose
	is that how you remember it
	
			goose
	yes sir by the time we could 
	respond we were diving right into 
	his view
	
	viper is not satisfied with the answer but he moves on
	
			viper
	the hard deck for this hop was ten 
	thousand feet jester at what 
	point did you call off the fight
	
			jester
	just below ten thousand
	
			viper
	but you continued to fight
	
	another pause another grudging nod
	
			viper
	why
	
			maverick
	we werent below for more than ten 
	seconds there was no danger i had 
	the shot i took it
	
			viper
	the rules of engagement are not 
	flexible they exist for your  
	safety you will obey them
	is that clear
	
	maverick thinks about continuing the discussion but the 
	thought is momentary he quickly cuts his losses gives viper 
	what he thinks he wantshe is just on the cusp of too 
	sincere
	
			maverick
	
	yes sir perfectly clear i guess 
	we were i was just a little 
	over enthusiastic
	
	viper measures him for a moment then lets it go
	
			viper
	i guess you were dismissed

	a great struggle the weight is extremely heavy finally he 
	pulls a body to the surface goose goose is dead maverick

	i always try to find something 
	worthwhile in someones death its 
	no tradeoff its not one for one 
	what you learned isnt worth his 
	death it couldnt be but maybe 
	there is some value in it i know 
	its the first thing ive ever seen

	the question is what will you do 
	with it if it gets you out of

	yourself or anybody elsethats 
	good thats one good thing you 
	were an accident waiting to 
	happen
	
			maverick
