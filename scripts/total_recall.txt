1	ext desert  day

all we can see filling the entire frame is a flameorange skyalmost  
like the sky from the burning of atlanta in gone with the wind

superimpose presenter credit

pan down lower and lower until we see the terrain below the desert  
there is no vegetation whatever just sand and oddshaped rock 
formations the air  is filled with red dust which alternately 
obscures and then reveals the  image camera moves forward optically  
enlarging the film grain in the process

 slow disolve

opening credits begin

another shot of a barren landscape once more with bizarre rocks dust  
sound of wind camera moves forward again dissolve

another landscape but this time in the distance are some enormous  
plastic domes sunlight striking them and reflect ing causes brilliant 
rainbows  camera optically tracks toward the dome seen in 
tantalizingly indistinct  fashion through the red dust dissolve

another angle and in the distance on the horizon of the arid 
landscape  is a huge sphinxlike structure it is reminiscent of the 
egyptian sphinx  but both body and face though gargoylelike are 
different in design there are  some large pyramids not far from the 
sphinx camera moves optically forward  dissolve

camera is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front it moves 
combination of zoom and optical printer move towards the eyes which  
appear to be red gems

as camera approaches one of the eyes it appears to be stained red 
glass  as in a temple suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the 
glass shatters  into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the 
camera

 2	int catacomb below sphinx  day

a man wearing a lightweight thermal suit is running through this  
labyrinth of tunnels the ground trembles under him as if in an 
earthquake we cannot  clearly make out his face especially since he 
wears some kind of breathing  apparatus over a portion of it

the surface of the tunnels walls is curious the walls are again  
bright reddish orange and a composite of two different substances  
roughtextured claylike material and red quartz which glistens like 
crystal

the man throws a backward glance over his shoulder fear fully as he  
runs his hands are splattered with blood because of this the red 
glow the air  of fear to the man and the ground heaving and buckling 
there is almost a  satanic suggestion to the scene

suddenly up ahead of the man there appears a brilliant white light 
he  sees it and runs even faster towards it

we are almost up to the light and we see hands reaching out of the 
light  towards us that seem to beckon him to safety

abruptly the entire screen goes red but in reverse negative with  
yellow layovers so that all the images we see  entire frame  are 
small  yellow areas diffused on a red background it is much like 
looking at a tableau  made out of molten lava

 3	int bedroom in small apartment  morning

douglas quail and his wife kristen are asleep in bed

gradually the room lights brighten the clock chimes and begins 
speaking  in a soft feminine voice

clock sweetly tick tock seven oclock time to rise and open your  
eyes

they dont budge shortly the clock chimes again

clock continuing tick tock sevenohone time to get up the day 
had  begun

quails wife stirs maddeningly the clock chimes a third time

clock continuing tick tock 

quail reaches out and shuts the clock off then he sits up in bed

he swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the edge of 
the  bed he puts on his glasses and sits lost in thought

he is a goodlooking but conventional man in his early thirties he 
seems  rather in awe of his wife who is attractive and rather offhand 
towards him  kirsten pulls on her robe lights a cigarette sits 
fishing for her  slippers

quail i dreamed about mars again it was bizarre yet is was so 
real

kirsten casual its your time of the month again

quail looks at her quizzically

kirsten continuing worldweary air at least once a month douglas  
quails obsession for twelve years youve been talking about mars

quail people do go to mars you know

kirsten thats right douglas but not you not us

quail looks crestfallen

kirsten continuing disdainful as it is we can barely scrape by on  
your lousy ten thousand a week

she leaves the room he meditates on what she said depressed

 4	int kitchenette  morning

quail and kirsten sit at a small table eating breakfast on the wall 
is projected the front page of a newspaper

drinking his coffee quail studies the wall with the air of a man who 
had  his node stuck in a newspaper ignoring his wife

the newspaper headline reads rioting on mars over water tax

his wife is reading a different article four women rape man in park

kirsten mumbling what do they expect  the way men dress these days  
 then they scream rape

quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesnt hear her

quail you know  lets really do it

kirsten rape men in the park

quail no go to mars

kirsten withering go to hell

quail we can pool our savings and ive got some sick leave coming  
besides my regular vacation

kirsten interrupting corrects herself more of a halfwit for a  
start a war could break out there any day 

she gestures toward the tv screen where martian police are keeping  
protesters behind a barrier some have signs reading a free mars 
down with  cohaagen earth  out etc

quail thats just media talk theyre indicating the protesters  
just a minority theyre powerless

kirsten well theres a lot of things we need around here before we 
waste  our money on a trip to mars were broke im just a slave 
around this dump  now if you were capable of finding a better job

the kitchen clock chimes and talks

clock its now eight youll be late

quail ill be late

he jumps up quickly from the table picks up his coat and briefcase  
kisses kirstens perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves

 4a	ext city  early morning

camera tracks with quail as he walks along the busy modern street 
towards  a subway station modern cars out of focus pass noiselessly 
between the  camera and quail there is a plaintive tune being played 
on violin quail pauses  and gives a wad of notes to the aged 
violinist then walks on briskly

 5	int subway station  early morning

quail enters the station everybody must pass through a weapons check  
before proceeding to the platforms

two armed guards stand at either side as commuters pass through an  
electronic beam on a screen the entire body of each person is seen in 
xray all  of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat 
pocket

guard no weapon again mr quail

quail i keep forgetting herb they frighten me

guard yeah well its the law mr quail has been since 1990 they 
tell  me tomorrow  ya carry ya gun or ya get reported

guard gestures to his associate theyve obviously been through this 
with  quail before

quail okay herb okay

quail walks on to the track area the train arrives signs above each  
approaching car say car full room for 10 persons etc quail goes 
to a carriage  marked new car

 6	int urban transit train  day

the doors open and the crowd surges on quail grabs a seat at 
intervals throughout the car are video monitors on which a news 
broadcast is  showing

newscaster vo  more violence today from marss striketorn ore  
colonies 

everyone ignores the broadcast  except quail who perks instantly at  
the word mars

the newscaster is a young black man

newscaster continuing but earth intelligence operations director  
vilos cohaagen clearly worried about the damage to marss all 
important  tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident 
groups

tv scene switches to a press conference cohaagen sur rounded by 
aides  steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones 
and cameras  cohaagen is a striking intense man with an obvious air 
of power

cohaagen were dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative  
lunatics mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of earth and 
will remain  so

the train stops at another station and more people pile on quail tries  
to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and  
intermittently blocking the image

reporter vo there have been some criticisms sir

cohaagen i have no further comment

the news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the  
screen quail continues to watch though not as interested initially 
as he was  by the mars story few of the other passengers bother 
looking at the screen

announcer good morning commuters this portion of your trip is brought  
to you by rekall inc do you have a dream that never came true do you 
aspire   but only perspire has the great adventure passed you by 
then come to rekall  where what might have been will have been for 
the memories of a lifetime  rekall

quail watches the commercial through to the end but doesnt seem to 
take  it very seriously he glances away as a card comes on the screen 
with rekalls  numbers

 6b	int quails office  day

quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room  
numerous people are typing information onto the screens quail pauses 
in his  typing thoughtful he then types in a little more information 
then pauses  again on the screen a sentence types itself

why have you stopped request more information

quail read it and continues

scene opens on a cu of mcclane a genial bubbling enthus iastic man

mcclane were all dreamers douglas but here at rekall dreams are our

he presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated  
appear to be in outer space countless stars glitter all around 
startlingly a  comet whizzes by quail is amazed mcclane grins and 
presses the button again  the scene changes to a beautiful underwater 
coral reef multicolored fish  swim around the chairs and desk

quail but is the process really that effective a false memory

resolve

 10	int memory studio  day

quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch alongside some  
strangelooking lab equipment wearing a hospitaltype smock in the 
bg hovers a  technician adjusting some instrumentation discreet 
banks of computers etc   that apparently relates to the lab 
equipment next to quail the room in a dim

soothing booth lit by indirect lighting

quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation 
next  to him  as one always does at the dentists looking at the 
drills

the door opens abruptly in walks a cutelooking little old lady

 11	int mcclanes office  day

mcclane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse objects 
and  placing them on his desk

these items apparently are objects rekall inc intends to plant for  
some client of theirs to find perhaps even quail  as part of his 
fantasy

while he is putting these things on his desk the phone buzzes he  
answers it

mcclane yes

lull vo filtered tense howie listen youd better get in here

lull vo filtered youd better get in here

 12	int memory studio  day

mcclane come quickly in brushing the swinging door open

lull and ernie look up as he enters quail lies on the couch breathing  
slowly and regularly his eyes closed mcclane looks queryingly at 
lull who  motions him to silence

lull bends over quail quail dougie can you hear me

quail yes

lull tell mcclane what you told us

mcclane glances sharply at lull then turns to quail

quails eyes open and scan the room they settle on mcclane these eyes  
have changed they have become cold and steely in fact quails entire  
personality seems to have changed  his face has acquired a flint 
edged hardness  he is chillingly menacing

quail a deadly voice all of you in this room are dead

mcclane not quite taking it seriously whats he talking about

quail youve broken my cover

mcclane what is this

mcclanes eyes flash angrily at lull

lull the narkadine cracked a memory cap mars  shes scared hes  
really been there

there is a chilly silence in the room as mcclane digests this

mcclane forced suppression

ernie with spontaneous breakthrough

mcclane holy shit

they stare at quail as if hes a ticking bomb

quail coldly youve compromised the sphinx project youll have to be  
silenced

now theyre all panicked

mcclane wait a minute quail 

quail my name isnt quail

mcclane listen whoever you are sir almost pleading this 
is  all an accident well destroy all the records no one will know i 
swear it  believe me

quail i believe you but that wont stop eto from killing you

the rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror

quail continuing killing you killing you killing you

his voice trails off his eyes close

lull intensely he wants a false memory implanted  of a trip he 
really  took pause someone at earth intelligence operations erased 
his memory all  he know was going to mars meant something special to 
him

ernie what do we do graft a false memory pattern over the real memory 
of  the same thing

lull shaking her head uhuh that could promote a partial  
breakthrough of the real trip

mcclane overlapping revive him without any false memory implantation  
and get him out of here

lull why dont we just wipe out the memory of his visit here

mcclane nodding relieved yes good ill destroy his file and cancel  
his fee i have a feeling that the longer he doesnt know who he is 
where hes  been where hes going and who we are the better off well 
all be im taking  a holiday a real one

he leaves the others stare after him looking very grim

 12a	int reception area of rekall  day

a dazed and disoriented douglas quail comes out of an inner door and  
walks through the lobby towards the exit door

an attractive receptionist her bare breasts visible through a clear  
plastic blouse watches him she then looks toward mcclane who has 
halfopened  the door to view quails progress

 12b	int elevator  day

coming to his senses

quail where am i

an  ordinary cab driver

 15	int corridor of quails apartment  day

the reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is smart and  
clean though not lavish a uniformed and armed doorman is standing by 
the  entrance door

filmed from the elevator end of the area we see the cab pull up and  
quail alight and enter the building he nods to the doorman and 
approaches the  elevators as he reaches them a man steps out from 
behind the camera a 2nd man enters  from a door opposite the 
elevators quail looks at them and becomes quite  panicky

1st agent arent you the man from mars

he takes a modern lethal gun from his pocket quail turns but the 
other  man is behind him

2nd agent dont give us a reason to kill you

quail looks toward the doorman who is paying little attention to the  
events as the two men edge quail towards the door he call out

quail mr zimmermr zimmer help me theyre

but the doorman turns calmly away

 16	int basement car park  day

the two men lead quail past a number of cars to their own vehicle

went who you worked for what you did

he slaps quail hard across the face quail is terrified he is tearful  
with fear

quail my god no youre going to kill me

he cringes his hands across his face

1st agent no ones going to kill you if you do what youre told

playing rough

quail no its not my fault you cant do it

they start to force him into the car physically

suddenly quail stops cringing the fear disappears from his face and 
is

replaced by an odd thoughtful expression

quail continuing wait a minute i remember 

1st agent what quail what do you remember

quail on mars they tried to kill me and

quail transforms into a highly skilled killing machine

in an instant he karatechops both agents across the windpipe and 
they  crumple to the ground

quail steps back he stares at the two bodies incredulous then stares  
at his own deadly hands it is as though they belong to someone else

then leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley he races back  
into the basement door of his building

 18	int quails apartment  evening

lights

kirsten doug i want you to see a doctor now alec and shirley turnbull

bathroom and slams the door she turns on one lamp goes to a telephone 
and dials

 19	int bathroom  twilight

quail takes a washcloth turns the hot water up full and soaks the 
cloth  under the steaming water using it as a compress he presses it 
against his  face and his neck to drain off some of the tension

he turns off the water towelling his head dry he opens the bathroom  
door

the instant he does this a blinding white burst of light comes arcing  
into the bathroom and the back wall crinkles and chars into a swatch 
of  blackness

quail dives out the door just as another bolt incinerates the spot 
where  he was standing

 20	int living room  twilight

the room is in total darkness the only thing visible is the pale  
rectangle of the balcony window with the curtains drawn over it

quail and his assailant cannot be seen  but they can be heard there 
is  the sound of a scuffle  the meaty thud of a fist connecting with 
flesh   and a painful grunt as someones breath whooshes out

the light comes on quail is standing with one hand on the lamp and 
the  other twisting kirstens arm up behind her back a pistol lies on 
the floor  quail is totally stunned he releases her arm shoving her 
away from him at the  same time scooping up the pistol

quail my god did you say i need a psychiatrist

as she speaks she walks to a picture on the wall and from behind it  
pulls out a small wallet she flips it open to show him her eio 
badge he looks  down uncomprehendingly at the holographic lettering 
earth intelligence  organisation

he leaves kirsten smiles secretively she goes to a drawer opens it 
and  removes a tiny instrument that looks like a tv channelchanger 
there is a very  small light on the instrument which begins flashing 
on and off as the  instrument begins to make beeping sounds

in  a doorway

 34	int pawnshop  night

the fat man studies him warily for a long moment then he disappears  
through the curtain

case as well as two large candelabra

the pawnbroker puts the case on the counter quail looks at the case 
with

curiosity

quailcontinuing i wonder if you could tell me

opening up the small case

pull back to reveal they are quails hands the hotel room hes now in

obviously a different one than the last one we saw him in the room is  
large but rundown the walls are peeling the architecture is much 
older etc

quail examines the contents of the case there are credit cards and 
also  money several stacks of bills neatly tied  some of it the 
conventional  green but most of it red

 close on red money

on the face of it is printed mars federal colony

quail mutters martian money

quail thumbs through the money and whistles softly to himself as he 
sees  how much there is

also in the case are two passports a small cassette recorder a  
rolledup leather pouch and a spray can of some sort and a strange 
thing that  looks like a silver mask he examines the face mask 
studies black letters written  across it which we are not close enough 
to read and then puts it aside another  item now catches his eye a 
wristwatch he sees a conspicuous red button on the  side of the watch 
and presses it instantly to his shock quail sees a man  manifest 
himself himself out of thin air and stand there in the room a few feet  
away from quail hes an exact holographic duplicate of quail  down 
to the  clothes quail is wearing now

the image stands and watches quail

quail continuing what the hell

quail smiles presses the red button again there is a humming sound   
and the man fades into thin air  like a television set being turned 
off

quail looks bemused

now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside there he finds what  
look like surgical instruments a sponge a long piece of wire doubled 
over with  some attachments and a tiny metal head on one end and some 
tubes of salve

he turns on the cassette recorder

the voice he hears on the cassette tape is his own

cassette voice vo quails voice hauser this is hauser  or  
whatever you think your name is now if youre listening to this im 
talking to  myself your memorys been erased and youve got a wet 
towel around your head he  does the first thing youve got to do is 
get rid of that bug in your head

 36	int hotel bathroom  night

the sound of the tape continues as quail follows instructions  pushing  
the wire up into a bloody portion of his neck just below the ear

cassette voice vo the monitoring device is located in your left  
maxillary sinus cavity make a small incision in your neck just below 
the left ear  and insert the wire up into the sinus the head is self
guiding just shove

quail makes a face

cassette voice vo continuing you wont feel a thing the spray  
cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant careful

notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the skirting board

cheese  and pushes the transmitter inside he then throws the cheese 
into the rat  hole

service  door they advance cautiously guns at the ready they see no

leading off to one side two of  the men sneak cautiously up to it 
their guns at the ready

a large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage bins furious 
they  fire the bullets rip the bins to shreds scattering refuse 
everywhere the rat  is killed they all stare in disbelief

serial number and some dates the slate vanishes replaced by a scene 
of quail   undergoing some kind of military training

pan to other monitors all depicting quail in other action scenes  on  
some kind of mission driving a car etc

technicians man the monitors scrolling through them in fastforward 
and  fast reverse as if searching files

the technicians turn as cohaagen and his aides enter

cohaagen demands anything

cohaagen interrupting then how do you explain what hes doing

supervisor just his instincts he was well trained by eio maybe 
the  memory caps fractured portions of his prior identity could be 
leaking through

 cohaagen very anxious hell remember mars the sphinx project

supervisor fragments nothing more nothing he could piece together i  
did advise terminating him rather than implanting an identify 
alternative

cohaagen what do you think i am a barbarian were not living in the  
twentieth century

he looks at the video screen again an image has flashed onto it of an  
attractive eurasian girl

cohaagen continuing hold it there

he studies the picture which changes to show the same girl from  
different angles

 42	int space port  day

passengers are boarding a commercial spacecraft in addition to the  
stewardesses checking their tickets there are two plainclothes men 
checking every  passenger they carry some kind of small portable 
electronic device that they shine  in the face of each passenger going 
through it gives off a blue beam and  hums

the passengers are a diverse group  businessmen officials government  
people etc there is also a large tour group consisting of a 
predominately  middleaged and determinedly jolly crowd many of them 
carrying dutyfree bags they  are being marshaled by an harassed tour 
organizer who is carrying aloft a handpainted sign martian tour 
group

the last of the passengers board the spacecraft the chief plainclothes  
man nods to an official and the door begins to close

plainclothes man 1 if he had to travel to mars with that bunch id be  
sorry for him

plainclothes man 2 we couldnt have missed him

plainclothes man 1 no way lets get a coffee before the next shuttle

 43	int spaceliner  in flight

one of the passengers  a middleaged woman  unbuckles her seat belt  
and heads for the restroom carrying her handbag and some clothes on a 
hanger

 44	int lavatory  in flight

the woman locks the door and turns to the mirror she opens her bag  
takes out a spray container sprays her face with it and takes out  
the silver  face mask we saw in quails emergency kit

she holds the mask to her face there is a sizzling noise and smoke  
rises from behind the mask

she lowers the mask her face is now that of quail he tears up a  
passport and drops it down a chute

he reaches inside his dress starts to remove his falsies

close on mask

we can read the black lettering written across it now laser facial

 45	int spaceliner  in flight

quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour  
crowd he turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video 
theater  advertising rocky 36 with sylvester stallone iii jnr he 
isnt too excited but  heads towards it he pauses a little when an 
announcement comes over the  intercom

a little bell sounds followed by intercom static quail looks up

captains voice vo ladies and gentlemen if youll glance out the  
starboard viewports youll behold an indeed awesome sight 

quail goes to a viewport and peers transfixed he is seeing at  
last the object of his obsession

 46	ext spaceliner  in orbit around mars

the spaceliner  which we have deliberately not seen before this 
moment  for dramatic effect  banks and turns suddenly bringing into 
view  mars

an immense orange globe  so close it looks like its going to fall on  
us it dwarfs the spaceliner

captains voice vo those long gorges you see clearly are the  
legendary canals of mars

the liner drops toward the surface of mars below a network of  
intersecting lines crisscross the planet

captains voice vo continuing of course they are not manmade  
canals but vast natural chasms many deeper and larger than the 
grand canyon  though utterly without moisture now scientists have 
determined that they were  formed by massive flooding millions of years 
ago

 47	int spaceliner

quail stares his brow furrowing as if with some deep hidden memory he  
cant quite recall

captains voice vo continuing surface temperatures at the martian  
equator is minus onehundred and twenty degrees centigrade  in 
winter  fortunately this time of year its slightly more seasonable 
sixty degrees  fahrenheit outside the domes beat please remember 
folks that outside the domes  youll need to carry your own personal 
oxygen supply at all times the  atmosphere of mars is almost a vacuum 
thank you for flying with interstellar and we  hope your stay will be a 
pleasant one

 48	ext mars  outer space

camera follows the spaceliner until the entire frame is filled with the 
redorange sands of mars

an endless expanse of boulderstudded red sand under a redorange sky

the desert is cut by a road which snakes across the rocky terrain 
some  surface traffic moves along the road all pressurized vehicles 
since the  atmosphere of mars is almost a pure vacuum  including the 
marsport bus

pan with the bus  to reveal

a city under a dome

in the midst of the stark trackless landscape  its midday 
scorching   rises a huge weatherbeaten geodesic structure its glass 
surface scarred by  sandstorm damage its feeling is like an old 
western when clint eastwood rides  into tombstone  the raw 
forbidding vistas with a tough town carved out of  the wilderness

 50	int marsport  day

quail is looking out at the desolate landscape the tour organiser an  
amiable middleaged man sits beside him it is possible he is not a 
married man

quail its no garden of eden

sphinx

quail what do you know about that

tour oraniser not much really millions of years old bit like the one  
that used to be in egypt you know

 55	ext city under the doom  day

the bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel the buildings  
surrounding it have a much more improvised temporary look most are 
prefabricated  structures the streets are crowded and there is a 
frontiertown atmosphere stalls  sell fruit and vegetables also 
water and air containers

a lot of greenery is evident  this is to absorb co2 and emit oxygen  
thus helping with the air supply under the dome

some small ragged boys look at quail as he looks around before going  
inside the hotel suddenly one of them throws a small sack at him it 
hits his  chest and leaves a yellow stain the hotel doorman chases the 
boys away

boy smogpsucker

from the other side of the street a gang of urchins with a harmonica  
start singing some kind of defiant patriotic song

doorman you know how it is sir some of these redasses are a bit  
prejudiced

quail prejudiced against what

the street song has swelled adult miners and citizens joining the  
belligerent chorus

quail what are they singing

absolutely fabulous a complete contrast to the dirty casbahlike 
streets  affluentlooking people in spotless linen fill the lobby

quail stops to examine a large rotating display sitting on a table in 
the  middle of the lobby it is a standup model of a sphinx across 
the top is  written the first wonder of mars a recorded voice 
repeats a canned speech 

canned voice the martian sphinx only evidence of nonhuman  
civilization ever discovered age estimated at over eighteen million 
years

his nod indicates an area behind quail he turns to see an attractive  
waitress placing drinks on tables she doesnt notice quail he walks 
toward her  through the crowd bennie watches then tactfully slips 
away

melina turns to return to the bar and runs straight into quail she  
stops obviously astonished to see him

melina you bastard

almost in tears she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard 
room  which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors

there are no occupants and it is almost in darkness quail bewildered  
follows her inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which 
illuminates  the area of the table

note as quail and melina speak the activity in the outside bar can 
be  seen above the swinging doors

melina is still fighting back tears quail stops in front of her 
unsure  about what to do he has no recollection of how well he might 
have known this  woman

suddenly she slaps him hard across the face

he rubs his painful cheek

melina continuing thats new  the innocent look bitter sarcasm

 extreme closeup  trigger of gun

 two shot  quail and edgemar

edgemar youre going to do exactly what i tell you 

quail pulls the trigger

 reverse angle  back of edgemars head

we see the results of the gunshot from this angle only and so briefly 
as  to produce an almost subliminal effect the back of edgemars head 
blows off  

he collapses to the floor

melina leaps at edgemars falling form and clamps her hands over  
edgemars right hand

melina watch out charles theres more of them in the hall

quail spins toward the door just as it bursts open a man enters 
firing  but quail has fallen to the floor and returns the fire he 
staggers back out  into the corridor and slams against the wall dead

voice os from hall youve had it hauser throw out your weapon 
if  you want a past

melina is still crouched by edgemars body holding his hand for some  
reason her clipboard dangles by her side

melina whispering theres an explosive in the clipboard he has a  
deadman switch in his hand

squeezing edgemars hand shut with one of hers she holds up her other  
wrist  to show that the clipboard is bound to her wrist by a chain

voice os what do you say hauser we havent got all night hauser

quail hauser shoots off the chain

quail what happens it i come out

quail takes the clipboard from melina and eases himself to the side of  
the doorway

voice os well put in a word with the big boys maybe youll just 
get  exile to venus

quail all right here comes the weapon

quail reaches around the corner and sails the clipboard into the 
hallway  melina lets go of edgemars hand 

there is a tremendous explosion in the hallway

 83	int hallway  night

quail comes out in crouch ready to shoot on the floor lies a dead man  
and the body of the shoeshine boy sprawled grotesquely the hallway is 
filled  with smoke the floor covered with debris plaster falling from 
the ceiling

quail strides back in icyfurious he seizes melina by the wrist and  
drags her after him into the corridor

down the hall in the opposite direction he pushes open the door 
leading to the  staircase

elevator from which a waiter is emerging carefully carrying a tray 
with hors  doeuvres and champagne

quail back in quick

quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the elevator

 84c	int lift  night

quail presses the basement button as he talks to melina he opens the  
champagne and pours two glasses the waiter is too frightened to 
protest

quail okay answers now

told them i didnt care but then when i realized they meant it

quail i dont know why theyre after me but whats your connection 
with  all this

bennie reaches down grasps a knob he yanks it like someone starting 
an

outboard motor  and an earsplitting loud engine roars to life

bennie opens the throttle and the solar car hurtles down the street  
quail and melina are thrown back in the seat

gunfire blazes all around the car quail fires back at the pursuing 
car

quail shouts over gunfire youre gonna get a ticket for that engine

 87a	ext city streets  night

bennies car hurtles through the crowds with the official car gaining 
on  it bennie takes a corner sharply near a huge water selling stand 
the  official car brakes to make the same turn but clips the side of 
the water stand the  water container tips and empties water through 
the open roof ie through  which one of the agents has been firing 
so that the car completely fills the driver continues the chase but 
the occupants are now submerged they frantic  ally open the windows 
while continuing to follow bennies car

 88	ext alley  night

the solar car rushes down what appears to be a deadend street with 
the  official vehicle water pouring out of the windows in pursuit

at the end of the street however bennie doesnt stop but continues  
going into a large opening it is an abandoned mine the bigger car 
follows him but  wont fit the roof is smashed to pieces as the 
vehicle is wedged into the  narrow opening

the second official car pulls up behind a chauffeur jumps out and 
opens  the rear door cohaagen steps out he sur veys the scene the 
four men in the  wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the 
wreckage they are covered in  blood and their clothes are in shreds

cohaagen turns to an associate emile a youngish welldressed 
executive  type

cohaagen continuing proceed with operation sphinx

cohaagen with him gestures toward the mine on the lose im not  
taking any more chances operation sphinx will flush him out

93	int old mine  night

the solar car proceeds along the tunnel it enters an area full of 
smoke  dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes pipes and 
cigars quail  looks at them in amazement

quail whats all this

bennie nothin boss just old smokies only place they can come for a  
puff its all banned topside

they have now climbed out of the car quail looks searchingly at melina  
and bennie

quail so you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi 
and truckstop business

bennie thats right boss

he unzips his jacket to reveal a tshirt with martian liberation 
front  and an appropriate symbol emblazoned on it

quail my god tshirts they died out on earth years ago

bennie hurt well maybe we aint fashion leaders boss

melina no but we still believe in a free mars

they walk as they talk  into a room off the main tunnel it is adorned  
with free mars and martian liberation front posters a group of 
people are

printing tshirts and leaflets they exchange greetings with melina and  
bennie

quail so where did i fit into all this

melina you  when you were charles hauser with eio  infiltrated our  
group i guess cohaagen didnt trust you any more when you and i

her gesture suggests their liaison

quail yeah and i cant even remember it well have to arrange a 
return  bout

identity

quail but  the sphinx why is that stuck in my mind whys it so  
important

melina i dont know

bennie just an ole heap o stone boss

quail its more than that bennie i know its more somehow its  
connected

he slumps into a chair with frustration

melina reflecting maybe theres a way you can get your memory back

quail how what where when

melina a bit of martian wisdom were not all stupid colonists

 99	ext city  night

bennie quail and melina are walking in a crowded area of town water  
sellers and food stalls are everywhere an armored loudspeaker vehicle 
appears  broadcasting to the crowd it is also swinging a powerful 
searchlight along the  footpaths and streets

voice from loudspeaker all residents are to report to their nearest 
spacetravel agent within twelve hours all residents will be departing  
on shuttles within twentyfour hours air and water supplies will be 
cut off  at that time i repeat

melina hes doing it

quail what why

melina clearing everyone out its been rumored for months

the searchlight approaches bennie quail and melina bennie ducks into 
a  doorway while quail grabs melina and kisses her passionately the 
light sees only  the back of his head she responds warmly to his kiss

quail wow i can see why i was willing to betray eio

melina i though you believed in our cause

quail yes of course that too

they move into the crowd the message on the loudspeaker is repeated

 101	int kuatos sanctuary  night

the interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its ghetto exterior  
the decor is a baroque combination of middle eastern opulence and 21st 
century  flash it looks like something out of the arabian nights

a man enters from another room although the mans features are east  
indian he is very much a peter lorre type he wears a small fez cap 
and a white  linen robe with a cowl draped around the back of his neck

strange man nodding to quail your servant fahreem kuato i greet you  
by the twentyseven names that still remain praying that you cast 
jewels into  the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of 
life

as kuato speaks quail unimpressed talks sotto voce to melina

quail what use is this weirdo

melina sssshthere are skills on mars that earth has forgotten

kuato no need to introduce yourself mr quail smiles at quails  
surprise tolerate my presumption but it does not tax my powers to 
know that you  are the most soughtafter man on two worlds

from the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about 
quail  and co can be heard searchlight beams occasionally sweep past 
the windows

kuato continuing this way my dear man we have much to accomplish  
ominously  and very little time

 102	int kuatos inner sanctum  night

a bysantine salon filled with enormous oriental pillows

note in the scenes inside kuatos sanctum the loudspeaker vans in 
the  outside streets can be heard from time to to time they are 
repeating the  evacuation message from scene 99 but alternating it 
with a call for the  apprehension of quail and melina

voice from loudspeaker for information leading to these arrests  
firstclass travel to earth will be provided plus a weekend at the 
leningrad  disneyworld all expenses paid i repeat an oriental girl 
and earthman possibly to be  found in the company of a black taxi 
driver these are dangerous subversives and  sworn enemies of the 
glorious peoples republic of mars

kuato the turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the 
turmoil  within you you have brought it to mars in your search for 
yourself  kuato takes a seat on the pillows invites the others to 
join him quail hesitates

quail and youre going to help me by reading my mind

kuato indubitably there is only small matter of a fee

three responses come together

quail a fee

kauto naturally

melina this is for our cause

kuato soothingly income before ideals shall we say  fivehundred
thousand dollars

quail appalled fivehundredthousand martian dollars thats 
think

calculating the exchange rate

kuato not martian dollars mr quail  earth dollars

melina thats interplanetary robbery

quail with todays exchange rate thats over two million martian  
dollars

kuato suave what price do you put mr quail on the future of the  
solar system

bennie aw come off it man just for a bit of mumbojumbo with a 
crystal  ball

kuato his manner slipping listen buster were talking heavy stuff  
here you try and work out whats with this guy

he jerks his thumb toward quail  quail okay okay ill pay it but 
the interstellar trade practices  commission might be interested in 
this

everyone calms down

kuato smiles he extinguishes all the lights save one small blue one  
which illuminates the room eerily like a seance

kuato retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous  
road the halfrecalled the halfforgotten the repressed the 
fantasies the  triumphs joys failures betrayals

he closes his eyes and concentrates

kuato continuing yes i can feel it a wall erasure techniques 
are  so brutal frowns scans harder blocks side channels future 
and past all

jumbled i shall have to enter deep trance to break through rising i  
will be scanning you through the oracle head

kauto turns around and sits down with back toward quail he reaches up  
and lowers his cowl revealing

a tiny little head growing out of the back of his neck

the heads eyes are closed in sleep it is utterly hairless and looks  
like one of those dolls made from dried apples a shriveled ancient
looking yellow  little ball

the little face twitched yawns and opens its eyes blinks it looks at  
melina then at quail

it opens its toothless little mouth and speaks

oracle head do not fear me i need your openness

zoom in on quails eyes

oracle head continuing open you thoughts to my presencecontinue 
zoom  until entire frame is filled by quails eye

oracle head continuing open

dissolve to

 blackness broken by pulses of white light

the alternations between dark action and white light are rhythmical  
so as to create a hypnotic dreamlike feeling

 103	white light

fades to reveal a dramatic close up of the sphinx we see its face  
shoulders and behind it the red martian sky 

 103a pull back

to reveal the sphinx is a projection on a screen in a windowless 
briefing  room quail is seated across from cohaagen and other senior 
eio officers on  the walls are numerous satellite photos recon 
maps and excavation drawings   all relating to the sphinx

 107	ext martian sphinx  sunset

scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the sphinx the 
sphinxs  huge carved face visible in the background

quail and several other eio agents stand poised wearing breathing  
masks and protective gear as a powerful excavation device prizes back 
a huge  stone revealing an entrance to some kind of hidden chamber

the other agents are fearful dont want to proceed quail ignores 
them  enters the chamber 

 107a close  quails face

as he enters we read awe shock and fascination on his features he  
approaches something we cant see his hand reaches out

suddenly a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out striking  
quail like a bolt of lightning

white light

 105	int last chance saloon  night

quail and melina are dancing the faceted mirror ball on the ceiling  
become the 

white light

 106	int bedroom  day

melina watches from the bed as quail dresses she rises with only the  
sheet around her tries desperately to make quail stay plainly he 
wants to  but he cant they kiss lingeringly then quail as if 
called to duty exits

white light

 108	int detention cell  windowless

quail alone hands bound in a holding chamber suddenly the door 
opens  and three beefy eio agents enter they grab quail to haul him 
out quail  battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness with 
his bound hands he  slugs one man hurling him into a wall he rabbit 
punches a second man with a  twohanded blow and knocks him 
unconscious the third man sneaks around behind quail  and drops him 
with a blackjack to the back of the head

white light

 109	int hospital room  windowless

quail on his back all four limbs pinned by some futuristic version of  
the rack his head held imobile by a fearsome device similar to the 
one we  glimpsed on earth in the van the two agents tried to shove him 
into

several doctors stand over him into frame moves cohaagen

cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to probes already  
inserted into quails brain as they turn up the power quails face 
contorts in a  grimace of agony 

oracle heads voice you have seen your past now read the future

white light

 110	int surreal tunnel  day or night

the same scene we saw during the films opening sequence

a man wearing a lightweight thermal suit races through a labyrinth of  
tunnels the ground trembles beneath him as if in an earthquake 
explosions  rumble deep in the ground below him suddenly we realize  
the man is quail

 insert  close  quail

he throws a backward glance over his shoulder fearfully as he runs  
suddenly a brilliant white light floods in from ahead of him he puts 
up his hands  to protect his eyes  and sees his hands are splattered 
with blood

quail runs even faster  ahead the brilliant light seems to promise  
safety he battles toward it sounds of explosions increase building 
urgency up  ahead emerging from the light hands reach out to help 
quail he seems almost  to safety but just as he reaches the hands 

two gunshots ring out

shock cut to

 111	int kuatos inner sanctum  night

quail awakens with a jolt white as a sheet sweating like hes just  
run ten miles then a transformation seems to come over him he looks 
 and  sees

kuato slumped across the cushions  melina beside kuato  bennie  
standing holding a smoking gun trained on kuato

melina rushes to quail charles are you all right

quail stares at her as if an entire bank of lost memories were 
suddenly  clicking back into place 

melina continuing he kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the  
trance we couldnt wake either of you

bennie you stopped breathing

quail gives bennie that same eerie look then turns to kuato who is  
sprawled motionless across the pillows a curl of smoke rising from two 
entry  wounds in his spine

quail why did you kill him it was the next bit i really

bennie no choice boss it was him or you

quail lunges across the pillows to kuatos unbreathing form quail 
shakes  the ancient mystic trying to find a last flicker of life

kuatos body is dead white quail releases his grip he about to give 
up  when 

a muffled chocked sound comes from behind kuatos neck its the oracle  
head quail instantly rolls kuatos body over the head is still alive

quail bends closer kneeling

oracle head whispers  the vengence you seek and the salvation of  
mars are waiting for you in the crown of the sphinx sags gasping

the oracle head lets out a long sigh and goes limp a small trickle of  
blood oozing from the corner of its mouth

bennie phobos and demos what was that all about

quail ignores him still kneeling  deep in thought  over the oracle  
head

melina are you okay charles doug whoever

quail reaches out and closes the oracle heads tiny eyelids melina and  
bennie exchange a glance then

 quail

stands for a moment his back is to melina and bennie then he turns

he has become a different man his eyes gleam he is forceful  
purposeful contained once again the ace eio agent melina senses 
immediately  that this is the man she knew before

quail even his voice has changed im fine only im not doug  im  
charles hauser and i know everything hauser knew

he turns to bennie

quail continuing bennie wheres your depot

bennie working it out well you go outta here take a left then  
down past the first no second water bureau you

quail briskly can you get us there

bennie no problem

melina but why

quail were going to the sphinx

he strides off the others follow still full of questions

bennie impossible man guards everywhere

melina the oracle what did you learn

quail only everything ive got total recall

they are now heading down the stairs toward the street

 114	ext street  early morning

quail melina and bennie make their way through the crowds to bennies  
depot the streets are even busier then before  people are now 
beginning to  evacuate the city everyone is carrying their possessions 
 bundles suitcases pets  etc etc the loudspeaker vans are still 
touring and broad casting the same  message

bennie indicates a building on their left

 115	int car pool  early morning

bennie and melina follow quail as he walks up and down the rows of  
vehicles in the vast building there are bull dozers and ore haulers 
as well as  solar taxis

bennie well never get near the sphinx theyll blow us apart

quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself he rapidly but  
carefully inspects each vehicle as they pass camera tracks rapidly 
with them

melina what are we doing charles for gods sake tell us

quail the sphinx its not some useless artifact its a machine 
built  by some alien race eighteen millions years ago the same race 
that built the on  one earth for the same purpose

he stops in front of a large oddshaped vehicle with a large scoop or  
propeller on the front

quail continuing this is what we need

he begins to climb in the others follow

bennie referring to the sphinx its a hunk of old stone man

melina ditto purpose what purpose

bennie starts the engine

quail come on bennie move it then to melina have you heard the  
word terriform

melina shakes her head the vehicle moves off

 115a ext air lock  morning

guards are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city though 
this  has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving 
for the space  ports

the vehicle with bennie quail and melina arrives

 115b int vehicle  air lock  morning

bennie is nervous melina and quail are in the back but cannot be 
seen  guards are checking all vehicles exiting looking for quail and 
melina

bennie calling to guards just deliverin some old junk to the mine 
out  at apidalia planitia got them people youre lookin for in the 
back as  well

the guards laugh and signal him on

once through the second door of the air lock ie to the area outside  
the city quail and melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats

quail the machine in the sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten  
core of this planet there are tunnels and ducts everywhere all 
powered by  fusion generators

bennie you sure the little man didnt fry your brain quail

melina overlapping for what to do what

quail to combine elements in the martian core and release them as 
oxygen

hydrogen and nitrogen

bennie thats air

 116b ext desert  morning

in a wide shot the vehicle is traversing the desert the domed city is  
some distance in the background voices are heard in false perspective  
emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of mars

quail thats right air and water terriforming will create a permanent  
livable environment for mars no more pressurized cities no more 
containers in  the desert therell be rivers vegetation  life  the 
same as earth

melina baffled so why is cohaagen shipping everyone out

quail dont you see from being a pile of red dirt with minerals mars  
is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate

melina and cohaagens going to own it all

quail right he can start selling it off to wellheeled investors from  
earth beach condos ski resorts you name it

melina no wonder he wanted you to penetrate out group

quail nods once word of this gets out the whole planet will support  
you

 117	ext desert  day

the vehicle is now approaching the sphinx both it and the pyramids can  
be seen some distance away

voice are heard in cu perspective

melina so what can we do

quail ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule  while  
the inhabitants are still here

melina is amazed

melina but wholl work the machine do you know how

quail im the only one who does why do you think cohaagens left me  
alone all this time

 118	ext desert  day

the vehicle is even closer to the sphinx

quail i was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the  
sphinx it mustve been programmed some kind offorceshot into 
me

melina but cohaagen wiped your memory

quail smoothly just a way of putting me on ice hed of reversed it  
once the planet was evacuated

bennie man this is real complicated go over it again real slow

 119	int vehicle  day

quail ignoring bennies aside what he hadnt counted on was your 
effect  on me

melina smiling and all without the marvels of modern science

quail looks out the back window his attention attracted by two patrol  
vehicles they are some distance away but approaching steadily

 119a ext desert  day

a wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach ing the  
vehicle with quail melina and bennie suddenly it stops moving

 120	int vehicle  day

the vehicle had just stopped

quail bennie dont stop now take it

he turns to see bennie is covering him and melina with a pistol

melina you bastard

bennie like i said its a tough planet im a baddie not a goodie

quail i should have known you were just too helpful

bennie eio rule one man trust nobody now you can do your 
terriforming  stuff right when those space shuttles are gone

melina but what about the martian people out cause i thought you  
believed in it

bennie your cause that bunch of dead beat radicals when i hand in 
this  little number flicks his gun in quails face ill get 
real estate rights  on the whole of chryse planitia

at that instant melina lunges punches a red emergency button the 
vent  beside bennies hand blows open causing a powerful suction 
caused by marss  vacuum atmosphere bennies gun hand is planted 
against the vent opening

simultaneously the air in the vehicle starts rushing out all three  
parties begin choking as bennies mechanical hand claws for the lever 
that seals  the vent quail has a moment to jump him he pounds 
bennies gun hand the  pistol is sucked clattering out the vent

quail delivers a roundhouse punch to bennie knocking him clear across  
the bus

melina seals the vent repressurizes the cabin

bennie gets up off the floor shaking off quails punch

 121	ext desert  day

the eio vehicle are a half mile off  and closing in

 122	int sand mole  day

quail glances at the vehicles turns to bennie  ready to jump him 
but  stops short at what he sees bennie doing

bennie is clipping on his mechanical arm it sprouts several rows of 
viciouslooking steel blades 

bennie this makes bennie a cut above anyone else

bennie presses another button and the blades start spinning bennies  
mechanical arm is in effect now a buzz saw

the fight begins bennie attacks quail with his buzzsaw arm quail  
dodges bennies arm shreds various articles in the cabin  and keeps 
melina at  bay with welltimed swipes finally bennie gets in a 
roundhouse punch to quails  jaw with his real hand quail sprawls 
dazed

now bennie goes for the kill but melina leaps onto him bennie grabs 
her  by the hair and moves his spinning hand in for the quick kill 
melina clutches  the terrifying appendage with both hands desperately 
keeping it at bay but  her strength is no match for bennie the 
whirring blades are just about to  bite into melinas neck when 

quail comes back lands a ferocious rabbit punch to bennies spine 
quail  lunges at him grabs the blade weapon he and bennie crash into 
the cabin wall  and 

the blade rips clear through the moles wall alarms sound as a gaping  
hole is blown in the side of the cabin all the air is sucked out by 
marss  external vacuum

now no one can breathe they all claw for their masks still in 
place  bennie is first he recovers lunges with his spinning arm for 
quail quail  barely dodges grabs the arm muscles it back toward 
bennie 

the spinning blades sever bennies own oxygen line gasp ing he  
falters quail aims a titanic blow punches bennie out through the hole 
in the moles  wall

quail and melina masks on stare out as bennie claws desperately at 
his  severed air line the martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from 
bennies lungs he  chokes staggers 

 122aa ext desert  day

bennie is beside the vehicle he implodes like a balloon with all its 
air  gone

 122ab intext vehicle  day

melina hides her face in horror at that instant 

 122a ext desert  day

bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle the patrol cars are  
only a few hundred yards away loud speakers call for quails 
surrender

 122b int vehicle  day

quail lunges for the vehicle controls presses a buttonmarked dive 
the  vehicle tilts

 122c ext desert  day

the vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand as the patrol cars close 
in  and rake the desert with gunfire the vehicle vanishes from sight 
in the  distance the sphinx looms ominously

a driver in one of the patrol vehicles filmed from outside the  
windscreen is speaking into a microphone he cant be heard but can 
only be radioing a  report

 123	int sand mole  moving  underground

the little mining vehicle moves powerfully propelled by its borer 
nose

quail mans the controls while melina struggles to shore up the gaping  
hole in the side into which sand is pouring as the mole moves forward 
quail looks  at a compass in the control panel he makes a correction

quail shouts over engine noise hope ive got this direction right

sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the encounter with  
patrol cars

cu speedometer 22 mph every other gauge is overheating flashing  
warning lights 

 124	int sphinx control room  day

cohaagen and a number of his associates plus scientists and heavily 
arms  troops are present

cohaagen the air supply is off under the domes

emile yes sir in a couple of hours itll be all gone

cohaagen any trouble with the rabble

emile not much sir a lot of complaining but theyre all heading  
towards the shuttle areas

on some of the video screens a number of space shuttles can be seen  
ready for departure to earth

 123	int tunnel beneath sphinx

the mole bores through a sand wall emerges into a cramped horizontal  
tunnel quail and melina leap out the poor mole is smoking like an 
overheated  drill bit its nose is worn to a nub

melina we got in with this thing but well never get back out

quail a shame such a pleasant trip

theres a lighted area at the end of the tunnel quail and melina hurry  
toward it moving silently close to the wall

 126b int main downshaft

they draw up an abyss  where their tunnel intersects the main  
downshaft melina gasps at the colossal scale of the drilling hundreds 
of yards across  deeper than the eye can see and crisscrossed by 
catwalks buttresses and supersophisticated technology

quail and melina are forty feet below the upper end of the main  
downshaft they can look up the shaft and see the first interior level 
of the sphinx  itself

quail points down shaft this is the main tap  straight down to the  
core of mars when we trigger the mechanism fusion reactors will 
detonate down  there  four hundred miles deep

melina remind me not to slip

quail the new elements will come booming up through this shaft  and 
six

thousand others all around the planet

hes right at home  and full of confidence

quail climbs onto the ladder which links various top levels

he starts to climb melina follows him they are tiny figures the 
space  around them plummets down to infinity

 127	int corridor at top of shaft  lowest manned level level one

a patrol of nine heavilyarmed guards appear from a corridor in level 
one   directly above where quail and melina are climbing

 128	on the wall of the shaft

quail and melinas heads inch into view at floor level they take one  
peek at these formidable warriors and duck back swiftly out of sight

 129	int top of shaft  lowest manned level level one

guard leader to two of his men stay in contact i want to hear from  
this checkpoint every four minutes

seven of the guards move off two remain in position

we hear the footsteps of the seven guards recede

the two remaining guards realize their isolation they glance tensely 
to  one another

guard 1 did you hear something

guard 2 no where

guard 1 over there

the first guard points to the edge of the main shaft  right where 
quail  and melina are hiding the guards cock their weapons start 
cautiously  forward just as theyre about to peer over the brink guns 
at the ready

quails voice os from behind the guards im not there boys im  
here

the guards spin around weapons poised standing in the shadows near 
the

corridor is quail still with no gun

both guards walk quickly toward quail covering him with their weapons

guard 1 to guard 2 watch him he was eio trained theyre all full 
of  tricks

guard 2 yeah likewho was that guy  fred bond to quail keep  
em up fred keep em up

quail has his arms raised high just as the guards reach him he fizzes 
electronically emitting a humming sound then disappears

guard 1 a hologram

before either guard can react the real quail appears  one foot 
behind  them with two lightning blows he dispatches the guards 
apparently quail has  climbed out of the shaft while the guards were 
distracted

quail snatches both guards weapons grenades and ammo belts melina  
climbs out of the shaft quail tosses her one of the guards guns

 130	int corridor  level one

alarms go off everywhere quail  carrying a gun and all the grenades  
and ammo belts  and melina just carrying a gun bolt down a corridor 
past a  sign level one

melina running whered you get that little trick

quail running mailorder company its a great one for fooling the  
wife

 131	int control room level thirteen

cohaagen and his aides hear the alarms see quail and melina on 
monitors  as they race down the corridor on level one

cohaagen how the hell did they get in

security aide up the fusion core

cohaagen up the fusion core

he exhibits begrudging admiration for quail

security aide studies monitor more carefully theyre on level one  a 
wall sign behind cohaagen reads level thirteen

cohaagen seal all upper levels

a button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front of the  
formidable doors already closing the control room off from the outside 
corridors

 133	int level one corridor

quail and melina are still racing through the corridors he passes her 
a  fresh ammo belt

quail indicates weapons know how to use one of these

melina expertly ejects her spent clip that guards fired at quail 
slams  in a fresh clip and cocks the gun

quail has a halfsecond to react impressed then  four guards pound  
into view at the end of the corridor

melina opens fire nails two quail heaves a grenade as it explodes 
he  and melina bolt down a side corridor 

 134	int various corridors catwalks stairs

alarms continue as quail and melina dash down the side passageway more  
guards cut them off melinas machine gun sends them scattering 

quail pauses at a corner he looks around quickly and sees that an  
elevator is arriving he motions melina back the doors of the elevator 
begin to  open very quickly quail bobs his head and arm around the 
corner he calls out  loudly

quail catch he hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator 
instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object it is an  
explosive device of some sort quail and melina press themselves 
against the wall  just around a corner from the elevator there is a 
tremendous explosion

quail followed by melina rounds a corner the elevator is in ruins  
bodies are scattered everywhere

melina great stuff but how do we get up

she points toward the upper levels

 135	int control room level thirteen

melina and quail can be seen on the security monitor from a high angle  
quail looks up spots the monitor and shoots is to pieces the image 
on the  screen goes black

cohaagen forget them well pick up quail once the shuttles have left 
for  earth

 137	int corridor

quail spots a large windowed air lock at the end of the corridor he 
and  melina race to it quail starts to open the inner door of the air 
lock

quail if youre afraid of the heights you better get over it real 
quick

 he is pulling melina through the inner air lock door just as 

guards stampede around the corner of the corridor toward them

quail is out of sight but they see melina poised near the window she  
waves and smiles to them hiding her gun behind her body they slow 
down and  approach less cautiously beguiled by her manner and 
attractiveness as they get close  she suddenly lifts her gun and 
opens fire mowing them down

 140	ext sphinxs face  day

quail and melina climb through the outer air lock door they are at the  
sphinxs shoulder with a dizzying drop beneath them melina looks 
down shes  sorry she did the fall is at least 200 feet both are 
wearing their breathing  apparatus

quail and melina start to climb up the sphinxs shoulder along its 
egyptianlike headdress 

 141	int control room  day

cohaagens chief aide emile addresses him quietly

emile if quails the only one who can operate all this gestures  
toward sphinxs controls then he can call all the shots

cohaagen well tell him the computers worked out the operational 
details  so we dont really need him were just doing him a favor

emile and if that doesnt work

cohaagen we offer him rewards

emile what if that doesnt work

cohaagen well torture him you dont think i got this far by being a  
nice guy

 142	ext sphinxs face  day

quail and melina traverse across the cheekbones haul themselves up at  
the base of the red translucent eyes 

 142a int control room  day

the video monitors show the space shuttles an operator with 
earphones  turns to cohaagen

operator first of the shuttles ready for departure sir two minute  
countdown

 142b ext sphinx  day

quail jams three grenades against the glass of the eyes pulls melina  
back behind the stone cheeks 

 143	int sphinx control room

a muffled explosion due to the thin martian atmosphere detonates  
overhead the sphinxs right eye blows in a storm of shards and 
shrapnell

instantly the room turns into a hurricane as the martian vacuum sucks  
out all air everyone panics grabbing their

cohaagen seal the breach repressurize

an aide dives for an emergency switch but now 

quail and melina wearing breather masks bursts in onto an overhead  
catwalk they open fire on the guards who are choking struggling with 
their  masks

an emergency pressure seal powers into place sealing the breach in the  
eye repressurization comes up the internal atmosphere stabilizes 

none of the men inside the control room still moves the victors tug 
off  their masks spring down to the main level melina hurries to the 
main control  panel

melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a dozen huge space  
shuttles lined up for departure

melina those shuttles are starting up any minute if you know how to 
work  this thing you better do it now

quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex machinery

quail yes

he hesitates

melina dont you know how

transfixed mesmerized quail moves closer to the control panel

quail yes theres a vital connection missing

he approaches even closer he begins to raise his arm towards a blank  
area a little above his head

quail continuing me

cohaagen wait

melina dont wait

cohaagen if you activate the mechanism youll diethere were glimpses  
of it in your memory

quail wrong cohaagen theres a long tunnel a brilliant white light  
hands reaching for me

cohaagen assured thats your death thats what it looks like thats  
what is always looks like

quail looks around him halfconvinced

melina looking toward space shuttles on video screens charles  for  
marss sake

quail hesitates he looks from melina to cohaagen

cohaagen its not too late join us again uve a lot to offer a whole  
world

quail continues to look at him thoughtfully

quail you dont deserve a new world you and people like you made too 
big  a mess of the old one time someone else had a chance

he turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm again his 
fingers  reach towards the blank section on the panel slowly through 
the panel a  luminous hand reaches toward quails fingers gently the 
fingers of the two hands  touch

the entire control room begins to rumble and shudder as quail reaches  
for melina cohaagen suddenly dives on him they grapple amid the 
shuddering  sphinx and can be seen only intermittently as debris 
crashes around them

the fight ends as cohaagen is hurled backwards and disappears when a  
section of floor collapses underneath him

 144	int surreal tunnel

a reprise of the sequence that opened the movie

quail runs through a labyrinth of tunnels the ground heaves beneath 
him   huge stone blocks crash donw on all sides we hear an 
explosion and another  and another each one sounding closer than the 
last 

quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs is this his own death  
where is melina

the tunnel walls are just like the ones in quails original nightmare 
  bright reddishorange clay and quartz

quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder the  
explosions are closer suddenly 

up ahead appears a brilliant white light quail sees it but it only  
terrifies him more is it death hes running to he hurries on with all 
his  strength but 

just as he nears the white light he falls on his knees too weak to  
move he struggles 

hands are reaching out to him from out of the brilliant light quail  
stretches for them just as 

a final explosion blows him forward  straight into the white light 
the  hands seize him pull him upward to 

 145	ext martian desert  day

the hands belong to breathermasked miners dismounting rapidly from an 
overloaded transport vehicle which was taking them to the space port  
quail looks from them to melina who is walking towards the group

 quails pov  miners masked faces

the miners desert garb shield goggles and breathers add to the 
surreal nightmare quality of quails tortured perspective 

 back to quail

in terror lost disoriented totally

quail am i dying

masked miner i wont lie to you pal you are

miner from melinas bar id say in about forty years he and 
others  help quail to his feet come on weve gotta get to the 
space port that intergalactic napoleons switched off the air

2nd miner shippin us all out mars is finished

a miners wife watches them she is crying

quail looks up at the sky melina follows his glance so do the others

slowly but perceptibly the color is changing from yellow to blue

melina its happening

miner what is it

all the miners are puzzled apprehensive quail reaches toward the one  
who spoke to him before and pulls off his breathing apparatus at first 
the man is  shocked then realizes he can breathe without it quail 
takes off his own then  melinas  all the miners watch in amazement 
they all remove their breathing masks

 quail thats just the start next therell be rain and growth and   
life

melina embraces him

quail continuing rekall could never have come up with anything like  
this

melina looks oddly at him smiling mysterious

as the sky becomes more and more blue more of the miners descend from  
the bus softly at first then with more and more confidence they 
begin singing  the martian national anthem

the music swells quail puts his arm around melina they both join in 
the  chorus

it reaches an impassioned crescendo as the frame freezes and the end  
credits roll up the screen

hostility we call it following orders

welles yes it would simplify things if everyone did wouldnt it  
particularly the civilian component of that deck squad i think we may 
have a  potential problem there

fox weve been going over psyche profiles colonel anchorpoint seems 
to  be the kinds of project that attracts idealists

rosetti with a thin grin liberals

welles lets just say weve noticed a certain antipathy to military  
sciences colonel a certain lack of sympathy with the goals of the 
weapons  division

rosetti anchorpoint is under colonial administration authority this  
isnt a military operation if it were wed be in violation of the 
strategic  arms reductions treaty

boarded  sulaco sewn up tight

fox im kevin fox hicks this is susan welles were with the company  
wed like to congratulate you on a successful mission

hicks successful i lost my squad in that hole

welles but you returned corporal and youve rescued the colonys sole 
survivor

rosetti picks up a sheaf of printout weve all read the transcript of  
you debriefing hicks

hicks wheres bishop sir

rosetti blinks if you dont mind hicks well table that until 

trent ive read the transcript are you certain hicks that you have  
nothing more to tell us about the aliens life cycle detail hicks 
detail is  crucial

rosetti trent the subject is classified corporal hicks security 
rating  need to be upgraded before we can 

hicks ignoring rosetti he addresses trent ive already told you  
everything i know

rosetti hick 

fox let the corporal have his say colonel after all hes seen these  
creatures in action

rosetti you ordered the subject classified maximum security fox

trent i seriously doubt the corporal hicks knows anything more than 
hes  already told us which is a great pity but the android bishop 
was designed for

scientific observation a hyperdyne model a5 a walking data bank

welles corporal hick asked the right questions to begin with

rosetti stiffly to answer your question hicks we arent certain

welles heavy sarcasm but we can guess cant we colonel

hicks to welles where

fox rodina station

hicks the upp whats the upp got to go with this

rosetti sulacos navigation system failed you were in disputed 
territory  for something over eightyfive minutes hicks the upp 
would ordinarily  respond to that as a violation of their space so far 
theres been no protest  nothing he hesitates sulacos computer 
indicates a covert boarding operation

fox indicates

shuman to put it in diplomatic terms hicks theyve got our ass in a  
sling if they want to regard the sulaco incident as a hostile act  
and let me  assure you that they will eventually  they can 
compromise our position in the  current round of arms reduction talks 
were talking serious ramifications here  then we have the 
communications lag to and from earth a week either way so  were 
looking at a fourteen day wait for policy clarification we may have a  
major crisis on our hands

welles we arrived with a policy brief shuman and youve seen it 
were  here to implement that brief

rosetti and you orders predate knowledge of upp involvement

fox were here to do our job colonel

shuman in this case doing your job might involve the distinct  
possibility of precipitating nuclear war 

rosetti quick to break in the subjects too sensitive for enlisted  
ears any further questions for the corporal no in that case

int rodina  conference chamber

cigarettesmoke drifts above a long narrow table in a narrow space a  
half dozen ranking technocrats are jammed along wither side in folding 
chairs with coloneldoctor suslov at the head

braun rodinas chief of rd obviously colonel doctor the purpose of  
their mission was to obtain specimens of this lifeform the android 
dissected a  single specimen one of the prelarval forms  like the 
thing that killed  lenko

an officer and you believe that these creature are of potential 
military importance

braun yes provided its possible to clone the alien spores recovered  
from the androids skin and clothing

suslov with the goal of programming these machines for use as 
weapons

braun the adult form coloneldoctor is evidently a killingmachine of  
great strength extraordinary sophistication no evidence of 
intelligence  purely instinctual

intelligence officer our sources in the corporationist infrastructure 
are  aware of the existence of a special project with weylandyutanis 
weapons  division we have been unable to penetrate their security

suslov the intelligence officer suggests that this special project  
concerns the alien

diplomatic officer i remind you coloneldoctor that we experiment 
with  the alien genetic material only if we are prepared to violate 
primary  biological warfare limitations in the strategic arms reduction 
treaty

braun an i reminds the diplomatic officer that the weyland yutani  
corporation is obviously prepared to do so  that they may already be 
doing so as  ever our level of technology lags slightly behind that 
of the capitalist  cartels but now by chance 

military officer by chance you refer to the proven bravery and 
constant initiative of our peoples commando division 

braun smoothly a seasoned political infighter covering his bases not  
at all major their courage is unquestioned nonetheless consider we 
are in  possession of a potential weapon  a whole new technology if 
you will  which  weyland yutani clearly intends to develop we are 
in as they might put it on  the ground floor but only if we choose 
to be if we choose to hold our advantage

suslov i agree we have no choice but to proceed

diplomatic officer then i go on record as strongly advising that the  
android be returned to anchorpoint are ourtechnicians capable of 
repairing the  thing

braun repairing it why

diplomatic officer you lack a sense of the importance of gesture 
braun  let us avoid their customary accusations of barbarism and 
buy ourselves  time

suslov our technicians will repair the thing return it to them and 
we  will proceed we will clone the alien

to determine its compatibility with terrestrial dna

fox what kind of dna exactly doctor

trent human of course

something shivers and shakes and takes form in the cube of light a  
double helix threaded with green and red beads of light

trent continuing watch closely please

the alien genetic material looks like a cubists vision of an art deco  
staircase its asymmetrical segments glowing dayglo green and purple

rosetti thats a biological structure more like part of a machine

the alien form makes contact with the human dna the transformation is  
shockingly swift but its stages can still be followed the thing seems 
to pull  itself into and through the coils and for an instant the two 
are meshed locked and  then the final stage a new shape glows a 
hybrid the green and red beads  have been altered beyond recognition

shuman youre holding one of our citizens captive

diplomatic officer the citizen in question the synthetic bishop 
has  been held in regard to a treaty violation involving an armed 
vessel

shuman sulaco was homing on anchorpoint the socalled violation was 
the  result of a malfunction

diplomatic officer the matter is under investigation

shuman i repeat you are holding one of our citizens

to an apparent violations of the strategic arms reductions treaty

shuman sulacos weaponssystems fall entirely within the prescribed

with

biological warfare

rosetti trent fox and welles

welles and bishop has agreed to undergo complete physical and chemical  
analysis

rosetti he requested it himself

fox results

trent no irregularities so far no trace of the alien cellular  
material

welles tampering then reprogramming any new circuits in our mr  
bishop any little surprises courtesy of the upp

trent no nothing

fox and his data on the aliens all there intact

trent yes it seems to be but if his memorys been tampered with wed  
have no way of knowing neither would he

welles in any case we have to assume that the upp accessed bishops  
memory that they have the data they may also have specimens of the 
alien  genetic material

rosetti in other words you want to get on with your brief dont you  
you want trent to clone the cultures and you didnt want shuman at 
this meeting

fox this isnt a question of diplomacy colonel rosetti

rosetti isnt it a violation of the sar treaty

fox has anyone mentioned military applications colonel trent

trent smiles no i think a very nice case can be made for applied  
exobiology we do have a standing order to study alien lifeforms when 
we encounter  them preliminary analysis of the material from sulaco 
reveals a remarkable  adaptive capacity the potential for cancer 
research alone

welles imagine colonel if it can be programmed to only kill cancer  
cells

rosetti and what exactly is it you propose to do trent

fox before trent can answer well nourish the cells is stasis tubes  
under constant observation well terminate them before they become 
embryos

rosetti i see cancer research and our motives are exclusively  
humanitarian is that it

welles colonel when shuman gets his reply from earth priority will go  
to military development of the alien we know that because we know 
where our  orders came from the decision has already been made

fox and potential upp research in the same direction only adds to 
the  urgency colonel

rosetti the decision rests with me

welles perhaps you misunderstood rosetti the decision has been made

fox they wont just break you colonel theyll see to it that its as  
though your career never happened theyre top people that can do 
that and you  know it

rosetti with a long cold look for both of them he got the message

rosetti shuman of course will have to be informed

fox of course cancer research

who  saw what happened

hicks why you

spence tullys okay hicks i know him believe it or not he doesnt  
scare that easy he told me what was on that ship hicks what he saw 
you know what  is was

hicks i dont think anybody knows what it is

manipulation  braun the speed with which its cells multiply

braun yes remarkable

suslov as though the genestructure had been designed for ease of  
manipulation and this apparently universal compatibility with other 
plasms

braun reluctantly abandoning his task and you find this ironic

suslov ironic that we are attempting to program it as a weapon yes

braun how is that

suslov perhaps it is the fruit of some ancient experiment a living  
artifact the product of genetic engineering a weapon perhaps we 
arelooking at  the end result of yet another arms race

bishop she called it the queen it was larger than the others very  
large somehow is deposited genetic material in the ship

hicks then theyre stone cold crazy man i hear the upp might try 
it themselves

bishop given the current state of the arms race its entirely 
possible  im programmed to protect human life hicks its my 
nature everything i  am everything i know tells me this experiment 
must be aborted

hicks yeah i know the feeling

bishop but i cant be entirely sure you can trust me hicks

hicks you cant what

bishop the upp may have reprogrammed me ive been very thoroughly  
examined of course but the possibility does exist

hicks wouldnt you know

you have made since our arrival is going to be gone over with a fine 
toothed  cccc

as welles begins to stammer her eyes betray a terrible consternation  
she rises from her chair lurches forward catching herself on her 
hands the  ccccc phases into a chattering palsy as a thick strand 
of bloodstreaked drool  descends toward the table fox seated to her 
left has instinctively shoved his  own chair back ready to run 
everyone else is frozen with shock

as the chittering toothburr becomes a shrill shriek of inhuman rage 
the

transformation takes place segmented biomechanoid tendons squirm 
beneath  the skin of her arms her hands claw at one another tearing 
redundant flesh  from alien talons then the shriek dies she 
straightens up

and rips her face apart in a single movement the glistening claws  
coming away with skin eyes muscle teeth and splinters of bone 
sound of ripping  cloth the new beast sheds its human skin in a single 
sinuous bloody ripple  molting on fast forward

an instant of utter silence as the featureless mask moves from side to  
side scanning

trent vomits explosively the marine guard snatches his pistol from its  
holster and fires wildly across the table blind screaming chaos

spence is coming down the corridor carrying a clear plastic bag of  
styrofoam food containers nobody else in sight she look tired but 
not  particularly worried she reaches the door to his cubicle thumps 
on it with the heal  of her hand

spence tully hey open up got you some food

no reply she thumps again then punches the combination the lock look  
like a telephone keypad door opens dark inside

spence continuing tully you sleeping

she climbs in dark very a red led glows on the phone console she  
crawls through the detritus of tullys housekeeping and fumbles with

spence tully

walker stops the jeep hicks stands up plays the beam of a flashlight  
around the area presses the mute button on his headset

hicks bellows tully tully yo

hicks clips the flashlight beneath the barrel of his gun and jumps 
down reflections ripple as he moves forward swings the beam along the 
surface   something there the logopatches down a sleeve of 
tullys ruptured bloodsoaked leather jacket drifting shred of human

jackson we can fiddle the overrides on the fusion package baby nova

bishop were dealing with a new form colonel we know nothing of this  
new mode of reproduction others may have already become hosts

rosetti what are you suggesting

bishop in order to be entirely certain colonel it would be necessary 
to

override the fusion package now

jackson looks up at bishop hes suggesting mass suicide

hicks i thought you were programmed to protect human life

bishop with android blandness im taking the long view

jacksons console chimes begins to display new data id shots of three

out  the scrubber the main air scrubber pretty soon there isnt 
going to be  anything to breathe in here wed by okay for about five 
days except you also  started an electrical fire and we got no way to 
put it out the crews down to onetwentyeight

them out

bishop yes colonel i

bishop lowers himself through the opening dangles an emergency 
service  ladder is recessed in one wall he tries to reach one of the 
rungs with his  foot but the toe of his boot slips too far he begins 
to swing back and forth  like a gymnast building momentum  and lets

the lifeboat party emerges coughing from a wall of acrid smoke

reaction shot

dismay and amazement

the tunnel has been sealed with a plug of alien resin human bones  
weapons and marine helmets protrude from the biomech convolutions of 
the resinwall  another of the sixwheeled military vehicles carriers 
is skewed across the tunnel  in a pool of blood

rosetti it doesnt want us to get out

hicks bugs just fucking bugs cmon he climbs into the drivers 
seat  of the carrier were taking the bus which way ops

jackson getting in beside him way we came unless you think of

here  get up there was an experiment it got out of control we 
have to go

tatsumi what kind of experiment

hicks throwing the carrier into gear cutting off their questions 
come  on

int blue concourse

tracking on carrier close on hicks and jackson she takes a flat 
gadget  from her jacket and flips it open a miniature computermap on 
anchorpoint like a  pocket video game

as she wiggles a tiny joystick extreme closeup on miniature color  
screen shes looking for an alternate route to the lifeboats

jackson still studying the map left at b83 well cut through  
aquaculture up to level to aeroponics we can get into residential 
from there then its  up a service tunnel behind the central 
mainframe

hicks sounds complicated

jackson quickest way

flips the map shut spence is trying to comfort halliday

int aquaculture farm

an automated fish farm factory space ranged with dozens of waisthigh  
round white vats of dark green water low ceiling dim light sweeps 
rotate  slowly across the water in some vats others are still with 
floating green  vegetation

hicks leads the party along a narrow aisle between the vats jackson  
pauses to check her map and watch hicks light a cigarette leans his 
elbow against  the nearest vat

jackson were doing okay

the surface of the water behind hicks elbow erupts as the fish go into 
a  feed frenzy he yelps and jumps back dropping his cigarette

spence bass theyre just hungry ready to be harvested

hicks sure lets get out of here okay

the others follow keeping their distance from the vats

int elevator shaft

bishop jumps down dodges a dangling power cable squints through the  
smoke finds a manual emergency level that opens the shafts door

int tunnel

a blast of air fans the flames behind him as he steps out the carrier 
is  there among the scattered crates where hicks left it bishop 
climbs in tries  the power a feeble whine touches another button 
the dash flashes battery recharge he climbs down an sets off along 
the tunnel at a jog

int aeroponics farm

structures of white styrofoam are studded with hundreds of precisely 
spaced plants  their roots watered by periodic bursts of highpressure

all of the wreathed in mist under  brilliant halogen lamps

hicks scans the chamber gun ready as the party emerges from a hatch 
in  the white deck behind him spence has to help halliday whose 
cheeks are  streaked with tears rosettis up last clutching his 
pulserifle a bit too  tightly eyes darting around the chamber

hicks keep the safety on colonel you could hurt somebody

he kneels beside the hatch takes plastique and a grenade from his  
harness and slaps together another bomb

rosetti what are you doing

hicks they may be following us

he closes the hatch over the charge and locks it halliday starts to 
weep

hysterically in spences arms goes to her knees the tries to curl 
into  a fetal position on the white deck shuddering crying like a 
child rosetti  rushes over as spence is trying to get her to her feet

rosetti theyll hear you

rosetti slaps hallidays face hard eliciting a piercing scream 
spence   no hesitation  punches him solidly in the face his head 
snaps back and  hes down reaching for his rifle

tableau spence furious ready to kick ass halliday wideeyed stunned  
into silence by spences move rosetti with blood on his mouth and his 
hand on  his gun

jackson to rosetti cocking her gun try it

hicks breaks the spell

hicks drill sergeant bellow two minute fuse hall ass people

the lab tech grabs halliday throws her over his shoulder and runs 
the  others scramble after him including rosetti whose drive to self
preservation  is paramount hicks and spence take up the rear

hicks shoots her a grin as they run

long shot down the aisle of aeroponic greenery hightech hanging 
gardens  of babylon the lifeboat party approaching behind them the 
hatch lifts off  its hinges with the explosion crashes back in a 
tangle of metal several of  the party are thrown to the deck

jackson quietly urgently as the others pick themselves up hicks

hicks yeah

jackson look

she points down another aisle of aeroponic structures

jackson continuing what the hells that

two of the styrofoam structures have been overgrown with a grayish 
parody  of vegetation glistening vinelike structures and bulbous sacs 
the echo the  alien biomech motif patches of thick black mold spread 
to the styrofoam and  the white deck

hicks it was cabbages or something

tatsumi with the others come please jackson which way

jackson gripping hicks arm pulling him along spence said it did her  
monkeys too raising her voice third door to the right

evident in his run makes a turn into the chamber that houses the 
fusion package anchorpoints power source the chamber is spotless

but it wasnt supposed to be like this and it mightve worked it 
almost did  now look at it ending

she sits up and hugs halliday whose eyes are shut tight

bottom of the elevator he reaches up grabs a rung  sets his left 
boot on another straightens up  and drives the jagged and of his  
broken knee joint through the side of his leg and the fabric of his

alien distracting it from halliday

the beast springs toward spence bet shes already scrambling out along 
a

fragilelooking catwalk that quakes with her passage the alien pursues  
her into the forest of cables with a hideous agility hicks clambers up 
through  the opening too late spence and the alien are out of sight

takes  a breath look out between two glowing trunks of cable sees the 
aliens  back fifteen feet away she bites her lip and slips out

motherfuckers

rosetti looks up at her

rosetti go ahead

clenched teeth as a wisp of acid smoke rises from his torn trouser leg 
hicks  shines his light down into the duct

hicks oh man forget it jackson anyway its empty

he tosses her a fresh magazine

his light and passes it to spence

spence continuing on my god

the doors look as though someones gone after them with a giant can  
opener theyre ragged gaping bishops hands suddenly appear in the 
opening in  the floor grip the edge he hauls himself up arms 
quivering with strain  last thing through is the useless leg he has 
to pull it up with both hands

he looks anxiously out into the mall nothing moving no aliens in 
sight  the queens attack as torn loose a strip of alloy trim bishop 
bends it  double for strength and begins to work it beneath the belt 
around his thigh still  keeping an eye on the mall

hicks shit no hes just brass hes just like you an me to the 
people  who brought this down wouldnt do any good to grease them 
either

jackson bullshit what not

rosetti breaks into a stumbling run as he nears the portal at the end 
of  the corridor the entrance to the lifeboat bays

closeup  rosetti

frantically punching a combination wants that door to open gets it  
slides back smooth as silk revealing a brightly lit room filled with 
pristine space  gear and an indeterminate number of aliens their 
appendages tangled black and  shiny as a fresh catch of eels

rosetti no goddamn it no

the aliens stir as he throws himself back down the corridor toward the  
others hicks drops tatsumi who sags into jacksons arms and raises 
his rifle  fires a bolt past rosetti into the heart of the mass 
rosetti claws his way by  as spence lets loose with the flarepistol 
all the ammo she has but its a big red

distress flare straight through the portal it bursts crimson 
lightning

scattering the aliens now everyone is backing down the corridor the 
way  they came jackson burdened with tatsumi rosetti fumbles with the

come darting out  past the dying cherry brilliance of the flare 
screaming down the corridor the  second door open for rosetti  
hes through the second lab tech on his heels

int an office

tries to slam and lock the door in spences face  but the lab tech 
yanks him out  of the way the others tumble in jackson with tatsumi 
in a firemans carry  hicks kicks the door shut and locks it  as 
something slams into it hard jackson  lowers tatsumi to the carpeted 
floor

he finds her around the corner of a padded partition that screens a 
desk  console from the rest of the room his light finds the lab
coated corpse sprawled  in the chair behind the desk a quarter of its 
skull blown away dried blood  spattered across the bulkhead a service 
automatic locked in rigid fingers

hicks shrugs did himself hey rosetti cmere

rosetti looks around the edge of the partition sees trent

hicks continuing thats it man thats what it looks like you dont

 jackson continuing filter suit radio third times a charm

a bigger burst of sparks the hatch suddenly pops open with a rush of  
escaping air

jackson continuing filter suit radio how damn okay

jackson ducks wedges helmet and shoulder through the opening  and a  
queen sized stinger erupts through the back of her neck slicing the 
suits  alloy collar ring like butter brief but horrible sound on 
radio

a queen her crest rising against the stars leads the swarm against 
them  in a solid wave

hicks pumps the pulserifles grenade launcher sheer reflex no  
consideration for the effect of recoil in zerog pulsecharges have 
been assumed to be

his last round is for the towering queen  androids dont miss  
straight into the jaws her head explodes

but the headless body doesnt stop it stumbles tumbling forward 
flips  over the vast abdomen with its lashing stinger outlined agasint 
the stars

as bishop tugs his wedged foot free and rolls as the stinger whips 
down  to gouge a chunk of bright steel from the hull the carcass 
smashed into the  lifeboat  the swarm twitches hesitates with the 
loss of the queens unifying intelligence the aliens are reduced to 
their usual level of instinctual  action

hicks filter suit radio bishop come on

hicks with spence is fleeing across the hull taking long zerog 
leaps   one more worries about drifting away

spence filter suit radio the mast bishop the radio mast

bishop starts after them abandoning his empty pulserifle trying to  
bound along on his good leg the stiff one obviously in his way three 
aliens rapidly  gaining on him he loses his balance

hicks and spence have almost reached the foot of the radio mast  
handholds lead out to the tip

hicks sees bishop struggling to right himself the aliens closing in  
snatches the rifle from spence

hicks filter suit radio to spence go on get out there

hicks recrosses the hull to bishop shoots the nearest alien gets a 
grip  on bishops suit pulls him up tries for the second alien but 
misses they  start for the mast hicks firing back at the swarm

clinging to a handhold

hick and bishop haul themselves handoverhand along the mast

bishop filter suit radio the fusion package hicks overload

hicks filter suit radio yeah but it means we win come on

the swarm closes around the foot of the mast in a single writhing mass  
one spring onto the handholds and scuttles out along the mast like a 
spider
