the night stand

            shhhhh

woody covers up slinkys mouth aware that the other toys in
the room are watching  he leans in close to slinky

                         woody
                   whispering
            just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy

                         slinky

slinky shuffles off

                         woody
            be happy

slinky perks up his gait and laughs hard

woody proceeds in the other direction  he passes a toy
robot and snake partially hidden under the bedspread

                         woody
                   to the room

follow woody

woody walks past an etchasketch etch going the other
direction

                         woody
            hey etch  draw

both etch and woody whip around like gunfighters

before woody can fully extend his arm out the etchasketch
etches a gun on its screen

                         woody
                   pretending to be shot
            oh you got me again etch youve
            been working on that draw  fastest
            knobs in the west

slinky passes a group of toys on the floor

            got a staff meeting you guys come
            on lets go

robot and snake begin constructing a podium made out of
legos and a tinker toy tub while woody searches the floor

                         woody
            now where is that    aw hey
            who moved my doodle pad way over here

woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it  as he reaches down to pick it up

rex the plastic dinosaur jumps out to scare woody

                         rex
            rooaaaarr

                         woody
                   unaffected
            oh how ya doin rex

rex suddenly turns timid

                         rex

                         woody

            im going for fearsome here but i
            just dont feel it  i think im
            just coming off as annoying

a crook suddenly grabs woodys neck and jerks him towards bo
peep the porcelain figurine

                         woody
                   choking
            aach  oh hi bo

                         bo peep
            remember im just a couple of
            blocks away

woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium

the toys crowd together as woody steps up to the podium
mike a toy tape recorder waddles up next to woody and
indicates his microphone

the green army man hops down to the floor where a bucket o
soldiers sits

            lets move move move

the green army men file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor

int upstairs hallway

andys door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear  satisfied he motions for
the others to proceed  squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope

the army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars

angle sargents binocular view of downstairs

directly below mrs davis passes through the hallway
rounding up andy and all his birthday guests

                         mrs davis
            okay cmon kids  everyone in the
            living room  its almost time for
            the presents

once mrs davis and the children are out of sight the
sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal

two paratroopers jump out through the railing parachuting
down to the floor below

int downstairs hallway  continuous

the paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles
then give the all clear sign

the jump rope is lowered and more soldiers rappel down

int andys bedroom

the toys race towards the nightstand where woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor

                         woody
            and this 
                   turning on the baby monitor
             is how we find out what is in
            those presents

int downstairs hallway

the green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly

sfx footsteps

can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door  immediately the sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses

                         mrs davis os
            okay whos hungry  here come the
            chips  ive got cool ranch and
            barbeque 

the door opens and mrs davis foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier

                         mrs davis
            owww  what in the world    oh

with a sweep of her foot she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room

int andys bedroom

                         rex
            shouldnt they be there by now

            theyre the best  cmon theyre
            not lying down on the job

int downstairs hallway

as soon as mom is gone the sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room

the sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward  a casualty of mrs davis foot  the
sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet

                         wounded soldier
                   moans
            go on without me  just go

                         slinky
            a good soldier never leaves a man
            behind

the sargent motions to the remaining men above  they lower
themselves via jump rope riding the baby monitor  once
downstairs they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant  suddenly

a ball

bounces into the hallway followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor

the sargent supporting his wounded man reaches the plant
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor  they
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by

int downstairs  house plant  continuous

while the baby monitor is set in place a medic evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the thumbs up signal

the sargent scans the party with his binoculars

frantic rex slams into a trashcan and falls over

everyone scurries to their places as the kids footsteps
grow louder

woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as

andys bedroom door flies open and a flood of childrens
feet rush in

door behind them

the toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed

                         mr potato head
            what is it

                         bo peep

woody crawls out from under the bed  the toys are shocked
to discover him there

                         slinky
            woody what are you doing under the
            bed

            hey  what did i tell you earlier
            no one is getting replaced

the toys give each other a look of doubt

                         woody
            now lets all be polite and give
            whatever it is up there a nice big
            andys room welcome

woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed peeking over the
edge  his eyes widen at the sight of

buzz lightyear

we see buzz as woody does  an expensive looking space age
action figure covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe  the imposing gi joesized doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed his back to woody

woody gulps

buzz comes alive and looks around

angle buzzs pov through his helmet

while he scans the bedroom a darth vader like breathing is
heard

buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest

sfx electronic beep

            buzz lightyear to star command

just then buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging  the
box is designed to look like a spaceship

                         buzz
                   gasp
            my ship

he runs up to the box and investigates the damage

                         buzz
            blast  thisll take weeks to repair

buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm  his
wrist communicator

            hypersleep

buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed

                         buzz
                   into communicator
            terrain seems a bit unstable

he taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator

                   into communicator
            no readout yet if the air is
            breathable and there seems to be
            no sign of intelligent life

woodys face suddenly pops into view

                         woody
            hellooo

                         buzz
            hoyaaahh

buzz jumps back taking a fighting stance  he presses a
button on his arm that turns on a red laser beam light on
his wrist  buzz aims the red beam on woodys forehead and
holds it there

                         woody
            aaaaaaah  whoa hey whoa did i

woody tries to keep up

laser

as buzz speaks woody glances down at the box in which buzz
arrived

angle back of buzzs box

there is a cartoon drawing of buzz giving the exact word
forword spiel that buzz is now giving

                         mr potato head

woody walks over to bo peep

                         woody
            youd think theyve never seen a
            new toy before

            well sure look at him  hes got
            more gadgets on him then a swiss

slinky presses the button on buzzs arm activating his
laser light  buzz quickly pulls his arm away

                         buzz
            ah ah ah please be careful  you
            dont want to be in the way when my
            laser goes off

                         woody
            hes not a space ranger  he
            doesnt fight evil or shoot lasers
            or fly 

                         buzz
            excuse me

buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out

again the toys gasp in awe

                         hamm
            oh impressive wingspan  very good

                         woody

            plastic  he cant fly

                         buzz
            they are a terilliumcarbonic alloy
            and i can fly

                         woody
            no you cant

                         buzz

                         woody

                         woody

                         buzz
            all right then i will
                   to toys
            stand back everyone

the crowd of toys make room for buzz as he heads towards the
edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost  he poses like a
high diver shuts his eyes

                         buzz
            to infinity and beyond

and leaps off the bed

buzz plummets straight down hits a big rubber ball and
bounces right back up

he then lands on a hotwheels car which races him down the
track through the loop and off a ramp  buzz soars upward
into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling

buzz becomes wedged between the planes wheels  the impact
turns on the planes motor making it and buzz spin around
and around

all the other toys watch from the bed mesmerized

finally the centrifugal force causes buzz to separate from
the plane sailing him across the room toward the bed

buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of woody and
then opens his eyes

                         buzz
            can

the crowd of toys rush buzz cheering and clapping with
adoration

                         rex
            whoa  oh wow  you flew
            magnificently

                         bo peep
            i found my moving buddy

                         buzz
            why thank you  thank you all
            thank you

                         woody
            that wasnt flying  that was
            falling with style

                         mr potato head
            man the dolls must really go for
            you
                   aside
            can you teach me that

woody stands alone at the other end of the bed fuming
slinky caught up in the euphoria approaches woody

                         slinky
            heh heh heh  golly bob howdy 

                         woody

int andys bedroom  later

a andy plays with woody jumping up and down on the bed
running around the room

b andy sets woody down on the floor  next he lands buzz
lightyear on the floor opposite woody  andy shoots buzzs
laser at woody and then smacks woody across the room as if
hed been blown away by the laser

c andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
cowboy pajamas

                                            match cut to

and a homemade spacemans helmet

                         andy
            buzz lightyear to the rescue

d woody observes all the cowboythemed items in the bedroom
transform to space motif the posters the drawings on the
wall the pillow the bedspread

e buzz watches rex execute a wimpy roar  the space ranger
suggests a few tips for the dinosaur  rex tries again this
time giving a jurassic park roar

the roar blasts potato heads features right off his face

f woody passes etchasketch whos sporting a portrait of
buzz

woody looks across the room to see buzz combing troll dolls
hair chatting away like a hair dresser

woody angrily shakes etch removing buzzs image

g rocky snake troll doll and rex are lifting tinkertoys
as weights  buzz works out on top of an upside down robot
using his feet as a treadmill

potato head attempts to lift his tinkertoy barbell but ends
up tumbling backwards leaving his arms connected to the
barbell

h woody looks under the bed for slinky finding only the
checkerboard

woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see slinky and
robot under buzzs direction setting buzzs ship up on
top of abc blocks for repair

in frustration woody kicks the checkerboard sending the
pieces flying  one of the checkers ricochets off the
dresser and boomerangs into woodys mouth

i on andys bed buzz pets slinky whose back end is
stretched over to the other side where woody sits  slinkys
wagging tail whacks woody in the face repeatedly

woody shoves slinkys rear end off the bed leaving his
front end no choice but to eventually follow

j at bedtime andy loads his toys into the toybox until
just woody and buzz are left  he deliberates as to which
toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox

int andys bedroom  later that night

andy is sound asleep with buzz tucked under the covers next
to him

woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
back into the box closing the lid to

black

end montagesong ends

the black screen splits horizontally to become

int andys bedroom  morning  woodys pov of the bedroom
from the toy box

all is clear  no sign of andy  woody throws open the lid
of the toy box

                         woody
            finally

he takes a couple deep breaths of fresh air then discovers
that his hat is missing

                         woody
                   looking back into
                   the toy box
            hey  whos got my hat

the rubber shark pops up wearing woodys cowboy hat

                         shark
            look im woody  howdy howdy howdy

                         woody

            ahhah  ahhahhah
                   grabs the hat
            give me that

woody leaps out of the toy box

                         buzz os
            say there lizard and stretchy dog
            let me show you something  it
            looks as though ive been accepted
            into your culture

woody looks up to see buzz chatting with rex and slinky

                         buzz
                   continued
            your chief andy inscribed his
            name on me

buzz puts his foot out so that slinky and rex can see the
sole of his boot

the name andy is written on it in permanent marker

                         slinky  rex
            wow

                         rex
            with permanent ink too

                         buzz
            well i must get back to repairing
            my ship

buzz walks away

woody looks at his foot  andy is written on it also but
in a much more childish scrawl and is largely faded

                         bo peep os
            dont let it get to you woody

hearing bo woody puts his foot back down and quickly
straightens up

                         woody
                   nonchalant
            uh let what  i dont  uh what
            do you mean  who

                         bo peep
            i know andys excited about buzz
            but you know hell always have a
            special place for you

                         mr potato head
                   walking past
            yeah  like the attic  heh heh

                         woody
            alright  thats it

woody angrily marches across the room

across the room buzzs cardboard ship is still up on the
abc blocks  buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
the ship like a mechanic  snake and robot stand by waiting
for instructions  buzzs hand reaches out from under the ship

                         buzz
            unidirectional bonding strip

robot turns towards snake who stands in readiness by a tape
dispenser

                         robot
            mr lightyear wants more tape

snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth

woody approaches the skateboard grabs hold of buzzs foot
and rolls him out from under the ship

                         woody
            listen lightsnack you stay away
            from andy  hes mine and no one
            is taking him away from me

                         buzz
            what are you talking about
                   to robot
            wheres that bonding strip

buzz rolls himself back under  woody rolls him out again

                         woody
            and another thing  stop with this
            spaceman thing  its getting on my
            nerves

                         buzz
            are you saying you want to lodge a
            complaint with star command
                         woody
            oh okay so you want to do it the
            hard way huh

buzz stands up face to face with woody

                         buzz
            dont even think about it cowboy

                         woody
            oh yeah tough guy

woody pushes buzz in the chest accidentally activating a
button that makes the spacemans helmet open

buzz grabs his neck gasping for air  he drops to his knees
and begins to writhe on the ground holding his breath

woody is unsure how to react

suddenly buzz sniffs the air

                         buzz
            the air isnt toxic

buzz rises and points an accusing finger at woody

                         buzz
            how dare you open a spacemans
            helmet on an uncharted planet  my
            eyeballs couldve been sucked from
            their sockets

buzz closes his helmet

                         woody
            you actually think youre the buzz
            lightyear oh all this time i

            buzz lightyear

                         woody
            oh no no no
                   pointing behind buzz
            buzz look  an alien

                         buzz
            where

buzz falls for the trick and turns around

woody kneels over with laughter

around in their backyard

a tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard
sid pummels the figure with rocks while scud strains at his
leash barking wildly

                         mr potato head

approaching him from the other end of the desk  woody picks
lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene

                         rex
            oh no  i cant bear to watch one
            of these again

buzz grabs lenny from woody and looks through him

                         buzz
            why is that soldier strapped to an
            explosive device

                         woody
                   redirecting buzzs view

he is sporting a skull tshirt and laughing hideously

                         woody

                         buzz

                         buzz
            well then weve got to do something

buzz steps up onto the window ledge  the toys gasp in shock

                         bo peep
            what are you doing  get down
            from there

            yeah sure  you go ahead  melt
            him with your scary laser

woody presses buzzs laser button  it emits a wimpy
electronic beep  buzz quickly pulls his arm away

                         buzz
            be careful with that its
            extremely dangerous

while woody and buzz banter lenny witnesses sid lighting
the fuse of the m80

                         lenny
            hes lighting it  hes lighting it

                         sid os

                         lenny
            hit the dirt

the toys jump away from the window

sfx explosion

dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
andys house

                         sid os
            yes  hes gone  hes history

andys toys peek over the window sill

angle sids yard

a large black scorch mark is all that remains where combat
carl once stood  sid jumps up and down victoriously while
scud resumes his barking

                         buzz
            i could have stopped him

                         woody
            buzz i would love to see you try
                   gesturing to sids yard
            course id love to see you as a
            crater

sid cackles and dances around the crater

                         bo peep
            the sooner we move the better

                                            dissolve to

ext andys front yard  sunset

a for sale real estate sign stands in the front yard
another sign reading sold hangs from the bottom

int upstairs hallandys bedroom

mom opens the door to andys room and steps in  the room is
full of packing boxes most of them half full  andy is
playing with woody and buzz

                         andy
            to infinity and beyond

                         mrs davis
            oh all this packing makes me
            hungry  what would you say to
            dinner at uh oh pizza planet

                         andy
            pizza planet  oh cool

andy throws the two toys on his desk with buzz landing right
on top of woody

                         mrs davis
            go wash your hands and ill get
            molly ready

the minute the door is closed woody comes alive and shoves
buzz off of him

                         andy os
            can i bring some toys

                         mrs davis os
            you can bring one toy

                         andy os
            just one

woody perks up with concern

                         woody
                   to himself
            one toy

he glances over his shoulder at buzz who is walking away
towards the opposite end of the desk

woody picks up a magic 8 ball left beside him on the desk
with his back to buzz woody quietly shakes the 8 ball

                         woody
                   whispering
            will andy pick me

he tips the 8 ball over  the triangular oracle floats up to
the surface  its prediction reads dont count on it

                         woody
            dont count on it  dohhhh

woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust  it rolls across
the desk and falls behind it with a loud thud

woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
and peers down it

angle back of the desk

the 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom  the space is
a black chasm dark and deep just big enough to fita toy

woody looks across the desk at buzz

he is humming to himself as he forages through andys
penpencil tray looking for tools to repair his ship with
right behind buzz sits

the rc car

it rests on the desktop pointing in the direction where the
8 ball fell with the remote laying by its side

woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to buzz

                         woody
            buzz  oh buzz buzz lightyear
            buzz lightyear thank goodness
            weve got trouble

                         buzz
            trouble
                   looking around
            where

                         woody
                   pointing to the back
                   of the desk
            down there  just down there  a
            helpless toyitsits trapped
            buzz

                         buzz
            then weve no time to lose

buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk

                         buzz
            i dont see anything

woody picks up the remote for the rc car and switches it on
rcs eyes headlights open sleepily

                         woody
            oh hes there  just just keep
            looking

woody hits the forward button on the remote and steers the
rc car straight for buzz

                         buzz
            what kind of a toy  

buzz turns to see rc headed straight for him  he dives out
of the way as the rc car smashes into the base of

a bulletin board

the impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board  buzz
ducks as pins land all around him sticking into the desk
like arrows

potato head

sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with hamm

he looks up at the desk and gasps as the bulletin board
slams down onto

a globe

knocking it out of its stand  the globe starts rolling
right at buzz

woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos hes created

buzz runs along the desk the globe rolling right behind
him indiana jones style  buzz gets stuck log rolling on
a pile of pencils but at the last second jumps out of the
way onto the window ledge

the globe lumbers past buzz and strikes a luxostyle
desklamp  the arm of the lamp swings all the way around
barely missing woody

and knocks buzz out the window

                         toys
            buzz

                         woody
            buzz

woody looks out the window  no sign of buzz  all the other
toys rush over to the sill

                         slinky
            i dont see him in the driveway  i
            think he bounced into sids yard

woody backs away from the commotion unnoticed

                         rex
                   gasp
            buzz

                         rc car
                   electric motor sounds
            whirrr  whirrrrwhirrrr

rex looks over at rc  the remote control car is bouncing up
and down excitedly

                         rex
            hey everyone  rcs trying to say
            something

the toys turn from the window to rc

                         rex
                   leaning down close
                   to rc
            what is it boy

                         rc car

            what

the toys turn to woody who suddenly realizes how this looks

                         woody
            wait a minute  you  you dont
            think i meant to knock buzz out the

                   backing away
            oh i dont like confrontations

the sargent pops out of the army bucket next to woody

                         sargent
            where is your honor dirtbag  you
            are an absolute disgrace  you

woody seals the lid back on the bucket

potato head starts closing in on woody

            your playtime could ya woody

            well what if andy starts playin

potato head has driven woody back to the very edge of the
desk  trapped

                         hamm
            i dont think we should give him
            the chance

suddenly the lid pops off the bucket of army men

                         sargent
            there he is men  frag him

the army men yell charge and pounce on woody while all the
rest of the toys close in

the toys all drop woody and rush back to their places

andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
woody is lying  andy overlooks woody and begins searching
around the room

                         andy
            mom  do you know where buzz is

                         mrs davis os

woody looks across the room

potato head and etchasketch peek out of a packing box
etchasketch scribbles a hangmans noose while potato head
points an accusing finger in woodys direction

woody gulps

next to the van begins to rustle  hands part the foliage
revealing buzz  he eyes woody going into the van and does a
slow burn

the van engine starts up  buzz races out of the bush and
with a mighty leap grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway

angle side of andys house

a chain of monkeys falls into view dangling a considerable
distance above the ground

ext andys bedroom window  continuous

the rest of andys toys have regrouped at the window
supervising the lowering of the monkey chain

                         slinky

            oh great  how am i gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident

suddenly buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof

                         woody
            buzz

buzz jumps down on the back seat to face woody  he is furious

                         woody

            big mistake  huh

no response from buzz  just an angry stare

                         woody
                   weakly
            right  buddy

                         woody
            no

buzz lunges for woody  the two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van

ext gas station  continuous

woody and buzz hit the ground and roll under the van locked
in mortal combat

                         woody
            ok  come on  you want a piece of
            me

buzz lands a punch that sends woodys head spinning around

woody lunges with all his might  he smacks buzz in the
face making it squeak with every blow

buzz closes his helmet on woodys hand

                         woody
            owwwww

woody pounds on buzzs chest with his free hand activating
buzzs sampled voice buttons

                         woody
                   gasp
            andy

woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight leaving buzz and woody stranded

                         woody
            doesnt he realize that im not
            there

            local sheriff and i seem to be at a

woody whips around his expression changing from panic to
seething anger  he charges at buzz

                         woody
            you

sfx loud truck horn

just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station

buzz dives off to the side while woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement  the truck roars over him

a gigantic tire

stops just millimeters from woodys nose

petrified woody inches away from the tire moving back
under the truck until he bumps into buzz

                         buzz
                   into wrist communicator

pizza truck  woody chases after him

buzz bumps into woody

                         woody
                   using straw as periscope
            ow  watch where youre going

they sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises  they then take a good look at

the arcade

the spacethemed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games  a sea of hitech sounds and lights
overwhelm the place

buzz is beaming with hope

                         buzz
            what a space port  good work woody

woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade but
none of the kids look familiar to him  just then he hears

            headed for sector 12 

buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor

the corner of one of the video games and waits for mom and
andy to approach

                   tracking andy and family

            alright buzz get ready

buzz heads for the crane game but woody does not notice
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller

            okay buzz when i say go were
            gonna jump in the basket

way just in time to see buzz leap into the crane game
through the prize slot

                   loud whisper

            dooh  no  this cannot be
            happening to me

woody runs towards the crane game but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some screaming children pass by

int crane game

buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of

squeeze toy aliens

there are hundreds of them all identical and way too cute

                         alien 1
                   excited

game and dives through the prize slot

the cute alien toys

                         buzz
                   continued to the aliens

woody and buzz look up

angle crane game claw

it dangles directly above the toys

                         alien 1
            the claw is our master

                         alien 2
            the claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay

                         woody
                   to himself
            this is ludicrous

woody gasps at the recognition of sids voice  he turns to
see sid heading straight for the crane game

                         woody
            oh no  sid

woody leaps off the partition and tackles buzz pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens

                         woody
            get down

sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket

                         buzz
                   loud whisper

            shhhhhh  the claw  it moves

angle claw

it moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where woody and buzz are hiding

the crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of buzz

                         alien 3
                   whispering excitedly
            i have been chosen

the claw

                         alien 3

with the alien gone buzzs upper torso becomes exposed
forcing the space ranger to freeze  sid suddenly spots buzz

                         sid
            a buzz lightyear  no way

woody still hidden frantically looks around for some way
to escape  behind him through the aliens he eyes

a small repair door

woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door
he grabs hold of the locking latch and after a few
attempts is able to pry the door open

the shadow of the crane lines up over buzz lowers and
grabs his head

                         sid
            yes

the claw begins to lift buzz up

                         woody
                   gasp
            buzz no

woody grabs hold of buzzs feet

woody and the claw begin to have a tugofwar with buzz

woody pulls down hard forcing buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens out of sids view

                         sid
                   slamming his fist
                   against the glass
            wha    hey

still tugging against the crane woody is almost out the
door with buzz  just then the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull buzz and woody back inside

                         alien 4
            he has been chosen

                         woody

            do not anger the claw  he has been
            chosen

woody and buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air dangling lifelessly in front of sid

                         sid
            alright  double prizes

woody and buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by sid

slamming the door behind him

woody and buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
surroundings  heavy metal posters discarded toy remains
and power tools adorn the messy room

they are in helltoy hell

                         woody
            we are gonna die

open it  no good  woody drops to the floor

                         woody
            locked  theres gotta be another
            way out of here

sfx rolling sound

woody is startled by the noise

a small yoyo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
side

spooked woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes
it like a weapon

just then a shadow passes by woody  he turns quickly but
sees nothing

                         woody
            uhbuzz  was that you

woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight

he hears a noise from under sids bed  woody turns on the
flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
noise illuminating

a baby doll heads profile

                         woody
            hey  hi there little fellah
            come out here  do you know a way
            out of here

the baby doll moves out from under the bed revealing a one
eyed doll head atop a spiderlike body made of erector set
pieces

                         woody
                   gasp

the creature extends its legs and rises up taller than woody
scared speechless woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on
babyface

various other mutant toys begin to emerge from the shadows
a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs a skateboard with
a combat soldiers torso screwed to the front end a jack
inthebox with a rubber hand for a head and others

woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind buzz

                         woody
            bbbbuzz

buzz and woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
they grab all the janie and pterodactyl parts dragging them
off into the shadows

                         buzz
            theyre cannibals

woody retreats back into the backpack

int backpack  continuous

woody cowers in the corner as buzz enters  he punches a
button on his chest

buzz adjusts his laser light  it emits a short blip

                         buzz
                   aiming his arm out
                   the pack
            ive set my laser from stun to kill

                         woody

            well we have ways of making you talk

sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on woodys forehead

sid runs out of the room  as soon as hes gone woody jumps
up screaming his forehead burning

he runs to a bowl of halfeaten cereal with milk on the
floor and dunks his head in

buzz runs over to woody pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling woody out of the bowl
two colorful frootloops stick to each of woodys eyes like
glasses

                         buzz

spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead

                         woody

flickers against babyfaces head  the mutant toys look
confusedly at each other

toys by pushing a large button on buzzs back making buzzs
arm involuntarily chop up and down

continually chopping buzzs arm

                         buzz
            woody stop it

                         woody

woody races down the corridor

                         woody
                   to himself

            theres no place like home

turns onto the top of the stairwell down a few steps
and is confronted by

scud

asleep on the landing

woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast  he
slowly backs up the stairs

suddenly buzz appears and pulls woody back against the
hallway wall  he covers woodys mouth with his hand

                         woody
                   muffled gasp


                         buzz
                   whisper
            another stunt like that cowboy

                         woody
                   pulling buzzs hand away
            dont tell me what to do

                         buzz
            shhh

buzz checks to make sure scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway
once safely across he motions for woody to follow

woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with buzz

as he stands

woodys pullstring ring

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing

the toys begin to creep down the hallway unaware that
woodys pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until 

it snaps off the iron railing and flies back towards woody

                         woody voice box
            yeeeeeeehaaaaaaa

both buzz and woody leap in surprise at the sound of woodys
voice box

it opens

woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring

                         woody voice box
                   continued
            we got to get this wagon train a

woody and buzz take off running

                         buzz
            split up

two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway  buzz
dives behind one while woody jumps into

a closet

woody slams the door shut just as scud reaches the top of
the landing  crashed can be heard from behind the closet
door getting scuds attention

buzz peeks out from his doorway at scud sniffing and
growling at the closet

sensing movement behind him scud whips around and starts to
enter buzzs doorway

sfx snoring

the noise stops the dog in his tracks  both scud and buzz
look up to see

scud backs out and heads down the stairs

buzz turns to exit the room when he hears

and opens it

molded on the underside of the cover are three words made
in taiwan

song i will go sailing no more begins

int upstairs hallway  continuous

buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway

as he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at

a small window

it is open revealing the blue sky beyond  a bird flies past

the taunting voice of woody echoes in his head

                         woody vo
            you are a toy  you cant fly

buzz bows his head defeated

beat

slowly buzz raises his head determination in his eyes  he
slams the offending wrist communicator shut as if to deny
its message of made in taiwan

buzz climbs up the railing to the banister  he pops open
his wings and aims himself towards the window above

                         buzz
            to infinity and beyond

buzz leaps off the banister

and falls

in slow motion buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below

int sids houseentryway  continuous

buzz crashes on the entryway floor

buzz opens his eyes to see

his severed left arm

the broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
socket

buzz drops his head back in defeat

song ends

the knob jiggles for a moment  suddenly the door flies
open revealing woody entangled in christmas lights
standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height

hannah has placed a tiny teapot in buzzs severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it

            right back

as soon as hannah exits the room buzz keels over facedown
onto the table

hannah passes woody hidden in the christmas lights and
walks downstairs

            what is it mom  mom where are you

woody bolts into hannahs room

            alright back  back you cannibals

woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room
crashing into the wall

by now there is no sight of buzz within the swarming mass of
mutant toys

woody attacks the mob with a vengeance

when he looks to the mutants

            but  but theyre cannibals  we
            saw them eat those other toys

the mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of sids
last operation the janie doll and pterodactyl  their
heads have been taped back on the correct bodies

the mutants all innocently stare at woody

                         woody
            uhsorry  ii thought that you
            were gonna
                   laughs nervously
            you know eat my friend

immediately the mutant toys retreat back into the dark
corners of the room

                         woody
            hey  no no wait  hey  whats
            wrong

                         sids mom os

                         woody
            sid

footsteps approach the bedroom  woody tries to pick up the
still depressed buzz but he just goes limp

                         woody
            buzz  cmon get up  buzz
            youre
                   grunt
            get up

woody begins dragging buzz towards the bed but their
progress is too slow  he shakes buzz hard

                         woody
            fine  let sid trash you  but
            dont blame me

woody leaves buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as

sid enters carrying a big box

                         sid
            it came  it finally came

sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box

                         sid
                   reverently
            the big one

he pulls out a rocket with the big one written on it

                         sid
                   reading the rocket label
            extremely dangerous  keep out of
            reach of children  cool
                   looks around
            what am i gonna blow  manhey
            wheres that wimpy cowboy doll

sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up

no woody

angle underside of milkcrate

out of sids view woody presses against the inside hanging
on for dear life

sfx buzzs laser

sid looks down and notices hes stepping on buzz activating
his laser

                         sid
            yes  ive always wanted to put a
            spaceman into orbit  haha

he places buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
a toolbox on top of the crate

the impact of the toolbox dislodges woody from his hiding
place  woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
the crate jail

woody watches helplessly as sid fishes out a roll of
electrical tape from the toolbox and with an irreverent
chuckle tapes buzz to the rocket

sfx thunderclap

a flash of lightning interrupts the moment

                         sid
            oh no

sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence
sullenly he smacks his head against the window

                         sid
            aw man

woody heaves a sigh of relief

suddenly sids face brightens  he turns his focus from the
rain to the buzzrocket

                         sid
                   as newscaster
            sid phillips reporting  launch of
            the shuttle has been delayed due to
            adverse weather conditions at the
            launch site  tomorrows forecast

sid smacks buzz down on the desk winds his alarm clock and
places it next to buzz

                         sid
            sunny  hahaha  sweet dreams

int andys bedroom  that night

andy is being tucked into bed by his mother  she hands him
his cowboy hat

                         mrs davis
            i looked everywhere honey but all

                   groggy

                         mrs davis
            oh dont worry honey im sure
            well find woody and buzz before we
            leave tomorrow

andys eyes shut  mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room

a moving box on the floor with the words andys toys
scrawled on it begins to shake from side to side

                         rex os
                   muffled
            aaaah  i need air

rex pops out of the top of the box coughing a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth  potato head appears
beside him

                         rex
                   relieved
            aaaaaah
                   cough

                         mr potato head

            moving buddy

potato head drops back down into the box

                         rex
                   following potato head
            everyone else was picked

bo peep

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat

                         bo peep
            oh woody if only you could see
            how much andy misses you

ext sids house  later that night

thunder rumbles as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling

int sids room

sid is in bed fast asleep

woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail but with the
weight of the toolbox on top it wont budge

woody looks across the desktop at buzz sitting dejectedly
with the rocket strapped to his back

                         woody
            psssst  psst  hey buzz

no reaction from buzz

woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
at buzz striking his helmet

buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at woody

                         woody
            hey  get over here and see if you
            can get this tool box off me

buzz just looks away from woody and bows his head

                         woody
            oh come on buzz  ibuzz i
            cant do this without you  i need

            andys house  sids house  whats
            the difference

                         woody

            you must not be thinking clearly

                         buzz
            no woody for the first time i am

            stupid little insignificant toy

                         woody
            whoa hey  wait a minute  being
            a toy is a lot better than being a
            space ranger

                         buzz
            yeah right

                         woody
            no it is  look over in that
            house is a kid who thinks you are
            the greatest and its not because
            youre a space ranger pal its
            because youre a toy  you are his
            toy

                         buzz
            but why would andy want me

                         woody
            why would andy want you  look at

            talk your helmet does that  that
            whoosh thing  you are a cool toy

woody pauses and looks at himself

                         woody
                   continued depressed
            as a matter of fact youre too cool
            i mean  i mean what chance does a
            toy like me have against a buzz
            lightyear action figure  all i can
            do is

woody pulls his own pullstring

                         woody voice box
            theres a snake in my boots

woody bows his head

                         woody
            why would andy ever want to play
            with me when hes got you
                   pause
            im the one that should be strapped
            to that rocket

woody slumps dejectedly against the crate his back to buzz

buzz lifts up his foot

angle the sole of buzzs foot

the signature andy reads through the dirt and scuff marks

buzz gazes back at woody  a look of determination spreads
across his face

                         woody
            listen buzz forget about me  you
            should get out of here while you can

silence

woody turns around

buzz is gone

suddenly the entire milkcrate begins to shake  woody looks
up to see

buzz

he is on top of the milkcrate trying to push the tool box off

                         woody
            buzz  what are you doing  i
            thought you were 

                         buzz
            come on sheriff  theres a kid
            over in that house who needs us
            now lets get you out of this thing

                         woody
            yes sir

both buzz and woody push the milkcrate and together they
finally get it to move but its slow progress

                         woody
                   strained
            come on buzz  we can do it

sfx truck

the two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench

angle out sids bedroom window

with the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise

a moving truck

can be seen pulling up in front of andys house

                         buzz
            woody  its the moving van

                         woody
            weve got to get out of herenow

buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall

using his legs buzz pushes with all his might  the toolbox
begins to move

woody notices that with every shove buzz gives to the tool
chest the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the
desk

                         woody
            cmon buzz

finally the gap is wide enough for woody to jump through
woody drops down to the floor below

                         woody
                   loud whisper
            alright  buzz  hey  im out

buzz doesnt hear woody and continues to shove the toolbox
and milkcrate farther out

                         buzz
            almost
                   grunt
            there
                   grunt
            

woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
milkcrate topple towards him

                         woody
                   nervous laugh

the toolbox crashes right on top of woody

buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to sid who
stirs

                         sid
                   in his sleep
            i wanna ride the pony

sid does not wake  buzz heaves a sigh of relief then peers
over the edge of the workbench

                         buzz
            woody  woody  are you alright

woody lifts himself out from under the rubble

                         woody
                   punchdrunk
            no im fineim okay

sfx alarm clock

it goes off by sids bed  woody drops back under the
toolbox and buzz goes limp

sid groggily sits up for a beat then his eyes light up

                         sid
            oh yeah  time for liftoff

sid jumps out of bed grabs buzz and bolts out of the room

                         sid os
            to infinity and beyond

woody leaps to his feet runs across the room and catches
the door just before it closes  as he swings the door back
open woody is confronted by

scud

the dog barrels down the hallway straight for woody

                         woody
            aaah  back  back  down  down

woody slams the door shut just in time  scud barks and
scratches at the door

                         woody
                   out of breath to himself
            okay what do i do  come on woody
            think

woody looks across the room

the mutant toys

have appeared all around the room

                         woody
            guys

the mutant toys all scatter and hide

                         woody
            no no no  wait  wait  listen

                   pause
             but i need your help

no response

woody then notices babyface timidly peeking out of the
shadows from under the bed

                         woody
            please  hes my friend  hes the
            only one ive got

babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of sids
metal bedpost

the mutant toys emerge from the shadows and gather around
woody  he kneels down into a huddle with them

                         woody
                   to babyface
            thank you

            rules but if it works itll help
            everybody

int andys bedroom

the movers cart out the last load  a forlorn andy clutches
onto buzzs spaceship box in one hand and his cowboy hat
in the other

andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad sigh

ext backyard shed

sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under

attack anything that exits

woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and scrabble tiles  he points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants

buzz runs up close to the truck with woody still back a few
paces

a strap

dangles off the back of the truck  buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold  he climbs up the strap and onto the bumper

woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach

                         buzz
            you can do it woody

woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap

the moving truck continues down the street leaving buzz and
scud behind

still hanging onto the strap woody scrambles up onto the
bumper  he unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door

suddenly the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light

woody slams into the door causing it to fly upward taking
woody with it

hanging from the door woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what hes looking for

a pile of moving boxes

with the words andys toys written on them in crayon

confusion as they poke their heads up out of the first box

                         woody

woody pulls the rc car and its remote out of the second box

                         mr potato head

woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the rc car

doing doughnuts matching woodys in the middle of the street

looks at his hand

like the one generated from sids magnifying glass appears
on the back of woodys hand

woody leaps up grabs buzzs helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse

jut out of buzz severing the tape that holds him to rocket
the toys separate from the rocket just before it blows up

the toys plummet

                         woody
                   covering his eyes
            ahhhhh

just then buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again  woody takes a peek

theyre flying

                         woody
            hey buzz  youre flying

                         buzz
            this isnt flying  this is
            falling  with style

                         woody
            ha ha  to infinity and beyond

they soar gracefully towards the moving truck but then pass
over it

                         woody
            uh buzz  we missed the truck

                         buzz
            were not aiming for the truck

angle family van

buzz and woody fly right over the vans sun roof and then
drop into the car

int family van  continuous

before anyone can notice woody and buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to andy

andy turns to discover the limp buzz and woody lying in the
box

                         andy
            hey  wow

                         mrs davis

they give each other a knowing wink

                                            dissolve to

ext andys new house  christmas morning  living room bay

through the gently falling snow the davis family can be
seen around the christmas tree unwrapping presents

                         andy

                         mrs davis

one of the christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal

the sargent

the plastic green soldier spies on the davis family with his
binoculars  he turns and motions back into the tree

int christmas tree

a baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
by several green army men  one of the soldiers turns it on

int andys new bedroom

it crackles with static

                         sargent os

nightstand alongside the monitor  they listen intently

                   to the room
            hey heads up everybody  its
            showtime

woody and the rest of the toys are mingling together like a
typical office christmas party

                         rex
            oh  its time

the toys all stop and run towards the monitor

woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
reveal

bo peep

                         woody
            whoooooah  oh  bo
                   rubbing his neck

            to get my attention

                         bo peep
            merry christmas sheriff

on a shelf dangling mistletoe

                         bo peep

bo drops her crook dips woody and kisses him

the rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with excitement not fear

woody

they look at one another with a halfsmile halfgrimace and
laugh weakly

                                            fade out

                           the end
