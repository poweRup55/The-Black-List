                         his felony drug habit was the link

               endless corridors of the old executive building alongside 
               jeff sheridan 35 an enthusiastic government employee who 
               has found his place

                                     sheridan
                         i just want to be clear about one 
                         thing  i used to work for him but 
                         now i work for you  im not a 
                         partisan person im an issue person  
                         in the next few weeks if you allow 
                         me well get you wellversed on an 
                         incredible array of issues  the 
                         most important of which in my 
                         opinion being mexico  i know 
                         everybody that youre gonna meet
                         its important that they like you
                         its not important that they like 
                         me  thats why i can help protect 
                         you

                                     robert
                         like you protected landry

                                     sheridan
                         i see where youre going with that 
                         but if i could just say something 
                         which is basically that a guy like 
                         landry is so autocratic he doesnt 
                         know how to let himself be helped 
                         its a point of pride to take every 
                         bullet no matter who fired it or 
                         whether it was even aimed at him 
                         which personally i think it very 
                         selfdefeating  now dont get me 
                         wrong hes a man of enormous 
                         integrity but theres a political 
                         component to this job that the general 
                         just didnt have any patience for

                         down and wrote two letters and handed 
                         them to his successor  he said when 
                         you get into a situation you cant 
                         get out of open the first letter 
                         and youll be saved  and when you 
                         get into another situation you cant 
                         get out of open the second  soon 
                         enough this guy found himself in a 
                         tight place  so he opened the first 
                         letter  it said blame everything 
                         on me  so he blamed the old guy 
                         and it worked like a charm

                         he got into another situation he

                         like always

               caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than 
               necessary

               robert and barbara look at each other raising their eyebrows 
               and breathing deeply

                         dan kelly in the district attorneys 
                         office will probably help us out

                         i think she has to find out for 
                         herself on her own  we have to
                         allow her space

                         other kid  i will not send the 
                         message that this type of behavior 
                         is okay with her parents  because 
                         it isnt  correct

                                     barbara
                         we dont want to push her away
                         these are growing experiences

               robert looks at his wife then it dawns on him

               and we get blasted with music

               caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on  
               she faces the window and moves back and forth back and forth

               robert calls her name but the soundtrack is drowning him 
               out

               he calls again this time apparently loud enough for her to 
               hear  she takes the headphones off  the music stops  and 
               turns to look at him  or rather she looks right through 
               him as though he didnt exist  robert is so taken aback by 
               the coldness of her gaze that he doesnt speak

               she turns away from him and puts the headphones back on

                                                                    cut to

                         will never tell anyone he was here
                         he will freely give the names of his 
                         superiors  then we get them and 
                         they too will give us names  and

               the figure of commander salazar fills the doorway

                                     salazar

                         search  the odds are not high and 
                         we found variables that reduce the 
                         odds  we hire drivers with nothing 
                         to lose  then we throw a lot of

               shes listening hard for any sound in the house  what shes 
               wondering is if someone is outside the door listening

               she puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once 
               more before lighting it  she does the hit

               and seems to feel better

               suddenly theres a pounding on the door  the voice of her

               druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in 
               a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet

               she pauses a beat then opens the door and tries to brush 
               by her father while avoiding his eyes

               the blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and 
               irritated

               depresses the plunger

               she groans sexually and slumps against the pillows her 
               eyes halfopen her lips twitching

                         believe this disqualifies you from 
                         hearing this case and we therefore 
                         move for a temporary suspension while 
                         this is investigated

                         if this is in any way designed to 
                         delay the testimony of eduardo ruiz

                         the cocaine brand 911 is an east

                                     robert
                         let me ask you a hypothetical 
                         question if salazar worked for 
                         madrigal and the juaraz cartel and 
                         he went out of power would it mean 
                         the juarez cartel is losing influence

                                     javier
                         it could mean that yes

                                     robert
                         that would probably mean the tijuana 
                         cartel is gaining power

                                     javier
                         its possible

                                     robert
                         is it possible to have a drug czar 
                         in mexico who isnt connected in 
                         some war to one of the cartels

               javi thinks along time before answering
