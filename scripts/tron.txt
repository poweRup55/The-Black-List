1the electronic world								 1

	on one side of the screen computer programming language is being
	printed and we hear the sound of an electronic keyboard in the
	center of the screen glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
	simulation of a figure in response to the programming gradually
	the figure is completed and refined as we hear a resonant voice
	speaking

						 voice
				as astonishing advances in computer
				science are made artificial intelligence
				programs are being designed to assist
				us in every area of life

	we see that the completed form is manlike heroic and muscular
	wearing a form of flexible armor the face is calm handsome and
	intelligent as the voice continues the form becomes rounded by
	the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate

						 voice cont
				in a worldwide network of electronics
				they travel through miles of circuitry
				at the speed of light we created them to
				calculate and research to help us design
				and heal and think with all that they can
				do are they only electrical impulses
				or are they a new form of life

	the figure is rotated completely around and as it comes back to face
	us a glowing disk appears beside it again in response to the
	programming printed out at the side of the screen the disk moves
	towards the manlike figure and is rotated into position above it
	as the voice reaches the final word the disk is slammed into place
	on the back of the figure there is an explosion of colored light
	a resounding crash of music and the title appears across the top of
	the screen in huge letters

							 t r o n  

	the music continues as the glow fades and we see that the figure has
	become real a living being although filled with glowing light as
	if it had an inner core of electricity

	the following is a series of quick cuts in montage style as the
	opening titles roll the montage takes place in two worlds the
	electronic world and the real world

	the electronic world is a mirror of our own consisting of the
	electronic information in our computers television sets and
	telecommunications network it is peopled by computer programs
	data and the characters from countless video games for the first
	time we are seeing their world as it really is rather than through
	the window of television screens

	two other electronic figures standing on a glowing grid against a
	dark background each holds a bar between his fists and as a buzzer
	sounds a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them completely
	encasing them

	as the cycles take off we see that each leaves a solidifying laser
	trail behind it one turns abruptly creating a wall in front of the
	other

	screen of a video game the real world version of light cycles
	as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear

5the real world									  5

	we see teenagers strangely lit from below with bluish light
	their hands on electronic controls levers knobs we hear
	electronic beeping and popping

6electronic world									6

	futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat gridlike
	landscape one fires and the other disappears when it is hit to
	reappear spinning wildly in the distance we hear a sound
	like a crack of lightning

7real world										 7

	a video game in an arcade on the screen is a typical version of
	tank wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2d
	maze

	two other game warriors on the grid this time throwing
	glowing disks at one another like frisbees we see the
	one colored blue throw his disk smashes into the second
	warrior and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines

11   real world										 11

	a video game called berserk in which a human character
	throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze we see a quick
	glimpse of the screen then cut to a group of people staring
	down laughing

13   electronic world									13

	another game in progress from a long shot a version of
	jai alai in which the two players stand suspended in space
	on glowing colored rings and throw a pellet of solid energy
	at each other

14   angle on one of the warriors						   14

	he is huge evil looking his body is enormous his head
	mechanical this is sark he glows ominously blue he is catching
	the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller glowing
	yellow

15   close up  face of the opponent						15

	fearful nervous poised on one ring

16   sark											  16

	sneering as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
	back with violent force

16a  the smaller warrior								  16a

	desperately trying to catch the pellet but it smashes
	into the ring which explodes into a million pieces one
	last glimpse of the yellow warriors tortured desperate
	face as he falls to instant death

17   sark											  17

	triumphant laughing high above him etched in enormous
	glowing computer printed 3d block letters are the words

	19  electronic world									19

	sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
	looking blue warriors are lounging around leaning against the
	walls sitting on the floor against the wall they look up as
	sark comes in and one of them calls out

						 warrior 1

				sark my man you are hot

						 warrior 2
				that knuckleball gets em every
				time boy

	sark and the other blue warriors laugh raucously and sark moves on

										 cut to

20   the bridge of the aircraft carrier					  20

	overlooking the video game grid we see sark walking onto the bridge
	removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly a buzzer is
	sounding sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a sigh of
	satisfaction

	the buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
	cylinder forming around sark at first translucent and then
	solidifying so that we cant see through it and sark is
	hidden from view

21   int cylinder  sarks pov							21

	of this happening we can see the inside surface of the cylinder
	 a wavering image of a stretched out face just features
	appears superimposed on the cylinder the face speaks

						 voice mcp
				youre getting brutal sark
				brutal and needlessly sadistic

	the feet sockets glow and we see sark absorbing the energy like
	a drug addict eyes glazed

						 sark
				thank you master control

						 mcp
				we might be capturing some military
				programs soon that interest you

						 sark
				sure id love to go up against some of these
				guys  be a nice break from these
				accounting creampuffs you keep sending
				me which branch of the service

						 mcp
				strategic air command

						 sark impressed
				nice

	the sockets glow more intensely as the hologram disappears and we
	cut from a close shot of sarks satiated face to

22   a corridor beneath the game grid					22

	long darkened sinister a dejected and disheveled character
	crom is being escorted by a guard

	as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guards
	shove the cell is small oneman and in each wall next to the door
	an opening gives a view of the next cell through one of the windows
	we can see the back of another captive program and through the
	other a face looking over at the newcomer the character speaks

	the new captive looks up nervous

				uh thanks but i dont even know

						 ram
				thats what youre doing here master

				im ram theyll train you for

				make it okay hey whats going on
				in the other sectors ive been stuck

	he points to several hash marks on his cell wall

						 crom
				its murder out there you cant even

	focus and we realize that this is not a circuit board but rather
	an actual landscape a suburban grid at twilight we are
	approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
	accurately as we descend a thumping rhythmic noise gradually
	increases in volume until it is very loud and we realize it is the
	sound of a helicopter and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
	landscape we just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
	conversation begins obviously between the pilot of the copter and
	a passenger

	addresses dillinger simultaneously speaking in a humansound voice

				yes  it felt like flynn

				hes still looking for that old file
				cant you just appropriate it

						 mcp
				i would if i could find it its stashed

				out of my range meanwhile

						 dillinger
				meanwhile he might find it

						 mcp
				im afraid so i spotted him this time
				and kicked him out but hes getting

				well i dont knowi just tried

						 dillinger
				oh you have group 7 access dont you

						 alan
				yeah

						 dillinger
				we have to close that down just
				briefly security reasons  someone
				with that access has been tampering

						 alan
				i hope you dont think its me
				i dont even balance my checkbook on
				downtime  ive got a honeywell at
				home for that

						 dillinger
				no no im sure but  you understand
				it should only be a couple of days
				whats the thing youre working on

						  alan
				its called tron its a security
				program itself actually monitors
				all the contacts between our system
				and other systems if it finds
				anything going on thats not scheduled
				it shuts it down i sent you a memo
				on it

						 dillinger
				mmm part of the master control program

						 alan
				no itll run independently
				it can watchdog the mcp as well

						 dillinger
				ah sounds good well we should have
				you running again in a couple of days
				i hope

						 alan
				ok

				ed i am so very disappointed in you

						 dillinger
				im sorry

				i cant afford to have an independent
				program monitoring me do you have any
				idea how many outside systems ive gone into
				how many programs ive appropriated

						 dillinger
						  nods
				its my fault i programmed you to want
				so much

						 mcp
				and i was planning to hit the pentagon
				next week

						 dillinger
				the pentagon

						 mcp
				it shouldnt be any harder than general
				motors was but nowthis is what i get
				for using humans

						 dillinger
				now wait a minute  i wrote you

						 mcp
				ive gotten 2415 times smarter since then

						 dillinger
				what do you want with the pentagon

						 mcp
				the same thing i want with the kremlin
				im bored with corporations with the
				information i can access i can run things
				900 to 1200 times better than any human

						 dillinger
				if you think 

						 mcp
				you wouldnt want me to dig up flynns file
				and read it up on a vdt at the new
				york times would you

						 dillinger
				you wouldnt dare

						 mcp
				so do as i tell you keep that tron program

	of two whitesuited figures visible through a network of two white
	suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
	encloses the giant laser structure they are standing on a cherry
	picker crane at the second story level of the laser with a box of
	tools at their feet we truck down the side of the laser along the
	tubes which house the amplifying lenses and move up gradually
	getting close enough to hear what they are saying and get a look
	at them

	we see that the figures are a young darkhaired beautiful woman
	with her hair tied back under a hard hat and an older man who is
	using a tool on a section of the laser and is also wearing a hard
	hat the woman is lora and the man is dr walter gibbs hes
	wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watchcalculator and
	has an intense almost insane look to his dark eyes with their
	bristling white eyebrows

	in contrast lora seems more serious and conservative but she
	defers to gibbs as a senior and more accomplished scientist
	both have protective eye goggles  worn loosely around their necks
	at the moment

	as the crane lowers them to the floor

						 lora
						sighs
				well here goes nothing 

						 gibbs
				hah interesting interesting you
				hear what you said here goes nothing

						 lora
				well i meant 

						 gibbs
				whereas actually what we propose to
				do is to turn something into nothing
				and back again so you might just as
				well have said here goes something
				and here comes nothing hah

	they step off the crane and walk to a short leadshielded
	cylindrical platform on which rests a solid sphere of clear plastic
	polymer about 3 inches in diameter the firing end of the giant
	laser is aimed straight at the sphere five feet away is an identical
	platform  empty

						 lora
				let me make sure were running

	she crosses to a computer console nearby the console is
	connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables

	pulling her goggles into place over her eyes she sits at the
	console gibbs adjusting his goggles takes a position near
	the platform bearing the sphere  safe from the laser but
	close enough to watch

74   angle  lora									74

	she types a series of commands on the computer keyboard

						 lora
				looks good

						 gibbs os

				let er rip

75   laser lab  as before								75

	the laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright light at the polymer
	sphere for a moment the sphere has the look of a wavering poorly
	received television picture  wobbling lines of dots  and then
	it disappears entirely as gibbs watches a lora works feverishly
	the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away a second
	discharge of light hits the surface of this platform and  like a
	filminreverse of the balls disappearance  it is reconstructed
	five feet from its original position when the beam shuts off lora
	rushes to join gibbs in examining the bornagain ball of plastic

						 gibbs
					quietly
				perfect

	at the sound os of an appreciative pair of hands clapping lora
	and a gibbs turn to see alan in hard hat goggles and paper
	shoecovers walking toward them

						 alan
				beautiful

						 gibbs
				hello alan

						 alan
				boy i sit up there grindin away
				all day and you guys are down here
				disintegrating things and having fun

	he gives lora an embrace and a quick kiss

						 gibbs
				not disintegrating alan  digitizing
				while the laser is dismantling the
				molecular structure of the object
				the computer maps out a holographic
				model of it the molecules themselves
				are suspended in the laser beam then

				yeah tryin to find the file and erase it

						 flynn
				not much chance of that now the mcp can just

	we see they are entering an open part of the game grid with two
	bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
	circular platforms made up of concentric glowing rings crom
	marches acrossone of these and flynn follows suit on the other
	when they each reach the circular platforms the bridges disappear
	we see flynn turn and stare back across the empty space then turn
	and face his opponent above them a third floating disk hovers he
	looks over at crom whos anxious

						 flynn

				you think youre gonna wipe me right
				out dont you

						 flynn
				no i

	a buzzer sounds the game begins crom hurls a glowing pellet
	upwards it strikes the upper platform ricochets off and heads
	straight for flynn

	flynn lunges but misses the pellet strikes one of the rings of
	his platform and that ring dissolves flynns lunge takes him
	right to the edge of the open space created and he just catches
	himself in time to keep from falling over the edge

	his head bends down and their lips meet yoris body begins to glow
	change metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
	love scene with tron sparkling and gorgeous her eyes are closed

614  close up  their faces							614

	finally flynn pulls away from her her eyes stay shut for a second
	then open

						 flynn
				dont worry

615  longer shot										615

	he releases her steps to the edge of the observation port poises
	on the brink and then leaps off directly in the beam we see yori
	shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out

616  her pov										616

	flynn is diving through space in the beam falling in slow motion
	directly into the center of mcp itself

	his voice is that of the mcp

						 sarkmcp
				end of line program

	we can see the mcp in the bg suddenly there is an explosion of
	static as flynn falls into the mcp we see a weird 2d image of
	flynns face circling in the cylinder with the mcp as they battle
	sark falters stumbles distracted by this and tron ducks under him
	and hurls the code disk for the last time it circles the mcp once
	and then hurtles straight for the target the apex of the energy
	cones and connects

618  shot of the apex									618

	a brilliant explosion of lights bursts out

619  shot of sark									619

	dead face wracked with the pain of a second death he begins to melt
	into a column of pure energy dissipating completely

620  shot of the mcp									 620

	we see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones it
	is dressed like dumont was at the i0 tower an old man in the
	padded altar costume spinning slowly finally stopping we see the
	wizened wrinkled face of the true mcp for just a few seconds and
	see that he is furiosly typing on an old remington portable then he
	too dissolves into liquid energy and disappears the cylinder of
	the mcp glows brighter and brighter

621  yori and the bit									621

	on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this

622  her pov										622

	a fountain of energy explodes upwards like a supernova right at the
	camera

623  yori											  623

	shielding her face from the power of the blast

624  long shot										  624

	the nova of energy bursting upwards we start to see the glow
	returning to the surrounding domains as the nova dissipates
	leaving the sky full of sparkling stars

625  yori											  625

	still shielding her eyes but looking out in wonder at the domains
	regaining their life

626  her pov										626

	one domain after another scattered around the horizon glows
	brightly increasing

	leading dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
	programs that were saved he looks up spots the carrier descending

629  shot of carrier									 629

	basically all that is left of it is the bridge with only a very
	faint image of the rest of the body it lands on the mesa

630  ext cpu mesa									   630

	tron catches yori as she jumps down he hugs her close and looks at
	her about to speak but she reaches up and presses her lips to his
	in a quick intense kiss then pulls back

						 tron
					   laughing
				nice

						 yori
				its something users do

						 tron
				wheres flynn

	he looks up at the bridge

						 yori
				hes gone he went into the beam
				he saved you he saved all of us

632  racing over the circuit pattern						632

	and returning to the real world

633  the real world  laser lab							633

	close on the business end of the huge laser in icoms lab a bright
	blast of light shoots out of the mechanism

	widen to reveal the laser pouring its light onto the floor near the
	chair where flynn was sitting when he was digitized

	slowly  in a reverse of his disappearance  flynns body takes
	shape on the floor as the laser shuts off he is revealed intact 
	back in his realworld body and clothes and as bewildered to find
	himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world

	he studies his hands  and sees that theyre now nonluminescent
	flesh and blood

	he looks out the window and sees that its shortly past dawn with
	weak sunlight coming in

	and at the sound of light machinery at work he turns to look at
	loras computer terminal where a hardcopy computer printer is
	coughing out a long document on wide blue paper

	flynn gets up off the floor goes over to the printer and reads the
	document as he does so his eyes widen and a smile appears on his
	face

	the printer finishes its run clicks patiently flynn exuberant
	tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it

						 flynn
				hey  you guys

	before he can say anything more alan turns to greet him holding up
	a seveninch computer software floppy disk in its cardboard sleeve

						 alan
				flynn i made it i worked out some
				new codes for tron put em on a disk
				and  its running

						 flynn
				i know i met him

	from tron and yori in the other world he checks himself

						 flynn cont
				i mean i saw it readup 
				hey look at this

	he shows them the printout it takes alan and lora a few seconds of
	reading it to figure out its significance

						 alan

	flynn folds up the printout puts it in his pocket alan and lora
	get up stretch start wandering slowly toward the door with him

						 flynn
				youre telling me

	as they talk camera pans over to alans color crt screen and holds
	on it

635  crt screen										 635

	the lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off and
	are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
	typical video game

	a blue cylinder poised on a blue mesa  resembling the mcp in the
	electronic world and three yellow rockets they move randomly at
	first then converge on the blue figure from three different
	directions

						 flynn v0
				you have any idea how much i can sue these
				jokers for

						 lora v0
				well just dont forget your old friends
				when youre rich and famous

						 flynn v0
				are you kidding you guysll he running
				this joint by then

						 alan vo
			your friend dillinger sure wont

	the yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time it
	explodes in typical videogame fashion  radiating lines of blue
	sparks the yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
	formation heading together toward the side of the crt screen as we
	hear flynn lora and alan heading for the door

						 flynn vo
				hey you know anybody who wants to
				get hold of some video games cheap

						 lora vo
				youre getting out of the business

						 alan vo
				shouldnt you wait till your
				lawsuits settled

						 flynn v0
				nahi decidedive had enough of
				video games to last me a good long
				time i feel like gettin into some
				real life

	at the sound of the door to alans office closing os the three
	yellow rockets leave the crt screen sailing off its lefthand edge
	hold a moment on the exploded blue figure and
