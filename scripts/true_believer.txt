               ext ossining correctional facility  early morning

               mist shrouds the prison

               cu  eyes

               closed then the lids fly wide open

               int cell

               an asian man sits up on his cot coming out of sleep with a 
               gasp shu kai kim is in his late 20s with a muscled torso 
               and shaved head meant to inspire fear and to hide it

               int cellblock  later

               the electrified doors slide open shu steps out of his cell 
               ortega  a rugged young chicano  steps out of a nearby 
               cell the two cons trade small nods

               int corridor

               the cons walk in single file ortega is behind shu ortega 
               speaks softly with barely perceptible lip movement

                                     ortega
                         fear will kill you

               shus replies are like a ventriloquists as well the two 
               men are running through some sort of arcane drill

                                     shu
                         im not afraid

                                     ortega

                         then believing you are weak theyd 
                         come for you anyway

                                     shu
                         no i want this

                                     ortega
                         good right after chapel its 
                         going down in the yard

               now shu and ortega file into

               int prison chapel  morning

               on the dais the minister leads a small convict choir

               reverse  the congregation

               the cons have segregated themselves into sullen groups of 
               black white and brown

               close  four cons

               at the rear shu is flanked by two stringy chicanos ortega 
               sits behind shu all four stare ahead with an intense 
               blankness

               angle  from the side

               now we see whats really happening shu grips two sharpened 
               spoons the chicanos wrap duct tape around shus fists  so 
               that even if he wanted to he couldnt let go of the knives

               angle  a white con

               in front duane lindeman is burly with long blond locks 
               his arms decorated with swastikas tattooed on one cheek are 
               three black teardrops lindeman is surrounded by others like 
               him all singing a hymn to the lord jesus

               through the chapel doors

               a disturbance out in the hall we hear thumps loud cursing

               duane lindeman

               and friends just keep on singing

               wide

               the rest of the congregation turns around to see whats 
               going on the two corrections officers at the rear of the 
               chapel venture to the door and peer out truncheons drawn

               two white inmates spring out of opposing back row aisle seats 
               and slam shut the chapel doors on the cos  who immediately 
               start pounding on the doors with their sticks

               onstage  a hulking white member of the choir discreetly 
               moves to block the fire exit offstage

               shu and ortega

               turn back around to face what appears at first glance to be 
               a grotesque apparition

               duane lindeman

               seems to be flying from the front of the chapel toward them 
               blond hair flowing arms waving a warlock

               in fact hes racing from the top of one pewback to the 
               next  and his hands are ducttaped too around not 
               sharpened spoons but long serrated blades

                                     ortega
                         motherfuckers not in here

               a siren wails as lindeman leaps at shu  who executes a 
               perfectly timed karate throw sending lindeman over his 
               shoulder to land sprawling in the aisle

               lindemans tattooed accomplices move to help ortega holds 
               them off before lindeman can right himself shu pins the 
               blond goliath brings a fist to lindemans neck sharpened 
               spoon pressed against the neonazis jugular

               outraged the minister claws his way through the crowd of 
               rubbernecking cons

               shu is breathing too hard to demand that lindeman concede 
               but his message is clear now in gasps

                                     lindeman
                         kill me

               instead shu lifts the sharpened spoon away from lindemans 
               neck carefully climbs off steps back

               lindeman lies there defeated then looses a startling banshee 
               scream and springs blades flashing at shu

               theyre like two snarling cats wrestling so furiously we 
               see only a blur of flesh glint of metal splash of blood

               a ring of inmates forms around the combatants some cheer 
               others shout for the fight to stop none dare interfere

               now the back doors virtually fly off their hinges as a half
               dozen cos in riot gear charge the chapel

               it takes all six to drag the bloody cons apart shu 
               immediately goes limp duane lindeman is slack twitching

               horrified the minister backs off vestments soaked in gore

                                                                    cut to

                         edward dowd is an inventive lawyer 
                         im sure hed like you to believe 
                         that the pound of pure cocaine found 
                         in his clients home was intended 
                         for personal recreational use

               several jurors stifle snickers

                                     da
                         he may claim that the many pounds of 
                         baby laxative were intended to help 
                         mr nevins stay regular

               enters he quietly deposits his luggage in the empty back 
               row then moves to the front row behind the defense table 
               seated there is a slick natty defense attorney next to him 
               is a wired and weirdlooking defendant in a threadbare suit 
               the cut decades out of date

                                     da
                         what will mr dowd say the defendant 
                         weighed on his laboratory scales 
                         oh hell think of something but 
                         bear in mind that you jurors control 
                         the scales that really count  the 
                         scales of justice only you can ensure 
                         that the defendant  a man who sells 
                         dangerous drugs to teenagers for

               hair that hangs to his shoulders his vintage suit accented 
               by an embarrassingly wide and loud floralprint tie

                                     da os

                         fair and have courage thank you

               as she crosses to the prosecution table

                         thank you ms jessum mr sweeney 
                         may i have a word with you

               as mr sweeney  the court officer  confers with the judge 
               roger leans forward whispers to the defense attorney

                                     roger
                         roger baron sorry im late

               the defense attorney looks mildly baffled regardless roger 
               extends a hand

                                     roger
                         this is an honor and a thrill

                         really

               but what the hell he shakes with roger

               now the defendant turns to see whats going on trying to 
               breathe as much empathy as he can into the one syllable

                                     roger
                         hi

               the defendant has fixed roger with the sort of soulpiercing 
               stare it takes many acid trips to perfect so delicately

                                     roger
                         whatre you um accused of

                                     defendant

                         work with mr dowd

               nodding at the defense attorney we hear a pounding gavel

                                     judge baum
                         mr dowd would you care to make 
                         your closing argument

               roger pats the defendants shoulder reassures

                                     roger
                         youre in good hands

               the defendant lifts his eyebrows as though to say is that 
               so turns back around and for some reason he rises

                                     defendant
                         i would your honor

               confused at first  then mortified omigod thats dowd

               edward c dowd

               takes three long crooked strides over to the jury box hands 
               clasped behind his back hair streaming

                         brian nevins pound of pure cocaine 
                         was quite clearly intended for sale

               the jurors look surprised so does the da so does brian 
               nevins

                                     eddie
                         the baby laxative  dealers use it 
                         to dilute their coke before selling 
                         it they can  quadruple their 
                         profits

               nevins throws a jittery glance at the jury

                                     eddie
                         and of course you cant sell 
                         cocaine without a laboratory scale

               eddie strikes a tone of cosmic lamentation

                                     eddie
                         cocaine is evil selling cocaine is 
                         evil

               nevins checks his mental rolodex for a great appeals lawyer

                         pity this foolish merchant dislike 
                         him if you must but despise the 
                         tactics the police employed to snare 
                         brian nevins dont lose sight of 
                         whats really on trial here  our 
                         basic personal freedoms our quality 
                         of life

               freedoms and life are rendered as startling shouts that 
               make the jurors sit up straight

                         sublime concepts such as the right

                         for when we condone the bugging of 
                         our citizens bedrooms when we allow 
                         the police to enter our citizens 
                         homes with specious warrants when 
                         we invade our citizens privacy in a 
                         frenzied quest for a wicked white 
                         powder arent we capitulating to 
                         the evil arent we surrendering to 
                         the drug arent we saying cocaine 
                         is more potent than our constitution

               ext courthouse  afternoon  later

               roger maintains a discreet distance behind eddie and nevins 
               as lawyer and client stroll down the steps

               quickly notes the offices squalor and questionable clientele 
               what catches his eye is the trio of cracked and yellowing

               arrow and slick couple to come into his inner office roger 
               starts to follow but eddie shuts his inner office door behind

                         yeah well i had reasonable cause to

                         of the search and seizure was the 
                         only issue the judge refused to 
                         exclude the evidence no deal

               he turns a corner so does eddie

                                     eddie
                         no its not the only issue theres

                         what about entrapment

               fulton veers into the mens room eddie follows

               roger enters behind eddie

                         tempted might succumb

               roger lingers at the sink as eddie follows fulton to the 
               urinals

                                     eddie

                         dont you see planting the idea of 
                         being a criminal is just one step 
                         away from planting the evidence

               fulton flushes grudgingly

                                     fulton

               roger turns away from the drug money embarrassed and ashamed

               as eddie continues roger queasily flips through a stack of 
               forensic exhibits we see xray positives of jimmy chins

                         trial advances in forensic ballistics 
                         analysis will enable us to piss on 
                         the evidence

               the phone starts ringing

               now the door swings open  its kitty as she casually strips 
               off her overcoat

                                     kitty

                         to montreal and wont budge

               kitty catches roger watching her with a look of pleasant 
               surprise with a little smile

                                     kitty

                              sits
                         but theyve still got laura gordon  
                         and she was the closest about 20 
                         feet from the killer

               eddie appears untroubled

                                     eddie
                         gee maybe she saw the gun

               he pulls a joint from the desk drawer and lights up

                                     roger
                         do you have to do that

                                     eddie
                         have to no

               he takes a hit then turns to kitty

                                     eddie
                         start looking into the joe boys  
                         who assigned the hits in 1980 what 
                         rank generally did the hits
                              pointedly
                         your extensive law enforcement 
                         contacts should be of some use

                                     kitty
                              to roger
                         i was never politically correct enough 
                         for comrade dowd

               the phone starts ringing again shouting through the wall

                                     eddie
                         billy

               no result so eddie picks up as kitty and roger continue 
               talking in bg

                         put him through
                              then
                         speaking

               roger has heard of reynard with a trace of incredulity

                         his tests show that shus gun fired 
                         the bullet that killed jimmy chin

                                     eddie

               eddie turns to kitty

                                     eddie
                         did you find me an expert witness on 
                         the joe boys

               kitty is nearly as reluctant as roger

                                     kitty
                         the best expert in new york is a soc 
                         professor at columbia
                              carefully
                         apparently doing a hit was the way 
                         to get into the joe boys

               eddie levels a so what are you telling me look at kitty

                                     kitty
                         so there goes your theory about the 
                         joes giving up shu to protect their 
                         trigger man

                                     eddie
                         but i like that theory and since 
                         im not putting twerp professor on 
                         the stand and since i dont have a 
                         better theory im sticking with 
                         that theory meantime i want pictures 
                         of the joes whatll you bet there 
                         was a guy in the gang looked enough 
                         like shu to fool the eyewitnesses

               kitty and roger halfheartedly nod eddie tries a peptalk

                                     eddie
                         our guy is innocent we prod in enough 
                         places i dont care how solid this 
                         case against shu looks  theres a 
                         weak spot somewhere and when we hit 
                         it the whole hideous thing collapses 
                         better yet we get our hands on 
                         chuckie roeder we dont have to 
                         grope in the dark chuckie is the 
                         answer man

               kitty snakes her head

                                     eddie
                         have you considered that chuckie 
                         roeders not calling himself chuckie 
                         roeder these days get his mugshot 
                         from one of the many law officers 
                         whove got hotpants for you then 
                         canvass those art supplies places 
                         were gonna win this one kitty but 
                         ya gotta believe

               roger

               uneasy with eddies optimism he stands wanders back toward 
               the bathroom then notices that the door leading to eddies 
               living quarters is slightly a jar

               through the open door

               roger sees a single bed in one corner plain wooden bureau 
               opposite but on the walls something strange and beckoning 
               as eddie exhorts in bg roger slips into

               int eddies bedroom

               hung on a hundred hooks and nails are as many ties the wide 
               thriftshop kind that eddie wears to court from a distance 
               we cant distinguish the prints the room is lit only by a 
               blinking neon across the street as roger sifts through the 
               ties we go in close on the big amoebas the zaftig mermaids 
               the oddball dated patterns and paintings its as though 
               each tie stands for a case won or lost but fought as though 
               each loud shameless tie is a piece of eddie himself

               now as he pulls the ties from their hooks to examine them 
               roger exposes old photos tacked to the wall and forgotten

               the photos

               are mostly yellow cracked faded here is eddie twentyfive 
               years ago hair cropped a princeton undergrad five years 
               later hes sprouted a beard and is posed with his graduating 
               class at yale law school

               now its the glory days of the midsixties and eddies in 
               his prime a longhaired defense attorney in denim and 
               leather at a press conference flanked by abbie hoffman 
               and jerry rubin in washington square park igniting an anti
               war rally

               at a sheep meadow bein arm around a lovely young woman 
               toddler balanced on his shoulders infant cradled in her 
               lap eddies family on a longago spring day

               and here is eddie about 30 in a swarm of student activists 
               outside a federal courthouse clearly after winning an 
               acquittal held high above the crowd like a conquering hero 
               now we bring up an excited buzz of voices  as though the 
               crowd in the photo were somehow coming to life over

                                     judges voice
                         matter of people vs shu kai kim

                                                                    cut to

               int superior court  morning

               weve hit the big time its clean spacious echoic the 
               previous courtrooms were by comparison mere vestibules

               judge quealy bangs his gavel

                                     judge
                         this case has been tried before but 
                         you the jurors must make no

               now the judge notices something amiss he squints 

               at the defense table

               theres shu with his new bristly growth of headhair and 
               oversized suit he appears thin and mildmannered almost 
               bookish at shus left sits roger looking around bemused 
               the chair at shus right is empty

                                     judge
                          where is mr dowd

               int mens room

               eddie is alone in here at the sink hes just doused his 
               face he examines his reflection in the dirty mirror trying 
               hard to like what he sees hold for several silent beats as 
               eddie gathers his strength and courage then

                                     reynard vo
                         you will hear from the detectives 
                         who arrested shu kai kim and found 
                         the murder weapon in his apartment

               int courtroom  a few minutes later

               eddie has now taken his seat beside shu reynard is in the 
               midst of his opening statement

                                     reynard
                         an eyewitness will testify that she 
                         saw mr kim shoot jimmy chin in cold 
                         blood an expert who examined kims 
                         gun and the bullet that tore through 
                         jimmy chins brain will testify 
                         that shu kai kim was the killer

               he strides over to the jury box

                                     reynard
                         but this trial is about much more 
                         than mr kims guilt its a test of 
                         our legal system  the fairest 
                         most liberal in the world in world 
                         history so fair and liberal that 
                         lawyers like mr dowd can manipulate 
                         it on a whim to retry convicted 
                         killers well thats a tradeoff we 
                         can live with provided we have the 
                         courage to meet our civic obligations 
                         you twelve are all that stand between 
                         society and every shu kai kim itching 
                         to get free quite a responsibility 
                         but one i know that each of you can 
                         handle

                                                                  time cut

               eddie paces off a large circle  a territorial act in which 
               he is claiming the courtroom as his

                                     eddie
                         picture this in a part of town that 
                         thrives on its spirit of 
                         celebration good food friendly 
                         faces one young man walked up to 
                         another out on the street in front 
                         of the tourists and committed murder

               as eddie pivots we see that his hair is pulled back with a 
               bright blue ribbon the jurors see this too if he didnt 
               have it before eddies now got their full attention

                                     eddie
                         i wonder if chinatowns shopkeepers 
                         and restaurant owners pleaded with 
                         the mayor i wonder if the mayor 
                         put pressure on the police 
                         commissioner

               eddie jigs over to the jury box

                                     eddie
                         what do you think the mayor said to 
                         the police commissioner i think the 
                         mayor said arrest somebody

               hes trailed off the last word is whispered as he opens 
               his mouth again 

                twelve jurors crane forward to hear

                                     eddie
                         anybody

               an older woman gasps the others merely flinch

                                                                  time cut

               the homicide detectives lead off first up is montell early 
               40s beefy black with a toughbutfair persona

               reynard concluding his direct

                                     reynard
                         and so having brought mr kim in 
                         for booking you arranged a lineup 
                         with six other asian males

                                     montell
                         thats right

                                     reynard
                         and the results of the lineup

                                     montell
                         all the eyewitnesses picked kim

                                                                  time cut

               eddie smiles broadly at montell who smiles back then

                                     eddie
                         isnt it a fact that the six other 
                         asian men in the lineup were all 
                         of the classic mongoloid type whereas 
                         shu has the distinct facial bone 
                         structure of a korean

                                     reynard
                         objection the witness is not an 
                         expert in racial classification

                                     eddie
                         isnt it a standard trick to pack a 
                         lineup with men who resemble each 
                         other but look different than the 
                         suspect so the suspect will stand 
                         out for the eyewitnesses

                                     reynard
                         argumentative

                                     judge
                         sustained

               eddie takes a beat flashes another smile montell 
               reciprocates now eddie shifts into his empathetic mode

                                     eddie
                         you had to use less than scrupulous 
                         methods true the mayor was pushing 
                         you hard for an arrest wasnt he

               montell sadly shakes his head as empathetic as eddie

                                     montell
                         i dont want to disappoint you but 
                         the mayor and i have never spoken

               a few titters in the gallery

                                     eddie
                         i was being metaphorical detective 
                         montell

                                     montell
                         is that a fancy way of being wrong

               the halfdozen reporters can barely suppress their snickers

               int courtroom  next day

               next up is sklaroff a coiled rangy cop in his late 30s

                                     eddie

               he ducks around a skid stacked with industrial sinks runs 
               into a waisthigh conveyor belt loaded with large cartons 
               starts to back away  then sees below the conveyor belt 

               pair of boots

               the combat boots that he last saw aimed at his eye

               eddie

               freezes for a beat  then takes off down the length of the 
               conveyor belt but the belt goes on and on and so eddie 
               drops down and scuttles under it as he gets to the other 
               side and leaps up he sees 

               chuckie roeder

               who sees eddie lets out a startled cry and drops the carton 
               he was checking then spins on his heels and sprints away

               eddie

               gives chase slipping on the contents of the spilled carton 
               scores of loose spigots then he finds his footing and 
               races after roeder down another

               aisle of pipes

               this one about thirty yards long now from the other end 
               moving quite fast comes a forklift roeder dives out of its 
               way climbing up the wall of pipes

               eddie clambers after him as the forklift driver frantically 
               downshifts  and the point of a prong catches eddies 
               pantleg tearing it as 

               roeder

               scurries over the nowcollapsing wall of pipe onto a double 
               skid of horizontally stacked hot water heaters

               eddie stumbles after him both men struggling to stay 
               balanced now just as eddie is about to seize him roeder 
               reaches a steep ladder  he breathlessly climbs up to

               a catwalk

               eddie claws his way up the ladder right behind he takes 
               a flying leap at roeder grabbing hold of his belt

               but the catwalk sways sickeningly and roeder kicks free 
               nearly sending eddie over the side now roeder bolts to the 
               far end of the catwalk fairly flying down the ladder there

               meantime eddie takes a breath and drops off the catwalk 
               twenty feet down and just an arms length from roeder but 
               as he thrusts out his hand a huge man intercedes hurling 
               eddie to the concrete

               roeder

               dashes across a sea of tubs his boots cracking several

                         absolutely

               eddie presses the tip of the pointer to a thin smudge along 
               the lower edge of the right bullet

                                     eddie
                         i see a groove here i dont see a 
                         groove here

               pointing now to the lower edge of the left bullet

                                     ballistics expert
                         its not a significant difference

               eddies pointer finds another mark on the rear of the right 
               bullet or maybe its the shadow cast by the pointer

                                     eddie
                         and what about this i dont see 
                         this on the other bullet

               he points to something else on one of the enlargements  
               but so quickly were not even sure what he was pointing at

                                     eddie
                         or this  is this a significant 
                         difference

                                     ballistics expert
                         no it is not mr dowd

               as though baffled by the experts criteria eddie sets down 
               the pointer

                                     eddie
                         to the best of your recollection 
                         were you sober when you performed 
                         the tests

               her pov

               the killer hurries by onscreen for only a second  but 
               long enough for us to see he looks a lot like shu

                                     ms gordon vo
                         he was walking very fast and his 
                         hand was shoved inside his jacket i 
                         was in front of a restaurant called 
                         andy lees something told me to 
                         turn

               we watch the killers back as he races to an intersection 
               where several pedestrians wait for the walk signal we glimpse 
               his face again as he pulls a gun the young man in front 
               of him whirls theres a sharp crack and then the young man 
               is lying in the street blood welling around his head

               the killer takes off running

               back to courtroom

                                     reynard

                         have visited the murder scene and 
                         the conclusion i keep reaching is

                         you werent even close enough to see 
                         the killers gun

               their families disperse quickly silently

               here comes eddie what has seemed a merry jig in court now 
               looks like a limp

               roger behind eddie he moves to catch up but sees that eddie 
               is moving toward kitty waiting at the exit door so roger 
               hangs back

               but without even slowing down or giving a sign eddie moves 
               right past kitty and out of the building

               shocked roger goes to kitty gently touches her arm

                                     kitty

               roger nods resigned  and then someone else in the departing 
               crowd catches his eye

               a woman

               furtive and alone hurrying away

               roger

                         stoned since the trial started

               stoop head in hands presently kitty emerges and sits down 
               next to him several silent beats then eddie speaks looking 
               straight ahead not at kitty

                                     eddie

                         seemed fine until this kid came along

                         fought the good fight and but 
                         he seemed so damned disappointed in 
                         who he found and then out of

                         free an innocent man  an innocent

               through the white pages finds the page hes looking for 
               tears it out and stuffs it into his pocket

               as he races for his riviera parked in a towaway zone

               as he pulls the paddywagon into an alley marked by a sign 
               overhead the firing line the shot has the floating quality 
               and irresistible forward motion of a dream

               he doesnt move eddie grabs the excops pudgy hands

                                     eddie
                         get up godammit

               and eddie hauls badalato off the bed

               int hallway

               eddie drags badalato past connie chewing her cuticles

                                     connie

                                     connie

               int elevator

               badalato is slumped in the corner the car descends with 
               painful slowness eddie nudges badalatos shoulder

                                     eddie
                         stay awake badalato vinnie come

               badalatos response a faint snorting sound

                         out myself she had a moustache

               finally the car stops the door creakily slides open as 
               eddie pulls the hulking excop upright

                                     badalato
                         wherere we goin

                                     eddie

                         too fine badalato the bad news is 
                         youre gonna live

               in response badalato gurgles  it sounds disconcertingly 
               like a death rattle

                                     eddie
                         make ya deal you clean up i clean

                              amends
                         for the rest of the year

               he hauls badalato out of the elevator and right into  
               sklaroff and montell montell the burlier of the two flings 
               eddie against the wall with an odd brutal melancholy

                                     montell
                         whyd you have to come here you 
                         hippiedippie fuck

               meantime sklaroff helps badalato down the access stairs as 
               he murmurs soothing assurances in the excops ear

               as montell roughly patsearches eddie

                                     eddie
                         montell listen to me vinnie took

                         makes two of ya

               he knees eddie in the groin then tosses him into

               int access stairs

               eddie tumbles down the short flight then picks himself up 
               as montell hurtles after him eddie makes a break into

               int underground garage

               but esparzas waiting here he hauls off smashing eddies 
               head against the concrete wall

                                     montell
                         goddammit art get back in the car

               meantime sklaroff walks badalato past a row of dark sedans 
               huddled like hearses past a mesh gate that guards the 
               buildings ancient furnaces crackling with flame spewing 
               steam to an unmarked car parked at the far end of the 
               garage softly suppressing his unbearable tension

                                     sklaroff
                         vin whatd you tell the lawyer

               he opens the back door maneuvers badalato onto the seat

                                     badalato
                         lou

               with infinite kindness infinite patience

                                     sklaroff

                         know what you told the lawyer

               badalato nods slowly a stoned beatific smile forms

                                     badalato
                         i came clean

               pain stabs sklaroffs face he pats badalatos knee

                                     sklaroff
                         good vinnie you wait here

               as he starts back to where montell and esparza stand over 
               eddie sklaroff draws the gun from his shoulderholster

               his face in the dirty yellow flourescent light down here 
               is a taut shiny death mask quietly

                                     sklaroff
                         vinnie told im everything

               woozily as he mops the blood from his brow with a sleeve

                                     eddie

               he lunges at eddie montell pulls him back

                                     eddie
                         killing me in the middle of the trial 
                         would cause quite a stink

                          whod ywaste now art

               meantime sklaroff levels the gun at eddies face

                                     sklaroff
                         goddam you

               sklaroffs finger twitches on the trigger

                                     eddie
                         still letting your snitch run you

               sklaroffs eyes flash eddies touched a nerve

                                     montell

               sklaroffs gaze flies from esparza to eddie to montell all 
               four mens faces are slick with sweat

                                     esparza

                         freak out of his mis

               abruptly sklaroff swivels jams his gun against esparzas 
               ear and fires as esparza topples backward eyes and mouth 
               wide

                                     sklaroff

                         shoulda done that eight years ago

               waving his gun at esparzas ruined head sklaroff hoarsely 
               shouts at eddie

                                     sklaroff

               montell registers shock at his partners offer

                         you gonna keep quiet  

               eddie considers for a moment that feels like forever then

                                     eddie
                         i cant do that keep quiet you

                         you sorry bastard

               eyes fixed on the gun eddie takes a step back

                                     eddie
                         my guys gotta walk you hear me

               montell swallows hard then raises the gun

               eddie turns

               montells gun

               pointed at eddies back his finger tightens on the trigger

               eddie

               crosses the oilstained concrete past the row of black 
               sedans the clanking furnaces barely able to breathe 
               waiting for the bullet

               montells arm

               starts to shake just slightly he brings up his other arm 
               to steady the gun

               eddie

               has traversed this humid halfacre of hell he reaches the 
               unmarked car a bleary badalato looks up at him eddie holds 
               out a hand his voice catching

               badalato reaches up and takes eddies hand

               sklaroff places his hand on montells wrist he helps his 
               partner slowly lower the gun partys over

               eddie and badalato

               awkwardly walk up the ramp the sun is just rising over new 
               york city the two men squint as they come into the light

                         joint  though he didnt really do 
                         it

               at the defense table

               shu looks up interested again in the proceedings

               scene

                                     eddie
                         i guess i could find witnesses to 
                         dispute every point made by the da 
                         but in the end would we be any closer 
                         to understanding what really happened 
                         eight years ago as mr reynard has 
                         said these matters are cloaked in 
                         secrecy how can we here in the 
                         safety and sanctity of this court 
                         presume to pass judgment on shu kai 
                         kim a refugee

               at the defense table

               reynard trades smug looks with rabin and starts packing his 
               briefcase

                                     eddies voice
                         who has spent his young adulthood 
                         like a caged animal in a prison where 
                         kill or be killed was the code

               scene

               his impatience tinged with pity

                                     judge
                          then you dont wish to call any 
                         witnesses mr dowd

                                     eddie
                         i would like to put shus alleged 
                         crime in a context your honor and 
                         we do have the foremost expert on 
                         prison and street gangs right here 
                         in this room if it please the 
                         court id like to call mr reynard

               at the defense table

               dean rabin looks outraged reynard is merely annoyed

                                     reynard
                         i would ask opposing counsel to make 
                         an offer of proof that this is 
                         anything more than a desperate tactic

                                     judge
                         will you both approach the bench

               reynard strides up as eddie joins him

                                     reynard
                          cant mr dowd find his own expert 
                         witness your honor

                                     eddie
                         id need a continuance three weeks 
                         at least

               judge quealy sighs he doesnt have three weeks to waste

                                     judge
                         your questions would of course be 
                         restricted to mr reynards area of 
                         expertise

                                     reynard
                         its a lastditch ploy your honor 
                         the defense clearly hopes that my 
                         presence on the stand will create 
                         the opportunity to call for a 
                         mistrial

               he flashes eddie a grim smile

                                     reynard
                         but the defense is mistaken

               reynard proceeds to the witness box though its clearly a 
               formality the da must be sworn in

                                     clerk
                         do you swear to tell the truth the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth 
                         so help you god

                                     reynard
                         i do

               eddie ambles over to the witness box

                                     eddie
                         lets start by establishing your 
                         credentials as an expert witness 
                         mr reynard in the late 70s you 
                         led an investigation into a colombian 
                         crime syndicate called the ochoa

               as though indulging a child

                                     reynard
                         yes mr dowd

                                     eddie
                         didnt this investigation with its 
                         attendant publicity catapult you 
                         into the office you now hold

                                     reynard
                         if i were sitting where i normally 
                         sit i would say calls for 
                         speculation

               the jurors are charmed by reynards ironic bonhomie

                                     eddie
                         did you do any handson work or did 
                         you just supervise from on high

                                     reynard
                         mr dowd i was personally involved 
                         with all phases  and principals  
                         of the investigation

                                     eddie
                         and who were the detectives who 
                         assisted you mr reynard

               reynard

               glances into eddies eyes to read whats behind them

               eddie

               his expression gives away nothing

               scene

               reynard as he answers manages to sound perfectly casual

                                     reynard
                         lou sklaroff vin badalato dave 
                         montell

                                     eddie
                         the same three detectives on the 
                         jimmy chin case

               judge quealy perks up considerably

                                     reynard
                         in those days they often worked as 
                         a team

                                     eddie
                         and who was arturo esparza

               reynard hesitates then

                                     reynard
                         i dont think i know that name

                                     eddie
                          but you just said you were 
                         personally involved with all the 
                         principals of the investigation

                                     reynard
                         i cant be expected to remember the 
                         name of every informant eight years 
                         after the fact

                                     eddie
                         i didnt say he was an informant 
                         but since you mentioned it wasnt 
                         esparza your primary informant

                                     reynard
                              bristles
                         youre trespassing into the area of 
                         witness protection mr dowd such 
                         showboating puts lives at risk

               heedless eddie hammers at him

                                     eddie
                         isnt it true that without esparza 
                         you had no investigation

                                     reynard
                              scalding contempt
                         i think youre a dangerous man mr 
                         dowd

                                     eddie
                         i hope so mr reynard

               eddie moves in closer

                                     eddie
                         on the night of november 2 1980 
                         did art esparza phone you at home to 
                         say i just killed a man in chinatown  
                         people saw me do it

               the reporters trade looks then start to madly scribble

                                     reynard
                              ice
                         no

                                     eddie
                         no then what did he say

               dean rabin

               has no idea whats going on all he knows is that he must do 
               something he stands

                                     rabin
                         objection badgering the witness

               judge quealys withering glance causes the deputy da to 
               sink back down and stay down

                                     eddie
                         youd worked too hard to let esparzas 
                         crime of passion spoil everything 
                         you ordered your team to comb through 
                         the mugbooks find a patsy frame

                         protect your career isnt that so

               the courtroom sucks in a collective breath

                                     reynard
                         thats an outrageous accus

               reynard trails off as in the back of the courtroom

               vin badalato

               is helped into the courtroom by connie who pointedly sits 
               her brother behind the defense with kitty and mrs kim

               reynard

               a cornered animal his gaze flicks from badalato to eddie

               scene

               this time eddie returns reynards gaze

                                     eddie
                         putting away one punk enabled you to 
                         keep your informant out of prison 
                         and in place

               shu has gone pale tears stream down mrs kims face kitty 
               reaches an arm around her shoulders to comfort her

                                     eddie
                         by keeping your informant out of 
                         prison and in place you were able 
                         to complete your work ultimately 
                         you saved scores of lives didnt 
                         you

               no answer now eddie invokes the das pet principle

                                     eddie
                         it was a tradeoff wasnt it

               quietly with a kind of tragic dignity

                                     reynard
                         a tradeoff yes
                              then
                         id do it again

               eddie nods then returns to the defense table and sits 
               between roger and shu eddie looks drained but exalted he 
               can sleep now

                                     eddie
                         the defense rests

                                                                    cut to

               shu kai kim sits on the edge of his cot listens to the echo 
               of footsteps that grow louder in eight years of waiting a 
               man learns patience

               the footsteps stop tumblers turn still shu doesnt move 
               moving might break the spell the cell door slides open

               shu emerges from the main gate toting a sad little vinyl 
               valise blinking as though he hasnt seen daylight in years 
               he heads toward the concrete depot where a bus will take him 
               south to new york city how strange to walk without shackles 
               handcuffs armed guards os he hears

                                     mans voice

               edward c dowd lounges against his riviera

               shu cocks his head stares at the lawyer

               eddie shrugs stares down three beats when he looks up 

               shu is standing before him searching for words failing to 
               find them at last

                                     eddie
                         shit man  lets get out of here

               now roger steps out of the car holds open the door for shu

               the riviera

               spewing clouds of pollution eddies car pulls away

               rise over the turrets and towers and electrified fences as 
               eddie roger and shu drive away from the prison to freedom

                                                                  fade out
