	1   ext mountains near geneva switzerland  night

		the snow covered alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
		moon  a fortresslike chateau is situated in a flat saddle of
		forest partway up the mountain next to a frozen lake  the
		property is surrounded by high stone walls and the stately
		grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
		with dogs


	2   ext chateau  night

		the driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars  a formal
		dress party is in progress a private reception for a middle
		eastern dignitary  tuxedoes men escort their diamondencrusted
		ladies through the huge front doors where they doff their
		overcoats and are politely scanned with handheld metal
		detectors by white gloved security staffers

		the walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake forming
		a kind of rampart  there is an opening to a kind of waterway
		or canal which connects to the private docks inside the
		grounds  there is a steel grating across the opening  the
		bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter

		with the house visible bg we crane down below the parapet wall
		along which a guard is a white exposuresuit is walking down
		along the dark wall to the grating tilting down to see a
		glow pulsing under the ice

	
	3   ext beneath the ice underwater  night	
	
		camera moving toward  a figure in diving gear working at the
		metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch  one bar has
		already been cut out  two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
		the muddy bottom  lit now only from the floodlights filtering
		down through the ice the figure slips through the bars and
		swims powerfully along the stone canal wall

		seem from below the figure is a black shadow moving against
		the rippledglass of the ice above


	4   ext canal and boathouse  night

		a dock extends into the frozen canal just behind a large
		boathouse  there is a faint chipping sound  the ice breaks
		quietly and the pieces are slid back  a head appears in a
		rubber drysuit hood  the diver slips the regulator out of his
		mouth and turns slowly scanning  revealing

		harry tasker  our hero  harry floats with just his eyes above
		the surface silent as a water snake as a guard passes on a
		footpath nearby

		after a few beats harry slips out of his tanks and fins
		letting them sink and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock
		he moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse
		opening a waterproof bag he pulls out a walky talky

						harry

		winding mountain road a halfmile from the chateau whose
		lights are visible through the trees

		faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
		nightvision scope  the eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
		the grounds locating the boathouse

		harry slips into his shoulder harness holster on one side
		containing his 45 auto glock22 and the transmitter pack for
		the earpiece slung on the other  he slips on a formal jacket
		concealing the rig  then a final touch  a little aftershave
		from a tiny plastic vial

		harry adjusts his bowtie and strides confidently out of the
		shadows crossing quickly to the main house  he looks
		ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
		his hair slicked back  he enters the main house through a back
		service entrance

	22   int main hall  night

		harry whirls juno aggressively across the dancefloor  she

		juno is hot  he bends her back at the waist then snaps her
		up  she twirls into the crook of his arm  their faces are
		inches apart  wow  the music ends and she gives him a wry

		gets suckered in  trying to hit him getting right down
		behind him and suddenly harry slides to a stop in an

		swerves and suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
		of him

		kwhack  the mainrotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper

		his heavy boots  he has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow

		harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
		chopper which still has its engine running  the ski patrol

		blammo  it drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
		skidding van  then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
		rocky canyon where is blows up  the fireball lights up the

		rushing to get ready herself  we get our first good look at
		helen  she is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an

		have been together a long time do

						juno
				harry  i thought i might see you
				again  i just didnt  except you
				to call so soon

		juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake

						harry
				well whats the point of
				waiting

						juno
				i agree

		there is definitely unholy magnetism here  she indicates for
		harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of
		offices  there are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in
		niches on either side and beautifully restored mosaics and
		tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls

						juno
				so your clients want something

				thats right  they want
				something  dramatic  i spoke
				to a number of people who said
				youre the one to see

		there is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates  an
		overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces  there are
		massive columns and statues two stories high  even the entire
		facade of a tomb

						juno
				so what did these people
				say about me exactly

		they stroll amongst the statues as coveralled workmen move
		around them with tools scaffolding pneumatic equipment  most
		of the workers are middleeastern

						harry
				lets see that you can read
				ancient sanskrit without having
				to sound out the words  and that
				other dealers and archeologists
				dont like you much

						juno
				those wimps  its because i use				
				my diplomatic contacts to export
				cultural treasures from countries
				which tell them to take a hike
					yelling in arabic to
					two workmen
				i told you to move those crates
				an hour ago  come on guys lets
				get going

		we realize that a workman is watching them intently from
		nearby  he is an intense looking middleeastern man in his mid
		thirties

						juno
				you see a lot of these pieces
				are from ancient persia
				unfortunately ancient persia is
				twenty feet under the sand of					
				iran iraq and syria  not the
				most popular places lately  so
				ive had to become an expert in
				international diplomacy

		juno stops and looks at harry  her smile indicates the
		possibility of more than just business

						juno
				well do you see anything you
				like mr renquist

		face

						malik
				you stupid undisciplined bitch

		her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive

						juno
				its a good thing you pay me
				well

						malik
				do you realize that there are
				surveillance teams watching this
				place right now  your phones are
				almost certainly tapped  and you
				are busy laughing and flirting

		yusifs arm in an armlock  the shot goes wide shattering a
		urinal

		harry slams his palm into yusifs face like a piledriver and

		it shows more shoulder then hitches up the hem  ditches the
		pearls  puts on some red lipstick

		now she doesnt look hot and elegant just hot  she
		practices a slinky walk getting into the role

		suddenly she remembers her wedding ring  she pulls on it  it
		probably hasnt been off in years  she licks her finger and

				now turn cheri in the
				moonlight  let your body flow
				like water

		she turns  her skin is beautiful in the silvery light

						harry tape
				now dance for me  go on

		helen has no idea what to do but she improvises quite well
		the scrutiny of the shadowed man who is fully clothed and her
		raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic
		combination

						harry tape
				let your hands be a lovers hands
				on your own skin as you move
				yes thats it

		tight on harrys eyes as he studies her  his game meant to
		give her a dangerous fantasy is actually turning him on
		mightily  he is amazed to see her playing the role getting
		into it  this is not the helen is thought he knew for sixteen
		years

						harry tape
				now lie on the bed and close
				your eyes

		she does  harry rises and goes to her bringing the tape deck

						harry tape
				keep them closed  do not open
				them

		he sits on the bed next to her but without touching her  he
		strokes her hair lovingly  then runs his fingertips over her
		eyes down her cheeks  to her it feels delicate and delicious
		part of her is enjoying this a lot  but helen is torn between
		wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so
		far is enough to cause her to abort her mission

						helen
				i thought you only liked to
				watch

		harry goes ssshhh  its all he can do  he bends over her and
		brings his lips slowly down to her  he touches them to hers so
		slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her  then he takes
		her in a passionate kiss

		and she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and smashes it over
		his head  harry flies off onto the floor groaning and
		semiconscious

		the tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded
		revealing a fourth statue  the figures are cracked and
		obscured by centuries but they are unmistakably warriors
		mounted on horseback  the legs and arms are missing on some
		but the massive heads and necks remain

		malik grabs helen jerking her roughly forward  he whips out
		a knife and inserts the point under helens jaw forcing her

						malik
				do you know why you have been
				brought here

						helen
				nno

						malik
				so that this man can verify to

		malik lowers the knife from her jaw  he turns away from her
		like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to
		remove the other weapons  jackhammers tear into the stone
		figures

		helen is just staring at harry her mouth open  he turns to
		her not knowing what to say  he shrugs sheepishly

						harry
				what can i say  im a spy

		she just looks at him for a long time  she moves closer
		staring and staring letting it sink in  then she hauls off
		and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him
		down
