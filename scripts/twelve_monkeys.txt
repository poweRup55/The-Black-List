     fade in

     int  concourseairport terminal  bay

     close on a face  a nine year old boy young cole his eyes wide
     with wonder watching something intently  we hear the sounds of
     the pa system droning flight information mingled with the
     sounds of urgent shouts running feet exclamations

     young coles pov  twenty yards away a blonde man is sprawled on
     the floor blood oozing from his gaudy hawaiian shirt

     a brunette in a tight dress her face obscured from young coles
     view rushes to the injured man kneels beside him ministering
     to his wound

     angle on young cole flanked by his parents their faces out of
     view as they steer him away

                               fathers voice os
                come on son this is no place for us

     young cole resists momentarily mesmerized by the drama

     young coles pov  intermittently visible through a confusion of
     figures rushing through the foreground the blonde man reaching
     up and touching the cheek of the kneeling brunette in a gesture
     of enormous tenderness a gesture of farewell while the pa
     system continues its monotonous monotone

                               pa system
                flight 784 for san francisco is now

                number 5429 garcia  number 87645 cole

     cole late thirties dark hair comes awake in a bunk cage one
     of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
     corridor  he blinks in the near dark shaken disoriented

     then as he recovers from his very vivid dream we get our
     first look at his environmenta windowless underground world of
     eternal night sometime in the futurean almost colorless
     reality of blurred edges and echoey sounds much more
     dreamlike than his dream

     flashlights glare in the halflight cole sees spooky figures
     guards moving among the locked bunkcages

     cole turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage jose

                               cole
                ssssst  jose whats going on

     joses face is almost lost in shadow  what there is of it is
     youthful  hes just a scared puerto rican kid

                               jose
                volunteers again

     jose immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as scarface a
     menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek looms
     close to coles cage and unlocks it

                               scarface
                volunteer duty

    the prisoners in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes

                               cole
                i didnt volunteer

                               scarface
                you causing trouble again

                               cole
                     controls his temper
                no trouble

     int  equipment room  eternal night

     coles alone struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
     in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes

                    titles begin supered over the scene

     cole has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it

                               offscreen voice os
                all openings must be closed

     cole looks for the source of the voice a tiny grate in the wall

                               offscreen voice os
                if the integrity of the suit is compromised
                in any way if the fabric is torn or a zipper
                not closed readmittance will be denied

     int  sealed chamber  minutes later eternal night

     cole wearing the space suit and a helmet with a plastic visor
     steps into a tiny chamber a kind of air lock  the heavy door
     clangs shut behind him  hes alone  coles breath comes quicker
     now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back

     on the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock
     cole turns the heavy wheel opens the door steps through it

     int  elevator  seconds later eternal night

     coles in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks  he looks
     down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand

     the map shows a series of tunnels and ladders

     int  sewer pipe  minutes later night

     cole pans a flashlight probing the filthy sewer hes wading through

     rats flee the blade of light scurry across islands of rusting junk

     the flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall

     reaching the rusted ladder cole starts to climb awkwardly

     ext  city streetfuture  moments later night

     a scraping noise as a heavy manhole cover is pushed up and moved
     aside  coles helmeted head emerges from below

     coles pov through his plasticvisored helmet  a city in
     moonlight  a surreal image of abandoned buildings  no people
     anywhere  the only sounds are the wind and coles breathing

     ext  another city street  minutes later night

     coles light reveals abandoned vinecovered automobiles
         
     moving to the nearest car cole searches in the vines for
     something  finds it  an insect

     cole takes the bug in his gloved hand  as he clumsily inserts it
     into a collection tube something makes him turn

     theres something across the street in the dark  something alive

     cole points his flashlight and revealsa bear  startled by the
     light the animal blinks then stands on its rear legs and roars

     angle on cole staring wideeyed
         
     then the bear sinks down onto all fours and trying to avoid the
     flashlight it pads quickly down the street

     int  subterranean parking garage  night

     using the flashlight to see cole reaches down to the cracked
     floor and gets another specimen  dogshit

     the only sound is coles labored breathing

     then a different sound  grrrr  a dog  more grrrrs  more
     dogs  then a yip  then vicious growls  its a dogfight

     ext  street  night first light

     a giant owl perched on an overhead traffic light raises its wings
     and lifts offrising higher and higher into the brightening sky

     below on the street cole trudges along passing deserted
     buildings windows broken rusted signs dangling

     int  department store  night first light

     coles light reveals a spider web just inside the store  a large
     spider tries to hide from the light

     cole reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
     puts it into one of his specimen tubes

     then he shines his light all around the once elegant store  theres
     nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods

     ext  department store  dawn

     as cole comes out of the store the first rays of the sun hit the
     building  cole stops squints into the light through his visor

     coles pov  spraypainted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
     logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle  over it is
     written we did it

     cole looks up

     coles pov  high up on a building across the street a lion
     patrols a ledge pauses looks out majestically over his world

                     tttles end

     int  first underground decontamination chamber  eternal night

     roaring water powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
     wall pummel the stillsuited cole

     int  second underground decontamination chamber  eternal night

     stark naked and shivering cole is being scrubbed with brushes on
     long poles like the ones used to wash cars wielded by two hulking
     figures in bulky decontamination suits their personas lost in their
     windowed masks  its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp
     dripping walls  from an unseen source comes an amplified voice

                               amplified voice os
                raise your arms above your head

     cole lifts his arms and the figures start scrubbing his armpits

     int  tiny chamber  shortly eternal night

     still naked cole is seated on a stool while a masked technician
     in a less elaborate less bulky decontamination outfit draws
     blood from coles arm with an oldfashioned hypodermic needle

     cole glances toward a single nearly opaque window of thick
     plastic in the rusty iron wall  vague figures seem to lurk
     behind the translucent aperture studying him

     the technician slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall

     int  engineering officefuture world  eternal night

     ushered in by two guards tiny and scarface cole looks around

     coles pov  wails hidden by old headlines articles maps charts
     a blackboard covered with elaborate sophisticated formulaesurfaces
     heaped with cracked monitors gerryrigged computers held together with
     string lasers lost in tangles of cable ancient tube amplifiers a
     dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city stacks of moldering
     books and tattered computer printoutsand seated at a long conference
     table staring at cole six scientists  an astrophysicist engineer
     botanist microbiologist zoologist and a geologist  they represent
     a modern science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude
     outdated patchedtogether technologies

                               tiny
                james cole  cleared from quarantine

                               microbiologist
                thank you  you two wait outside

                               scarface

     coles eyes return to the walls

     headlines  clock ticking  no cure yet

                               scarface
                antisocial six  doing 25 to life

                i dont think hes going to hurt us  youre
                not going to hurt us are you mr cole

     coles head turns quickly to the engineer

                               cole
                no sir

     the guards exchange a look shrug exit closing the door

                               microbiologist
                why dont you sit down mr cole

     cole goes to the empty chair at the conference table sits down

                               astrophysicist
                we want you to tell us about last
                night

                               cole
                i went to the surface and i collected
                specimens like i was told

     the scientists dont say anything  they just study him carefully

                               cole
                     worried
                i mashed the spider didnt i

                               microbiologist
                well get to the spider later mr
                cole  right now we want to know
                everything that you saw

     int  engineering office  an hour later eternal night

     cole starting to look very tired now stands at the blackboard
     sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night

                               astpophysicist
                where you collected sample 4 what
                street was that

                               cole
                uh

                               botanist
                its important to observe everything

                               cole
                i think it wasim sure it was 2nd street

     as the scientists start to whisper animatedly among themselves
     coles eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
     wall  one headline screams virus mutating  another features
     a photo of an old man dr mason who well see again later on
     and the words scientist says its too late for cure

                               astrophysicists voice os
                close your eyes cole

     startled cole closes his eyes obediently

     blackness  like cole we see nothing  but we hear their voices

                               engineers voice os
                tell us in detail what youve seen in
                this room

                uh in this room  uh

                               coles voice os
                sixseven if you count me

                               astrophysicists voice os
                tell us about the pictures on the wall

                               coles voice os
                uh you mean the newspapers

                               a montage of overlapping voices os
                tell us about the newspapers  can you
                hear my voice  what do i look like
                what does he look like the man who
                just spoke  how old were you when you
                left the surface

     the voices blur into a cacophony and fade into the droning pa
     system at the airport

     int  concourseairport  day

     the dream again  but at an earlier moment  young cole flanked
     by his parents whose faces are out of view is watching a plane
     land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
     leading to the departure gates

                               pa system os
                flight 784 now boarding at gate

     suddenly a shout followed by raised voices interrupts the
     monotonous airport routine  as young cole and his parents turn
     to see whats going on a man well call mr ponytail his face
     averted hurries past them bumping young cole with a chicago
     hulls sports duffle bag

                               mr ponytail
                watch it

     young cole sees little more than the gaudy pants the duffle and
     the mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates

     just then a womans voice cries out nooooooooo

     young cole turns back toward the security check point just as
     travelers scatter madly some diving to the floor others
     running  a terrified traveler hitting the floor close by looks
     up at young cole with panicky eyes and asks
         
                               terrified traveler
                just exactly why did you volunteer

     int  engineering officefuture world  eternal night

     cole comes abruptly awake  seated now hes facing the scientists

                               astrophysicist
                wake up cole

                               cole
                uh i didnt hear the

                               microbiologist
                     tapping a pencil on the table
                i asked you why did you volunteer

                               cole
                well the guard woke me up  he told me
                i volunteered

     the scientists react whispering urgently among themselves

     cole starts to nod off again then comes awake with a start as
     the engineer speaks to him

                               engineer
                we appreciate you volunteering  youre
                a very good observer cole

                               cole
                uh thank you

                               engineer
                youll get a reduction in sentence

     cole keeps his face impassive

                               astrophysicist
                to be determined by the proper authorities

                               engineer
                you dont want to jeopardize that reduction
                do you cole  have it taken away

                               cole
                no sir

                               astrophysicist
                we have a very advanced program something
                very different requires very skilled people

                               microbiologist
                an opportunity to reduce your sentence
                considerably

                               zoologist
                and possibly play an important role in
                returning the human race to the surface
                of the earth

                               engineer
                we want tough minded people  strong
                mentally  weve had somemisfortunes
                with unstable types

                               astrophysicist
                for a man in your positionan opportunity

                               botanist
                not to volunteer could be a real mistake

                               microbiologist
                     tapping his pencil again
                definitely a mistake

     cole gives away nothing  hes in a box here  he has no choices
     he stares at the tapping pencil

     int  art gallery  night

     a strikingly real world of bright colors  extravagant paintings
     adorn the walls  a poet tiny and ruddy faced squints over his
     glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an audience of thirty
     seated on folding chairs

                               poet
                still among the myriad microwaves the
                infrared messages the gigabytes of ones
                and zeroes we find words infinitesimally
                small bytesized now tinier even than
                science lurking in some vague electricity
                where if we listen we can hear the solitary
                voice of that poet telling us
                we are no other than a moving row
                of magic shadowshapes that come and go
                round with the sunillumined lantern hold
                in midnight by the master of the show

     as the poet reads we study the audience mostly yuppie culture
     junkies or bohemians  among them a lighthaired woman of twenty
     eight soberly dressed wearing glasses  shes kathryn railly  and
     its her beeper that suddenly beeps  beep  beep

                               poets voice os
                the moving finger writes and having writ
                moves on  nor all your piety nor wit
                shall lure it back to cancel half a line
                nor all your tears wash out a word of it

     beep  beep  scowling at the outrageous interruption the poet
     looks up from the text just as railly tumbling shuts off the
     beeper and rises embarrassed  as she makes her way to an exit
     the glaring poet continues

                               poet
                yesterday this days madness did prepare
                tomorrows silence triumph or despair
                drink  for you know not whence you came nor why
                drink  for you know not why you go nor where

     int  corridorpolice station  night

     detective franki leads railly past crowded holding cells

                               franki
                 so they get there and they ask the guy
                real nice for some kind of id and he gets

     glass in an otherwise solid door and railly looks through it

     raillys pov through the window  a man his back to her in
     straitjacket and prison denims examining the wall of the padded
     cell with the distorted intensity of a mental case

     palmer and billings supervise

     as palmer shuts off the water billings hands cole a towel and
     starts inspecting his scalp

     lice inspection only his eyes revealing his frustration

     int  hospitaldayroom  half an hour later day

     cole stands in the doorway stunned by his first sight of the
     large room  his eyes go to the heavilygrilled windows where
     light pours in from outside  then to the tv where a cartoon
     commercial makes raucous noises

     patients in kmart street clothes or ratty robes stare gloomily
     at the tv or play cards pace or just stare blankly

     billings is at coles side beckoning to a patient jeffrey mason
     a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt

                               billings

                kid around kid around  it makes them feel
                good were all pals  were prisoners theyre
                the guards but its all in good fun you see

     cole nods and jeffrey indicates card tables where patients are
     playing cards checkers chess or working on jig saw puzzles

                               jeffrey
                heres the games  games vegitize you

     the peaceable kingdom depicting a serene world of animals in harmony

                               jeffrey
                whatd they give you  thorazine  how
                much  learn your drugs  know your doses

                               cole

                               jeffrey

                with the outside world  doctors
                discretion  hey if alla these nuts
                could just make phone calls it could
                spread  insanity oozing through telephone
                cables oozing into the ears of all those
                poor sane people infecting them  whackos
                everywhere  a plague of madness
                     suddenly sly and confidential
                in fact very few of us here are actually
                mentally ill  im not saying youre
                not mentally ill for all i know youre
                crazy as a loon  but thats not why
                youre here  why youre here is because
                of the system because of the economy
                     indicating the tv
                theres the tv  its all right there
                commercials  we are not productive
                anymore they dont need us to make
                things anymore its all automated  what
                are we for then  were consumers  okay
                buy a lot of stuff youre a good citizen
                but if you dont buy a lot of stuff you
                know what  youre mentally ill thats
                a fact  if you dont buy thingstoilet
                paper new cars computerized blenders
                electrically operated sexual devices
                     getting hysterical
                screwdrivers with miniature builtin
                radar devices stereo systems with
                brain implanted headphones voice
                activated computers and

     a woman orderly terry turns from the feeble patient shes helping

                               terry
                take it easy jeffrey  be calm

     abruptly jeffrey stifles his hysteria takes a deep breath and
     continues completely calm now  but cole isnt listening  hes
     mesmerized by the tv

                               jeffrey
                so if you want to watch a particular
                program say all my children or
                something you go to the charge nurse
                and tell her what day and time the show
                you want to see is on  but you have to
                tell her before the show is scheduled
                to be on  there was this one guy who
                was always requesting shows that had already
                played  he couldnt quite grasp the
                idea that the charge nurse couldnt
                just make it be yesterday for him turn
                back time ha ha  what a fruitcake

     this last thought actually penetrates coles focus on the tv and
     he turns to jeffrey whos picking up speed again

                               jeffrey
                seriously more and more people are
                being defined now as mentally ill  why
                because theyre not consuming on their
                own  but as patients they becone
                consumers of mental health care  and
                this gives the socalled sane people work
                     hysteria again
                whooo  shock therapy  group therapy
                hallucinations  therapeutic drugs
                iggidy diggidy dig  perfect  the
                system in harmony like a big machine

                               terry
                okay thats it jeffrey youre gonna
                get a shot  i warned you

                               jeffrey

                to subjugate barbarian hordes on pluto

                reality in every wayi can feel breathe

                construct of my psyche  i am mentally
                divergent in that i am escaping certain
                unnamed realities that plague my life

     int  psych ward conference room  minutes later day

     cole is agitated speaking forcefully

                this is a place for crazy people  im
                not crazy

     railly four other psychiatric residents including raillys best
     friend marilou martin and their chief dr owen fletcher sit
     around a beatup conference table watching cole who sits facing
     the doctors with billings looming behind him  some of the doctors
     bear a strong resemblance to the scientists of the future

                               resident 1
                we dont use that termcrazy mr cole

                               cole
                well youve got some real nuts in here
                listen to me all of you  i have to
                tell you something thats going to be
                difficult for you to understand but

                               dr railly
                jamesplease  these are all doctors
                here and we want to help you

                               dr fletcher
                mr cole  last night you told dr
                railly you thought it was
                     checking a file
                1995  how about right now  do you
                know what year it is right now

                               cole
                1989  look im not confused  theres been
                a mistake ive been sent to the wrong place

     suddenly cole reaches out and billings lunges forward but cole
     is just grabbing a pad and pencil

                               cole
                hey im not going to hurt anybody

     fletcher restrains billings with a hand signal

                               cole
                     drawing
                do any of you know anything about the
                army of the twelve monkeys  they paint
                this stencil it on buildings all
                over the place

     cole waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier

                               dr casey
                mr cole

                               cole
                right  i guess you wouldnt this is
                1989 theyre probably not active yet
                that makes sense  okay  listen to me
                three billion people died in 1995
                three billion got that  almost
                the whole population  of the world
                only about one percent survived

     doctors exchange knowing looks  this is an old story apparently

                               resident 2
                are you going to save us mr cole

                               cole

                already happened  i cant save you  im
                simply trying to get some information for
                people in the present so that someday
                     sees their eyes
                you dont believe me  you think im
                crazy  but im not crazy  im a convict
                sure i have a quick temper but im as
                sane as anyone in this room  i

     cole stops sees dr fletcher tapping his pencil  coles seen
     that tapping before  in the future  it disorients him

                               dr railly
                can you tell us the name of the prison
                youve come from

     cole doesnt answer  hes staring at the tapping pencil

                               dr fletcher
                does this bother you mr cole

                               cole

                need to do is make a telephone call to
                straighten everything out

                who would you call mr cole who would
                straighten everything out

                to them  theyll want to know they

                               dr fletcher
                so you could talk to these scientists
                and they do what  send you to the future

                               cole
                no no  i cant talk to them  its called

                               cole
                no 1995 is the past too  look

                               dr fletcher
                these scientists mr cole  are they
                doctors like ourselves

     two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks

                               cole
                no  i mean yes but look ive been given
                a lot of drugs but im still perfectly lucid
                you have to let me use the phone  one call

     cole looks desperately toward railly pleading eyes meeting hers

     int  low rent apartment  day

     four little kids scream and squabble while the phone chirps
     insistently in the tiny cluttered apartment and a harried mother
     lunges for the phone answers sharply

                               mother
                yes
                     listens frowns then
                whaaaaat  voice mail  i dont know

                a joke  i dont know any scientists
                james who  never heard of you

     the mother slams down the phone

     int  raillys officecounty hospital  day

     a dismayed cole still has the receiver in his hand  sympathetically
     railly takes it from him

                               railly
                it wasnt who you expected

     cole is clearly agitated starts to pace upset  nuts

                               cole
                it was some lady  she didnt know anything

                               railly
                perhaps it was a wrong number

                               cole
                no  thats the reason they chose me 
                i remember things

     railly frowns studying the distracted man with intense interest
     its clear cole is becoming a special patient and raillys cool
     detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly

                               railly
                james where did you grow up  was it
                around here  around baltimore

                               cole
                     lost in thought
                what

                               railly
                i have thestrangest feeling ive met
                you beforea long time ago perhaps
                were you ever

                               cole
                wait  this is only 1989  im supposed
                to be leaving messages in 1995  its
                not the right number yet  thats the
                problem  damn  how can i contact them

     railly recovers her distance her poise as she takes a bottle
     pours out some tablets and holds them out to cole

                               railly
                james take these
                     watching him step back
                please  i helped you like i said i
                would  now i want you to trust me

     int  airport concourse  day the dream

     mr ponytail races past the startled young cole

                               mr ponytail
                watch it

     was it jeffrey wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail  it was
     definitely jeffreys voice

     travelers dive for cover as a womans voice cries out

                               womans voice
                noooooooooo

     the terrified traveler looks up at young cole makes eye contact but
     doesnt speak  the terrified traveler looks a lot like dr fletcher

     just then young cole is distracted by a running figure  its
     the blonde man in the hawaiian shirt but hes not injured  hes
     sprinting toward the gates glancing back over his shoulder his
     moustache slightly askew

     a sharp crack of a gunshot rings out  then dazzling light
     everything goes white

     int  dormitory psych wardcounty hospital  night

     coles eyes blink awake blinded by a flashlight

     hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward  disoriented
     which world is this  the room is full of breathing snoring
     occasional moans  he can barely discern the shadowy figures of
     an orderly and a nurse making their rounds checking each bed

     his eyes adjusting to the darkness cole watches them exit

     he turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window

     with a quick glance at the sleeping patients he slips out of
     bed makes his way stealthily to the window peers out

     coles pov  the moon glowing in the sky illuminating a single
     tree  under the tree in silhouette a couple embraces kisses

     angle on cole looking out the window absorbed

                               voice os
                it wont work you cant open it

     alarmed cole turns sees jeffrey in the next bed

                               jeffrey
                you think you can remove the grill but
                you cant  its welded

     cole checks the grill anyway

                               jeffrey
                see  i toldja  and all the doors are
                locked too  theyre protecting the
                people on the outside from us  but the
                people outside are as crazy as us

     cole has become preoccupied with a small spider creeping along
     the window sill  hes staring at it when hes distracted by a
     sudden sound  grabbing the spider cole scrambles back into bed
     just as the door opens and an orderly probes the dark room with
     the blade of his flashlight

     angle on cole in bed feigning sleep

     the flashlight clicks off and cole hears the door close

     for a long moment the ward is silent except for breathing
     snores occasional moans  then cole hears jeffreys hoarse
     whisper picking up right where he left off

                               jeffrey
                you know what crazy is  crazy is
                majority rules  take germs for example

     although cole is preoccupied with the spider struggling to get
     out of his fist he cant help reacting to the word germs

                               cole
                germs

                               jeffrey
                in the 18th century there was no such
                thing  nobodyd ever imagined such a
                thing  no sane person anyway  along
                comes this doctorsemmelweiss i
                think  he tries to convince people
                other doctors mostlythat there are
                these teeny tiny invisible bad things
                called germs that get into your body and
                make yousick  hes trying to get
                doctors to wash their hands  what is
                this guycrazy  teeny tiny invisible
                whaddayou call emgerms

     as jeffrey warms to his subject getting excited cole tries to
     figure out where to put the spider

                               jeffrey cont
                so cut to the 20th century  last week

                into this hellhole  i order a burger
                in this fast food joint  the waiter

                wipes it off hands it to melike it
                was all okay

     no alternative  cole pops the spider in his mouth and swallows
     it as jeffrey prattles on

                               jeffrey

                for the nut case lunatic maniac devils

     patients are waking up as the nurse and two orderlies burst into the
     dorm and head straight for jeffrey whos struggling to calm himself

                               jeffrey
                sorry  really sorry  got a little
                agitated  the thought of escaping

                them and leaping leaping

                spider  but i didnt have anyplace to
                put it so i ate it  it was the wrong
                year anyway so i guess it doesnt matter

     the scientists stare incredulously then turn exchange knowing
     looks huddle start whispering to one another

     struggling to stay awake cole sees blurrily the microbiologist
     staring at cole intently  for one moment the face belongs to
     dr fletcher

     cole blinks hardand the microbiologist has his own face again

     coles head slumps forward nowand everything goes dark

     cole comes awake with a start  the room is dark now except

     a slide is being projected on a torn screen  its a picture of a
     stenciled graffitithe logo of the army of the 12 monkeys

                               engineer
                what about it cole

     another slide clicks into place  youthful protesters their
     placards featuring slogans and images of animal atrocities
     confront police in riot gear

                what about these people  did you see
                any of these people

     zooming in panning the scientists emphasize the faces of the
     protesters  the faces are unfamiliar to cole though we will
     recognize some of them later on

                uh no sir iwait

     the image pans back to a much enlarged blurry face among the
     protesters  in spite of the poor image the expression of rage
     is clear and it seems to resemble a somewhat older jeffrey mason

                               astrophysicist

     stretchered past them in the narrow trench  machine guns chatter
     close at hand  aak aak aak  a grenade explodes  reacting to the

     its his friend jose the puerto rican kid from the next cell in

     jose reaches out to cole just as a photographer takes a flash
     picture of the kid being carried off on the stretcher  suddenly
     shots ring out  cole goes down  hit in the leg

     soldiers in gas masks rush past him like giant insects

     looking to his left cole sees the captain lying beside him dead
     from a chest wound his gas mask half off

     cole is reaching for the mask when

     a shell hits close by with an enormous explosion

     ext  college campus  night

     stunningly quiet  we are on a placid campus looking at the
     dignified architecture of breitrose hall  moving in we focus on
     a large poster advertising the alexander lectures spring 1995
     we skim the listings jon else on the nuclear agony dr andrew

     int  auditoriumbreitrose hall  night

     a large screen dominates the auditorium stage  on the screen is
     a slide of an engraving from the middle ages showing a madman in
     apparent agony his mouth shaped to a scream as he is restrained
     by peasants  the projector zooms slowly in on the agonized face
     of this madman as we hear raillys voice lecturing

                               raillys voice os
                according to the accounts of local
                officials at that time this gentleman
                judged to be about forty years of age
                appeared suddenly in the village of wyle
                near stonehenge in the west of england in
                april of 1162  using unfamiliar words and
                speaking in a strange accent the man made
                dire prognostications about a pestilence
                which he predicted would wipe out humanity
                in approximately 8oo years  deranged and
                hysterical the man raped a young woman of the
                village was taken into custody but then
                mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again

     we discover railly six years older now standing at a lectern
     in a pool of light  shes dwarfed by the giant screen where the
     engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
     scenes of pestilence in the middle ages as she lectures to an
     audience of mostly scholarly types

                                    railly cont
                in 1841 mackay wrote during seasons
                of great pestilence men have often
                believed the prophecies of crazed
                fanatics that the end of the world was
                come  obviously this plaguedoomsday
                scenario is considerably more compelling
                when reality supports it in some form
                whether its the bubonic plague smallpox
                or aids  in addition to these natural
                contagions there are now technological
                horrors as well  besides radiation
                consider our lurking fear of germ
                warfare and its close approximation
                chemical warfare which first reared
                its ugly head in the deadly mustard
                gas attacks during the first world war

     on the screen a series of slides show images of world war i
     soldiers in gas masks in death throes etc

                               raillys voice cont os
                during such an attack in the french
                trenches in october 1917 we have an
                account of this soldier

     on the screen a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
     jose the puerto rican kid strapped to a stretcher being carried
     by soldiers through the trenches during an attack  jose appears
     to be ranting madly as the projector zooms closer on his face until
     the image approximates munchs famous painting

                               raillys voice cant os
                 who during an assault was wounded
                by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
                lines where doctors discovered he had
                lost all comprehension of french but
                spoke english fluently albeit in a
                regional dialect they didnt recognize
                the man although physically unaffected
                by the gas was hysterical  he claimed
                he had come from the future that he was
                looking for a pure germ that would
                ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
                the earth in the year 1995

     the audience gives a nervous chuckle

     on the screen a different old photograph of jose  this time
     hes in a military hospital gaunt haunted very ill

                               raillys voice cont os
                although seriously injured the young
                soldier disappeared from the hospital
                before more data could be gathered  no
                doubt he was trying to carry on his
                mission to warn others substituting
                for the agony of wara selfinflicted
                agony we call the cassandra complex

     as railly continues we scan the audience and discover marilou martin
     raillys friend and marilous husband wayne chang both listening
     attentively  further away another man listens intently  a man with
     shoulderlength carrotcolored hair  his name is dr peters

                               railly cont
                cassandra in greek legend you will recall
                was condemned to know the future but to be
                disbelieved when she foretold it  hence
                the agony of foreknowledge combined with
                impotence to do anything about it

     int  reception room  an hour later night

     a stack of new books  the doomsday syndrome apocalyptic
     visions of the mentally ill by dr kathryn railly

     surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience railly is
     seated at the table signing books but dr peters has her ear

                               dr peters
                i think dr railly you have given
                your alarmists a bad name  surely
                there is very real and very convincing
                data that the planet cannot survive the
                excesses of the human race  proliferation
                of atomic devices uncontrolled breeding
                habits the rape of the environment the
                pollution of land sea and air  in this
                context isnt it obvious that chicken
                little represents the sane vision and
                that homo sapiens motto lets go
                shopping is the cry of the true lunatic

     dr peters smiles selfimportantly at railly as an elderly
     disheveled professor elbows in front of him
 
                               disheveled professor
                doctor railly  please  i wonder if
                youre aware of my own studies which
                indicate that certain cycles of the
                moon actually impact on the incidence
                of apocalyptic predictions as observed
                in urban emergency rooms and

     as the professor babbles marilou martin and her husband wayne

     railly seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
     purse unlocks her car door starts to open it when

     unable to scream she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
     front seat

                ive got a gun

     railly freezes terrified as he opens the rear door and
     scrambles in behind her

     int  acuraparking lot

     fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice railly says

                               railly

     glancing in the rear view mirror railly sees penetrating eyes
     peering out of the shadows no other features

     halfturning in the seat she holds out the keys to him

                               railly
                here  you can have the keys  you can

     he grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard speaking fiercely
     into her ear his face last in shadow

                had no choice  turn left

     as she makes the turn railly glances in the rear view mirror
     sees him unfolding a tattered map  his face is lost in darkness
     but she glimpses ragged torn clothing as he tries to read the
     map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights

                               railly
                where where are we going

                here i think

     railly obeys  she glances in the mirror again hesitates then
     boldly switches on the dome light holding her breath fearfully
     for his reaction

     he grunts appreciatively  relieved she looks in the mirror
     again trying to get a better look at him but now his features
     are concealed by the map

                               railly
                if you make me go with you its
                kidnapping  thats a serious crime
                if you let me go you could just take

     ext  skid row streetphiladelphia  day

     an elderly evangelist with long stringy hair wearing a tattered
     bathrobe stands on a skid row corner waving a worn bible as he
     rants at disinterested derelicts winos and bag ladies

                               evangelist
                and the wild beasts of the islands
                shall cry in their desolate houses and
                dragons in their pleasant palaces  and
                her time is near to come and her days
                shall not be prolonged

     angle on raillys acura crawling down the street railly driving
     cole beside her staring out the window

     int  acuraskid row street

     cole is scrutinizing the crumbling walls boardedup store
     fronts tattered posters decaying signs miserable residents

                               cole
                where i come from we think of this as eden

                they havent a clue  wait  stop

     ext  acuraskid row

     on foot now cole pulls an astonished railly to a wall covered with
     graffiti a hopeless tangle of symbols words and crude pictures

     clueless railly stares at the wall then at cole

     cole touches a bit of redstenciled graffiti hidden under gang
     insignias  we can just see twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle

                               cole
                the twelve monkeys  theyre here
                     looks around
                somewhere  come on

     he pulls her along the sidewalk  no question hes insane

     at the next alley entrance cole stops abruptly  then still
     keeping a firm grip on raillys arm he starts ripping down newly
     tackedup posters announcing a rap concert

     railly stares at him then turns and is looking all around when
     suddenly cole pulls her up tight and threatens

                               cole
                look im warning you  you do anything
                im going to go crazy  hurt people

                promise  but you need help james
                none of this is what you think it is

     angle on cole not listening staring triumphantly  hes found
     another partially obscured stencil of the twelve monkeys

     but just then a raspy voice startles cole

                               raspy voice os
                you cant hide from them bob

     cole whirls sees a derelict louie leering at him speaking in a
     voice eerily like the raspy voice from the next cell in the future

                               louie
                no sir old bob  dont even try
                     conspiratorially

                tracking device on you  they can find
                you anywhere  anytime  ha ha

     railly looks from louis to cole sees coles stunned reaction

                               louie
                     touches his back jaw
                in the tooth bob  right
                     sudden triumphant grin
                but i fooled em old buddy

     he opens his mouth wide  no teeth

     cole grabs railly and pulls her into the alley and down it

                               cole
                theyre keeping an eye on me

                               railly

                him  hes from the present  he

     cole breaks off freezes as he sees

     there on a brick wall is a stencil of the dancing monkeys

     and further on another red stencil

     ext  vacant lot  moments later day

     crackheads huddle against a building sucking their pipes
     oblivious to cole pulling railly past

     cole scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti

     railly is considering her surroundings dubiously when suddenly
     cole pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley

                               railly
                james no  we shouldnt be here

     cole ignores her yanking her after him into the alley

     int  dark alley  day

     two tom cats face off arching their backs and hissing menacingly

     cole avoids them as he pulls railly into the gloom

     angle on railly seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead

     raillys pov  two thugs standing over a man kicking him

     railly tries to stop but cole intent on the wall messages
     doesnt notice the thugs

     the two thugs turn and spot cole and railly moving toward them

     these creeps have mean eyes predator faces

     railly digs her heels in forcing cole to stop

                               railly
                james  we have to go back  those men

     too late  while cole turns and stares at her uncomprehending
     the two thugs are approaching

                               first thug
                hey buddy

     startled cole turns to face them

     the second thug lunges for raillys purse yanks it from her

     cole reaches to grab it back butwhack  the first thug smacks
     cole hard across the face with something metallic

     bloodyfaced dazed cole doesnt even have a chance to clear his
     head as the first thug shoves the hard object against coles
     cheek  its a cheap thirtyeight pistol

     railly turns to run gets two steps before the second thug knocks
     her roughly to the ground

                               second thug
                stick around bitch

     looming over her the second thug starts to unzip his fly
     railly looks over to cole sees

     cole dropping to his knees groveling at the first thugs feet

                               cole
                please  please dont hurt me

     the first thug steps close kicks cole contemptuously cocks his
     foot for a second kick when

     cole uncoils lunging rising his strong arms around the bigger
     mans calves lifting him mightily high off the ground

     the gun fires wildly as cole staggers forward with the first thug
     in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him
     the first thug goes down in a heap dropping the pistol

     zipping his fly hastily the second thug turns to deal with cole
     but cole attacks himrocking him again and again with savage
     blows that come one after another with lightning speed  the second
     thug staggers back bloody and dazed as railly watches amazed

     turning back to the first thug cole sees the man reaching for
     the dropped pistol

     cole kicks him viciously in the jaw  the first thugs head whips
     back  snap  he collapses against the brick wall

     cole turns back to see the second thug retreating down the alley
     as fast as he can stagger

     railly stares up at cole  he looks very dangerous  he glances
     in her direction as he pockets the pistol

                               cole
                are you hurt

                               railly
                uh no  yes  i mean just some scrapes

     as railly gets to her feet she sees cole bend over the
     motionless thug and quickly go through his pockets

                               railly
                is healive

     cole ignores the question as he pockets the mans wallet and a
     handful of bullets then turns and snaps at railly

                               cole
                come an  were running out of time
                you cant help him

     as cole yanks her roughly away she looks back sees the first
     thugs sightless eyes wide openstaring blankly

                               railly
                oh jesus james  you killed him

                               cole
                i did him a favor  now come on

     cole pulling her again sees more 12 monkeys on the wall

                               railly
                you didnt have a gun before did you

     the evangelist spotting cole and railly hurrying past him
     points urgently at cole

     leaflets that demand an end to specieism  behind them a large
     poster proclaims animals have souls too  just then theres
     a tremendous clap of thunder as the activists look up and see
     cole and railly enter

     cole looks startled  it sounds like torrential rain pouring in
     here  maintaining a tight grip on raillys wrist he looks
     around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour

     bookshelves line two walls  the front window is blanked cut with
     posters of animal rights demonstrations newspaper clippings
     photos of animal atrocities  the fourth wall features the
     counter where the three activists face cole as a jungle bird

                               fale
                uh can we help you

     cole looks confused as the rain abates and an elephant trumpets
     an urgent warning

     railly watches helplessly  suddenly cole finds something he
     thinks hes seen before  he holds it up

                     a helpless shrug to his cohorts

                wanted to do guerrilla actions to
                educate the public

     cole holds up a clipping showing horrified senators standing on
     their desks as rattlesnakes slither along the senate floor

                               fale

     railly puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
     the gas station attendant slams the hood down

     she looks him in the eye then indicates the tiny convenience
     store appended to the gas station

                you need stitches and antibiotics
                lucky for you it was near the surface

     railly wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
     while cole continues staring up at the sky

                               cole
                i love seeing the sun

                stimulating company for itself with no
                sense of purpose  but alas i am
                burdened with the sense that with all
                this excess of public attention and
                this cacophony of praise there comes
                great responsibility  indeed i
                practically feel a soapbox growing

                that would be totally out of character
                helping people is against my principles
                     to the agents
                see he definitely doesnt know me  now

     beside the stream  the car looks empty

     int  trunkford

     total blackness  the sound of keys in the lock

     then the trunk swings open and cole stands in the moonlight
     looking down

     railly is in the trunk tears of rage and frustration in her eyes

                               railly

     cole backs away as railly scrambles out of the trunk swinging

     he slips falls and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically

                i could have died in there  if something
                had happened to you i would have died

                jeffrey mason said it was my idea about
                the virus  and suddenly i wasnt

                out the human race  it was my idea

                               railly

                race  not you or jeffrey or anybody

                it can be dealt with but only if you
                want to  i can help you

                catching you running  okay

     crowded around coles bed the scientists are concluding a
     ragged out of tune rendition of blueberry hill

     int  raillys bedroom  morning

     bedside phone rings  her eyes snap open  a beat to orient
     herself  ring  she reaches for the phone

     close on halperin at his desk talking into the phone

                               lieutenant halperin
                dr railly  jim halperin philly pd
                sorry to call so early but

     close on railly eager concerned into the phone

                you found him  is he all right

     close on halpepin noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
     giving an i told you so look to the black plainclothes cop
     across his desk then continuing into the phone

                               lieutenant halperin
                au contraire doctor  no sign of your
                good friend the kidnapper  however
                the plot thickens  i have a ballistic
                report on my desk that says the bullet
                you claim you removed from mr coles
                thigh is an antiqueand all indications
                are it was firedsometime prior to 1920

     angle on railly reacting stunned

     angle on halperin continuing soberly now

                               lieutenant ralperin
                so what i was thinking was maybe if i
                sent a detective down there to talk
                with you you could maybe revise or
                amplify on the circumstances
                hello  hello  dr railly

     halperin considers the dead phone glances at the cop again

     int  raillys bedroomstudy

     her hand still on the receiver railly looks shocked  then she
     hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
     arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
     finds a copy of her book  she leafs through it hurriedly
     locates the picture of the puerto rican kid jose in wwi

     peering closely she tries to see everything in the picture
     then she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
     photographs and rummages through it until she finds

                               railly
                no

     its an uncropped shot of jose being carried on the stretcher in
     the trenches  and there in the corner with no helmet no gas
     mask and just a bit of bare shoulder showingits cole

     the astrophysicist fixes cole with a sharp penetrating look

                you cant trick us you know  it
                wouldnt work

                im afraid this doesnt seem very
                professional to me in fact its
                distressingly unprofessional for some
                one who treated my son briefly if
                indeed you actually are who you say you
                are to take a sudden unsolicited interest
                in his mental health six years later
                and to telephone a parent to express
                opinions that would be inappropriate
                     breaks off listens then
                i dont know anything about monkey
                armies doctor  nothing whatsoever
                if my son ever was involved in
                     listens then
                it would be doubly inappropriate to
                discuss matters of security with you
                dr railly but if it will put you at
                ease neither my son nor any other

                that man who broke into my house  she
                seems to have been suddenly struck by
                the most preposterous notion about jeffrey

                               dr masons assistant os
                i attended a lecture onceapocalyptic
                visions

     we see dr masons assistant now  its dr peters the red
     haired man who insisted to dr railly you didnt have to be
     insane to think the world was coming to an end

                               dr peters cont
                has she succumbed to her own
                theoreticaldisease

     but dr mason is lost in thought not listening

                               dr mason
                given the nature of our work we cant ever
                be careful enough  i think we should review
                our security procedures perhaps upgrade them

     int  scientists chamber  eternal night

     cole is facing the botanist whos using a pointer to indicate
     various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall

                               botanist
                lets consider again our current
                information  if the symptoms were
                first detected in philadelphia on june
                28 1995 that makes us know that

                               cole
                it was released in philadelphia
                probably on june 14 1995

                               botanist
                and it appeared sequentially after that
                in

     with a quick glance at the panel of scientists staring at him
     from behind the long table cole replies like a good pupil

                               botanist
                meaning

                               cole
                that the virus was taken from philadelphia
                to san francisco then to new orleans
                rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi
                bangkok then peking

                               botanist
                and your only goal is

                               cole
                to find out where the virus is so a
                qualified scientist can travel back into
                the past and study the original virus

                               botanist
                so that

                               cole
                uh so that a vaccine can be developed
                that will uh allow mankind to reclaim
                the surface of the earth

     cole glances nervously at the suspicious scientists as the
     botanist switches on a slide projector and projects

     a magazine photo of wall graffiti  attention  police are
     watching  is there a virus  is this the source  3 billion die

                               botanist os
                this is from a magazine printed in late
                september 1995  the writer speculated
                that this graffiti might be related to
                the epidemic that by that time had
                already killed thirty million people
                worldwide and was getting worse  he
                says certain people unnamed were
                questioned but what came of that is not
                known  but it is a clue you should pursue

                this is your leader a certifiable lunatic
                who told his former psychiatrist all his
                plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible
                schemes and now who knows what shes
                painted out there on our wall

                you think i told her about the army of
                the 12 monkeys  impossible  know why
                you pathetically ineffectual and
                pusillanimous pretendfriendto
                animals  ill tell you why  because
                when i had anything to do with her six
                years ago there was no such thing  i

     supercilious smile and a patronizing tone

                               jeffrey
                heres my theory on that  while i was
                institutionalized my brain was studied
                exhaustively in the guise of mental health
                i was interrogated xrayed studied
                thoroughly  then everything about me
                was entered into a computer where they
                created a model of my mind

     they all stare mesmerized at the strutting jeffrey  is he
     serious  is he crazy  doesnt matter  hes charismatic

                               jeffrey cont
                then using the computer model they
                generated every thought i could possibly
                have in the next say ten years which
                they then filtered through a probability
                matrix to determine everything i was
                going to do in that period  so you
                see she knew i was going to lead the
                army of the twelve monkeys into the
                pages of history before it ever even
                occurred to me  she knows everything
                im ever going to do before i know it
                myself  how about that

     jeffrey smiles smugly into fales flabbergasted face

                               jeffrey
                now i have to get going  do my part
                you guys check all this stuff out and
                load up the van  make sure you have
                everything  im outta here

     jeffrey exits  the others stare at the door

     holding  a menacing figure stands in the doorway  wallace  a
     wiry bikertype with jail house tattoos and mean eyes

     cole and railly are too stunned to say anything as wallace looks
     them over coldly insolently then advances on railly

                               wallace
                this is my territory bitch

                               cole

                     to wallace
                excuse me i think we have a little
                misunderstanding here

     wallace smashes railly in the face  she flies back against the
     wall and onto the floor as wallace spins around to cole who is
     stepping toward him but wallace is now holding a knife

                               wallace
                whatre you  some kind of tough guy
                you wanna be a hero  you gonna try and
                mess with me  come on

     a beat  cole puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
     wallace and moves to railly whose eye is already swelling

                               wallace
                now thats a smart boy  but you

                misunderstandin

     railly reaches a hand up to cole for assistance but he grabs
     her purse instead swings it around smashes wallace in the face
     with it then grabs the pimps arm and snaps it like it was a
     twig  the knife clatters to the floor as wallace yelps in pain
     and cole slams him to the floor straddles his chest retrieves
     the nearby knife and presses it sharply against wallaces neck

                               railly

     cole hesitates

                               wallace

                               railly
                iiwe need cash james

     a shadow  railly turns toward the door and glimpses a face
     disappearing then hears shouts from the hallway

                               shouts os
                theyre killing him  call the cops

     being very careful not to move his neck wallace reaches into his
     pocket and produces a thick roll of bills which railly grabs

                               wallace
                you two are crazy  i got friends  you
                put me in a closet theyre gonna be
                really pissed

     cole moves off wallace and keeping the knife close yanks him to
his teeth while railly hurries to the window and looks out

     her pov  a fire escape leads down into an alley

     railly turns just in time to see cole shove wallace into the
     bathroom follow him in slam the door behind them and lock it

                               railly

                james what are you doing

     wallace cowers back against the shower stall

     railly is pounding on the bathroom door now as suddenly it
     opens and cole steps out the knife in his right hand dripping
     with blood

                               railly
                oh my god james  did you kill him

     cole shakes his head no as blood oozes from his mouth

     raillys astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
     choice hes made  given up the future if it exists and its
     looking like it does  risking his life to be with her  for
     this brief time  shes overwhelmed lips trembling tears
     welling in her eyes  but just then the sounds of shouts and
     feet thundering up the stairs snap her back to reality

     realizes the truth  he starts to recite

     cruiser as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic
     noticing something he reaches for his radio

     angle on railly spotting the cruiser grabbing cole pulling him
     into the crowd

                here let me help you

     the theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
     screen revealing enough of cole and railly for us to see shes
     doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie

                               cole
                i think ive seen this movie before

                 but everytime you see it it seems
                to be different because youre different
                 you notice different things

                               railly
                if we cant change anythingbecause
                its already happened then we ought to
                at least smell the flowers

                               railly
                so we can stick our heads out the
                window and feel the wind and listen to
                the music  so we can appreciate what
                we have while we have it  forgive me
                psychiatrists dont cry

     there are tears in her eyes  they discomfit cole

                wrong  maybe were both crazy

                it wont  if there are still baseball

                the gift shop

     cole follows her look nods then heads for the mens room as
     railly in sun glasses gaudy outfit high heels starts clip
     clopping toward the ticket counter her ass attracting admiring
     glances

     int  telephoneslobby  day

     business travelers huddle over pay phones talking earnestly as
     cole walks past on his way to the mens room

     seeing an unoccupied phone cole hesitates considers it  coming
     to a decision he reaches into his pocket pulls out some change

     int  tzcket counterterminal

     close on the flyer of cole and railly taped under the counter
     hidden from the customers but in clear view of the ticket agent
     who has just finished serving a portly gentleman  the gentleman
     walks away

     angle on railly stepping up to the counter smiling looking
     nothing like the railly on the flyer

                               railly

                listen i dont know whether youre
                there or not  maybe you just clean

                but if you other guys exist and youre

                didnt do it  it was a mistake
                someone else did it  the army of the
                twelve monkeys are just dumb kids
                playing revolutionaries  it was
                someone else

     cole looks around nervously catches a businessman at the next
     phone looking away quickly  cole touches his loose moustache as
     he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper

                               cole
                ive done my job  i did what you wanted
                good luck  im not coming back

     cole hangs up the phone looks around catches a few stares
     averting his face he heads for the mens room

     int  ticket counter  day

     the ticket agent is counting out a stack of bills

                               ticket agent
                dont see a lot of this cash

                               railly

                minutes  have a nice flight mrs simmons

     turning to go railly fumbles the tickets while trying to put
     them in her purse and they flutter to the floor  as she kneels
     to retrieve them we see the long line of waiting travelers from
     the waist down  we see a familiar chicago bulls sports bag
     resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants
     weve seen this outfit beforein coles dreamon mr ponytail

     the pa drones as ccle head down lingers at a sink washing
     and rewashing his hands while another traveler finishes drying
     his hands gives cole a quizzical look then leaves

     quickly cole glances around checks the seemingly empty mens
     room then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket puts some
     goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
     against his face as he leans close to the mirror

                               raspy voice os
                got yourself a prob bob

     cole whirls looks for the source of the voice  nothing  until
     he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
     occupied stall  it must be him

                               cole
                leave me alone  i made a report  i
                didnt have to do that

                               raspy voice os
                point of fact  you dont belong here
                its not permitted to let you stay

     a toilet flushes in the occupied stall  coles answer is loud
     and defiant

                               cole
                this is the present  this is not the past
                this is not the future  this is right now

     a plump businessman emerges from the occupied stall gives cole
     a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink

                               cole
                im staying here you got that  you
                cant stop me

                anything you say chief  its none of
                my business

     cole looks dismayed  this guy couldnt be the voice  and there
     are no feet showing under the other stalls  did he imagine it

     the chicago bulls bag  its on the counter in front of the

     cole emerges from the mens room shaken paranoid  he glances
     around nervously  then keeping his head down he starts walking
     toward the gift shop  before he gets more than a few steps
     someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind

     jose having heard this steps back into the crowd as railly
     grabs cole and pulls him toward the security check points

                     blinks stupidly then
                of course

     dr peters takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it

     theres a sound of voices raised behind them  dr peters pays no
     attention but the security officer turns toward the noise

     second security officer

     commotion

     angle on dr peters oblivious to the fuss pulling a closed
     glass tube out of the metal cylinder

     indeed it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it

                               dr peters
                well yes to be sure it looks empty
                but i assure you its not

     angle on dr peters producing the glass tubes from the other
     metal cylinders as the security officer examines the papers

                               dr peters
                you see  also invisible to the naked eye

     a beat  or peters grins suddenly opens one of the glass tubes
     and waves it under the security officers nose

                               dr peters
                it doesnt even have an odor

     the security officer glances up sees what dr peters is doing
     and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist

                               security officer
                thats not necessary sir  here you
                go  thanks for your cooperation  have
                a good flight

     hastily dr peters snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and
     shoves them back into his gym bag

     angle on railly raging as the second security officer jabs her
     with his finger
