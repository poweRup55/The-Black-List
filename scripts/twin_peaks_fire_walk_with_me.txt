                         remember lils dance

               as desmond explains we 

               intercut with

               flashback ills dance

               in slow motion

               on lils sour face

                                     desmond
                         lil was wearing a sour face

                                     stanley
                         what do you mean

                                     desmond
                         her face had a sour look that 
                         means were going to have trouble 
                         with the local authorities they are 
                         not going to be receptive to the 
                         fbi

               on lil blinking both eyes

                                     desmond
                         both eyes blinking means there is 
                         going to be trouble higher up  
                         the eyes of the local authority a 
                         sheriff and a deputy that would be 
                         my guess two of the local law 
                         enforcers are going to be a problem

               on lil putting one hand in her pocket and one in a fist

                                     desmond
                         if you noticed she had one hand in 
                         her pocket which means they are hiding 
                         something and the other hand made a 
                         fist which means they are going to 
                         be belligerent

               on lil walking in place

                                     desmond
                         lil was walking in place which means 
                         theres going to be a lot of legwork 
                         involved

               we see cole putting his fingers in front of his face and 
               saying lil is his sisters girl

                                     desmond
                         cole said lil was his mothers 
                         sisters girl what is missing in 
                         that sentence the uncle

                                     stanley
                         oh the uncle is missing

                                     desmond
                         not coles uncle but probably the 
                         sheriffs uncle in federal prison

                                     stanley
                         so the sheriff had got an uncle whos 
                         committed a serious crime

               on lils red wig

                                     desmond
                         right which is probably why lil was 
                         wearing a red wig meaning we are 
                         headed into a dangerous situation  
                         let me ask you something stanley 
                         did you notice anything about the 
                         dress

                                     stanley
                         the dress she was wearing had been 
                         altered to fit her i noticed a 
                         different colored thread where the 
                         dress had been taken in it wasnt 
                         her dress or she must have lost some 
                         weight

                                     desmond

                         a blue rose

                                     desmond

                                     stanley

                         all these things

                                     desmond

                         cable

               cliff just smiles for a long minute

                                     cliff
                         why dont you folks have a seat 
                         make yourself at home its gonna be 
                         a while

               desmond stays standing and stanley sits after another long 
               moment cliff joins the secretary in a conspiratorial giggle 
               over the long wait they are planning to give the fbi in the 
               middle of a giggle cliff smiles up at desmond

                                     cliff
                         why dont you have some of that 
                         coffee it was fresh two days ago

               cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the 
               secretary pretending to look at some paper work they both 
               laugh

                                     desmond

                              still smiling
                         oh

               desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to 
               sheriff cables office

               cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway daring 
               him to do something while they stare eye to eye desmonds 
               hand goes up slowly towards cliffs face in a slow mesmerizing 
               way cliff tries to knock chets hand away chet counters by 
               grabbing cliffs nose and pinches a nerve to its side 
               injecting cliff with a great amount of pain

                                     cliff
                         aaahhhhhhhh

               desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the 
               inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides 
               cliff down into a chair

               while the deputys eyes tear copiously desmond turns to the 
               secretary

                                     desmond

                         nerve work we are going to have to 
                         take the body back to portland

               desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall takes the 
               picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass

               insert  picture

               teresa banks is wearing a ring

               back on the scene

               stanley returns with his equipment desmond shows him the 
               photograph

                                     desmond
                         take a look at this

               stanley studies it

                         my guess is there isnt enough detail 
                         in the photo to get an idea of the 
                         design on the ring but we should do 
                         a blowup of this anyway

                              looks at desmond
                         there doesnt seem to be enough detail 
                         in the photo to ascertain the design 
                         on the ring

               where he sees a hand appear in the window of a trailer then 
               the hand disappears

               desmond walks to that trailer he knocks on the door but no 
               one answers he looks under the trailer and sees a mound of 
               dirt with a small indentation at the top in the indentation 
               is teresa banks ring as he reaches out and touches it he

               the picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in 
               the neighbors yard

               ext palmer house outside lauras bedroom  night

               laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn

               little hook on the wall and crawls into bed she turns off 
               the light and stares at the picture in the dark

               mrs tremonds picture

               we hold on the picture as if by magic we suddenly begin to 
               move into the picture  into the room in the picture and 
               thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture

               on the other side of the dark doorway there is another room

               mrs tremond is standing in that room she is beckoning us 
               towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway we move 
               thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway 
               there is another room

               mrs tremonds grandson is standing in that room he is 
               holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary 
               glass ball as we move towards the space between his hands a 
               ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into

               int red room

               the man from another place walks into the red room to a table

               a ring lies upon the table

               cooper enters the red room the man from another place turns 
               toward cooper

                                     man from another place
                         is it future or is it past do

                         and i sound like this

               the man from another place puts his hand in front of his 
               lips and makes an indian whooping sound

               the man from another place picks up the ring and moves it 
               very close to us we recognize it as teresa banks ring  
               the symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of owl 
               cave

               cooper seems concerned

                                     cooper

                         take the ring

               the man from another place moves the ring towards us till 
               the ring fills the screen

               back in lauras room

               laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise 
               she tries to move her left arm but it has fallen asleep 
               she moves it with her right arm

               sfx the noise

               it sounds as if someone is calling her name

               on laura

               she turns to her right to see who it is then turning back 
               to her left she discovers annie blackburn lying in bed with 
               her annie has blood around her mouth she tries to raise 
               herself and strains to speak

               she is gone

               filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is teresa 
               banks ring

               she screams again her attention is drawn to her door and 
               her mothers distant call still holding the ring she gets 
               out of bed and goes to her door and slowly opens it

               it is dark on the other side of the door

               at the doorway of lauras bedroom

               and turns to look at mrs tremonds picture there in the

                         began to flutter there like there 
                         was a wind blowing and he couldnt 
                         swallow and they rushed to him and 
                         loosened his collar and they were 
                         asking him if he was alright and he 
                         started to turn blue and his eyes 
                         started to roll back into his head 
                         and he still couldnt get the fish 
                         eye out and they tried to do a 
                         heimlich maneuver i went over to 
                         him as they were preparing to do an 
                         emergency tracheotomy they were 
                         over him with a knife when he suddenly 
                         shot the fish eye out of his throat 
                         and right onto the ceiling splat 
                         it just stuck up there and spread 
                         out it was about the size of a half 
                         dollar and thats why i dont ever

               his gun

               bobby shoots the deputy in the shoulder but the deputy still 
               prepares to shoot at bobby so bobby shoots him again this 
               time in the chest

               the deputy spins and tries to run but bobby shoots him in 
               the back
