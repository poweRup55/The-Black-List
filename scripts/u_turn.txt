     ext somewhere in the desert southwest  day

     begin titles over

     it is early morning and already hot  insects drone crackle
     and scurry for shade  prairie dogs burrow to escape the sun
     we can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the earth

     on a dusty highway a pair of vultures dine on a dead coyote
     one of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of
     the carcass

     in the distance where a long dusty road meets the horizon a
     small shape appears  a sixtyfourandahalf mustang
     convertible its top down  its candyapple red burns like a
     brilliant fireball under the sun  as the car drifts closer we
     see steam escaping from under the hood  sammi smiths please
     help me get through the night plays on the cars radio

     int bobby coopers mustang  day

     at the wheel ignoring impending disaster bobby cooper young
     goodlooking fiddles with the radio dial annoyed only to find
     country stations hes been driving since noon yesterday and it
     shows  along with a heavilybandaged left hand resting on the
     steering wheel he finds something by pearl jam or smashing
     pumpkins and he cranks it he pops a percodan with his good hand
     as in the shimmering distance ahead he sees black shapes in
     the road and lays on the horn

                       bobby
             get off the goddamn road

     ext desert road  day

     as the mustang powers by the vultures move off the shoulder
     silently watching

     int mustang  day

     the radio blares as bobby fights to stay awake his attention is
     caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane he
     sits up as the police car sheriff potter inside closes
     quickly the siren starts faintly then screams as the cruiser
     roars past at speed

                       bobby
             fuck you

     there is a loud pop from the front of the mustang and a thick
     cloud of steam now pours from the hood the temperature gauge
     now starts rising

                       bobby
             nonot nowshit

     a couple of semis roar past in the opposite direction
     buffetting the mustang with their air waves

     ext fork in the road  day

     the car rolls into a fork in the road limping with the droop of
     an animal that wont make another hundred yards

     one sign on the larger road says globe is 29 miles away the
     other sign on the lesser road tells us superior is only 2
     miles a third sign confirms his destiny with gas food 1
     mile

     bobby seems to have no choice he aims the car down the lesser
     road towards superior arizona

     ext outskirts superior  day

     the car rattles on its last legs as bobby mutters incantations
     noticing a old ghostlike mining company at the base of the
     mountains overlooking the town its deserted now no one
     visible the gates shut but in its vast dark bulk we sense
     the ancient richness and power of this town bobby moves on

     ext harlins garage  day

     down the road from the mining company bobbys car pulls into a
     small gas station made of weatherbeaten wood its windows long
     since dusted over the pumps themselves look to have been
     manufactured in the early fifties above the station is a sign
     so faded its barely readable harlins

     bobby gets out of the car and with great care favoring his
     bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain
     he opens the hood a plume of steam hits him in the face

                       bobby
             oh shit

     bobby looks around for someone anyone  after a few moments he
     reaches into the car and blows the horn  he waits then blows
     it again  from out of the station walks darrell  a
     slowlooking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty  he
     looks the part of a yokel

                       bobby
             you harlin

                       darrell
             nope  darrell

                       bobby
             harlin around

                       darrell
             hes up at the look out

     darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance

                       bobby
             will he be back soon

                       darrell
             doubt it  hes dead  the look outs a
             cemetery

                       bobby
             you own this place

                       darrell
             yep

                       bobby
             then why do you call it harlins

                       darrell
             cause harlin used to own it

                       bobby
             but hes dead

                       darrell
             so

     bobby is confused but chooses to drop the matter

                       bobby
             you want to take a look at my car  i think
             the radiator hose is

                       darrell

             bed course dont want to get out for the
             cold ones neither  then of course the
             clouds come in

     darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag  it doesnt so much
     wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt

                       bobby
             look harlin ive got places to be

                       darrell

             ok darrell could you just take a look
             at my radiator hose  its busted

     darrell is clearly upset at being cut off  he leans into the
     car and looks at the engine

                       bobby
             so

                       darrell

             might be seventytwo these clouds move
             around a lot

     bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead

                       darrell
             what happened to your hand

     selfconsciously bobby quickly drops his hand to his side

                       bobby
             accident

                       darrell
             you got to be more careful hands is
             important  let me show you something when
             i was a kid now i dont know if you can
             still see it but i gashed my fingers in a
             lawnmower

                       bobby
             im very interested in this but is there
             someplace

                       darrell
             diner up a piece  not much but us simple
             folk like it

                       bobby
             ill be back in a couple of hours  and be
             careful with her will you

     darrell slams down the hood

                       darrell
             just a car

     bobby reaches into the car pulls out a small ugly gym bag which
     he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk pops it open

                       bobby
             its not just a car its a sixtyfour and
             half mustang convertible thats the
             difference between you and me and why you
             live here and im just passing through

     the trunk lid rises in the air partially blocking bobby from
     darrell acting as a partition between them

                       bobby
             now do you mind i got to get some stuff
             out of the trunk

     he throws the car key to darrell who takes the hint spits
     grotesquely into the dirt scratches his nuts and walks back
     to the shack

     concealed by the trunk lid bobby pulls out a gun a 9mm black
     baretta wrapped in a tshirt from the top of the bag perhaps
     we see a flash of green money lots of it sports pages and
     betting sheets are piled inside with a look around bobby takes
     the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk
     briefly we notice a towing rope under the mat there is a small
     travel bag from which he peels a fresh bottle of percodan
     quickly taking two as well as the sports page

     int harlins garage  day

     darrell watches out of the darkened office through the front
     window as bobby slams the trunk and starts walking down the
     road with the bag on his shoulder

     ext desert road  later

     bobby walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign
     saying superior  home of the golden door retirement
     community as he walks on a pair of motorcyclers roar past on
     their harleys blanketing him in a cloud of dust  he shouts
     after them but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle
     engines

     ext superior main street  day

     bobby hits town such as it is  the freeway left here a few
     years back there are only a few little stores  a general
     store a catalog outlet a post office that doubles as a bus
     depot  all of them built for the desert heat the busiest spot
     in town seems to be the truckstopdiner with a few 18 wheelers
     parked outside it

     at the corner of one street sits an old blind man dressed in
     raggedy clothes perhaps an indian his seeingeye dog lies next
     to him hes talking to two old men veterans perhaps indian or
     spanish they both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive
     alcoholic looks as bobby passes the blind man yells out in an
     american indian accent

                       blind man
             hey  you there

     bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine it has
     bottles instead of cans  the blind man shouts to bobby

                       blind man
             get me a dr peppa  i dont want no colas
             colas aint nothing but flavored water

     bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of dr
     pepper  he starts back to the blind man

                       blind man
             dont forget to open it for me  i cant be
             opening my own bottle

                       bobby
             christ

     bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle then walks
     back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground

                       blind man
             a little for mother earth im about fifty
             percent indian you know to all our

                       blind man
             ah  just what i needed  want some

     the blind man holds the bottle out to bobby  a string of saliva
     runs from his lips to the bottles neck

                       bobby
             ill pass

     bobby reaches down and pets the old mans dog flies buzz around
     both the dog and the blind man

                       bobby
             i think youd better give your pooch a sip

     bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street grace mckenna
     compulsively turns and catches up to her  she is dressed better
     than the usual tshirts and tank tops of this town  perhaps a
     mailordered dress or a mothers handmedown  with her raven
     hair and caramel skin it is obvious she is native american her
     arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage

                       bobby
             accident

                       grace
             you should be more careful

     they start walking towards graces car

                       grace
             its very nice of you to help me  that
             package is kind of heavy and its so hot

                       bobby
             no trouble at all really

     they get to a car and bobby puts down the package

                       bobby
             wasnt nothing

                       grace
             oh this isnt my car  its down a ways
             i should have parked closer  i just didnt
             think it would be so heavy  i could drive
             up

                       bobby
             thats all right  i got it

     bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again  the
     package seems to have gained weight

                       grace
             its just new drapes and curtain rods  if
             i had known it was going to be so heavy i
             would have had them delivered up to the
             house

     bobby struggles with the package  sweat starts to sheet his
     face

                       bobby panting
             that a fact

                       grace
             i just got tired of looking at the old
             drapes my mother made them had them long
             as i can remember you ever seen something
             and just knew you had to have it

                       bobby straining
             yes i have

                       grace
             course they cost a little more than i
             should really be spending  but damn it i
             dont hardly ever do anything nice for
             myself  i deserve nice things

                       bobby can hardly talk
             i  cant  argue 

     they arrive at a jeep sahara

                       grace
             this is it

     bobby practically drops the package  he is covered with sweat

                       grace

             and get out

     grace looks to bobby and smiles

                       grace
             sometimes i feel the exact same way

     int graces bedroombathroom  later  day

     bobby naked steps into the shower and turns on the water  it
     shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body  as the
     water falls over him we hear a russian accented voice

                       voicevo
             i want my money

     bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady
     himself  his hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his
     pinky or ring finger  bobby leans back in the shower  just as
     he does

     ext alley  night

     it is raining hard  matching the backwards motion of the last
     scene bobby is thrown violently against a brick wall facing
     out

                       voicevo
             i want my money

                       bobby
             look ill get the money you dont want to
             do this

                       voice vo
             take two for now one a week punk

     bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular goons
     another man stands partially hidden behind the goons frame
     with one hand one goon flattens bobbys hand against the brick
     with his other he clips two fingers off with a garden shear we
     see bobbys face in agonizing pain then he slidesscreamingto
     the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men

     as bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks
     down his ashen blank face

     int graces bedroombathroom  moments later

     we see bobbys face reliving the experience as once again we
     hear the voice

                       voice vo
             two weeks asshole get the money or you
             gonna lose your nose and ears

     bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower looking to his
     left hand almost crying unable to tolerate it  as a streak of
     blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring
     fingers have been cut off at the joints

     int graces bedroombathroom  day

     bobby his hand rebandaged is putting on his clothes

                       bobby to himself
             youre still lucky

     as he does he looks at himself in the mirror  he bends to pick
     up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag  as he lifts it we
     can see perhaps more closely than at the garage that the bag is
     34 filled with money  he closes the bag and stands  in the
     mirror hidden in the doorway he sees grace watching him  bobby
     slows perceptibly but does not try to hide himself  after a
     moment grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade

                       grace
             thought you might like a refill on your lemonade

     bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down  he rubs the glass
     against his forehead

                       bobby
             thats good  cools you right off
             tentatively i saw you watching me

                       grace
             im sorry  i didnt mean to

                       bobby
             i didnt say it bothered me

                       grace
             did you like it me watching you

                       bobby
             i guess  ive got an ego same as any man

                       grace
             good cause i liked what i saw

     bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant grace slides
     an ice cube from the glass between her lips he notices a framed
     picture of grace and an older man

                       bobby
             nice place

                       grace
             thank you

     grace sits on the edge of the bed bobby indicates the picture
     ironic

                       bobby
             whos that your father

                       grace without much thought
             stepfather

             got a boyfriend

                       grace
             no not really

     bobby senses shes lying but plays along

                       bobby
             must get kind of lonely for a woman living
             by herself in a big house

                       grace
             i guess it must

                       bobby
             what do you do anyway

                       grace
             a little of this a little of that  mostly
             i tell fortunes

                       bobby
             whered you learn to do that

                       grace
             from my father  he was the tribes shaman

                       bobby
             a medicine man

                       grace
             those are white words not ours

                       bobby
             nice house for a shamans daughter  you
             must be good

                       grace
             come here

     bobby goes to grace and kneels before her  she takes his head
     in her hands and looks deep into his eyes  her voice goes
     thick but soft like a morning fog

                       grace
             theres something in your past something
             you want to keep hidden  theres a pain
             something  someone you cant forget
             and there is something you want very badly
             it seems very far away to you but you are
             determined and you will do what you must
             to get it

     bobby closes his hands on graces and takes them from his face
     he is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of graces
     reading

                       bobby
             my face tell you all that

                       grace
             it tells me what every face tells me
             everybody has a past they have a pain and
             they have something they want
             seductively what is it you want

                       bobby
             the same thing you do

     they silently stare into each others eyes

                       grace
             really  i want to hang drapes

     grace walks from the room  for a moment bobby stares after her
     he takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his
     teeth

     int graces living room  day

     grace is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes
     bobby notices a photo of grace with an older indian woman her
     mother

                       grace
             hold me

     bobby stands behind her gently places his hands on graces
     waist

                       grace
             tighter  i wont break you know girls are
             a lot tougher than men think

     bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes  his
     eyes are transfixed on her ass

                       grace
             there  all done  lift me down

                       bobby

             lift me down

     bobby lifts grace down from the ladder  he holds her his hands
     around her waist

                       grace
             you can let go of me now im safewith

             i like them  i was sick of looking at this
             room  i think they add a little life

                       bobby
             nothing like a little liveliness

     with a sexy pout grace loads the next question

                       grace
             no more drapes to hang  now what should
             we do

             i have an idea

                       grace
             and what would that be

     bobby steps close to grace and takes her by the shoulders  he
     pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers  grace
     doesnt respond

                       bobby
             all right grace  no more games

                       grace innocently
             games

                       bobby
             you flirt with me then you run cold  you
             lead me on then slap me down  i dont go
             for being jerked around

                       grace
             really  and what game did you want to
             play  you carry my box for me and i fall
             into bed with you

     bobby grabs up his pack

                       bobby
             i think i can find my own way back to
             into town

                       grace
             maybe i like to find out about a man first
             maybe i like to know what hes made of

                       bobby

     bobby turns to leave

                       grace
             you never did answer my question

                       bobby
             still playing

                       grace

     determination like a beast closing for the kill bobby moves

     jake looks at bobby his lips curled into a sly smile

             fire going under you

                       bobby

     bobby gives a little laugh

                       jake
             bet you just wanted to snap her neck right
             then didnt you  bet you just wanted to
             kill her

     bobby starts to laugh heartily  jake joins in then stops
     abruptly

                       jake
             would you

                       bobby

             would you kill her

     bobby starts to laugh bobby stops laughing

                       jake
             because im sick and tired of her little
             games  because you could do it and drift
             away on your boat and no one would ever see
             you again  because ive got a
             fiftythousand dollar life insurance policy
             on her and i would be more than happy to
             give the man who does her in a good chunk
             of it

     for a moment bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of
     the offer

                       bobby
             ive done a few things but im not a
             murderer mr mckenna

                       jake
             how do you know if youve never tried

                       bobby
             this is a joke right  you just want to
             rattle me  right

     they reach town and jake stops the car near a small grocery
     store

                       jake
             thats right  nothing but a joke  thats
             all

     bobby gets out of the car  with a big smile jake says

                       jake
             enjoy your stay lad

     jake speeds away  bobby looks after him

                       bobby

     int small grocery store  later

     the store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny older
     mexican woman who is behind the counter  bobby enters

                       bobby

     bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming

                       woman
             oh  something to eat  si

     she holds up a pack of twinkies

                       bobby

             spanish  uh agua

     the old womans eyes widen  she starts to scream but quickly
     clamps her hands over her mouth  for a moment bobby thinks the
     woman is screaming at what he has said  then as if he feels a
     presence behind him bobby turns slowly to face the two
     toughlooking unshaven tattoocovered bikers  one holds a
     gun

                       biker

     bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back

     the woman goes to an oldfashioned cash register and rings it
     open  she hands the money to the biker

                       biker
             thats it  lady i got kids to put through

     the biker turns to bobby

                       biker
             okay pal  whatcha got give it now

     bobby pulls a thick wad of cash 1000 plus from his pant
     pocket tosses it on the counter

                       biker thumbing through it impressed
             nicejust whoare youbeautiful what
             else you got for papa

     bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet flings it to him

                       biker

                       biker

                       second biker

                       biker

                       biker contd
             he doesnt have to give me the bag

     the biker grabs bobbys bag bobby flinches in anticipation of a
     shot but refuses to let go of the bag  the biker swings the gun
     hard clipping bobby across the forehead  bobby falls against
     the counter and to the floor  the woman starts to scream the
     biker grabs up the pack then looking back at the woman sees a
     ring on her finger  he grabs her hand and pulls at the ring
     the woman screams wildly

                       second biker
             lets go man

                       biker

             just relax

                       woman
             no  no my wedding ring

     he pulls the ring from the womans finger and pushes her back
     with bobbys bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave

                       biker
             now we go

                       woman
             you go to el diablo

     from beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun the woman
     fires a shot that rips through the bag and into the back of the
     biker  he falls to the ground very dead amid a shower of
     blood and shredded money

                      second biker
             bugger you bitch

     the second biker now sees the money floating all over the place
     out of the torn bag his eyes go big with greed as he fires at
     the old woman who ducks behind the counter

     the biker grabs for the bag and whats left of the money not
     expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her second
     blast into him and the bag

     whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to
     shreds along with the bag and the biker who is very dead

     bobby is staggered crawls towards the shreds

                       woman cursing in spanish
             hijos de puta bayan a comer su propia
             mierda en el infierno translation sons
             of bitches go eat your own shit in hell

     she comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet
     and the 1000 cash roll from the dead bikers pants

                       woman

     bobby gives her some more cash she looks at him finally he
     gives her the entire wad

                       bobby

     bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white

                                                     fade to

     ext street  later

     bobby dazed and holding his head sits on the ground next to a
     spigot that is dripping water  he cups his hands under the
     water and splashes it against his face lightly wiping the cut
     above his eye the sheriffs car goes wailing by on the main
     drag recoiling from being spotted bobby tries to take another
     drink a scorpion crawls out of the faucet he jumps back

     ext harlins garage  later

     darrell is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine
     as bobby walks up

                       bobby

     darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of
     greasy bills he carries in his overalls

     bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or
     not to fight for the car then wheels and walks away

     darrell looks at him smirks

     bobby comes out of the mens room and sits at the end of the
     counter  he has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a
     mess he buries his face in the menu

                       bobby

     flo moves off

                       bobby
             and a waitress named flo  christ

     as bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him he
     hears from somewhere outside the diner the sound of a police
     radio crackling he now feels something against his foot  he
     looks down and sees a cat rubbing against his leg  he gives it
     a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech

                       bobby
             fucking cat

     in the background two teenagers sit at a booth  toby looks the
     part of a local wearing jeans and a white tshirt  his hair is
     cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school  his
     girl jenny is nondescript neither ugly nor beautiful she is
     the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look
     toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom  after he
     is gone jenny walks to bobby

                       jenny

     bobby looks at jenny then picks a quarter from his winnings and
     flips it to her he cant resist putting a little charm into it

     bobby sits for a beat he doesnt need a fight with toby now
     with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either he
     sits there

             be over real quick

     reluctantly bobby rises facing off against toby each clenching
     their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move
     the tension builds  we see it on the faces of jenny flo and
     the regulars  just then the record on the juke ends and the
     needle scratches off  there is the crackle of a police radio as
     the door to the diner opens and sheriff virgil potter walks in
     the tension eases toby mindful of the sheriff steps closer to
     bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear

                       toby
             youre lucky mister  dont think its

     bobby walks a bit going nowhere in particular  looking at his
     watch thinking of mr arkady he shields himself with one hand
     from the sun  at the side of an old building in the bit of
     shade it throws he twists at the beer cap which sticks and
     wont turn  bobby tries again twisting harder  too hard  as
     the cap jerkily twists off cutting into his hand as it rotates
     bobby yells in pain  at the same time the beer comes foaming
     from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve the bottle slips
     from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground emptying he
     clutches his bleeding hand pissed

                       bobby

     as if in answer a jeep drives by on the main street grace
     looks pretty hot up there in the drivers seat her eyes behind
     sunglasses flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she
     keeps going

     bobbys eyes throw back his own hostility at her but
     unfortunately she misses it as he now notices  across the

     signage reading mckennas realty co

     grace has stopped the jeep on a plateau  bobby sits beneath its
     shade while grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the
     heat vultures swoop above

             like it gets to me  he says he dont mind
             being nothing but a big fish in a small
             pond  more like a little fish in a dried
             up watering hole

                       bobby
             you could leave him

                       grace
             i dont know how

                       bobby
             walk away

                       grace
             its not that easy  maybe you can take
             chances maybe you can wander around like
             some stray wherever you please  i cant
             i dont want to be alone  i need to know
             im going to be taken care of

                       bobby
             you need a meal ticket is what you mean
             some guy you can latch onto just long
             enough for him to get you out of here

                       grace
             is that so bad  its not like i wouldnt
             try to make him happy  for awhile anyway
             i mean i would  do things for him  i
             guess im no good that way  i guess i
             tried to sucker you along like that  do
             you hate me for it  i wouldnt blame you
             if you did  but maybe its like you said
             you just got to do whatever it takes to get
             out

                       bobby soft echo
             whatever it takes

     grace steps to the edge of the plateau

                       grace
             i wish i was a bird  i know its stupid
             every child says that  when i was growing
             up some of the old ones on the reservation
             believed people could actually change into
             animals  i wish i could

     we see bobby behind grace  he stares at her standing on the
     edge of the plateau  he rises and walks towards her slowly but
     with deliberation

                       gracecont
             if i was a bird i would fly to florida to
             disney world  i always wanted to go there
             id fly to new york  maybe  i guess new
             york isnt the best place to be a bird
             id fly to st louis then new orleans all
             over texas  then id fly to california  i
             guess by then id have seen it all and i
             could die

     bobby now stands a few feet behind grace  she kicks a rock and
     watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness
     below

                       gracecont
             they say you dont feel anything  the
             shock kills you before you hit the ground
             i dont know how they would know that  but
             i heard its just like flying straight
             down into the ground  i guess if it
             doesnt hurt its a beautiful thing

     bobby tenses himself  sweat forms on his brow as he stands
     directly behind grace with his hands extended before him  they
     hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward
     suddenly grace wheels  startled by bobby she almost falls over
     the edge  bobby grabs her her weight still going back
     graces life is literally in his hands  she looks down at the
     ground far below then up into bobbys eyes  she shows no fear
     but instead wears a curious smirk

                       grace
             hates a funny thing  right now i bet you
             dont know if you want to kill me or fuck
             me

     bobby hesitates then pulls grace close and kisses her with
     great ardor on the lips

     ext apache leap  day

     on a blanket on the ground bobby and grace make love quickly
     hotly her dress pulled up his pants down but grace is
     troubled and pulls out further frustrating bobby

                       grace
             nostop  i cant

     her eyes withdraw into another dimension as she hikes her dress
     back up bobby comes out of his own head feels the distance
     between them

             whats the mattergrace

             dont feel like nothing

     he finishes relieving himself behind a tree puts his pants back
     on

                       grace
             get out of town bobby as quick as you

     bobby is quietly stunned a whole world has opened up to him
     and he isnt sure yet where the story ends there is some force
     at work here beyond his control

     in her voice

     bobby walks through the desert parallel to the road still in a
     rage desert insects produce a cacophony of drones buzzes and
     clicks a rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush a voice
     whispers to him

     the screen burns a bright white

     ext street corner  day

     in a news pot further down the street from where he was first
     seen the old blind man sits with his dead dog speaking as if
     into camera sipping on a dr pepper

     bobby is now revealed standing next to the blind man and we
     realize the blind man has been talking to him all along bobby
     sips a dr pepper as well

                       bobby

                       bobby
             that a fact

     bobby noticing now all the little newspaper clippings that the
     blind man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall

                       blind man
             i can see just fine  for example  youre
             a young man who thinks hes got someplace
             to be

             and everything is nothing too

                       bobby shakes his head
             maybe one day ill get to sit on a corner
             and spout wise

                       blind man
             think youll live that long

     bobby is clearly unnerved by this suddenly the blind man
     stands pissed and powerful sniffing the air with the police
     radio in it

     as sheriff potter cruises by glancing at bobby shrinking the
     car goes on up the street

                       blind man
             cocksucker motherfucker cops i hear you

     it sounds demented bobby checking him out to see if hes
     really blind walks quietly around him during this monologue and
     peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind mans real eyes
     although he thinks the blind man thinks hes on the other side
     of him the blind man fools him by suddenly swivelling around
     and cranking a gob of spit into bobbys face as if bobby were on
     the other side

     bobby pissed wipes the spittle from his face

                       blind man finishing
             but they gotta know you dont fuck
             around with indians

     bobby is in a rage  he turns to leave and walks a few paces
     he sees a wrench lying on a table  for a second his mind reels
     then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down
     on darrells head  he stops cold  because ol darrell holds a
     crowbar in a batters stance ready to smash it onto the mustang

                       darrell

             you  you want to smash something  so do

                       darrell
             mister you already pissed me off but good

     darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car and
     drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch

                       bobby about to lose it
             goddamn you  you son of a bitch

                       darrell
             there you go sweet talking me again

     darrell begins to laugh bobby desperate looks to the trunk
     thinking of his gun in there

     his pov  the trunk a flashback of the gun goes through his
     mind

                       bobby

     using his trunk key he tries to open it but realizes the lock
     has been changed

                       darrell
             you cant help yourself can you mister
             youre out of control

     darrell starts to laugh it is a repetitive almost demonic
     laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on
     bobbys anguished face

     ext street  day

     as bobby steps out into the glaring sun he notices down at the
     other end of the town graces jeep parked right outside the
     sheriffs office empty

     presently grace and the sheriff walk out talking and she gets
     in says a few last words and drives away

     bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet is she selling
     him out hes very confused turbulent

     int bus depot  later day

     bobby enters the bus depot  the interior is poorly lit  there
     are a few benches for people to wait on but they sit empty
     old faded travel posters hang on the wall  a bored female
     clerk is behind the counter

                       bobby

     hes so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression

     whole town

                       clerk

     she nods puts a closed sign in the ticket window disappears

     ext bus depot  late day

     we hear the crackle of the same police radio again off camera
     as bobby walks out of the depot ticket preciously held in his
     hand and suddenly reels as he sees sergei about a 100 yards
     down the main stretch slowly rolling into town in his
     convertible looking for guess who

                       bobby
             holy shit

     int sergeis car  simultaneous

     bobby turns away but not fast enough sergei spots him hits

             got you shitface bobby cooper bobby
             cooper

     ext main street  simultaneous

     bobby ducking around a corner hears the brief whoop of the
     sheriffs police siren he glances back

     his pov  sure enough the sheriffs having a field day hes
     just pulled sergei over at this distance we catch snippets of
     conversation as the sheriff ambles from his car checking
     sergeis outofstate plates

                       sheriff
             wheres the fire sweetheart dont know how

             looking town i not even moving

     we pop in closer to their conversation  bobby relishing this
     in his minds eye sergei is constantly looking off to where he
     last saw bobby but the sheriff strangely pays no attention to
     these looks

                       sheriff
             whoa what kind of accent you got there
             you one of them russians

             concealed is a definite no no in this

             i want my lawyer

     sheriff cuffs sergei and sticks him in the police car

     bobby cant help smiling as he turns away to the soda machine
     seen in an earlier scene

     he comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and dying
     for a drink in this heat inserts the coin though still under
     considerable pressure from all sides this lucky break with
     sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new
     today  some luck

     the icy cold soda bottle shoots out bobby raises it to his
     lips about to taste it about to relax for once violently it
     explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain
     from a kidney punch he stumbles forward into the soda machine
     gasping the legs of his assailant are close to him but the
     face is unseen

     bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the
     brunt of the blow into the machine reopening the wound blood
     starts to seep through the bandage

                       bobby
             ow

     bobby crumples to the ground as toby now towers over him with
     his fists curled and a snarl on his lips

                       toby

     tobys words drift to bobby from a million miles away  the
     world around him is like a dream or a nightmare  a primal rage
     wells inside of bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the
     soda bottle up out of nowhere across tobys head smashing him
     backwards then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on
     the boys face and head

     jenny screams

                       jenny
             stop it  youre killing him

     jenny grabs bobbys arm literally hanging all her weight on it
     stopping him from striking toby again

                       jenny
             youre killing him  toby  toby

     jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles toby  bobby stands  he
     looks at toby then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief his
     bandage is soaked with his own blood but his adrenaline numbs
     the pain

                       jenny
             you killed him you killed him

     she wails in the background as he backs away around the corner
     into main street crossing to where the phone booth is

     ext phone booth  late day

     bobby is on the phone

                       bobby

             youre what i want
                  then

             ive had nothing but time to think about
             it  it keeps coming back to you and me and

                       bobby

             flyfly like a bird

     grace bites at a nail and fidgets but says nothing

                       bobby vo
             grace  grace

                       grace
             after dark  ill leave the back door
             unlocked

     she quickly hangs up the phone

     bobby also hangs up the phone an unreadable expression on his
     face

     int mckenna living room  late day

     jake sits in an easy chair reading a paper  puffs of smoke from
     his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over
     his head  grace stands in the doorway body stiff and arms
     crossed staring at him

                       jake
             who was that on the phone

                       grace
             wrong number

                       jake
             you spent a long time talking for a wrong
             number  but then you make friends so
             easily  dont you grace

     grace has no answer for that so she says nothing  a long
     moment passes then

                       grace
             i put up new drapes jake

                       jake
             i know  i was here when your apprentice
             was helping you  remember

                       grace
             you never said anything  about the drapes

                       jake
             they look nice

                       grace
             you havent even looked at them once

     jake lowers the paper looks at the drapes

                       jake
             they look nice

                       grace
             i picked them out for you jake  i thought
             you would like the colors

                       jake softly admiring
             you look just like your mama when you move
             like that against the light

     grace stares at the chain now visible around jakes neck that
     disappears under his shirt  she knows that hidden there is a
     key and she fixes on it intently

                       jake
             what the hell you looking at girl

                       grace
             nothing jake  absolutely nothing

     ext desert  evening

     the sun is setting it strikes the horizon sending a ripple of
     golden light through the sky

     ext porch of house  evening

     a man dances in the evening light with a small child in his
     arms

     ext corner of house  evening

     a dog and cat huddle together in sleep

     ext police station  evening

     sheriff virgil potter is tossing horseshoes with his deputies

     ext mckenna house  evening

     grace watches the sun going down outside her house cradling
     herself in her arms a desert wind gently caresses her

     ext street corner  night

     the blind man along with his dead dog sits on the side of the
     street

                       blind man
             well thats it  suns going down  people
             go home trade stories over dinner
             theyll talk about the day about the heat
             laugh about something crazy it made them
             do  theyll kiss sleep a few hours then
             do it all over again

     bobby now appears next to the blind man holding two dr peppers
     he hands one to the blind man takes a sip of the other one and
     offers him his own change

                       bobby
             the day wasnt so bad  we all got through
             it all right

                       blind man giving back the change
             keep it

     theres a suggestion of cockiness in bobby feeling his luck
     coming back with the night his humour is enhanced by his pov
     down the street

     as darrell with his dilapidated truck readies sergeis
     convertible for towing

                       blind man over
             aint over yet  night is part of day
             separate but equal  night is when you let
             your guard down when you see things in the
             shadows and hear things in the dark

                       bobby

             night is when you want to sleep but the
             dry heat keeps you tossin and turnin
             its when you wish the sun was bakin high
             in the sky so you could see what it is
             youre afraid of

                       bobby

             twigs in a stream so enjoy the ride  is

             the joint now its a woman im hep to
             you

     the blind man slowly lifts his glasses showing his eyes at
     last where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh an ugly
     sight that even takes bobby back a step

                       blind man
             used to be a young smartass like you then
             i got smart with the wrong mans daughter

             to war heroes not fools all fools get is
             pity may not have eyes but i see and
             you boy

     the blind man puts his glasses back on

                       blind man
             you got my pity

                       bobby doesnt believe him
             hope she was worth it

                       blind man
             oh she was worth it  she was worth every
             black minute since

     bobby looks at his watch gets ready to go drops a coin into
     the blind mans cup

                       bobby
             times up any last words of wisdom

                       blind man
             things aint always the way they seem you
             got to ask yourself is it worth it day

             is youre doingare you a human being
             or just one of them hungry ghosts out there
             floatin around

     bobby walks away smiling

                       bobby
             youarecrazy you know be seeing you old
             man

                       blind man
             you know i wont be seeing you

     the blind man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cupas ifhe sees we dont really know he reaches into the cup and pulls
     out the coin bobby tossed in

                       blind man
             cheap bastard gives me back my own
             money well jesse times up lets go
             for a walk

     the blind man now stands up and pulls the seeingeye dogs
     harness the dog struggles to its feet and they walk off down
     the street together

     int mckenna house  night

     grace stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock jake
     yells to her from another room

                       jakeoc
             what the hell you doin grace  are you
             coming to bed or arent you

     for a moment graces hand wavers above the lock  suddenly like
     a snake striking her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt
     just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the
     bedroom

     ext yard  mckenna house  night

     a light is on in the bedroom window  after a moment it dims and
     the house is dark silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight
     bobby steps into frame carrying an iron pipe

     int mckenna housebedroom  simultaneous

     we start close on grace  a key slapping against her buttocks
     as bedsprings groan  we reveal grace copulating on all fours
     with jake from behind

                       jake
             ya little bitch you like it dont you you
             like it this way  rough and hard gotta

                       jake

             alone

                       grace
             no no please

     he hits her harder

     in a strange flashback of his mind he now sees graces mama
     beneath him receiving his punishment

     he stops abruptly he cant go on fear coming into his eyes
     he starts to whimper begging for his punishment andor
     forgiveness

                       jake
             oh baby im so sorry im so sorry
                  he starts to cry
             i didnt mean to hurt you so bad it
             justgot away

     he drops down burying his face between graces legs

                       jake
             forgive me baby forgive me

     he hides there from the world that he has created crying to
     himself

     grace has an unreadable expression but thats certainly not a
     new occurrence in their strange relationship

     int mckenna housebackdoor  night

     the knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens  bobby slips
     quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the
     door behind him  it is nearly pitch dark and he has no
     bearings  he steps gingerly through the hall but in the
     darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only
     to catch it just before it crashes into the floor

     int mckenna housebedroom  simultaneous

     jake hears the noise  he raises his head and cocks an ear to
     the air she knows who it is and is concerned hes too early

             maybemaybe the wind blew something over
             encouraging him to continue come on
             baby keep going

     jake climbs out of bed throwing on some pants reaching into a
     drawer in the chest of clothes pulling out a small dark
     metallic object

                       grace realizing
             whats that jake  wheres you get that

                       jake

                       grace

                       jake

     he maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor

     int living roommckenna house  simultaneous

     crowbar in one hand bobby makes his way slowly through the
     living room banging against the edge of a table he hops
     silently in pain then waits at the door to the next room and
     listens  hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the
     darkness  a moment later bobby backs from the door and we see
     the barrel of his own black 9mm baretta pressed against his
     forehead  jake appears now backing him into the living room
     he switches on a lamp

                       jake

             didnt expect to be seeing the like of you

     bobby turns to jake who is suddenly extremely upset

             how the hell did you know where the
             bedrooms at

             her but killing hers one thing fucking

     suddenly jake swings his arm clipping bobby across the side of
     the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash

     bobby crumbles to his knees crying out

     jake suddenly grabs bobby by the hair forcing his face back and
     smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss the blood
     from bobbys wound runs down to his lips and mixes with jakes
     lips

                       jakenowyouve tastedbothof us

     he pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at bobbys
     head bobby sees it coming plays his last card on his knees

             what happened

     int living room  simultaneous

     like an old rag jake gradually soaks all this up becoming
     heavier with the weight of the knowledge

                       jake

     bobby goes

     int hallway  simultaneous

     grace bolts back to the bedroom the camera following her as she
     flies

     int bedroom hallway  night moments later

     bobby walks it his pov  the door every step seems freighted

     int bedroom  simultaneous

     grace is in a quandary how many seconds before bobby walks in
     to kill her or can he really kill her shes not sure

     she looks around the room frantically picks up a lamp puts it
     down she looks quickly through her closet rummages below in
     the boxes suddenly she finds it

     a dangerous looking indian hatchet with a feather hanging off
     its bindings its a formidable piece of iron quite capable of
     splitting a skull or impaling flesh

     grace hears the footsteps just outside the door she runs behind
     the door

     a moment later the bedroom door creaks open and bobby quietly
     enters approaching the bed we sense the doubt in his eyes as
     to whether he can kill her

     in a reverse pov bobby sees the outline of grace in the bed as
     victimcloser closer  he now lifts the edge of the bedcover
     but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure

     he suddenly hears a foot fall behind him then he feels her
     presence he spins

     shesdirectly behind him hatchet raised his life is in her
     hands

     his eyes locked in an eternal moment

     her eyes the hatchet

                                                     snap cut to

     int hallway  simultaneous

     as jake anxiously torn waits there is a loud crash followed
     by sounds of struggle of murder of death then

                       grace
             jake

     it is a desperate cry for help jake cant help himself he
     breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved

                       jake
             grace

     int bedroom  simultaneous

     jake bulls into the bedroom its a mess furniture overturned
     sheets and blankets all over the floor the lights broken
     waiting for him face down on the floor is bobbys body in a
     pool of liquid a broken bottle lies nearby bobbys body heaves
     in its final death throes and then shudders quiet  over
     there by the bed is grace who still clutches the hatchet
     the look on her face is pure shock

                       jake
             welllooks like you got him grace
             thats goodthats real good  he must of
             slipped past me but you got him  looks
             like that drifter from this morning  got
             to be careful who you make friends with
             sweetheart

     jake eyes the weapon in graces hand

                       jake
             why dont you put that down its all over
             now  put it down

     grace eyes the gun in jakes hand

                       jake
             go on girl  put it down

     what choice does grace have  she lets the hatchet clank to the
     floor

                       jake
             aww thats my grace  not about to let
             someone get the best of her  thats what i
             love about you  as dangerous as you are
             unpredictable

     behind jake the lifeless bobby rises up from the floor very
     much alive and clobbers jake with a golf club jake is
     staggered but hes one tough old customer as he manages to spin
     slowly gun still in one hand as if to fire

     before he can grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and
     drives it straight into his back

     he gurgles stunned from both sides but its like trying to
     kill rasputin he still has the gun as bobby jumps him from the
     rear trying to get his neck in a chokehold the gun fires once
     discharging into the wall the hatchet is ripped from his back

     grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged
     rodeotype fight jake seeking to dislodge bobby off his back
     an expression of fear and excitement in her eyes

     finally the two men go crashing to the ground rolling around
     bobby maintaining his stranglehold but calling to her his
     hands full

                       bobby
             grace goddamit do something

     jakes eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale pleading for
     help

                       jake
             grace

     she commits jumping into the fray its not clear whose side
     shes really on as the three of them roll across the floor
     strangling biting hitting spitting scratching gasping its
     a guignol but the pressure from bobbys forearm is taking its
     toll on jake trying to bite jake grace bites bobby instead
     but then she scratches jakes face jake is grabbing her hard as
     bobby chokes him trying to use her to leverage himself away
     but she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on
     her knees across the floor

     she grabs the hatchet and stands moving back towards the two
     men locked on the floor bobby looks up at her hatchet in hand
     no longer sure which way shell go

     jake however gasping for air eyes bulging spittle dripping
     from his mouth looks at grace with some inner certainty that
     she will help him he gasps the words

                       jake
             help me grace help

                       grace
             like you helped her jake

     grace stands there deciding the power of the hatchet in her
     hands she raises it suddenly over the two men

     it flashes downwards deep into the gut of her husband jake
     almost transfixing him to the floor

     in the silence that follows jakes eyes roll up to meet hers
     but all she has for him is a cold distant stare

     jakes head drops as the life rushes out of him bobby falls
     back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat

                       bobby
             what the helld you wait for

     she doesnt answer turbulence in her face he rolls jakes body
     off upset she may have made it a murder but he was part of
     it and he feels the shift in himself theyre both in new
     territory feeling an apartness between them

     suddenlyjake gasps still alive it is too much for bobby he
     grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on jake silencing him one
     last time

     grace is pushing the bed away from the wall slipping down on
     her knees and prying open several floorboards

                       grace
             the moneys right here get the key

                       bobby
             no you get it

     he doesnt want to get close to jake grace coldly runs over to
     his corpse ripping the chain key and all from the neck the
     action pulls jakes head up then she lets it thump back on the
     floor she runs back to the floorboards

     the top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed

     bobby watches  his whole life it seems hanging on the
     outcome

     with the key she opens the safe inside are rolledup bundles
     of cash  in hundred dollar denominations she looks up at him
     offering it as she reaches in for more bobby also gets down on
     his hands and knees and grabs more and more sucked into the
     fever of freedom far more money than he lost at the grocery
     store overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom

     they see each other

                       grace
             didnt i tell you

                       bobby plunging into the cash
             there must be 150 200 thousand here
             goddamnit grace you were right

                       grace
             we done it bobby oh my god

     they laugh excitedly and start kissing rolling in the stacks of
     cash some of which sticks to bobbys sweating back the day
     didnt turn out so bad after all for bobby

                       grace
             fuck me baby

                       bobby looking at jake
             what about him

                       grace
             let him watch i want him to know what hes
             missing

     as they consummate their violent relationship for the first
     time jakes lifeless eyes watch them

     ext mckenna house  later night

     the light in the bedroom window is low candlelight but we sense
     something watching them graces silhouette moves across a
     window

     bobby now comes out of the house cautious walking down the
     driveway

     he stops thinks and walks back to open the hood of graces jeep

     he reaches into the engine and disconnects something then
     closes the hood and walks on

     ext harlins garage  night

     bobby walks up to the shack near the garage and bangs on the
     door a light goes on in the window  darrell shouts out

                       darrell oc

     bobby in a hurry to get back should grace pull any tricks

     darkness and land on an empty patch where graces jeep had been
     parked  bobby jumps from the mustang and runs around
     frantically his look is devastated he falls to his knees
     about to sob when

     grace opens the front door and pokes her head out putting out
     several suitcases

     ext mckenna house  later night

     bobbys mustang is backed towards the front of the house  we
     see a silhouette of bobby and grace carrying something wrapped
     in a blanket and dumping it in the trunk

     ext desert highway  night

     a lone pair of headlights illuminate the night as the mustang
     cruises through the dark  as the lights brighten the screen we

                                                         fade to

     intext mustang  night

     grace sits next to bobby peering out the windshield clutching
     the money in a backpack shes humming an indian song

                       bobby

     a sign illuminated by the headlights  it reads  you are
     leaving superior  thanks for visiting

                       grace

             there

                       grace
             what are you talking about

                       bobby emotional
             when i got back from the garage and your
             jeep wasnt there i thought youd gone and
             left me and taken the money
                  off her look

     she responds with a luminous smile

                       grace
             i love you bobby

     he looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes

                       bobby
             were gonna pull this off grace

     just then a headlight rakes them from the rear as we hear
     again the ominous crackle of a police radio and the short
     brutal whoop of the siren as sheriff potters vehicle rolls
     up quickly behind them graces face is caught like a surprised
     deer in the headlamps

                       grace
             oh my god
                  then
             dont stop

     bobby is in a bind the siren whoops again the lights flash to
     highbeam

                       bobby
             he mustve seen us swerving on the road
             thats all just gonna give us a ticket for
             swerving

     but even bobby has trouble believing that as the police vehicle
     pulls out sharply alongside his and sheriff potter motions to
     him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder

                       sheriff into loudspeaker
             pull over goddamnit pull over

                       grace

                       bobby starts
             evening sheriff sorry bout that but this
             jackrabbit

     bobby has no time to react as the sheriff is suddenly there at
     his window jerking his door open angry a gun in his hand
     pointed at them his eyes on grace

                       sheriff

     a pause

                       bobby
             and us grace what do we deserve

                       grace crying quietly to herself
             nin chonk nin chonk my mama used to say
             in apache your worst is doing this to

             gotten away it begins cause you never get
             away

     bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road can he still
     love her she seems to be reading his thoughts like she said
     she could

                       grace
             its easy to judge someone else when you
             dont know nothing about it im apache
             bobby you dont eat what i eat you dont
             see what i see dont judge me

     a silence two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through
     the strangeness of an arizona desert at night

                       bobby
             i dont want to think anymore

                       grace quietly
             then drive

     the lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness

                                                the sun comes up

     ext canyon  end spot  dawn

     in the vast reaches of a deserted canyon where vultures circle
     in a hot white sky we find the mustang parked at the edge of a
     drop we hear the sound of a body being dragged

                       dj vo

             fast but the way it hit the semi it wont

                       bobby over
             right there drop it there i got it

     bobby is giving grace instructions as they drop sheriff virgil
     potters corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below

                       grace
             see ya virgil god bless

     bobby pushes him over his hand hurting the body crashes below
     its hard work they head back for the mustang to retrieve
     jakes body in the popped trunk but grace notices bobby
     glancing at the baretta now tucked in her waist

     the silence is tense between them the rocks and gravel
     crunching under their shoes as they walk

                       grace indicates the gun
             is this whats bothering you bobby

                       bobby
             no grace my hands bothering me

                       grace
             you think now that jakes dead theres all
             that money there and i dont need you
             anymore and i might just sneak up behind
             you sometime andpop

     she pulls an imaginary trigger on bobby mimicking the recoil of
     a gun bobby is nervous

                       grace
             dont you think i wouldve done it if i wanted
             to what can i do to make you relax baby

                       bobby
             you could give me my gun back

     grace smiles

                       grace
             why dont we just finish what we started

     she stares down at jake she cant help feeling some old
     feelings as bobby walks back to the front of the car turns off
     the annoying radio he watches as she softly prays over jake
     whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled

                       grace after a moment with jake
             what do you think happens to someones
             spirit when they die

                       bobby
             i think nothing happens youre dead meat
             thats it

                       grace
             you dont believe in anything do you
             bobby

                       bobby
             i believe in this moment thats all there
             is nothing else
                  lifting jake by the shoulder
             come on he must weigh 300 pounds

     grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his
     move quickly closing on her when shes off guard he slams her
     hard in the face coldly sending her sprawling to the ground
     dazed

     he steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist checks it

     she puts her hand to her mouth feels the blood on her finger
     tips she looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts
     into bobby like a knife

                       grace
             you hit me bobby you hit a woman you
             motherfucker didnt your momma ever teach
             you anything

     her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing her
     calm is extraordinary as if expecting to die

                       grace
             well

     for a moment bobby does nothing then he slips the gun through
     his belt

                       bobby
             well nothing we dump jake we split the
             money then youre on your own

                       grace

                       bobby

     bobbys got a headache now its too much to understand too

             i think youre a lying backstabbing
             psycho bitch and one day youll kill me
             but its nice to know you cared

     the expression on graces face changes as rapidly as the desert
     weather a coldness passing over and through her

                       grace
             you dont know your own mind it blocks
             your heart

     keeping a wary eye on grace bobby starts hauling jake out of
     the trunk

                       bobby
             give me a hand

     he wrestles jake up to a sitting position he grabs a can of
     beer from a warm sixpack in the trunk and shoves it into a
     pocket of jakes coat

                       bobby
             poor old jake a few drinks a fight with
             the sheriff over his wife and both of em
             ended up dead

     grace takes his boots

                       bobby
             time to go for a walk jake

                       grace
             my mother died in this canyon

                       bobby
             save the mom routine will ya grace it
             doesnt work with me one two three

     they lift the corpse and with great effort haul it towards the
     edge of the drop as they pause on the way bobby wary of
     graces strange coldness tries to soften the blow of
     separation

                       bobby
             look its not so bad we split up it might
             be months before they find these guys if
             at all i mean with the mountain lions
             around here remember if they cant find

             youll meet someone else you know theres
             a lot of hope with a 100000

     they lift jake again and move to the edge

                       grace
             hope is a fourletter word

                       bobby
             but we all need that too hold him

     he props jake at the edge standing and transfers the weight
     onto grace jakes head is on her shoulder

                       bobby
             you make a pretty couple

     it seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun
     wipes it of his prints and slips it through jakes belt

                       bobby
             won this in a poker game in reno god knows
             who its registered to  you shoulda been
             more careful jake see you later

     as he takes jakes weight off grace and pushes it over the drop

     grace watches him go her eyes shifting to bobby his back
     momentarily to her also watching she moves towards him

     bobby turns slips on the edge

                       bobby
             now all we got to do is tryand

     he feels a blur of motion almost like a bird and he is
     fallingfalling his life coming to an end

     grace is standing somewhere up above briefly seen did she push
     him he doesnt know

     hes stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of jake
     and virgil he screams out in sharp pain his leg feels broken
     but he is alive

     grace walks away cutting it all off deeply shaken she must
     get away from the past and all these hollow men she closes the
     trunk of the mustang gets in the drivers seat reaches for the
     ignition key her hand fumbles for it a moment it isnt there

                       grace
             shit

     she sits there bobby is calling from below

                       bobby
             grace help me grace we been through
             too much together  weve only had one day

     she finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff
     looks down

             thank you thank you ii knew you
             wouldnt leave me grace

             bobby the trunkits locked throw the
             keys up to me ill get the rope

     bobbys eyes pass over jake a few feet away his eyes staring
     upwards in death they take in the gun still attached to his
     waist he knows the trunk wasnt locked when they took jake out

                       bobby
             i cant throw that far you got to climb
             down here and get the keys you can make
             it its the only way grace

     grace looks down at the drop  its a tough descent but she
     knows she could make it and get back up as well

                       bobby
             graceplease grace  you have to help
             me

     grace takes a look around

                       grace
             okay im coming calm down

     she starts down the cliff face as she descends he talks
     deliriously

                       bobby off
             i knew youd help me i knew you wouldnt
             leave me baby cause were tied together
             too close we belong together always

     grace makes it to the bottom of the drop and walks cautiously
     towards bobby

                       grace yelling back echoing
             bobby dont flip out on me i cant do
             this alone i know you dont trust me but

     shes heading for the body of jake and the gun bobby knows
     that and is already crawling there

                       bobby as he crawls
             theyre right here grace  the keys  come
             get me out of here know why else i could
             never leave you

                       bobby
            cause i love you

     inching closer

     closer they meet at the apex of jakes corpse

                       grace
             and i love you too

                       bobby
             and loves a funny thing  sometimes i
             dont know if i want to love you

     grace leans close to bobby  he dangles the keys out in front of
     her but she doesnt reach for them her eyes go to bobby she
     reaches for him at that instant bobbys hands shoot out and
     clamp hard around her  a sharp gurgle is all that escapes grace
     as bobby twists the life from her as jake leers up at them

                       bobby
             or kill you

     grace twists and flails in bobbys hands but in spite of his
     bleeding stump he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly

                       bobby
             i love you grace buti just cant trustyou

     she looks at him trying to protest shaking her head graces
     flailing goes into overdrive somewhere in his semidelirious
     state bobbys eyes might notice the gun at jakes waist is no
     longer there

     grace manages one word

                       gracejake

                       bobby
             hecanthelp you now honey

     bobby is in agony as he kills her part beast part lover he
     kills that which he loves

     suddenly a shot is heard bobby buckles with the blast hit in
     the side he kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his
     hands breaking her neck

     bobby looks down at jakes gun which she clutches in her hand
     and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows
     from it  he manages to stand looks at jake their bodies lying
     side by side

     bobby with great difficulty claws his way back up the rocks to
     the car his fastflowing wound staining the white rocks with
     blood

     he makes it to the top and losing more blood climbs into the
     drivers seat he checks the money in the bag all there all
     his

     as he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side the vultures
     circle perhaps one smarter than the others lands close by it
     spooks bobby but hes okay he looks in the mirror

                       bobby
             youre still lucky

     he puts the key in the ignition the engine comes to life

                       bobby waves back
             adios 

     suddenly the radiator hose darrell installed blows apart
     loudly bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a
     cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood he shakes his
     head frustrated

                       bobby sighs
             oh shitthen arizona

     he cant help but laugh at his bad luck as we rise off the
     desert floor and take flight with the vultures eventually
     leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of
     arizona



                            the end
