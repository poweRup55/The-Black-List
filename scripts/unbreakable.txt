               begins to lull his eyes closed beat

               davids head bounces lightly against the window

               the shaking of the glass never allows davids eyes to 
               completely close

               he sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger

               girl is no longer watching him

               david looks to the passengers across from him he sees the 
               ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as

               their side of the train starts to rise

               the passengers scream as the amtrak passenger train begins 
               to tilt off the track

                                                                    cut to

               david follows the urgent sounds of activity to a prep area 
               directly across from him

               he can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn 
               curtain a group of emergency room personnel are treating a 
               man whose body is twitching violently on a gurney

               one of the group is a man who glances through the opening in 
               the curtain he notices david sitting up from across the 
               room

               the man in scrubs leaves the group and walks over

               fair elijah follows the voices he carries the stuffed 
               animals through the crowds of people click

               click click his metal brace sounds as he walks

               for a moment he sees nothing but bodies all around him

               he emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a 
               turnstile

               a man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets 
               and waves them in

               elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile

               the hurricane

               he watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup
               like seat they pull the metal bars down in front of them

               the man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile

               elijah stares up at the multicolored sign beat he moves 
               quickly ducks under the turnstile and climbs onto the 
               platform

               elijah finds and empty circular seat he slips inside the 
               gray metal compartment and sits he pulls down the rusted 
               metal bar in front of him

               he looks around at all the excited faces his eyes fill with 
               excitement too

               his small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the 
               compartment his expression changes

               elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms he presses 
               them to check their softness he places the stuffed animals 
               on either side of him on the seat hes wedged in between 
               them feels good

               he reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front 
               of him elijah looks a little anxious beat

               he pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar it 
               goes around twice before he ties the arms together he checks 
               its softness

               elijah looks around the customized cuplike compartment he 
               sits in he smiles an eight year old smile of pride

               and then he hears his mothers voice

               he searches around and finds her walking in the waves of 
               people he hears her calling

                                     mother
                         elijah

               she moves in his direction by chance she finds herself at 
               the entrance to the hurricane ride she looks up at the sign 
               above the turnstile her worried eyes immediately start 
               searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments

               her eyes meet elijahs he waves her face goes very still

               a huge roar of machinery as the ride starts up

               elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running

                                     elijah
                         i wont get hurt momma im safe

               his words get eaten up by the cheers of the teenagers and 
               the grind of machinery

               the platform spins he sees a glimpse of his mother and the 
               red and white striped man shes pointing at elijah

               the platform turns elijah sees a flash of the red and 
               white striped mans angered face as he yells at the frantic 
               woman next to him

               and then the ride speeds up

               the gray circular seats start to spin on their own the 
               teenagers cheer

               elijahs eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his 
               face

               suddenly the ride changes directions the cuplike seats get 
               jerked everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on

               elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his 
               right it cushions him and then falls to the floor of the 
               compartment along with the other stuffed animal

               elijahs expression becomes tense as his compartment spins

               his hands slide over the rusted metal bar as the sweater 
               unravels

               elijah looks around a sudden panic enters his eyes

               the blurring image of his mother now in a group of red and 
               white striped men

               the sound of machinery grinding is heard as the ride changes 
               directions suddenly

               elijahs hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to 
               the side of the compartment his shoulder and arm takes the 
               brunt of the impact we hear something crack

               teenagers scream in excitement elijah joins them with screams 
               of his own

               the ride spins its passengers elijahs small face looks up 
               at the swirling clouds in a mixture of agony and terror

               the ride changes directions

               elijah is thrust forward he hits the rusted metal bar square 
               against his chest

               we hear more cracks

               the world spins giggles and yells fill the air elijah slumps 
               down onto the floor of the compartment

               and then finally the grind of the machinery slows and then 
               comes to a gradual stop

               the teenagers moan

               elijah is facing directly up at the sky the clouds now move 
               slowly over him

               we hear commotion agitated voices his mothers desperate 
               voice

                                     mother os

               her voice gets louder as she moves closer to the platform

                         elijah baby

               then her face appears as she finds the cuplike seat elijah 
               is in she begins to scream

               elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment one arm is 
               clutching his chest the other is curved horrifically like 
               an s his mouth is open his eyes are bulging the last 
               thing we here are the short desperate breaths of an eight 
               year old child about to black out from the pain

               to react a storm of camera movement as the group jockeys 
               for the best angle of his troubled face

               the word security on the back has almost faded away we 
               can barely see davids face under the hood

               there is a football game in progress on the enormous field

               the players seem unusually small there is no one in the 
               stands about four hundred people are on the sidelines of 
               the field watching the players a soggy limping banner 
               stretched behind them declares the pennslvania elementary 
               school championships

               davids eyes scan the tiny figures on the field his eyes 
               come rest on a surge of activity on the sidelines beat

               just a foot away

               jerry nods to himself looks like hes going to say something 
               instead he lunges forward and smashes a headbutt to the man 
               who spoke to him

               david tackles jerry hard and fast he drives him into the 
               ground

               blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who 
               took the headbutt

               the other fathers start yelling and pushing each other

               the remaining security guard calls on his walkie for 
               assistance

               david keeps jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head 
               lock that holds the mans enraged face hard into the wet 
               surface of the field

               davids eyes are not on jerry they gaze out onto the field 
               where twenty two elementary school boys have stopped playing 
               and are standing frozen helmets off rain washing over their 
               faces they watch in horror as their parents attack each 
               other on the sidelines

               on a walking stick

               hes looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a 
               wall two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked 
               in fierce battle one figure is extremely muscular with a 
               mask the other is half human half animal

                                     man
                         this is from fritz champions own 
                         library this is before the first 
                         issue of the comic book hit the stands 
                         in 1968

               then back to the sketch

                                     elijah
                         its a classic depiction of good 
                         versus evil notice the square jaw 
                         of slayer  common in most comic 
                         book heroes and the slightly 
                         disproportionate size of jaguaros 
                         body to his head this again is 
                         common but only in villains the 
                         thing to notice about this piece 
                         the thing that makes it very very 
                         special is its realistic depiction 
                         of its figures when the characters 
                         eventually made it into the magazine 
                         they were exaggerated as always

                         there are probably only four or five 
                         individuals in the world who can 
                         claim more knowledge of comics than 
                         myself ive spent a third of my 
                         life in a hospital bed with nothing 
                         else to do but read i have studied 
                         the form intimately i have seen the 
                         patterns in them the references 
                         to social and cultural events and 
                         the atmosphere that surrounded them 
                         ive come to believe that comics are 
                         our last link to the ancient way of 
                         passing on history the egyptians 
                         drew pictures on walls about battles 
                         and events countries all around the 
                         world still pass on knowledge through 
                         pictorial forms
                              beat
                         i believe that comics just at their 
                         core now have a truth they are 
                         depicting what someone somewhere 
                         felt or experienced then of course 
                         that core got chewed up in the 
                         commercial machine and gets jazzed

               in his hands

               jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over davids 
               legs

               david doesnt blink as he gazes at the headline silently

               stirs but doesnt wake up

               david moves to the darkness of the corner of the room he 
               opens a closet door

               a naked hanging bulb goes on as david yanks a chain david 
               steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly 
               so the light from the bulb doesnt fall on jeremy

               theres just enough room to stand and look around david 
               reaches up and pulls a small travel bag out of the way

               david stretches as he feels on the top shelf

               his hand comes down with something wrapped in a tshirt

               he unwraps it its a handgun

               he stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and 
               replacing it to the highest shelf

               he stretches even more reaches farther back we hear 
               something slide on the shelf as he pulls it forward

               he pulls down a folder jammed with clippings he opens the 
               folder to reveal a young david in football uniform holding 
               his helmet in the air victoriously the word champion is 
               written over his head david flips through the top clippings 
               all are images and stories of david and football

               he turns the pile over goes to the last clipping this piece 
               of paper is folded over three times unlike the others he 
               opens it

               its a newspaper headline it reads

               david puts the new headline next to the old one they look 
               like a set even the font is similar

               david stares at the old headline stares hard at the photo 
               of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in 
               the middle of the highway the bulb seems to flicker

               david is utterly still

               someone knocks at the bedroom door david gets startled

               he puts back the clippings stuffing the new one inside with 
               them he replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the 
               closet

                         simple as instinct like being able 
                         to touch someone and tell whether 
                         theyve done something wrong or 
                         the level of what theyve done wrong

                         or he might have been carrying a 
                         silver handled gun tucked in his 
                         pants

               davids walkie erupts with noise

                                     david

                         there anyone else involved

               the two men stand very still in the tunnel

                                     david
                         yes my wife megan she was in the 
                         car with me

               david turns and starts down the hall david talks back over 
               his shoulder

                                     david
                         have a good life elijah and try to 
                         buy your tickets at an authorized 
                         sales location

               elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of david dunne jogs 
               down the darkness of the tunnel

                                                                    cut to

               int car  late afternoon

               we are inside a customized car the dashboard is covered in 
               some sort of thin foam padding the steering wheel and gear 
               shift have the same padding every corner and hard surface 
               has been safe guarded elijah sits behind the wheel of his 
               car in the parking lot of the stadium he sits as thoughts 
               crash at his head beat

               he finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car he 
               looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green 
               army jacket pass behind his car

               elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the 
               parked cars heading out of the parking lot

               elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine

                                                                    cut to

               ext parking lot  late afternoon

               elijahs walking stick makes rhythmic clicks on the concrete 
               parking lot

               the figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away 
               with every step

               elijah starts breathing harder he pushes himself to move 
               faster he avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that 
               jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the 
               lot

               he gains on the army jacket

                                     elijah
                              calls out
                         hold up for a second

               the man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway 
               entrance that marks the end of the parking lot he looks 
               back at elijah for a beat doesnt like what he sees he 
               disappears into the subway entrance

               elijah quickens into a jog now he hasnt done this in a 
               while and its painful

               he makes it with great strain to the subway

               he looks into the entrance

               a steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor the tail 
               of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears

               elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing

                                     elijah
                         i just want to ask you something

               elijahs voice echoes down the stairs no response

               elijah starts his descent

               the sound of a subway pulling in roars up the stairs

               elijah has to move fast he takes the steps with less and 
               less hesitation hes moving with great agility and then 
               his foot catches on a step

               his hand slips away from the railing

               he falls down the remaining part of the stairs the first 
               sickening crack is heard when his hand reaches out to stop 
               his fall

               the second crack is more like a crunch as his leg lands 
               awkwardly on the metal stairs

               he comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor 
               of the subway landing his jaw is locked in a

               horrific scream that gets eaten by the roar of the subway 
               train pulling in

               his contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway 
               upside down the green army jacketed man looks back at elijah 
               with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile

               the last thing elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail 
               of the mans coat riding up as he move through the turnstile 
               the silver handle of a gun peeks out from the belt of his 
               pants

                                                                    cut to

               ext bus stop  dusk

               davids neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an 
               end the septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high 
               school david steps off still in his security clothes the 
               bus pulls away as he hears his sons voice

               david turns to the high school football field behind him

               a group of children are having a touch football game

               jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to david

                                     jeremy
                         was it sold out

               david nods no

                         if she knew you were playing football

               david looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age 
               man in sweats who stands with the other children

                                     jeremy

               looks down at his son who waits patiently

                                                                    cut to

               the basement is dominated by storage boxes and christmas 
               decorations an old bench press and weights are in a cluttered 
               corner

               david sits and turns at the end of the bench as jeremy 
               laboriously carries and places fifteen a pound weight on the 
               bar david talks over his shoulder

                                     david

                         from here youve been a big help

               jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to 
               put on another weight

                                     jeremy

                         good for you and you worked out 
                         everyday for a year

               jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on 
               the barbell and comes around to davids end of the bench

               david lays back

                                     david
                         no

               david takes hold of the barbell beat he takes a deep breath

               the weight comes off the armrests of the bench david lowers 
               it to his chest and pushes it back up he does just one more 
               rep with serious strain he puts the weight back on the 
               armrest and sits up

                         how much did you put on there

               david twists around and looks back at the barbell he counts 
               up the black metal circles he turns back to jeremy

                                     david

               david looks back at the weights

                         finish up

               jeremy starts back to the barbell

                         ill take it off ill help you right

               he slips off the safety collar

                         you think you could have beaten up 
                         bruce lee

               david hears the sound of the weights sliding off the bar 
               behind him

                                     david

                         you were really mad at him

               jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights 
               and comes around to david

               david lays back

                                     david

               it and lowers it two time it takes a sizable effort the 
               weights bang down onto the armrest

               he counts the black discs on the steel bar beat

               nobody says anything for a long time

                                     jeremy

               davids fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar he 
               leans his head forward and looks to jeremy

                                     david
                         why dont you move back a bit just 
                         to be safe

               jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to 
               the house he waits

               another deep breath as david heaves the weight clinks as it 
               comes off the arm rest david is full out straining now as 
               he lowers and raises it his arms begin to tremble as he 
               lifts it for the second time bang the weight lands back 
               safely onto the rest

               an enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar davids 
               hands are gripping the metal

               he talks to jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom 
               of the stairs without looking at him

                                     david

               takes one last breath clink the weights comes off the rest 
               his arms are trembling immediately now his face is locked 
               in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back 
               up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest

               he slowly sits up

                                     david
                         how many did you put on that time

               his basement

                                     david

               int basement  early evening

               a set of two unopened mab satin finish paint cans are dangling 
               by their metal handles on the outside of each side of the 
               weights

               the fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of 
               davids chest his arms are shaking hard he raises the weight 
               to its apex and brings it down again it touches his chest 
               and rises up again davids red strained face exhales 
               powerfully as he straightens his arms

               the bar lands on the armrest with a crash the paint cans 
               make metal squeaks as they swing to stillness one at a time 
               beat

               david sits up and turns back to the weights his mouth moves 
               as he calculates the discs and the cans

               his lips stop moving beat

                                     jeremy

                         when you work with clients on 
                         machines do they sometimes just 
                         jump up a level or two do something 
                         they didnt know they were capable 
                         of

                         not often but it is possible most 
                         people get scared when they see the 
                         shadow of their limits they dont 
                         know how long the shadow really is 
                         they dont know how far away the 
                         real limits are standing they 
                         stop out of fear

               yes to megan

               int stadium locker room  late morning

               david dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double 
               doors that leads into the players locker room

               three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers 
               one side of the room has benches and massage tables the far 
               end of the room has work out equipment

               about twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout 
               the spacious room lost in their own pregame rituals

               david watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on 
               the massage table and removes his dress shirt his body is 
               covered in old bruises he lays down wincing a bit from the 
               pain a trainer begins to massage him

               david just stares at the battered athlete his gaze moves 
               across the room beat

               david stares at something in the crowded room then he starts 
               towards it

               he moves through the room of players and trainers he moves 
               to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone

               david comes to a step at the foot of an olympic bench press 
               racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press

               david looks down at the thick silver bar three large black 
               plates are on either side six in all

               david looks back and glances at the double doors where he 
               should be standing beat he looks to the twenty or so players 
               and trainers in the room some of the players have headphones 
               on some are staring into space a couple are on cell 
               phones

               no one notices david dunne as he reaches for a fortyfive 
               pound black plate off the weight rack

               the huge disc slides onto the bar with almost no sound

               a matching fortyfive pound disc goes on the other side

               and then david adds another he matches it on the other 
               side

               the bench creaks just the slightest bit as david takes a 
               seat

               no one notices the security guard lay back on the bench

               davids hands take hold of the shiny bar

               he closes his eyes

               davids arms become tense he pushes against the weight

               it doesnt move

               his face turns deep red he opens his eyes and stares at the 
               bar as he keeps training his face and arms are shaking 
               he keeps staring focusing

               and then without any fanfare the bar lifts off the arm 
               rest

               the weight hovers over david he lowers it to his chest for 
               a second time his arms arent shaking anymore he pushes 
               the weights back up

               he carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest it touches 
               down with the smallest of clinks

               davids fingers uncurl from the bar

               david lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick 
               black discs

                                     david

               david sits on the edge of the tub his shirt is unbuttoned

               he sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor

               his eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on 
               its side under one of the sinks

               david rises and picks it up

               its a box of band aids david looks up to megans sink

               looking across to his own identical mirrored medicine cabinet

               there are three things on the shelf disposable razors 
               shaving cream and cologne

               davids mouth opens just a little bit as he stares

               poncho the word security is almost faded away

               he opens and closes the front door with virtually no sound

               about forty feet a fenced gate with a lock stops his 
               progress

               david looks through the fence down to the tracks just to 
               the side is a construction site cranes and lifts and various 
               equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train 
               wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for 
               dismantling and salvaging the bent shapes of the train pieces 
               can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness 
               hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station

               beat a huge metallic crack echoes through the train yard as 
               david kicks open the fence door that holds him back from 
               going down

               frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain

               david walks along the body of the cavedin passenger car

               the passenger car is split in two just before the tear 
               along the window line the windows have been crushed in

               a huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the 
               ravaged interior

               david stands before this heavily damaged area of the car

               he just stares at the wreckage water falls off the rim of 
               his hood in front of his face

               his eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal

               he takes a couple slow breaths as the sounds of harsh rain 
               fade away to silence

                                                                    cut to

               top of a street

               the sound of distant fire comes into the silence

               a twenty year old david dunne rises to his feet from the 
               ground where he was laying amongst the fragmented pieces of 
               windshield he looks down at himself his football jacket is 
               torn so are his jeans hes trembling slightly but not 
               bleeding

               he looks up towards the noises

               about thirty feet away is a honda upside down wrapped around 
               a telephone pole its front is on fire

               through one of the crushed door windows we see a womans 
               hand

               young david heads toward his car he slips a couple of times 
               on the slick iced surface of the road

               he kneels down next to the inverted car he looks in the 
               crushed window frame

               the face of a twenty year old megan is upside down she is 
               unconscious

               david pulls at the handle of the mangled door its wedged 
               tight it wont move

               the heat from the fire is tremendous

               davids powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength

               we hear the creak of metal the door bends unnaturally and 
               then practically rips open

               david leans into the car and unbuckles megan he works her 
               out underneath the steering column he slides out

               her leg is bleeding

               david picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the 
               road he lays her down gently

               a light washes over them david turns to see a truck 
               approaching up the road

               david waves frantically the truck slows

               david turns back to megan her eyes are open

               tears fall from davids face as he moves the hair out of her 
               eyes she looks at david

               framed family photos displayed on top of it

               davids shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open 
               bathroom on the other side of the bedroom

               a woman is tied to the bathroom door handle she sits on the 
               tiled floor slumped against the door her eyes stare blankly 
               at the ground she has considerable bruises on her face and

               door nearby the curtains draping the screen door move with 
               the wind from outside

               david crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain it leads 
               to a small balcony

               an empty lawn chair is the only thing on it

               david steps onto the balcony and looks down

               the rain still pours down unmercifully it comes down on a 
               black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard

               david turns to go back inside

               a blurr of orange attacks him

               the collision is sudden and explosive the huge man drives 
               his shoulder into davids chest and takes him off his feet 
               davids body flips over the railing

               the dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two 
               stories directly towards the black tarp

                                                                    cut to

               theres a thin layer of rain water on the tarps surface

               david is laying on his cheek half his face is covered in 
               water

               beat davids exposed eye looks around in a daze the surface 
               of the tarp gets pounded by the rain

               david uses his hands to push his body off the tarp his hands 
               sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down

               the first sounds of nylon sliding against concrete start

               david stops pushing his vision catches the corner of the 
               swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand 
               bags that hold it in place

               the tarp sags david becomes utterly still the sound 
               continues anyway

               one by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand 
               bags all around the edge of the pool

               and then without warning the tarp caves in it folds around 
               david as he and the tarp get pulled under the cold dark water

                                                                    cut to

               balcony flickers and disappears

               across the room they come to a hard stop as davids back 
               gets rammed into the bedroom wall

               the huge man in orange pulls away and then slams david harder 
               against the wall

               davids arm remains locked around his throat

               the man becomes frantic his face turning dark red he 
               clutches at davids arm

               he spins taking david with him into another wall the impact 
               is tremendous the room shakes david holds on

               his face bent low and hidden under his hood

               and then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back

               it lands hard right in davids side david groans the huge 
               man delivers another one savage desperate blows

               we hear the impact of each one with davids body and david 
               never lets go

               the elbows slow and then stop the legs of the man in orange 
               start to buckle

               david pulls him back onto his heels he turns him in a half 
               circle all of his tremendous weight is hanging from davids 
               arm now david lets out a yell as he applies all his strength 
               the mans legs stop kicking

               david keeps turning him the mans body goes completely limp 
               davids just dragging two hundred and seventyfive pounds of 
               weight in a circle over the carpet now

               wrapped around the mans neckthe mans limbs dangle down 
               to the ground beat

               davids hands let go of each other his arm slips out from 
               under the mans jaw

               the man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll

               the only sound in the room is davids heavy breathing

               beat

               he moves to the woman slumped against the door he starts to 
               untie the phone cords that bind her wrists to the handle he 
               whispers to her
