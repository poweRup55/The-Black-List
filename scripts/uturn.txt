     ext somewhere in the desert south west  day

     begin titles over

     it is only midmorning but it is hot  insects scurry for
     shade  prairie dogs burrow under ground to escape the sun
     we can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the earth
     it adds a surreal quality to the surroundings

     in the distance where a long dusty road meets the horizon
     a small shape appears  a sixtyfourandahalf mustang
     convertible  its candyapple red burns like a brilliant
     fireball under the sun  as the car drifts closer we can see
     steam escaping from under the hood  martha reeves heatwave
     plays on the cars radio

     the car rolls on looking as if it wont make another ten
     feet until it reaches a small gas station on the edge of a
     desert town  the station is made of weatherbeaten wood
     its windows long since dusted over  the pumps themselves
     look to have been around since the early fifties  above the
     station is a sign so faded its barely readable  harlins

     john stewart  young good looking  gets out of the car
     and mindful of a bandaged left hand  opens the hood  a
     plume of steam rises from the engine and hits him in the
     face

                         john
               oh shit

     john looks around for someone anyone  after a few moments
     he reaches into the car and blows the horn  he waits then
     blows it again  from out of the station walks darrell  a
     skinny man in coveralls that are caked with grease and dirt
     he looks the part of a yokel

                         darrell
               you want somethin

                         john
               you harlin

                         darrell
               nope  darrell

                         john
               harlin around

                         darrell
               hes up at the look out

     darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the
     distance

                         john
               will he be back soon

                         darrell
               doubt it  hes dead  the look
               outs a cemetery

                         john
               you own this place

                         darrell
               yep

                         john
               then why do you call it harlins

                         darrell
               cause harlin used to own it

                         john
               but hes dead

                         darrell
               so

     john is confused but chooses to drop the matter

                         john
               you want to take a look at my car
               i think the radiator hose is

                         darrell
               damn  gonna be another hot one
               today

     darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag  it doesnt so much
     wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt

                         darrellcont

               seen it so hot  sometimes i dont
               even want to get out of bed  id
               rather just lay there and try to
               catch a breeze  i was in mexico
               this one time

                         john

               could you just take a look at my
               radiator hose  its busted

     darrell is clearly upset at being cut off  he leans into
     the car and looks at the engine

                         darrell
               its your radiator hose  its busted

                         john

     darrell slams down the hood

     john wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead

                         darrell
               what happened to your hand

     selfconsciously john quickly drops his hand to his side

                         john
               accident

                         darrell

                         darrell
               just a car

     john reaches into the car pulls out a back pack which he
     throws over his shoulder

                         john
               its not just a car its a sixty
               fourandahalf mustang convertible
               thats the difference between you
               and me and why you live here and
               im just passing through

     darrell watches john walk away    and spits after him

                                                            cut to

     ext desert road  later

     john walks along a dusty patch of road into town  as he
     walks on a pair of motorcyclers roar past john on their
     harleys blanketing him in a cloud of dust  he shouts after
     them but his words are lost under the whine of the cycles
     engines

     john hits town    such as it is  its really nothing
     more than a detour off a desert road  there are only a few
     little stores  a general store a catalog outlet a post
     office that doubles as a bus depot   all of them in
     buildings of graying wood  just beyond is a truck
     stopdiner with a few eighteen wheelers parked outside it

     along the side of the street sits an old blind man dressed
     in raggedy clothes  his seeing eye dog lies next to him
     as john passes the old man yells out

                         blind man
               hey  you there

                         john
               all right old man  christ

     john walks across the street to a very old soda machine it
     has bottles instead of cans  the blind man shouts to john

                         blind man
               get me a dr peppa  i dont want no
               pepsi  pepsi aint nothing but
               flavored water

                         john
               yeah yeah

     john puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of
     dr pepper  he starts back to the blind man

                         blind man
               dont forget to open it for me  i
               cant be opening my own bottle

                         john
               christ

     john goes back to the machine and opens the bottle then
     walks back to the old man who takes a hearty swig of the
     soda

                         blind man
               ah  just what i needed  want some

     the blind man holds the bottle out to john  a string of
     saliva runs from his lips to the bottles neck

                         john
               ill pass

     john reaches down and pets the old mans dog

                         john
               i think youd better give your pooch
               a sip  he looks sick

                         blind man

     john jumps back

                         john

               the war when i lost my eyes  he was
               just a pup then   

     as the blind man talks on john notices a very beautiful
     woman down the street grace mckenna  she is dressed
     unpretentiously in cutoff jeans and a tshirt  with her
     raven hair and caramel skin it is obvious that she is native
     american  her arms are full with an awkward package she can
     barely manage  john walks to her leaving the blind man
     rattling on to himself

                         john
               can i give you a hand beautiful

                         grace

     grace stops walking

                         grace
               my mother told me never to accept
               offers from strangers

               my name is john  now im not a
               stranger anymore  see how easy it
               is for us to get to know each other
               beautiful

                         grace
               do you have to call me that

                         john
               maybe but if you didnt i think you
               would have kept on walking

                         grace

               arent you

     grace hesitates then gives the package to john  he has
     trouble with it himself

                         john
               jesus

                         grace

               do you want me to carry your pack
               for you

     john blurts out emphatically

                         john
               no

     he catches himself and softens a bit

                         johncont
               no ive got it

                         grace
               what happened to your hand

                         john
               accident

                         grace
               you should be more careful

     they start walking towards graces car

                         grace
               its very nice of you to help me
               that package is kind of heavy and
               its so hot

                         john
               no trouble at all really

     they get to a car and john puts down the package

                         john
               wasnt nothing

                         grace
               oh this isnt my car  its down a
               ways  i should have parked closer
               i just didnt think it would be so
               heavy  i could drive up

                         john
               thats all right  i got it

     john takes up the package and they begin walking again  the
     package seems to have gained weight

                         grace
               its just new drapes and curtain
               rods  if i had known it was going
               to be so heavy i would have had them
               delivered up to the house

     john struggles with the package  sweat starts to sheet his
     face

     sweat

     grace steps to john and places her hand against his chest
     she rubs away some of the sweat

     john naked steps into the shower and turns on the water
     it shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body
     as the water falls over him we hear

                         voicevo
               i want my money

     john press his left hand against the white tile to steady
     himself  his hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his
     pinky or ring finger  john leans back in the shower  just
     as he does

     ext alley  night

     it is raining hard  matching the backwards motion of the
     last scene john is thrown violently against a brick wall

                         voicevo
               i want my money

     the angle widens to reveal john being pressed against the
     wall by a big goon  another man stands partially hidden
     behind the goons frame  with one hand the goon flattens
     johns hand against the brick with his other he flicks open
     a switch blade  the camera follows the goons hand as he
     brings the blade around to johns fingers then pans to a cu
     of johns face which suddenly violently contorts in pain
     john slides to the ground until he is framed between the
     legs of the two men  as john clutches his left hand the
     rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen blank face

     int graces housebathroom  moments later

     we see johns face reliving the experience as once again we
     hear the voice

                         voice vo
               i want my money

     the camera pans with john as he looks to his left hand  as
     a streak of blood snakes down the white tile we see that the
     pinky and ring fingers have been cut off sloppily at the
     joints

     int graces housebedroom  later

     john his hand rebandaged is putting on his clothes  as he
     does he looks at himself  he bends to pick up his shirt
     which is draped over the back pack  as he lifts it we can
     see that the pack is filled with money  he closes the pack
     and stands  in the mirror hidden in the doorway he sees
     grace watching him  john slows perceptibly but does not
     try to hide himself  after a moment grace walks into the
     room carrying a glass of lemonade  she has changed into a
     sun dress

                         grace
               thought you might like a refill on
               your lemonade

     john takes the lemonade and drinks it down  he rubs the
     glass against his forehead

                         john
               thats good  cools you right off
                    tentatively
               i saw you watching me

                         grace
               im sorry  i didnt mean to

                         john
               i didnt say it bothered me

                         grace
               did you like it me watching you

                         john
               i guess  ive got an ego same as
               any man

                         grace
               good cause i liked what i saw

     john gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant

                         john
               nice place you got here

                         grace
               thank you

     grace sits on the edge of the bed

                         john
               must get kind of lonely for a woman
               living by herself in a big house

                         grace
               i guess it must

                         john
               what do you do anyway

                         grace
               a little of this a little of that
               mostly i tell fortunes

                         john
               whered you learn to do that

                         grace
               from my father  he was the tribes
               shaman

                         john
               a medicine man

                         grace
               those are white words not ours

                         john
               nice house for a shamans daughter
               you must be good

                         grace
               come here

     john goes to grace and kneels before her  she takes his
     head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes  her voice
     goes thick but soft like a morning fog

                         grace
               theres something in your past
               something you want to keep hidden
               theres a pain  something   
               someone you cant forget  and there
               is something you want very badly
               it seems very far away to you but
               you are determined and you will do
               what you must to get it

     john closes his hands on graces and takes them from his
     face  he is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of
     graces reading

                         john
               my face tell you all that

                         grace
               it tells me what every face tells
               me  everybody has a past they have
               a pain and they have something they
               want
                    seductively
               what is it you want

                         john
               the same thing you do

     they silently stare into each others eyes

                         grace
               really  i want to hang drapes

     grace walks from the room  for a moment john stares after
     her  he takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in
     his teeth

     grace is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the
     drapes  john stands behind her

               hold me

     john gently places his hands on graces waist

                         grace
               tighter  i wont break but i sure
               dont want to fall

     john holds her tighter as she finishes hanging the drapes
     his eyes are transfixed on her ass

                         grace
               there  all done  lift me down

     john lifts grace down from the ladder  he holds her his
     hands around her waist

                         grace

               at this room  i think they add a
               little life

                         john
               nothing like a little liveliness

     with a sexy pout grace loads the next question

                         grace
               no more drapes to hang  now what
               should we do

               i have ideas

                         grace
               such as

     john steps close to grace and takes her by the shoulders
     he pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers
     grace doesnt respond

                         john
               all right grace  no more games

                         grace
                    innocently
               games

                         john
               you flirt with me then you run
               cold  you lead me on then slap me
               down  i dont go for being jerked
               around

                         grace
               really  and what game did you want
               to play  you carry my box for me
               and i fall into bed with you

     john grabs up his pack

                         john
               i think i can find my own way back
               to into town

                         grace
               maybe i like to find out about a man
               first  maybe i like to know what
               hes made of

                         john
               im just flesh and blood baby
               that and a few memories of bad
               women just like most guys  but you
               already know that  you read my
               fortune  thanks for the lemonade

     john turns to leave

                         grace
               you never did answer my question

                         john
               still playing

                         grace
               thats not an answer  what is it
               you want

                         john
               you know what i want

                         grace
               maybe i just want to hear you say it

     for a beat john stands and stares hard at grace  his pack
     slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor  with great
     determination like a beast closing for the kill john moves
     for her  grace stands firm ready for him her head tilts
     back  her breath comes deep and hard

     just as john is about to reach her just as he is about to
     take her he is stopped dead by the booming voice of jake
     mckenna

     formidable for his age  a charlton heston with a thick
     irish brogue

     for a moment john and jake stare at each other down before
     jake steps aside  john grabs up his pack and storms from
     the room and the house

                                                            cut to

     ext desert road  later  day

     john walks along the side of the road back into town  he
     couldnt have been walking more than a few minutes but
     already he is caked with a mixture of sweat and dust  he
     looks up at the relentless sun that beats down on him

                         john
               damn it

     john walks on a short way before a cadillac slows beside
     him  jake is driving

                         jake

               give you trouble i would have done

     john climbs into the car  for a short time the two men ride
     in silence  jake notices johns bandaged hand

                         jake

               he was was a memory  i guess a
               little place like this would just be
               a dot on a map to you after awhile

                         john

                         jake
               ah i can smell it on you

     jake wipes his hand across the back of johns neck and holds
     it to his nose

                         john
               hey

               married her she was a free spirit

               shoot em

     jake looks at john his lips curled into a sly smile

                         jake
               i bet she led you on good didnt
               she  taking you up to the house
               with that smile of hers  bet she

                         john
               like you dont know

                         jake

               on you

     john gives a little laugh

                         jake
               bet you just wanted to snap her neck
               right then didnt you  bet you
               just wanted to kill her

     john starts to laugh heartily  jake joins in then stops
     abruptly

                         jake
               would you

                         john
               would i what

                         jake
               would you kill her

     john starts to laugh again

                         jake
                    deadly serious
               i asked you a question

     john stops laughing

                         john
               why would i kill her

                         jake
               because im sick and tired of her
               little games  because you could do
               it and drift away on your boat and
               no one would ever see you again
               because ive got a fiftythousand
               dollar life insurance policy on her
               and i would be more than happy to
               give the man who does her in a good
               chunk of it

     for a moment john sits in silence not sure of what to make
     of the offer

                         john
               im not a murderer mr mckenna

                         jake
               how do you know if youve never
               tried

                         john
               this is a joke right  you just
               want to rattle me  right

     they reach town and jake stops the car

                         jake
               thats right  nothing but a joke
               thats all

     john gets out of the car  with a big smile jake says

                         jake
               enjoy your stay lad

     jake speeds away  john looks after him

                         john
               this fucking town is crazy

                                                            cut to

     int small grocery store  later

     the store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny older
     mexican woman who is behind the counter  john enters

                         john
               got any cold soda

                         woman

                         john
               soda  you got any soda

                         woman
               hablar slowly por favor  my ingles

                         john
               soda  you know

     john cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming

                         woman
               oh  something to eat  si

     she holds up a pack of twinkies

                         john
               not eat  drink  what the fuck is
               drink in spanish    uh agua

     the old womans eyes widen  she starts to scream but
     quickly clamps her hands over her mouth  for a moment john
     thinks the woman is screaming at what he has said  then as
     if he feels a presence behind him john turns slowly to face
     the tow thoughlooking unshaven tattoocovered bikers  one
     holds a gun

                         biker
               thats right lady  keep it in you
               and nobody gets hurt  that goes for
               you too stud  gimmie the money

                         second biker
               the dinero senora  hand it over

     john shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his
     back

     the woman goes to an oldfashioned cash register and rings
     it open  she hands the money to the biker

                         biker
               thats it  lady i got kids to put
               through school

                         woman
               es all i have

     the biker turns to john

                         biker
               okay pal  the wallet

     john pulls his wallet from his pocket and tosses it on the
     counter  the biker scoops it up and starts to leave the
     store  he stops

                         biker
               toss me the pack

                         john
               theres nothing in it  just books

                         biker
               im a reader toss it

     john takes an unsteady breath

                         john
               no

                         biker
               no

     the biker starts to walk back towards john

                         second biker
               hey man  forget about it

                         biker
               no

                         woman
               senor give him the pack

                         biker
               thats all right  he doesnt want
               to give me the pack   

                         second biker
               hes fucking with you man shoot him

     the biker lightly taps john on the temple with the barrel of
     the gun

                         blind man
               he doesnt have to give me the pack

     again he taps john on the temple  john flinches in
     anticipation of a shot  the biker goes to tap johns temple
     again but this time swings the gun hard clipping john
     across the forehead  john falls against the counter and to
     the floor  the woman starts to scream

                        second biker
               fuck man  come on  lets get out
               of here

     the biker grabs up the pack then looking back at the
     woman sees a ring on her finger  he grabs her hand and
     pulls at the ring  the woman screams wildly

                         woman
               no  no

                         second biker
               christ man  would you come on

                         biker
               a little extra never hurt

     he pulls the ring from the womans finger and pushes her
     back  with johns pack slung over his shoulder he turns to
     leave

                         biker
               now we go

     from beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun

                         woman
               you go to el diablo

     the woman fires a shot that rips through the pack and into
     the back of the biker  he falls to the ground very dead
     amid a shower of blood and shredded money

                         second biker
               oh shit  oh shit  oh shit

                         john
               nooooooooo

     as the second biker tears from the store the woman fires
     another shot that rips into the doorway but misses him  we
     hear a motorcycle fire up and race off  john sits on the
     floor trying to grab pieces of the still falling money as
     the woman comes around the counter to his aide

                         woman
               senor  senor are you all right

     john clutches at the side of his bleeding head and mumbles
     something

                         woman
               i call the policia

                         john
               no

     john struggles to his feet

                         john
               no police

                         woman
               but senor

                         john
               no police  wait until im gone

                         john
               no police

     john stumbles from the store as the woman calls after him
     the screen burns a bright white

                                                           fade to

     ext street  later

     what follows is a quick montage

     john walks along the street dazed and holding his head

     he sits on the ground next to a spigot that is dripping
     water  he cups his hands under the water and splashes it
     against his face lightly wiping the cut above his eye

     john stands on the street side digging into his pants
     pocket  he pulls out a five dollar bill which he looks over
     before stuffing it back where he found it  he walks on

                                                            cut to

     ext harlins garage  later

     darrell is leaning under the hood of a car working on its
     engine as john walks up

                         john
               hey

                         darrell

     john slams the phone down into the hook  his hand lingers

     lifts the receiver again and desperately dials a number

     john again slams the phone against the hook each time
     punctuating it with

                         john
               fuck you  fuck you  fuck you

     john marches from the phone booth  the phone falls from the

     it is a little dinertype stop one would find on most any
     open road  a counter with stools laminated menus a
     wurlitzer in the corner belching out country tunes  a
     little worse for the wear its obvious the place does a
     brisk business although now its a little slow  there is a
     short order cook in the kitchen and flo  a stereotypical
     waitress with a bouffant and chewing gum  is behind the
     counter  a couple of regulars ed and boyd are seated on
     the stools

                         ed
               onehundredthirteen degrees  that
               was back in july of fortyseven
               now there aint no way its gonna be
               hotter than that

                         boyd
               hundred and eight already

     john enters and sits at the end of the counter  he is
     sweating and obviously tired  he buries his face in his
     hands

                         ed
               hundred and eight aint a hundred
               and thirteen

               will be

               why dont you both shut up and drink
               your coffee  how you can drink that
               stuff on a day like today is beyond
               me

                         ed
               hes always going on about
               something  this morning he wouldnt
               shut up about that coin

                         boyd
               its true

                         flo
               what about a coin

                         ed
               its nonsense

                         boyd

                         ed
               a coins got two sides  when you
               flip it theres a fiftyfifty chance
               itll be heads or tails  boyd
               thinks if you flip a coin ten times
               half the time itll come up each
               side

                         boyd
               it will

     needle scratches off  the door to the truck stop opens and
     sheriff potter walks in  the tension is shattered  toby
     mindful of the sheriff steps closer to john and whispers
     menacingly into his ear

     just as the words leave flos mouth the sheriff spills the
     pot  it shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee

     while everyone is distracted john notices that the register
     drawer has been left open  he looks around to make sure he
     is not being watched  slowly he eases his hand towards the
     drawer  it gets closer and closer  as he his about to grab
     the money there the cat  the same one he kicked away
     earlier  hisses and claws at his hand  john jumps back
     startled

     john exits

                                                            cut to

     ext empty street  later

     john walks a bit going nowhere in particular  he shields
     himself with on hand from the sun  at the side of an old
     building in the bit of shade it throws he stops to drink
     his beer  he twists at the cap trying to get it off  it
     sticks and wont turn  john tries again and again twisting
     harder and working up a sweat from the effort  finally the
     cap twists off cutting into his hand as it rotates  john
     yells in pain  at the same time the beer comes foaming from
     the bottle and spills onto the ground  he throws the
     bottle and clutches his bleeding hand

                         john
               damn it  god damn it  i hate this
               fucking town  do you hear me  i
               hate it

               i got to get out of here  i got to
               get out of this place

     across the street john sees a sign on a building  jake
     mckenna  real estate  he thinks for a moment then starts
     to walk towards the building

                                                            cut to

     int jakes office  later

     jakes secretary opens the door to his office and shows john
     in

                         jake
               thank you tracy  why dont you
               take lunch

     tracy exits closing the door behind her

                         jake
               good lord  what happened to you

                         john
               just ran into a little trouble

                         jake
               another accident  youve really got
               to be more careful  can i get you a
               drink

                         john
               no

                         jake
               hungry

                         john
               no

                         jake
               im surprised to see you  i thought
               youd be halfway to vegas by now

                         john
               i had a problem getting my car back

                         jake
               you just seem to attract trouble
               dont you

     ignoring the question

                         john
               nice office youve got

                         jake
               i do all right  real estate isnt a
               bad game such as it is around here
               the trick is to underestimate the
               price when you buy it and overvalue
               when you sell  you can turn a few
               dollars that way

                         john
               isnt that illegal

     jake smiles

                         jake
               now what can i do for you

                         john
               i was hoping we could talk

                         jake
               talk  about what

                         john
               about things  about your wife

                         jake
               sweet grace  what about her

                         john
               about what you said this morning

     jake shakes his head as if he doesnt understand

                         john
               you said you had an insurance policy
               out on your wife  fiftythousand
               dollars

                         jake
               i do

                         john
               you said youd cut that up with the
               man who did her in

                         jake
               i did

                         john
               dont play simple with me jake
               you want me to spell it out for you
               ill kill grace if you cut me in on
               the money

                         jake
               i think this heats getting to you
               the way youre rambling on

                         john
               im not rambling

                         jake
               youre talking like a mad man

                         john
               youre the one who brought it up
               this morning  in your car

                         jake
               that was just loose talk  i dont
               want anybody dead

                         john
               bullshit  you wanted me to kill her

                         jake
               a man doesnt always mean the things
               he says

                         john
               you meant it

                         jake
               what makes you say that

                         john
               because i think youre a slimy
               bastard who would have his wife
               killed just to get his hands on some
               money

                         jake
               and what does that make you

                         john
               the slimy bastard whos going to do
               it for you

     for a moment jake stares quietly at john then walks to the
     office door and locks it

                         jake
               lets say i do want her dead  what
               is it you want  this morning you

               town

                         jake
               and for that youd kill grace

                         john
               for that id kill a nun on easter
               sunday

                         jake
               just to get out of here  that
               doesnt seem much for a murder

                         john
               how do you put a price on murder

                         jake

               minus your cut of course  which is

               insurance until months after shes

               killed  im the one whos neck is
               stuck out  its thirteen or its
               nothing

     jake considers all this for a moment

                         jake
               you drive a hard bargain but i had
               a feeling you were my boy when i met
               you

                         john
               im not your boy jake  i dont
               like you and i dont like what you
               are  i got no choice but to do
               business with you  this is just a
               nasty little marriage of convenience

                         jake
               dont say that  i had a marriage of
               convenience with grace and look
               where thats lead  well looks like
               we got ourselves a pact

                         john
               do we shake hands

                         jake
               if you cant trust the man youve
               hired to kill your wife   

     for a moment the two men stand silent  all we hear is the
     ticking of a grandfather clock that stands in the corner

                         john
               i guess i might as well get this
               done with

                         jake
               the sooner its over the sooner
               youre on your way  now listen to
               me  its got to look like an
               accident thats the thing  if it
               doesnt then its no good  i wont
               get a dime and its my neck thatll
               be on the chopping block while
               youre living it up somewhere

                         john
               what should i do

                         jake
               how the hell should i know  ive
               never had a wife killed before  i
               guess i should have hired a
               professional

                         john
               you want to do this yourself  i
               dont have to do this you know

                         jake

               cant be done at the house  it
               should be   

     jake walks the office thinking a bit  an idea comes to him

                         jake
               this is what you do  go to the
               house to see her

                         john
               and tell her what

                                                            cut to

     ext mckenna house  later

     john stands on the porch talking to grace through the screen
     of the front door  the look on his face is sincere  hers
     is skeptical  in the following scenes we see the action
     take place as we hear jakes voice over

                         jakevo
               i dont know  tell her you had to
               see her  tell her you dont care if
               shes married or not you had to be
               with her  sweet talk the woman  a
               stud like you must be good at that
               then    maybe shift the
               conversation  get her thinking
               about that jeep of hers  she loves
               that thing  maybe the only thing
               she does love  shell want to take
               you for a ride

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  day

     graces jeep cuts hard across the desert  grace has a wild
     excited look on her face  john sits next to her looking
     somewhat nervous

                         jakevo
               shell take you out somewhere in the
               desert  she loves it out there
               ridin through the red rock and the
               mesas  so do i  i guess we got
               that in common  shell ride you out
               someplace quiet  someplace deserted

                                                           fade to

     ext desert  later

     grace has stopped the jeep on a plateau  john sits beneath
     its shade while grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected
     by the heat

                         jakevo
               there wont be anyone for miles
               around  just the two of you and
               some prairie dogs  thats all  you
               can sweet talk her a little if you
               like  makes no mind to me  just
               put her at ease make her feel
               relaxed then do it

     jakes vo ends  the scene is now synch with real time

                         john
               doesnt the heat bother you

                         grace

               desert they were like a religion to
               us  jakes the same way  he loves
               the desert  i guess were alike
               that way  thats about the only way

                         grace

               land broker  big fish in a small
               pond he says  more like a little
               fish in a dried up watering hole

                         john
               you could just leave him

                         grace
               i dont know how

                         john
               you just walk away

                         grace
               its not that easy  maybe you can
               take chances maybe you can wander
               around like some stray wherever you
               please  i cant  i dont want to
               be alone  i need to know im going
               to be taken care of

                         john
               you need a meal ticket is what you
               mean  some guy you can latch onto
               just long enough for him to get you
               out of here

                         grace
               is that so bad  its not like i
               wouldnt try to make him happy  for
               awhile anyway  i mean i would   
                do things for him  i guess im no
               good that way  i guess i tried to
               sucker you along like that  do you
               hate me for it  i wouldnt blame
               you if you did  but maybe its like
               you said  you just got to do
               whatever it takes to get out

                         john
                    soft echo
               whatever it takes

     grace steps to the edge of the plateau

                         grace
               i wish i was a bird  i know its
               stupid  every child says that
               when i was growing up some of the
               old ones on the reservation believed
               people could actually change into
               animals  i wish i could

     we see john behind grace  he stares at her standing on the
     edge of the plateau  he rises and walks towards her slowly
     but with deliberation

                         gracecont
               if i was a bird i would fly to
               florida to disney world  i always
               wanted to go there  id fly to new
               york  maybe  i guess new york
               isnt the best place to be a bird
               id fly to st louis then new
               orleans all over texas  then id
               fly to california  i guess by then
               id have seen it all and i could die

     john now stands a few feet behind grace  she kicks a rock
     and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the
     nothingness below

                         gracecont
               they say you dont feel anything
               the shock kills you before you hit
               the ground  i dont know how they
               would know that  but i heard its
               just like flying straight down into
               the ground  i guess if it doesnt
               hurt its a beautiful thing

     john tenses himself  sweat forms on his brow as he stands
     directly behind grace with his hands extended before him
     they hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push
     forward  suddenly grace wheels  startled by john she
     almost falls over the edge  john grabs her her weight
     still going back  graces life is literally in his hands
     she looks down at the ground far below then up into johns
     eyes  she shows no fear but instead wears a curious smirk

                         grace
               hates a funny thing  right now i
               bet you dont know if you want to
               kill me or fuck me

     john hesitates then pulls grace close and kisses her hard
     on the lips  the screen burns white and we

                                                     dissolve to

     int mckenna housebedroom  later

     john sits shirtless on the edge of the bed staring out a
     window  grace lies next to him stroking his back  they
     both glisten with sweat

                         grace
               how far is it to california

                         john
               from here  i dont know  far  far
               enough

                         grace

               water and clear skies as far as you
               can see

                         grace

               dollars

                         john
                    suddenly intrigued
               where

                         grace
               jake

                         john

               money just so i can take you out of
               here

     stands and starts to dress

     as she talks grace comes up behind john

                         grace
               sometime in the middle of the night
               when its quiet  when hes asleep
               you just come up behind him and   

     grace lays her hands on johns back  spooked he jumps

               jesus christ  listen to yourself
               i cant do it grace  i cant do it

     john starts to leave but grace grabs him

                         grace
               john  i grew up on a reservation
               a fucking patch of desert in the
               middle of nowhere  thats where
               they stick indians john  thats
               where they leave us to die  my
               mother died there  my father  i
               had a brother who killed himself at
               twentytwo because he couldnt take
               it anymore

     john tries to pull away but grace holds him tight

                         gracecont
               theres no hope there john  i was
               lucky to make it this far  youve
               got to do this for me  ill do
               anything for you  anything

     john looks into graces pleading eyes  he sees all he can
     stand and pulls away  grace chases after him

                         gracecont
               how are you going to get out of
               here  you need the money  its not
               so much for a hundredthousand
               dollars

     pushing grace aside john heads out the door  grace calls
     after him

                         gracecont
               whatever it takes remember
                    to herself
               whatever it takes

                                                            cut to

     ext street corner  later

     the old blind man sits with his dead dog  he speaks into
     the camera which dollies in during his dialogue

                         blind man
               its the heat that makes you crazy
               i dont know what it is but it
               works that way for man and animal
               alike  i seen some peculiar things
               on a hot day  i seen a scorpion
               sting itself to death  it just
               keeps driving its tail into its body
               again and again  a little killer
               killing itself  seen a coyote kill
               itself too  just kept on biting and
               tearing at its own legs  near tore
               one clean off before it bled to
               death  and what a manll do when
               its hot    a man could get
               hisself killed just for rubbing
               shoulders with another  i dont
               know what it is about the heat  i
               figger its sort of like putting a
               kettle of water over a fire  people
               is mostly water  we boil when its
               hot  cept when we boil the waters
               got no place to go  it just churns
               inside of us until we can cool off
               if its not too late

     john steps into frame and sits next to the blind man  we
     realize the blind man has been talking to him all along

                         john
               you sure seen a lot for a blind man

                         blind man
               just cause i aint got eyes doesnt
               mean i cant see

                         john
               that a fact

                         blind man
               i can see just fine  for example
               youre a young man who thinks hes
               got someplace to be

                         john
               maybe i do

                         blind man
               or maybe you just think you do  you
               can run just as far as you can but
               wherever you go there you are

                         john
               i think ive heard that before

                         blind man
               what do you want for free

                         john
               you sure got a lot of philosophy
               old man

                         blind man
               thats cause ive done a lot of
               living

                         john
               maybe one day ill get to sit on a
               corner and spout wise

                         blind man
               think youll live that long

     john is clearly unnerved by this  he stands and starts to
     walk away  the blind man rattles his tin cup

                         blind man
               aint you got a little something for
               the infirm

               next time

                         blind man
               i wont hold my breath

                                                            cut to

     int jakes office  later

     john opens the door to the office and walks in  jake sits
     behind his desk ripping open letters with a very sharp
     letter opener

                         jake
               well

     john hesitates for a beat then

                         john
               i went to your place  we talked
               just like you told me  we drove out
               into the desert   

                         jake
               is the job done

                         john
               no

                         jake
               you didnt kill her

                         john
               the time wasnt right

                         jake
               youre out in the desert the middle
               of nowhere with no one around for
               miles and you say the time wasnt
               right  whats the matter  you were
               hoping to get it on home video  a
               keepsake for the grandkids
                    mocking
               thank god i waited or i never would
               have gotten it on tape

                         john
               you know what i mean

                         jake
               i know all right  i know youre
               just enough of a shit to have a go
               at bedding a mans wife  youve
               probably bagged a few at that
               youd probably lie cheat and steal
               without thinking twice  from that
               youd just turn and walk away  but
               to kill to get that blood on your
               hands  you cant wash that off
               youd be a marked man for life
               just like cain  and youre a sinner
               who wants to walk with the saints
               aint that right boy

                         john
               you know so much about killing why
               dont you do it yourself

                         jake
               i guess i have what youd call a
               lovehate relationship with grace

                         john
               you love her but you hate her

                         jake
               i hate loving her  i hate the kind
               of her person she is  i hate having
               to tolerate the little games she
               plays  i hate letting her use me
               but i love her too much to do
               otherwise  and i certainly love her
               too much to kill her  i couldnt
               stand to watch her eyes roll back in
               her head as she sucks her last
               breath or to see her pretty pink
               brains spill from her skull  but
               you  you got the killing in you
               boy

                         john

                         jake

               going to get dead

                         john
               shut up

     john lunges at jake who with surprising ease grabs the
     younger man twists him and stretches him back down across
     the desk  grabbing up the letter opener he holds it at
     johns throat

                         jake
               like i said  next time somebodys

               to this place  maybe one day you

     john starts for the door stops and turns back to jake

                         john
               jake how much were you going to pay

               he is at that  no so much a fault
               of his own  poor boy had quite a
               trauma as a child

                         john
               what happened

                         sheriff
               his father worked in a strip mine
               north of here  tobys school class

               takes field trips up there every
               year  big day for the kids when
               they can see ore tore up out of the
               ground  anyway on this particular
               day tobys dad up and falls into the
               machinery

               yep  tore him up good and spat out
               little refined pieces of him
               nothing like the embarrassment of
               having your father refined in front
               of your classmates to put the anger
               in a young man

                         john
               i guess

               the boy  some people dont know how
               to avoid trouble  know what i mean

     john stares at the sheriff but says nothing

               garage

     john is in a rage  he turns to leave and walks a few paces
     he sees a wrench lying on a table  for a second his mind
     reels then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to
     smash it down on darrells head  he stops cold  darrell
     holds a crowbar in a batters stance ready to smash it into
     the mustang

                         darrell

     darrell pulls back the crowbar ready to swing

                         john
                    pleading almost crying

                         darrell
               yeah you better remember that

     darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car

                         darrell
               get on out of here  and you better
               come up with my money

     darrell drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a
     long scratch

                         john
               goddamn you  you son of a bitch

                         darrell
               there you go sweet talking me again

     darrell begins to laugh  it is a repetitive almost demonic
     laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on
     johns anguished face

                                                            cut to

     ext street  later

     john walks along the street still in rage  a voice whispers
     to him and he slows

                         jakevo
               youve got the killing in you

     john turns and looks behind him  jake is nowhere to be
     found

                         jakevo
               maybe not this time but somebodys
               going to get dead around you

                         john
                    quietly
               no

     the screen burns a bright white

     int bus depot  later

     the camera picks up john as he enters the bus depot  the
     interior is poorly lit  there are a few benches for people
     to wait on but they sit empty  old faded travel posters
     hang on the wall  a clerk stands behind a ticket window
     john walks up to him

                         clerk

     the clerk is a little put off by john  he goes through his
     schedule looking for a bus

               figures  i just wanted to get out
               thats all

     john starts to walk slowly away suddenly he turns runs
     back to the clerk grabs him by the shirt and pulls him
     close  john is halfcrazed and almost in tears

                         john

               have to get out of here  theyre

               just please

     the clerk tears himself away from john and hastily writes up
     a ticket  john shrinks ashamed of what he as been reduced
     to

                         clerk
               here  bus threetwentythree  gets

     john hands the clerk his money

                         john
                    meekly
               im sorry  its just    the heat
                 

     he walks away a few paces then turns back to the clerk who
     puts a closed sign in the ticket window

                                                            cut to

     ext bus depot  later

     we see a quick montage of john waiting for the bus  the
     picture blends shots of him standing sitting reclining on
     the bench  over this we hear

                         johnvo
               two hours  two hours and youre
               free  mexicos not so bad  youll
               makes some money pay mr vesci
               back  throw in a little interest
               hell understand

     john runs this throat  he has been waiting for awhile and
     is thirsty  he sees a soda machine down the street
     digging through his pockets he comes up with a little change
     and starts towards the machine  he looks back at the bus
     depot then again to the machine  he moves slow and with a
     sense of trepidation as if leaving the depot may jeopardize
     his only chance at freedom  he begins to move more quickly
     we feel the urgency in his action

                                                            cut to

     pov  john

     the camera dollies in fast on the soda machine  just as
     john is about to reach it a figure jumps into frame

                                                            cut to

     ws  john

     we cannot clearly see who the figure is but he hits john
     violently in the gut  the force of the blow doubles him
     over  john clutches his stomach and stumbles forward a few
     steps before a vicious blow connects with his chin sending
     him reeling into the dirt a curled heap  the bus ticket
     falls from johns pocket  he chokes and spits up saliva
     then rolls over  we see clearly for the first time that
     toby is the attacker  he towers over john with his fists
     curled and a snarl on his lips

                         toby
               get up mister  dont ever let it
               be said toby tyler beat the living

               them a fair chance

                         john
               get away from me

     john sees his bus ticket on the ground  he grabs for it but
     toby beats him to it

                         toby
               now whats this

               means something to me

     toby rips the ticket in half

                         john

               gonna make your own momma sick  im
               gonna   

     as john stares at the pieces of the torn ticket tobys words
     seem to drift to him from a million miles away  the world
     around him is like a dream or a nightmare  a primal rage
     wells inside of john that rises up in a howl as he lunges
     for toby landing blow after blow on the boys face and head

     jenny screams

                         jenny
               stop it  youre killing him

     jenny runs to john and grabs his arm literally hanging all
     her weight on it stopping him from striking toby again

                         jenny
               youre killing him  toby  toby

     jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles toby  john stands
     he looks at toby then at his bloodied knuckles in
     disbelief  he backs away then breaks into a run

     grace stares at jake  she stares at the chain barely
     visible around his neck that disappears under his shirt
     she knows that hidden there is a key and she fixes on it
     intently  jake looks up from the paper and sees grace
     staring

                         jake

     knows of johns plans

               you talk too much old man

     the blind man lifts his sunglasses and we see that he is not
     really blind  he reaches into the cup and pulls out the
     coin that john tossed in

     in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a
     lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the floor

     down his shin he starts through the house again  he waits
     at the door to the next room and listens  hearing nothing

     jake is silent  he takes his time thinking  finally

                         jake
               shes in the bedroom

     john stares at the automatic in jakes hand  hesitantly he
     turns and walks towards the bedroom

                         jake
               hold a second  come here

     john turns to jake

                         jake

                         john

               she wants you dead and she wants
               your money

                         jake
               what are you babbling about

                         john
               think about it  how do you think i
               got in here  did you hear any glass
               break  did you hear a door
               splinter  how did the evening end
               after you went to bed did she linger
               a bit  maybe just long enough to
               leave the back door unlocked  is
               that what happened

     like an old rag jake gradually soaks all this up becoming
     heavier with the weight of the knowledge

                         jake
               youd tell me anything to save your
               pathetic life

                         john
               you know what kind of woman grace
               is  you know how badly she wants to
               get the fuck out of sierra  what makes you
               think when you were planning on
               killing her she wasnt doing the
               same for you  whats she to you
               jake a woman who would have you
               dead  let me kill her  all i want
               is twohundred dollars to get out of
               here with

                         jake
               twohundred dollars

                         john
               twohundred dollars    thats how
               i put a price on murder

     jake lowers the gun and smiles a toothy smile which john
     returns  suddenly jake swings his arm clipping john across
     the side of his head with the pistol and opening another
     bloody gash

                         jake
               i think not  killing my wife for
               me thats one thing  but fucking
               her    well thats another

     jake pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it a johns
     head  at that instant grace who as come to the doorway
     screams at jake

                         grace
               jake  no

     jake whirls towards the shrill voice  in that split second
     john jumps on jake locking a forearm tightly across jakes
     throat  while pulling at the gun with his other hand  the
     gun fires once discharging into the wall  the bullet
     shatters a picture of jake and grace that hangs there

     grace presses herself against the wall and watches as the
     two men struggle  the expression on her face is an odd
     mixture of fear and excitement

     the two men battle back and forth across the room  johns
     arm remains locked in a death grip around jakes throat  he
     slowly squeezes the life out of the older man riding him
     like a bucking bronco down to the floor  eyes bulging
     tongue swollen spittle dripping from his mouth jake looks
     up at grace who returns a cold distant stare  jakes head
     drops and john falls back from the body puffing and
     dripping with sweat

                         john
               why the hell didnt you do anything

                         grace
               what was i supposed to do

                         john
               you could have hit him or kneed him
               in the balls

     grace gives a little smile

                         john
               christ  you liked watching that
               didnt you

     grace eyes the gold chain around jakes neck  she lunges
     for it

                         grace
               the money

     she yanks the chain key and all from the lifeless body
     the action pulls jakes head up then lets it thump back
     down on the floor

                         john
               wheres the safe

                         grace
               i dont know

                         john
                    incredulous
               you dont know  jesus christ
               dont you think you should have
               found out before we killed him

                         grace
               im not sure where it is  not
               exactly  i never saw it  i just
               heard him talk about it

                         john
               oh thats great  we killed jake
               because you heard him talk about
               some money that youve never seen
               thats fucking brilliant

                         grace
               dont yell at me

     grace goes to the wall and presses herself against it  she
     counts out six steps turns to her left and counts out three
     more

                         grace
               right here  six steps out three
               steps left  thats where i heard
               him say

     john goes to the spot on the floor where she stands and
     claws at the wood paneling  he is unable to move it

                         john
               go get a knife or something

     grace runs off to the kitchen to get a knife as john
     continues to claw like an animal at the floor  after a few
     moments grace comes running back  john takes the knife and
     uses it to pry at the wood  it slips a few times then
     finally takes hold

                         john
               i got it  its coming

     a panel breaks free  using his hands again john pries at
     another one until it pulls free  he stops to look at the
     floor

                         john
               nothing  theres no safe under here

                         grace
               there has to be

                         john
               there isnt  theres nothing under
               here but more floor  jesus fucking
               christ  we killed a man for nothing
               but floor

     grace goes to the spot and frantically digs with her hands

                         grace
               its got to be here  i heard him
               talk about it  he bragged about it
               six steps out three left

                         john
               this is good  this is real good
               this is so good they might not even
               charge us with murder when they
               catch us  theyll probably just
               lock us up for being idiots

                         grace
               if it isnt here why would he wear
               that stupid key

                         john
               youre calling jake stupid  you

                         grace
               dont yell at me  i know its here
               i know it

     a light of realization floods into johns eyes

                         john
               wait  wait a second

     john goes to the wall where grace counted out the steps  he
     walks off six steps forward

                         john
               jakes taller than you  he takes
               bigger steps

     john turns and counts off three more steps  he is now
     standing several feet from where they had been digging  he
     goes to the floor and begins pulling at the wood

                         john
               give me the knife

     grace hands the knife to john  he pries at the floorboards
     pulling them free  underneath is a safe

                         john
               the key

     grace hands the key to john  he opens the safe and thrusts
     a hand inside  he swings it from side to side and we hear
     it slap against the metal sides  a look of fear and
     desperation comes over johns face  the look quickly
     dissolves  he pulls out his hand clutching a fist full of
     money  grace runs to him and kisses his hand and the money

                         john
               look at it all grace

     john pulls out another fist full

                         john
               theres easily a hundredthousand in
               there  more than that

                         grace
               i told you  i knew it was there
               didnt i tell you

     grace kisses john on the neck and cheeks then hard on the
     lips  she falls back against the floor and pulls john down
     with her

                         grace
               well split it right down the
               middle  fiftyfifty  you dont
               have to take me with you  you can
               go your own way if you want

     grace presses their lips and gives him a deep long wet
     tongue kiss

                         grace
               if you want

                         john
               were going all the way  together

     again grace kisses john as their passions rise

                         john
               lets go in the bedroom

                         grace
               no

     she spreads the money across the floor and rolls in it

                         grace
               lets do it here

                         john
               what about him

                         grace
               let him watch  i want him to know
               what hes missing

     grace kisses at john who is slow to get into it but finally
     and definitely commits

                                                           fade to

     int mckenna house  later

     john shirtless sits up into frame  money is stuck to his
     sweatcovered back  grace naked but hidden in the shadows
     reaches up and peels the bills from johns back  john pulls
     on a shirt and dresses himself as grace lays in the darkness

                         grace
               now what

     john gathers up some of the money

                         john
               you got a suitcase

                         grace
               never needed one  ive never been
               anywhere  ive got a backpack

                         john
               get it and put the money in it
               pack up anything else you want to
               take with you

                         grace
               where are you going

                         john
               to get my car

                         grace
               wait  what about    him

                         john
               put some clothes on him  when i get
               back well load him in the trunk and
               dump him in the desert  itll takes
               days for anybody to find him

     john exits  grace stares at the body of her husband with a
     blank face  she sees jakes gun lying on the floor and
     picks it up  like a child with a new toy a sly smile curls
     her lips

                                                            cut to

     ext outside the mckenna house  night

     john starts down the drive way and walks past graces jeep
     he stops thinks and walks back  opening the hood he
     reaches into the engine and disconnects something then
     quietly closes the hood and walks on

                                                            cut to

     ext outside harlins garage  later

     john walks to a shack near the garage and bangs on the door
     he waits only a few seconds and bangs again  a light goes
     on in the window  darrell shouts out

                         darrelloc
               what you want

                         john

                         darrelloc
               come back when the sun comes up

     the light goes out  john bangs and kicks against the door
     the light goes back on and darrell yanks the door wide

                         darrell
               what the hell    oh its you
               mightve figured  what do you want

                         darrell
               you got the money

     john pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to

     john turns the mustang up the drive the headlights cut the
     darkness and land on an empty patch where graces jeep had
     been parked  john jumps from the mustang and runs around
     frantically before admitting himself that grace has left
     with the money

                         john
               damn it  god damn it  i knew she

     grace too nervous to speak nods

                         sheriff
               nice night for a drive  morning
               really  i guess thats about the
               only way to keep cool riding around
               with the top down on a fancy
               convertible in the first hours of
               the day

                         john
               not taking a drive sheriff
               heading out of town

                         sheriff

               sierra  what with that ruckus you

               sheriff he didnt give me any
               choice  if i hadnt defended myself
               

                         sheriff
               just cool down son  i aint
               accusing you of anything  serves
               toby right to get his ass whooped
               if you hadnt done it somebody else
               wouldve

                         john
                    cautiously
               is there a problem up the road
               sheriff

                         sheriff
               nope  no problems up the road

     sheriff potter looks in the back seat and sees the backpack

                         sheriff
               that yours mrs mckenna

                         grace
               yes  yes it is

                         sheriff
               taking a little trip

                         grace
               i had a fight with jake  i    i
               just wanted to get away for awhile
               mr stewart was kind enough to take
               me as far as montrose  im going to
               take a bus to my sisters  i
               thought id stay with her for a few
               days

                         sheriff
               is that right  cant say as i blame
               you for wanting to head out for a
               bit  i know ive had my fill of
               this town  sixteen years ive been
               the law and order here  so long i
               forgot why i ever wanted the job in
               the first place  help people i
               guess  keep the peace  problem is
               theres so much peace around here
               they dont much need me  got a lot
               of speeders but theyre speeding
               through miles of nothing so i cant
               hardly blame them  other than that
               well there aint much to steal  i
               reckon that the last big crime we
               had was what would you say mrs
               mckenna  a murder

                         grace
               i   

     the sheriff slips his gun from his holster

                         sheriff
               why dont you step out of the car
               son

                         john
               i dont understand what the

                         sheriff
               just step from the car  nice and
               slow

                         john
               sure sheriff

     john eases himself from the car  he is obviously tense as
     is grace as she silently watches the scene unfold

                         sheriff
               now step around to the back of the
               car and open the trunk for me

                         john
               what for

                         sheriff
               i think you might just want to do as
               i say

                         john
               theres nothing in the trunk
               sheriff

                         sheriff
               and as soon as i see that youre on
               your way

                         grace
               john   

                         john
               grace  just    let me handle
               this  sheriff im telling you
               theres nothing in that trunk  if
               thats not good enough for you then
               id be happy to open it  just as
               soon as you get yourself a search
               warrant

                         sheriff
               i could do that  course wed have
               to go back into town  thered be a
               whole crowd of people around when
               the trunk was opened  a whole crowd
               of witnesses  that wouldnt be too
               pretty now would it

                         grace
               john   

     john thinks for a moment then fumbles through his keys
     looking for the one that opens the trunk  clumsily he drops
     them

                         sheriff
               go on  pick em up

     john goes down slowly to pick up the keys  just as he
     touches them he lunges forward at sheriff potter  the
     sheriff quickly steps to the side and lands a quick jab
     against the side of johns head that sends him to his knees

                         sheriff
               is that the way you want it boy  a
               bullet in the head in the middle of
               the desert  ends like this and you
               wont be able to spend a dime of
               that blood money

                         grace
               he killed him sheriff  i couldnt
               stop him  he made me come with him
               he told me if i said a word he would
               kill me too

                         sheriff
               killing jake mckennas got to amount
               to something  he wasnt much of a
               man but that dont give you the
               right to murder him  and dont tell

     the sheriff twists his gun in the air

                         sheriffcont

               and youre taking

     sheriff potter smiles  his features are distorted by the
     shadows cast from the headlights of his squad car

                         grace
               thats all talk  hes got nothing
               on us  he let you kill jake

               he let it happen  he cant take us
               in

               give him the money

                         grace
                    stunned
               what

                         john
               you heard me  count it out

                         grace
               he cant prove anything john  he
               cant turn us in

                         john
               he can kill us  i dont know about
               you but my life is worth thirty
               thousand dollars

     sheriff potter reaches into his back pocket pulls out a
     plastic garbage bag and tosses it to grace

                         sheriff
               there you go mrs mckenna  just
               put it in there

                         grace
               john

                         john
               do it grace

     grace hesitates then reaches into the back seat for the
     backpack filled with money  she sees something and her
     expression hardens

                         sheriff
               that wasnt so bad  whats thirty
               somethousand to rich folks like
               you  it didnt hurt a bit

                         graceoc
               sheriff potter

     the sheriff turns to face grace  she has jakes gun in hand
     and aimed at sheriff potter  the sheriff panics  before he
     has a chance to take aim grace fires a round that hits him
     in the gut  he staggers backwards and falls to the ground
     in a sitting position clutching at the river of blood that
     is flowing from his fat stomach

                         grace
                    yelling at john
               come on

     john cannot move  he stares at the sheriff who sits quietly
     on the ground with a dazed confused look in his eyes  he
     is soaked in blood more dead than alive

                         grace
               get in the fucking car

     john walks backwards his gaze still fixed on sheriff
     potter  he practically falls into the car fumbles the key
     into the ignition and peels off  he looks back and we see
     sheriff potter still sitting in the middle of the road lit
     in the darkness by the headlights of his car

                         john
               what the hell did you do

     grace answers in a voice that is either dazed or crazed

                         grace
               i shot him

                         john
               you killed him

                         grace
               he was going to take the money

                         john
               thirtythousand thats all  we
               would have been free and clear  you
               didnt have to kill him

                         grace
               its our money  he had no right to
               take it

     john looks at grace  her eyes are glazed as if she is
     watching a movie in her mind  her hands are wrapped tightly
     around the gun  john stares at her

                         john
               youre crazy you know that
               youre fucked up

                         grace
               just drive

     john continues to stare at her

                         grace
               i said drive

     the tail lights of the car fade until there is nothing but
     darkness

                                                            cut to

     ext desert  midmorning

     a long shot of the mustang parked out on a desert plateau
     this is followed by another long shot closer than the first
     and set at a different angle  this is followed by a third
     long shot still closer and again at a different angle  we
     can now clearly make out john who sits on the edge of the
     drivers seat feet dangling out the open door and head
     buried in his hands  grace is reclined in the passenger
     seat  she is asleep covered with her jacket  we can just
     barely hear the crackle of a voice over the radio

                                                           fade to

     cu  john

     john rubs his head with his hands  we can see the strain on
     his face  over the radio we hear a dj

                         djvo

               sierra that sleepy little town was
               tocked last night by the murder of a
               police officer  authorities say
               they havent yet made any arrests
               but they have leads and hope to
               bring in suspects within

     john turns off the radio  grace sits up beside him

                         john
               jesus grace  did you have to kill
               him

                         grace
               he was going to

                         john
               i know  he was to take the fucking
               money

                         grace
               youre tense  what are you all
               uptight about

                         john
               you killed a man for no reason

     john stares at the automatic tucked in graces waist  grace
     follows his eyes to the gun

                         grace
               is that whats bothering you

     grace stands and slowly walks around to johns side of the
     car  nervously john stands

                         grace
               you think now that jake is dead
               theres all that money there and i
               dont need you anymore i might just
               sneak up behind you sometime and  
               

     grace points a finger at john then pulls it back mimicking
     the recoil of a gun  she lets her hands drop to her sides
     the two stand separated like gunfighters at high noon  only
     john doesnt have a gun

                         grace
               is that the kind of girl you think i
               am  what can i do to make you relax

                         john
               you could give me the gun

     grace smiles

                         grace
               why dont we just finish what we
               started

     for a moment john doesnt move  slowly he turns and goes to
     the cracked trunk of the car and lifts it fully open  we
     hear the sounds of buzzing flies  johns face contorts as
     the stench fills his nose

                         john
               christ jake  you need a bath

     john leans down to grab the body  we see grace circle
     around behind him  john senses this and he tries to catch a
     glimpse of her from the corner of his eyes  he pulls at the
     body then again but cannot lift it from the trunk

                         john
               give me a hand

     grace doesnt move

                         john
               are we going to dump him or not

     grace slowly goes to the opposite end of the body and takes
     hold

                         john
               on three  ready  one two

     john whirls quickly punching grace square in the face  it
     sends her to the ground dazed flat on her back  john
     immediately steps to her and grabs the gun from her waist
     as she comes around grace puts a hand to her mouth then
     looks at the blood on her finger tips  grace begins to
     laugh a wild crazed laugh that cuts though john like a cold
     knife

                         grace
               you hit me  you hit a woman
               didnt your momma ever teach you
               anything

     grace sees the gun in johns hand and stops laughing

                         grace
               well

     for a moment john does nothing then slips the clip from the
     gun and tosses them as far as he can in opposite directions

                         john
               well nothing

                         grace
               now what

                         john
               now we dump jake split the
               money then youre on your own

                         grace
               but you said we could be together

                         john
               are you kidding  im not going down
               with you for killing a cop

                         grace

               killed jake

                         johnwekilled jake  and its a big
               difference  you kill an old man
               thats one thing  nobody cares
               about an old man  you kill a cop
               and they never stop looking for you
               never

                         grace
               he was a crooked bastard  he would
               have killed us

                         john
               the police dont know that  and
               its going to be hard to explain it
               to them with a noose around your
               neck  ill take you as far as
               california  if we can even make
               that  after that im cutting you
               loose

                         grace
               but i want to say with you

                         john
               why  so when the cops catch up with
               us you can try and sell me out
               again  you take your hald of the
               money and run  you might want to
               try mexico  with all that dough

                         grace

                         john
               i think youre a lying back
               stabbing bitch  but its nice to
               know you care

     john goes back to the trunk and jakes body

                         john
               come on jake  time to go for a
               walk

     john grabs a beer from a six pack and shoves it into the
     pocket of jakes coat  he lifts the body and carries it
     towards the ridge

                         john
               poor old jake  had a fight with
               his wife a few too many drinks
               wandered out into the desert and
               fell off a cliff  you got to be
               more careful jake

     john reaches the edge of the ridge  he stands jake up and
     holds him so that they face each other

                         john
               well this is where we part company

     john leans close to jakes body as if whispering into his
     ear

                         john
               you shouldve just let me go into
               the bedroom  i would have killed
               for you  now look at yourself  oh
               well  bye bye and thanks for the
               loan

     john opens his hands and lets jakes body tumble backwards
     down to the ridge several meters below

                         john
               now all we have to do is try and

     john turns  grace is standing directly behind him  he is
     startled and begins to fall backward  the camera angles on
     graces hands at johns chest but we cant tell if she is
     grabbing for him or pushing him  john falls landing on the
     ridge below next to jakes body

                                                            cut to

     wide shot  the desert

     grace stands on the ridge and john and jake on the ledge
     below  we hear graces voice calling out

                         grace
               john    john

     the camera closes tight on john  we see his eyes flutter

                         grace
               john

                         john
               grace

     john stirs  he tries to sit up and a wave of pain crosses
     his body  his scream echoes across the empty desert

                         grace
               are you all right

                         john
               i think i busted my leg

                         grace
               can you climb back up

     john tries to pull himself up the side of the ridge but the
     pain is too great  he slumps back down on the ground

                         john
               i cant make it  grace  grace

                         grace
               im here

                         john
               grace listen to me  in the trunk
               of my car is a rope  it should
               reach down here  got get it throw
               it down and ill climb up

                         grace
               ill get it

     john slumps further with pain

     grace runs back to the car  she sees the rope in the open
     trunk  she starts to make a grab for it then stops  she
     thinks for a moment before slamming the trunk closed
     running quickly to the drivers side she hops in the mustang
     and grabs for the ignition key  her hand fumbles at it for
     a moment then she realizes the key isnt there  a look of
     panic floods her face  she jumps from the car and runs back
     to the ridge  she goes down on her stomach dangling her
     head over the lip of the cliff as if to get closer to john

                         grace
               john  can you hear me  are you
               still there

                         john
               where the hell am i going to go

                         grace
               john you have to throw the keys up
               to me

     johns painfully fishes the keys from his pocket  he is about
     to throw them up to grace when he stops and thinks

                         grace
               john throw me the keys

                         john

               when i took out jakes body

               why dont you come down and get them
               so i can wring your pretty little
               neck

     grace rolls on her back and looks up at the sky shielding
     her eyes with her hand  she rolls over again and yells down
     to john

                         grace
               john if you dont throw me the
               keys then ill just walk away

     grace stands and walks back to the car  she takes the
     backpack full of money slings it over her shoulder and
     heads out into the desert

     he reaches over to jake and pulls the beer from his pocket
     he pops it open
