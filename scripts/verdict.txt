                        dr thompson  from your review of 
                        the hospital records of may twelfth 
                        nineteen seventysix  in your 
                        opinion what happened to deborah 
                        ann kaye

                                    dr thompson
                        cardiac arrest  during delivery 
                        her heart stopped  when the heart 
                        stops the brains deprived of 
                        oxygen  you get brain damage  
                        that is why shes in the state 
                        shes in today

                                    galvin
                        now dr towlers testified that 
                        they restored the heartbeat within 
                        three or four minutes  in your 
                        opinion is his estimate correct

                                    dr thompson
                        its my opinion it took him much 
                        longer  nineten minutes  
                        theres too much brain damage

                               to dr thompson
                        are you saying that a failure to 
                        restore the heartbeat within nine 
                        minutes in itself constitutes bad 
                        medical practice

                                    dr thompson
