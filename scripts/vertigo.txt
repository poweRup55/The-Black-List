               we see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of 
               a fire escape in the bag are large skyscrapers with all 
               their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon this 
               background is used for the credit titles of the picture  
               after the last card has faded out we hold on to the empty 
               parapet when suddenly a mans hand reaches and grips the 
               top of the rail it is followed by another hand and after a 
               beat we see the face of a man in his early 30s he is an 
               italian type with rough features he turns quickly and looks 
               below him and then turning back springs up over the empty 
               parapet and is lost from view we stay on the empty scene 
               for a second or two as we hear the scraping of boots on the 
               iron ladder someone else is coming up presently two more 
               hands and the head of a uniformed policeman with cap and 
               badge starts to climb over the parapet the camera pulls 
               back so that by the time he has completed his climb he is 
               in full figure he dashes out of the picture drawing his 
               gun  immediately following him over the parapet a detective 
               in plain clothes climbs over this is john ferguson known 
               as scottie he too pulls a gun and dashes out of the picture

               a vast panorama of the san francisco skyline nearer to us 
               are three tiny figures running and jumping over the roof 
               tops the man on the run whom we first saw climb over the 
               parapet is dressed in a white shirt and light tan linen 
               slacks and wearing sneakers the uniformed man is shooting 
               at him scottie is dressed in medium grey clothes the camera 
               slowly pans the group across the roof tops

               we now see a short gap between rooftops with a drop below  
               the pursued man makes the leap successfully followed by the 
               uniformed policeman scottie makes the same leap but almost 
               trips in taking off and is thrown off balance he tries to 
               recover lands awkwardly on the opposite roof and falls 
               forward prone with a heavy impact that hurts and drives 
               tile breath from his body he tries to rise but raises his 
               head with a look of pain  one leg is doubled up under the 
               other the tiles give way and he slides backwards and his 
               legs go over the edge of the roof then his body in his 
               daze he grasps at the loose tiles and as he goes over the 
               edge he clutches on to the gutter which gives way and he 
               swings off into space looking down

               from scotties viewpoint the gap beneath the building and 
               the ground below it seems to treble its depth

               scottie looking down with horror his eyes close as a wave 
               of nausea overcomes him

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk  medium shot

               in the distance the fleeing criminal the policeman seeing 
               what has happened to scottie returns to the slope of the 
               roof and strains to reach down to scottie

                                     policeman
                         give me your hand

               the tips of the fingers of policeman straining to reach 
               scottie are at the top of screen scottie begins to open 
               his grip but stares down he quickly resumes his grip looking 
               up hopelessly towards the helping hand he looks down again  
               from scotties viewpoint  the ground below still a long way 
               away

               the policemans hand in foreground his face beyond

                                     policeman

                         your hand

               policeman endeavors to stretch out his hand further

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk

               the tiles beneath the policemans heel begin to give the 
               policeman starts to slide he claws desperately at the surface 
               of the roof

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk  closeup

               scottie his eyes closed he opens them as he hears a wild 
               cry

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk  long shot

               the policeman falling through space

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk  closeup

               scottie stares down in horror

               ext san francisco roof tops  dusk  long shot

               the body of the policeman sprawled on the ground below  
               people are running into the alleyway they stare at the body 
               look up to where scottie is hanging we see the light on 
               their upturned faces and now we hear a police whistle blown 
               shrilly again and again  up to this moment the background 
               music has had an excitement to match the scene and now it 
               cuts off abruptly leaving on the echo of the police whistle 
               as the dissolve begins then in the dissolve we hear the 
               gentle insistence of scarlatti played by a chamber orchestra

                                                               dissolve to

               phonograph records pictures the most striking feature of 
               the apartment is the view the rising hills of san francisco 
               framed by a large picture window to one side of the window 
               is the owner of the apartment majorie wood called midge 
               at a commercial drawing table concentrating with professional 
               intensity on a drawing of a slim a elongated woman with few 
               features and fewer clothes a brassiere sits on a table at 
               midges elbow and she studies it as she draws midge wood 
               is about thirtyseven attractive straightforward well

               an and off as they do in the movies the music comes from a 
               gramophone the other occupant of the room is scottie he 
               sits in a big chair with his feet stretched out on an ottoman 
               and his head far back there is a drink on a table nearby 
               he rouses himself to reach for it and in doing so knocks 
               over his walking stick that has been propped against the 
               chair he reaches out to catch it and in the quickness of 
               trying to keep it from falling he wrenches his body around

                         a time progressively see

               he has been looking about eagerly sees a low footstool 
               drags it to the center of the room as he speaks

                                     scottie

                         the golden gate bridge

               he has stepped up on the footstool and stands there proudly 
               looking up and down

                                     scottie

               she dashes to the kitchen returns quickly with a small 
               aluminum household ladder

                                     scottie
                         ah thats my girl here

               he steps on the first step

                         step number two

                                     scottie
                         okay

               he gets up on the second step and goes through the routine

                                     scottie
                         i look up i look down i look up i

                         here we go

               he gets on the top step

                                     midge

                         down i look up 

               and at this moment he makes the mistake of turning and looking 
               out through the picture window

               from scotties viewpoint

               we see the depth down to the street below the window the 
               whole picture begins to weave

               int midges apartment  late afternoon  closeup

               of scottie  expression of nausea

               from scotties view point  long shot

               the weaving view changes to the original scene where the 
               ground receded in a rush and the body of the policeman fell 
               into space

               int midges apartment  late afternoon  medium close

               shot

               scotties face distorted with agony  his eyes close and he 
               begins to slump camera pulls back slightly as midge now 
               comes into shot putting up her hands to him to hold him 
               and his weight is on her and his head is slumped and the 
               joke is over

                                     midge

                              muttering his face 
                              tight his eyes shut
                         oh damn it damn it damn it

               a wellappointed office with a large window looking out upon 
               a busy shipyard there are a couple of models of modern 
               freighters in glass cases but more important on the walls 
               are many framed prints and posters and maps relating to early 
               california history some from the mexican days many from 
               the gold rush days many of san francisco in the seventies 
               and eighties behind the desk sits gavin elster a man about 
               scotties age huskily built slightly balding with cool 
               watchful eyes he is beautifully tailored and gives the 
               sense of a man who relishes money and knows how to use it  
               he sits quietly watching scottie who stands staring out the 
               window at the activity of the shipyard after a long moment

                                     scottie

               scottie shoots him a small surprised smile of approval at 
               his frankness then looks out the window again

                 scottie smiles at the old prints on the wall

                                     scottie
                         like all this

               though he does not stress the word the way be lingers softly 
               on the word freedom makes scottie look over at him again  
               elster looks up and smiles companionably

                                     elster
                         shouldnt you be sitting down

                              scottie nods
                         a permanent physical disability

                         thing it just means i cant climb 
                         steep stairs or go to high places 
                         like the bar at the topofthemark
                         but 
                              shrugs and smiles
                          there are plenty of streetlevel 
                         bars in this town

               elster considers the top of his desk for a moment then looks 
               up

                                     elster
                         would you like a drink now

                                     scottie
                         no no thanks a bit early in the 
                         day for spirits
                              pause

                         shipbuilding business
                              pause
                         whats on your mind gavin

               a moment then elster rises from the desk casually wanders 
               across the room looks out the window gets out a handkerchief 
               and blows his nose prosaically finally turns and regards 
               scottie coolly and directly for a long moment

                                     elster
                         i asked you to come up here scottie 
                         knowing that you had quit detective

                         would go back on the job  as a 
                         special favor to me

               scottie looks at him questioningly

                                     elster

               scottie does not change expression and yet one can sense 
               the feeling of anticlimax within him and the almost 
               imperceptible small cynical smile deep behind his eyes

                         about something nothing at all and 
                         suddenly the words fade into silence 
                         and a cloud comes into her eyes and 
                         they go blank and she is somewhere 
                         else away from me someone i dont 
                         know i call to her and she doesnt 
                         hear and then with a long sigh she 
                         is back and looks at me brightly 
                         and doesnt know shes been away

               elster almost ignores the question as he looks back to the 
               day

                                     elster

                         someone i didnt know walking in 
                         a different way holding her head

                         sat on a bench at the edge of the 
                         lake and stared across the water to 
                         the old pillars that stand an the 
                         far shore the portals of the past

                         when the change has begun she looks 
                         so lovely and normal

                 the last part of this speech carries through the dissolve

                                                               dissolve to

               int ernies restaurant  night

               we are in the upstairs room that in mood and decor takes 
               us back to bonanza days this is the way san francisco was  
               scottie is at the bar turned a little so that he faces into 
               the dining room and as he drinks his eyes search the room 
               slowly carefully

               the camera searches with him passing over the many well
               dressed women until it comes to rest on a table for two 
               dressed against the far wall gavin elster is seated there 
               dining with his wife scottie cannot get a clear look at 
               her she is turned slightly away from him and when she does 
               turn her head in his direction there always seems to be a 
               waiter passing to block the view and during all of this we 
               hear elsters voice continuing from the previous scene

                                     elsters voice
                         but i realize now that the deep change 
                         began on the first day i brought her 
                         to san francisco you know what san 
                         francisco does to people who have 
                         never seen it before all of it 
                         happened to madeleine but with such 
                         an intensity as to be almost 
                         frightening she was like a child 
                         came home everything about the city 
                         excited her she had to walk all the 
                         hills explore the edge of the ocean 
                         see all the old houses and wander 
                         the old streets and when she came 
                         upon something unchanged something 
                         that was as it had been her delight 
                         was so strong so fiercely possessive  
                         these things were hers and yet she 
                         had never been here before she had 
                         been born and raised in the east i 
                         liked it at first of course i love 
                         this place i wanted my bride to 
                         love it  but then it began to make 
                         me uneasy  her delight was too 
                         strong her excitement was too 
                         intense it never faded her laugh 
                         was too loud her eyes sparkled too 
                         brightly there was something feverish 
                         about the way she embraced the city 
                         she possessed it  and then one day 
                         she changed again  and a great 
                         sigh settled on her and the cloud 
                         came into her eyes

               now gavin elster has signed the check and he and his wife 
               rise and start for the door scottie still cannot get an 
               unobstructed view of her face but we can see in flashes 
               that she is young in her twenties with a mobile attractive 
               face and gentle eyes that have warmth and intelligence and 
               humor  scottie is intent on her at the doorway to the bar 
               only two feet from him she stops and waits as her husband 
               pauses behind her to speak to the headwaiter and thank him 
               and tip him she looks about calmly with sure distant 
               repose  her eyes come to rest an scottie for a moment then 
               move an with the small smile  during all of the above 
               elsters voice has gone on without pauses and his narration 
               ends as the girl madeleine comes to a stop near scottie 
               and waits

                                     elsters voice
                         i dont know what happened that day 
                         where she went what she saw what 
                         she did but on that day the search 
                         was ended she had found what she 
                         was looking for she had come home 
                         and something in the city possessed 
                         her

               as scottie stares at her their eyes meet for a moment and 
               he turns to reach for his drink when he turns back she is 
               gone he looks about slightly startled then catches a 
               glimpse of her as she turns the corner of the upstairs lobby 
               his eyes grow thoughtful and glow with the memory of her 
               face

                                                               dissolve to

               of a minute or so suddenly we see gavins wife madeleine

               the green jaguar comes to a stop outside a large house which 
               has seen grander days obviously an old san francisco 
               residence it is now become an apartment hotel a long flight 
               of steps from the street leads to the front door which has 
               a semicircular canopy supported by columns

               madeleine gets out and ascends the stairs toward the hotel 
               entrance she is still carrying the posy of flowers

               scotties car pulls into the curb he gets out and stands on 
               the sidewalk and looks ahead of him he walks forward out of 
               the picture

               we see scottie walking along the sidewalk casually the green 
               car is at the curb at the left of the stairs to the hotel 
               he strolls up until he reaches the green car

               ext mckittrick hotel  day  medium shot

               shooting over the green car we see scottie hovering around 
               the bottom of the steps there is no sign of madeleine she 
               has obviously gone in by this time scottie turns and examines 
               the facade of the hotel and over his shoulder the camera 
               pans up over the building where we see the name in worn 
               black lettering under the top cornice

               ext mckittrick hotel  day  closeup

               scottie turns away from the hotel and glances in the direction 
               of the car he then turns and ponders what his next move 
               should be no looks back at the hotel suddenly his eye 
               catches sight of something he hastens over to conceal himself 
               by the entrance wall the camera panning him  his eyes go 
               up again

               ext mckittrick hotel  day  long shot

               from his viewpoint we see madeleine appear in the corner 
               second story window she is glancing out casually as she 
               takes off the jacket of her suit she turns into the room 
               again

               ext mckittrick hotel  day  closeup

               scottie is really puzzled by this appearance he thinks for 
               a while and then making up his mind starts to go up the 
               steps the camera panning him we see him reach the top stop 
               and make for the front door

               ext mckittrick hotel  day  medium shot

               scottie waits a slight moment and then bracing him himself 
               opens the door and passes through

               int mckittrick hotel lobby  day  semicloseup

               scottie comes through the door closes it behind him he looks 
               around

               int mckittrick hotel lobby  day

               from scotties viewpoint we see most of the lobby there is 
               a small reception desk with a key rack to one side but the 
               strongest and most immediate impact is one of greenery of 
               foliage scattered about the lobby in profusion are tall 
               standing potted rubber plants and philodendron  scottie 
               stands and stares there is no one to be seen no sign of 
               life then we see a leaf of a rubber plant move and move 
               again a hand appears seemingly caressing it and then we 
               hear a womans voice

                                     manageress
                         yes

               scottie looks in that direction and the woman moves out 
               from behind the plant she is a small gentle elderly lady 
               with white hair motherly and smiling with bright eager 
               eyes

                                     manageress
                         is there something i can do for you

                                     scottie

                                     scottie
                         would you tell me who has the room 
                         on the second floor in the corner 
                         that corner

                         the law of course i dont think 
                         any of them would mind really but 
                         still i would have to know who you 
                         are and ask 

               by now scottie has got out his wallet and has shown his badge 
               and the sight of it makes her stop abruptly and for a moment 
               her face hardens and is not a bit motherly but then she 
               recovers her innocent brightness

                                     manageress

               we are in the living room of a comfortable a bachelor 
               apartment there is a picture window that looks up to coit 
               tower on telegraph hill the room is softly lit a fire is 
               lit in the fireplace the logs are blazing well scottie in 
               a pair of grey trousers and an old sweater is wandering 
               about the room trying to think things out through an open 
               door we can see into a small kitchen where madeleines clothes  
               all of them  hang on a cord over the electric stove drying 
               and through another open door we can see into the bedroom 
               where madeleine lies in the largerthansingle bed under 
               the covers asleep she sighs and turns restlessly and 
               scottie glances at her from the livingroom as he wanders 
               and then she turns again and the sigh becomes words spoken 
               in sleep and he stops and listens

                                     madeleine
                              faintly distantly
                         please thank you please

               scottie waits taut but there is no more he starts to turn 
               away and suddenly still distant but more clearly

                                     madeleine
                              appealingly
                         where is my child have you seen 
                         my child

               scottie stiffens with the shock of recognition and his eyes 
               go wide with apprehension staring at the lost eyeclosed 
               troubled woman in the bed and at that moment the telephone 
               on the bedside table rings sharply he makes a dash for it  
               the ringing brings the woman to with a sharp start and she 
               instinctively clutches the bedclothes to her chin and raises 
               up a little and stares with wideeyed fright at the man 
               running towards her scottie takes the phone

                                     scottie
                         yes no its all right ill 
                         call you back yes yes

               he hangs up and tries to smile down at madeleine who has 
               not moved but has followed his every move with fright and 
               apprehension

                                     scottie
                         are you all right

               no answer only the eyes staring at him and then he realizes 
               with some embarrassment that she cannot move that she is 
               naked under the bedclothes and he reaches across to the 
               dressing gown he has laid out for her on the bed and moves 
               it closer to her

                                     scottie
                         oh youll want this

               he gives her a reassuring nod and smile straightens up and 
               goes to the door and goes into the living room closing the 
               bedroom door behind him and she stares after him as he goes  
               in the living room he moves to the fireplace puts another 
               log on and watches it catch the bedroom door behind him 
               opens and he turns to face madeleine  she has the dressing 
               gown belted tightly around the middle and holds it together 
               with one band at her breast and she stands there staring at 
               him nervously frightened not wanting to admit that she 
               does not know how she came there but wanting very much to 
               know and she cannot help herself knowing her own fears 
               she has to ask

                                     madeleine
                         why am i here what happened

                                     scottie
                         you
                              then not liking the 
                              sound of the truth
                         fell into the bay

               she puts a hand slowly to her hair understanding now why it 
               is wet

                                     scottie
                         i dried your hair as well as i could  
                         but youd better come here by the 
                         fire

               and now knowing that he dried her hair she realizes that 
               he must have taken her clothes off too and she looks down 
               at her body with deep awareness of her nakedness and draws 
               the dressing gown more closely to her and looks back at him 
               with frightened embarrassment and her head begins to move 
               quickly the eyes darting about the apartment as though 
               seeking a way of escape and she sees the clothes hanging in 
               the kitchen and she looks back to scottie appealingly  

                                     scottie
                         theyre almost at dry here why 
                         dont you come over here

               he pulls a lowstool over before the fire madeleine crosses 
               slowly keeping her eyes always on him and sinks down on 
               the stool he smiles a at her companionably

                                     scottie
                         would you like some coffee

               she shakes her head

                         youd better have some or would you 
                         rather have a drink

               she shakes her head again he pours a cup of coffee and places 
               it on the floor next to her along with a bowl of sugar cubes

                                     madeleine
                              wonderingly
                         fell into the bay

               she looks up at him he nods

                         and you fished me out

               he nods she gives him a small grateful smile

                         downtown shopping

               and scottie sighs inwardly having proved something

                                     scottie
                         please drink your coffee

                                     madeleine
                         youre not merely direct what were 
                         you doing there at old fort point

                                     scottie
                         wandering about

                         you like it too

               he nods she smiles at him happily enjoying the warmth and 
               the coffee enjoying his presence seemingly almost to have 
               forgotten her nearness to death and scottie is fascinated 
               by this thing curled up before his fire

                                     madeleine
                              then with a wicked 
                              smile
                         and where had you been just 
                         before

               a moment as scottie takes a deep breath and then he decides 
               to chance it and see the reaction

                                     scottie
                         the palace of the legion of honor  
                         the art gallery

                                     madeleine
                              enthusiastically

                         ive never been inside but it looks 
                         so lovely driving past

               at the words ive never been inside scottie is startled  
               he stares at her and she looks at him with naive happy 
               inquisitiveness and their looks are joined finally she 
               drops her eyes and smiles timidly

                                     madeleine
                              softly

                         no

               she reaches up to feel her hair

                                     madeleine
                         when you
                              and suddenly conscious 
                              of her nakedness 
                              again and embarrassed
                         there were pins in my hair

                                     scottie
                         oh yes here

               he crosses the room swiftly picks up an ash tray in which 
               he had deposited her hairpins takes her handbag from a chair 
               and brings them to her

                                     madeleine
                         thank you

               she proceeds to do up her hair he watches her held by the 
               movement of her body under the dressing gown as she raises 
               her arms and deftly sets about putting her hair in order at 
               one point as she works she looks up and flashes him a direct 
               smile

                                     madeleine

               he nods a cloud comes over her eyes she looks away

                                     madeleine
                              softly

                         no its wrong

               then she looks up with a small smile and the cloud is gone 
               from her eyes and she speaks completely matteroffactly

                                     madeleine
                              simply

               scottie nods almost imperceptibly with his eyes he looks at 
               her for a long moment then

                                     scottie
                         will you tell me something has this 
                         ever happened to you before

                                     madeleine
                              startled
                         what

                                     scottie
                         falling into san francisco 
                         bay

               she laughs with relief for it seemed to her for a quick 
               moment that he was going to say falling in love

                                     madeleine
                         no never before ive fallen into 
                         lakes out of rowboats when i was a 
                         little girl and i fell into a river 
                         once trying to leap from one stone 
                         to another but ive never fallen 
                         into san francisco bay have you 
                         ever before

                                     scottie
                              grinning
                         no this is the first time for me 
                         too

               and they laugh together with genuine warmth and friendliness 
               in their eyes and it is obvious they are very much taken 
               with each other and as they laugh simultaneously she 
               reaches for the cup of coffee to take another sip and he 
               reaches for it meaning to take it and refill it

                                     scottie
                         here let me give you a lit 

               and his hand falls on her outstretched arm and stays there 
               and with the contact made the laughter dies suddenly and 
               he is looking down at her intently and their eyes have met 
               and hers are anxious and wondering and at that moment the 
               telephone rings sharply scottie races into the bedroom 
               closing the door behind him and gets to the phone

                                     scottie

                         she went into the bay

               there is a long silence

                                     scottie
                         hello

                         worry about but she doesnt know  
                         you understand that she doesnt 
                         know what she did

               another long silence

                                     elsters voice
                         scottie madeleine is twentysix  
                         carlotta valdes committed suicide 
                         when she was twentysix

               and now it is scotties turn to be silent he hangs up slowly 
               and moves across the room to the door

               int the living room  night

               scottie enters from the bedroom and stops surprised the 
               room is empty the clothes are gone from the in the kitchen

               ext street outside scotties apartment  night

               a car is moving down the hill on the opposite side of the 
               street it begins to turn in toward the sidewalk and then 
               comes to a sudden stop

               ext scotties apartment  night  closeup

               midge is behind the wheel she is staring out of the side of 
               the window and we see what has made her come to a sudden 
               stop

               ext scotties apartment  night

               from midges point of view madeleine outside scotties 
               door hurries to the green jaguar

               int midges car  night

               midge watches madeleine almost wistfully and there is a 
               small look of hurt in her eyes but even to herself she has 
               to cover and she smiles ironically

               ext scotties apartment  night

               the jaguar pulls away and passes out of view

               int midges car  night

               midge is still staring across at scotties house and the 
               soft smile on her lips covers the hurt well but there is 
               still a shadow of it in her eyes

                                     midge
                              softly
                         well now johnnyo was it a 
                         ghost and was it fun

               then she suddenly changes expression

                                     midge
                         oops

               she takes her foot off the brake and turning hard on the 
               wheel straightens the car up and drives on

               ext scotties apartment  night

               the door to scotties apartment has opened and scottie stands 
               in the doorway looking up and down the street for the jaguar 
               his tall frame silhouetted in the light streaming from the 
               room

                                                               dissolve to

               see madeleine emerge she is dressed completely different 
               from the night before she makes her way down to the jaguar 
               in the fg she gets in starts up and swings the car round 
               toward the camera she passes out of the picture

               than it turns right then it turns left again

               scottie looks a little dizzy with the constant turning we 
               stay with him a little while and we can see from the scene 
               behind him that we are still turning left and right

               the jaguar speeds up its going down a street not turning

               the jaguar turns right into a narrow curving street and 
               finally comes to a sudden stop ahead

               int scotties car  day  closeup

               scottie now wears a look of great astonishment as he pulls 
               up hurriedly in the middle of the street

               ext san francisco street  day  semilong shot

               from his viewpoints we see the reason for his astonishment  
               madeleine has alighted and is approaching of all places 
               toward his own red front door

               ext san francisco street  day  medium shot

               scottie pulls his car over to the curb and gets out the 
               camera pans him down he stops short just before he reaches 
               madeleine to see her take a letter from her handbag and put 
               it into his letter box he moves up to her

                                     scottie
                         is that for me

               madeleine turns quickly startled and then sees who it is 
               and smiles

                                     madeleine
                         oh yes hello

                              flashing a smile
                         oh yes fine no after effects
                              then ruefully

                         was cold wasnt it

                         not at all i enjoyed 

               and he stops short now truly embarrassed and she looks at 
               him with wide eyes waiting for him to go on

                                     scottie

               an awkward pause scottie turns abruptly to the door getting 
               out his key

                                     scottie

               he opens the door and bends down to pick up the letter as 
               he is reaching for it he turns his head and speaks almost 
               without thinking

                                     scottie
                         would you like some coffee

                              quickly
                         no no thank you

               she says it so impulsively and with such young vehemence 
               that they both start to laugh he straightens up and opens 
               the letter

                                     madeleine

                         for coit tower

               he reads the letter as she watches him he looks up

                                     scottie

               they smile at one another and there is a nice moment of 
               silent rapport then

                                     madeleine
                         goodbye

                         goodbye

               she turns and goes to her car as he stands watching her and 
               gets in behind the wheel

                                     scottie
                              suddenly walking
                         where are you going

               and he races to the car and leans in the window she watches 
               him openmouthed as he crosses the sidewalk then

                                     madeleine

                         occupation isnt it

               and she waits with a small smile

                                     scottie
                         dont you think its sort of a waste 
                         for the two of us to

                                     madeleine

                         is a wanderer two together are 
                         always going somewhere

                                     scottie
                         no no i dont think thats 
                         necessarily true

               and now he waits hopefully

                                     madeleine
                              with a smiling nod
                         you left your door open

               he turns his head startled and annoyed than makes a dash 
               for the door as he goes he turns his head to call back to 
               her

                                     scottie
                         dont move

               and he hurries on to the door she watches him go and we 
               are close on her face to see her genuine amusement and then 
               the laughter fades a little and a troubled look comes into 
               her eyes a touch of concern

                                                               dissolve to

               seeming obvious

                         of all the people who have been

                              simply
                         knowing i have to die

               she looks up at him with a shy embarrassed smile then 
               seeing the wandering look in his eyes she brightens quickly

                                     madeleine
                         but i like the stream its a lovely 
                         stream

               she leaves him and moves quickly out onto the bridge and 
               loans on the railing to watch the water rippling below and 
               then as he approaches her she turns and looks at him wide
               eyed

                                     madeleine
                         but it makes no sound listen

               she listens intensely for a long moment and looks at him 
               anxiously

                                     madeleine
                         do you hear anything

                                     scottie
                              shaking his head
                         only silence its always like this

                                     madeleine
                              wondering
                         and no birds sing

                                     scottie
                         no birds live here

                         no

               she turns away with gentle somber selfcontained wonder 
               and they cross back to the path in silence and wander on 
               along the path in silence we watch them move away in the 
               distance disappear behind a tree then come into view again 
               and now there comes into view the crosssection of a redwood 
               tree that is on exhibit with certain of its rings marked to 
               show what it has lived through and they approach it

                                     scottie
                         would you like a drink of water  

                                     madeleine
                         no thank you

               scottie moves to the small upright drinking fountain as 
               madeleine approaches the tree section and stands before it 
               and studies it scottie gets a drink of water then comes up 
               behind madeleine and stands and she is seemingly unaware of 
               his presence their backs are to the camera  insert of rings 
               on the tree marked with dates beginning near the center 
               with the date 909 ad and ending with 1930  tree cut down

               we see the two profiles madeleine staring at the tree 
               scottie staring at madeleine she raises one gloved hand and 
               almost idly begins to trace a finger up along the white line 
               that is marked 1776 declaration of independence and as the 
               hand moves a little to the left madeleine begins to speak 
               almost vacantly oblivious of all but this piece of tree 
               and herself

                                     madeleine
                         somewhere in here i was born and 
                         here i died and it was only a moment 
                         for you you took no notice

                              almost sharply
                         madeleine

               she turns her head to him only now aware of his presence 
               and stares at him without expression then slowly she turns 
               and walks away and the camera panning her slightly brings 
               the head and shoulders of scottie into the foreground and 
               he watches her wondering anxiously trying to put things 
               together in his mind madeleine walks on until she disappears 
               behind one of the distant redwoods

               the camera moves over as though it is scottie looking it 
               moves far enough to reveal that madeleine is no longer there  
               she seems to have disappeared

               ext red woods  day  medium shot

               scottie comes forward the camera panning him to get a better 
               view of where madeleine went

               the camera in scotties position moving around shows that 
               there is no sign of madeleine whatsoever

               the camera dollies scottie down toward the trees

               camera is now among the trees where madeleine was last seen  
               as it travels across them it finally brings her into view  
               shes leaning against a tree with her head bent back

               she is breathing heavily in the background we see scottie 
               approaching her as he comes up to her the camera eases 
               back and moves around until it faces her and scottie

               she opens her eyes slowly and looks at him recognizing 
               him and yet not quite as though she were slightly 
               hypnotized  scottie speaks gently

               her head continues to move back and forth gently denying  
               his voice is more positive now more urgently demanding

               the head moves more rapidly now as though denying some

               the rapidly moving head stops short and her eyes open wide 
               and she cries out

               watching her knowing he can push it no further

               he looks down at her somberly promising and refusing nothing 
               they start walking holding together and the two figures 
               become small in the distance moving away through the tall

               sits in the car watching her she does not move then slowly 
               she starts to walk toward the sea and as he watches he 
               senses without being sure that her pace is increasing and 
               suddenly he opens the car door and jumps out and slams the 
               door and begins to run but then he sees something and slows 
               down quickly and walks for madeleine has stopped and turned 
               and is waiting for him there is a gentle apologetic smile 
               in her eyes she waits and he comes to a stop before her

                         no

               she looks up at him rebuffed desperately lost and her 
               eyes well with tears scottie is looking away lost in 
               thought

                                     scottie

                              quietly lost
                         and so explain it away  but there 
                         is a way to explain it you see if 
                         im mad that would explain it 
                         wouldnt it

               scottie looks at her and her eyes are big with fright and 
               despair and a plea for denial and suddenly she breaks and 
               the tears flow and she turns her head away sharply and turns 
               and runs toward the edge of the land

                                     scottie
                         madeleine

               he races after her and catches her and holds her and she is 
               against him clinging tightly deep in his embrace and 
               sobbing fiercely

                                     madeleine
                              muffled against his 
                              breast

                         want to die but theres someone 
                         inside me theres a somebody else 
                         and she says i must die scottie

                              she looks up
                         you wont let it happen

               her face is close to his and they are clinging tightly 
               together he shakes his head and then suddenly his mouth is 
               on hers and they are deep in a kiss their lips part but 
               remain close together

                                     madeleine
                              whispering
                         dont leave me stay with me

                                     scottie
                         all the time

               they kiss again passionately and the wind blows and the 
               waves dash against the rocks throwing up a curtain of spray

                                                               dissolve to

               int midges apartment  night

               outside the terrace darkness is falling and the lights of 
               the city have come on in midges apartment the lights are 
               on and soft music comes from the radio possibly progressive 
               jazz of the gentle george shearing kind midge is painting 
               at a standing easel she has a palette obviously she is 
               painting in oils we cannot see what she is painting the 
               canvas on stretchers has its back to us its size is about 
               thirty by forty inches whatever it is it seems to please 
               her she pauses in her work picks up a highball from a table 
               nearby drinks and stares at the painting and giggles a little 
               to herself than applies a few more daubs now she hears the 
               outside gate slam she puts down the brush and the drink 
               moves the easel a bit so that the canvas cannot be seen from 
               the front door picks up a water tumbler that contains a 
               small nosegay and hurries out to the kitchen with it the 
               door to the apartment slams

               watches him

               she crosses the room to get her own drink giving a flick of 
               a glance at the canvas as she goes scottie watches her 
               slightly amused knowing that her curiosity is working like 
               mad

                                     scottie

                         naturally

                              with small grin
                         wandering

               he takes another long pull and wanders over and sweetens the 
               drink midge moves a little to block his view of the easel 
               and canvas

                                     scottie
                         what have you been doing

               he wanders back into the room

                                     midge
                         oh im having a wonderful time  
                         ive gone back to my first love

                                     scottie
                         good ive always said you were 
                         wasting your time in the underwear 
                         department

                                     midge
                         well its a living but im excited 
                         about this

                                     scottie
                         what is it a still life

                                     midge
                         no not exactly want to see

               scottie moves toward the easel and midge backs away so that 
               as he comes around to face the canvas she in beyond him in 
               back of him as he moves toward the easel

                                     midge
                         as a matter of fact i thought i 
                         might give it to you

                                     scottie
                              smiling surprised
                         oh

               and now he comes around to face the easel and stops to look  
               beyond him midges face has a great smile of anticipation  
               and now we see what he sees the camera rests on the lower 
               half of the canvas and we see the folds of the blue and gold 
               gown and the two hands one holding the nosegay the camera 
               pans up to reveal that it is a hasty but quite creditable 
               copy of the portrait of carlotta half size but there is 
               one difference the face is midges face

               int midges apartment  night

               scottie staring at the portrait beyond him midge smiling 
               with anticipation scotties face is drained and 
               expressionless and a deep look of sadness and regret comes 
               into his eyes

               pause

                                     scottie
                              softly
                         not funny midge

               midges smile fades she is puzzled and surprised scottie 
               puts down his drink gently and without looking at her starts 
               for the door

                                     midge
                         johnny

               scottie takes his hat from the chair and moves on to the 
               door midge completely taken aback starts for him

                                     midge
                         but johnny i thought you would 

               she breaks off as he turns his head to look at her hes not 
               at all angry but disturbed inside and sorry it happened

                                     scottie
                              nicely
                         well make that movie some other 
                         night huh

               and he goes out the door and closes it behind him

                                     midge
                              desperately apologetic
                         but johnny

               and she stares at the door with a wellillbedamned 
               expression and now abruptly she gets angry at herself

                                     midge
                         ah no

               she turns away and moves toward the canvas

                                     midge
                         oh marjorie wood you fool

               she stops before the canvas and stares at her face in the 
               portrait and all her anger at herself comes out in one great 
               blast of scorn

                                     midge
                              at the portrait
                         oh

               and she picks up a brush and with three vicious daubs paints 
               a moustache and a beard on her image  then she throws the 
               brush out the window

                                                               dissolve to

               ext union square  night

               it is about 3 am the square is deserted  perhaps an odd 
               taxi or car drives by we see scottie a solitary figure 
               walking by his attitude head down hands thrust into his 
               pockets we see that he is lost in thought wrestling with 
               his problem

                                                               dissolve to

               the window we can barely distinguish coit tower in the 
               beginning of a grey dawn  the doorbell begins to ring

                         there was a village square a green 
                         with trees and an old whitewashed 
                         spanish church with a cloister  
                         across the green a big grey wooden 
                         house with a porch and shutters and 
                         a balcony above a small garden 
                         and next to it a livery stable 
                         with old carriages lined up inside

               scottie has been listening intently with growing awareness 
               and now as she mentions the livery stable his eyes glow 
               with the excitement of recognition

                         at the end of the green there was a 
                         whitewashed stone house with a lovely 
                         pepper tree at the corner

                         being pulled into darkness and i 
                         fought to wake up

               back to her and stands there looking up he raises his arms

               holds her tightly his head pressed down against hers and 
               she is looking past him her eyes wide with anxiety and a

               she looks up at him with deep regret and wonder in her eyes 
               then suddenly breaks from him and runs out the door he stands

               scottie runs in and looks around frantically the church is 
               empty a moment then he hears the sound of footsteps running 
               up wooden steps he turns in the direction of the sound 
               sees a door standing open at the side of the church and 
               through the door the beginning of a flight of steps he runs 
               to the open door and goes through

               scottie runs in stops at the foot of the steps hears the 
               running footsteps and looks up from his viewpoint we see 
               madeleine running up the open stairway that spirals up along 
               the walls of the high tower she is already well on her way  
               scottie is immediately stricken by vertigo and the tall 
               tower seems to slide away from him he makes an attempt to 
               start up the stairs flattens himself against the wall and 
               struggles up he claws his way up crosses over to the hand 
               handrailing and uses it to pull his body up the steps one 
               by one railing struggling for breath unable to call though 
               he tries and madeleine keeps running  madeleine reaches 
               the top goes through a small wooden door  we see it slam 
               hear it locked  scottie struggling up reaches a landing 
               next to a small open arch that looks out on the back garden 
               and has to stop to tight his nausea  there is a scream from 
               above through the arch he sees a body fall he calls

               the vertigo hits scottie again and the body and the root of 
               the cloister move and fall away into space and this

                                                      dissolves through to

               the body of the policeman falling from the rooftop tumbling 
               through space to the street below  scottie has to look away 
               in desperate horror he hears voices looks through the arch 
               again and sees two nuns hurrying across the garden from the 
               dormitory at the back looking up at the roof of the cloister  
               he turns and gazes down the great height he now has to 
               descend flattens himself against the wall and with 
               trancelike desperation tries to start moving

                                                                  fade out

               floor where the windows are open and from which a droning 
               voice can faintly be heard  the camera zooms up to the open 
               window and as it does the voice of the speaker becomes 
               louder and the words more intelligible

               people is at one side among the people assembled we see 
               the two nuns escorted by a priest gavin elster with

               his attorney some state patrolmen and of course scottie  
               next to him is a burly man in his fifties in civilian clothes 
               almost obviously a detective and obviously scotties one 
               friend there he is detective captain fred hansen of the san 
               francisco police

               at the front of the room is the official who is speaking a 
               rather testy old man behind him on the wall are an old 
               crudely handmade american flag from the last century and a 
               california bear flag

               note the first paragraph of the following speech covers 
               the rise and entrance of the camera and becomes intelligible

                         mr elster suspecting that all was 
                         not well with his wifes mental state 
                         took the preliminary precaution of 
                         having her watched by mr ferguson 
                         lest any harm befall her and you 
                         have heard that mr elster was 
                         prepared to take his wife to an 
                         institution where her mental health 
                         would have been in the hand of 
                         qualified specialists  and mr 
                         ferguson being an exdetective 
                         would have seemed the proper choice 
                         for the role of watchdog and 
                         protector as you have learned it 
                         was an unfortunate choice
                              pause
                         however i think you will agree that 
                         no blame can be attached to the 
                         husband his delay in putting his 
                         wife under medical care was due only 
                         to the need information as to her 
                         behavior that he expected to get 
                         from mr ferguson he had taken every 
                         precaution to protect his wife he 
                         could not have anticipated that mr  
                         fergusons weakness his fear of 
                         heights called acrophobia would 
                         make him powerless when he was most 
                         needed
                              pause
                         as to mr ferguson you have heard 
                         his former superior detective captain 
                         hansen from that great city to the 
                         north testify as to his character 
                         and ability captain hansen was most 
                         enthusiastic the fact that mr  
                         ferguson once before under similar 
                         circumstances allowed a police 
                         colleague to tall to his death 
                         captain hansen dismissed as an 
                         unfortunate incident

               captain hansens eyes narrow and his face reddens scottie 
               stares at the floor dully oblivious to what is being said

                                     official
                         of course mr ferguson is to be 
                         congratulated for having once saved 
                         the womans life when in a previous 
                         fit of aberration she threw herself 
                         into the bay it is a pity that 
                         knowing her suicidal tendencies he 
                         did not make a greater effort the 
                         second time but we are not here to 
                         pass judgment on mr fergusons lack 
                         of initiative he did nothing and 
                         the law has little to say on the 
                         subject of things left undone
                              pause
                         nor does his strange behavior after 
                         he saw the body fall have any bearing 
                         on your verdict he did not remain 
                         at the scone of the death he ran 
                         away  he claims he suffered a mental 
                         blackout and knew nothing more until 
                         he found himself back in his own 
                         apartment in san francisco several 
                         hours later you may accept that or 
                         not or you may believe that having 
                         once again allowed someone to die 
                         he could not face the tragic result 
                         of his own weakness and ran away 
                         that has nothing to do with your 
                         verdict  it is a matter between him 
                         and his conscience
                              pause
                         now from the evidence of the mind 
                         of madeleine elster prior to her 
                         death from the manner of her death 
                         and from the postmortem examination 
                         of the body showing the actual cause 
                         of her death you should have no 
                         difficulty in reaching your verdict 
                         gentlemen you may retire

               the foreman of the jury leans across to his colleagues and 
               they go into a huddle after a short whispered consultation 
               there is a general nodding of heads then the foreman stands

                                     foreman
                         weve reached the verdict

                                     official
                         and what is your verdict

                                     foreman
                         we find that madeleine elster 
                         committed suicide while being out of  
                         while being out of unsound mind

                                     official
                         your verdict will be so recorded  
                         dismissed

               people start to rise there is a general exodus toward the 
               doorway and the stairs leading down to the ground floor  
               scottie remains impassive still staring at the floor  people 
               stare at him curiously as they move past him and away  
               detective hansen rises takes him by the arm and helps him 
               to his feet

                                     hansen
                         lets go scottie
                              glares over at the 
                              official grimly
                         the son of a 

               he purses his lips and starts scottie toward the door gavin 
               elster moves toward them and they meet and have to stop  
               hansen looks at elster impassively

                                     elster
                         do you mind if i speak to him for a 
                         minute

               receiving no answers he takes scottie by the elbow

                                     elster
                         scottie 

               he leads scottie away toward the window they stop

                                     elster
                         scottie im sorry that was rough

               scottie finally looks up at him

                                     elster
                         he had no right to say that it was 
                         my responsibility you didnt know 
                         her i shouldnt have got you 
                         involved

                         to get as far away as i can probably 
                         europe and ill probably never come 
                         back
                              extends his hand

                         i can do for you before i go

               scottie looks at the outstretched hand then looks up at the 
               mans face wanting very much to tell him how he felt about 
               the dead woman but the words wont come elster drops his 
               hand with a sympathetic halfsmile and touches scottie 
               comfortingly on the arm

                                     elster
                         there was no way for them to 
                         understand but you and i know who 
                         killed madeleine

               elster and scottie look at each other for a moment then 
               elster nods somberly and turns away and goes down the stairs 
               with his attorney the room is empty now but for hansen 
               and scottie hansen waiting near the doorway looks across 
               to scottie standing alone by the window beyond scottie 
               through the window we can see the cloister across the green

                                                               dissolve to

               ext a cemetery south of san francisco   day

               it is grey and deserted in the distance a figure comes into 
               views walking slowly approaching a grave it is scottie

               ext a cemetery south of san francisco  day  medium

               shot

               a closer view brings him to a stop before the grave and he 
               stares down at it impassively the gravestone tells us it is 
               madeleines grave

                                                               dissolve to

               ext san francisco  night

               a foggy night the city hidden in mist the flash of beacons 
               fingers of fog the spasmodic growls and ories of fog horns

               int scotties bedroom  night

               scottie in bed sleeping restlessly his head fills the 
               screen rolls from side to side in a slow dissolve while 
               his head remains on the screen there comes into focus and 
               is superimposed as it gets closer the head and shoulders of 
               the portrait of carlotta the camera pans down until it 
               reveals the nosegay  the portrait is cleared from the screen 
               a new image is superimposed the final scene at the inquest 
               between scottie and gavin elster but this time though it 
               is not distinct a womans head can be discerned on elsters 
               shoulder elster turns to the woman and says tell him hes 
               not to blame tell him the woman turns her head to smile 
               at scottie it is carlotta valdes again dressed as in the 
               portrait with the necklace at her throats and she is alive 
               the picture fades away scotties restless head is alone on 
               the screen again

               another scene dissolves to the screen the graveyard at 
               mission dolores the camera is approaching the grave of 
               carlotta valdes now we see scottie approaching the grave  
               now the camera reverses moving closer to the grave it is 
               open there is a great black abyss with the headstone to 
               mark it

               a closeup of scottie coming to a stop as he stares down the 
               black depths of the grave fill the screen and now suddenly 
               we start to fall a big closeup of scottie his hair 
               windswept staring down in horror as he falls reverse angle 
               he is still falling but now from the tower of the mission 
               at san juan onto the roof where madeleine fell and at the 
               moment of impact the picture clears and scottie is sitting 
               up in bed staring ahead in horror awakened by the sound of 
               his own scream the scream is echoed by a fog horn in the 
               distance

                                                               dissolve to

               int sanitarium bedroom  day

               we see a portable phonograph with a record on and we hear 
               mozart at his gayest most incisive most sparkling  and 
               then we find midge standing nearby smiling across at scottie 
               who is seated in a wheelchair wearing a dressing gown over 
               pajamas his face is gaunt and expressionless we are in a 
               light and pleasant bedsitting room through the window we 
               can see a lovely garden and a few patients accompanied by 
               nurses strolling along the paths

                                     midge
                              brightly
                         its mozart wolfgang amadeus i had 
                         a long talk with the lady in musical 
                         therapy and she said mozarts the 
                         boy for you johnny the broom that 
                         sweeps the cobwebs away thats what 
                         the lady said you know its 
                         wonderful how theyve got it all 
                         taped now john theyve got music 
                         for melancholiacs and music for 
                         dipsomaniacs and music for 
                         nymphomaniacs i wonder what would 
                         happen if somebody mixed up their 
                         files

               there is no reaction on scotties face and midge makes a 
               grimace of dissatisfaction at the weakness of her joke she 
               looks across at him uncertainly

                                     midge
                         but i brought you a lot of other 
                         things you can see what you like  
                         and the thing shuts off automatically

               she crosses to him swiftly kneels beside him

                                     midge
                         ah johnny please try johnny try  
                         youre not lost mothers here

               no reaction long pause then we hear the door open

               scottie does not seem to hear but midge turns her head a 
               nurse is looking in with a significant look at midge

                                     midge
                         time okay

               the nurse goes out midge rises

                                     midge
                         ill be in again john do you want 
                         me to shut that off it shuts off 
                         automatically

               her eyes crinkle with anxiety she nods and goes to the 
               phonograph and shuts it off she comes back to him slowly 
               and stands behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders

                                     midge
                              softly
                         ah johnnyo you dont know im 
                         here do you

               she leans down and kisses him lightly on the top of the head 
               and smiles gently

                                     midge
                         but im here

               she moves to the door going out of the shot and we hear 
               the door open and close scottie has not moved his face 
               does not change expression his head bends down and his 
               gaze is fixed on the floor

               int corridor outside scotties room  day

               midge walking down the corridor meets the nurse near the 
               open door of an office

                                     midge
                         could i see the doctor for a moment

               the nurse backs up a step and looks in the open doorway

                                     nurse
                         doctor

               the doctor looks up and sees midge in the doorway

                                     doctor
                         oh yes miss wood

               the nurse continues on up the corridor midge remains in the 
               doorway

                                     midge
                         doctor how long is it going to take 
                         you to pull him out of this

                                     doctor
                         it is hard to say six months at 
                         least perhaps a year it depends to 
                         a certain extent on him

                                     midge
                         he wont talk

                                     doctor
                         no we have ways of digging out 
                         knowledge but it takes longer he 
                         is suffering from acute melancholia 
                         together with a guilt complex he 
                         blames himself for what happened to

               vista clears he sees walking toward him from carlottas corner 
               a woman who must surely be madeleine he stares rigid as 
               she comes closer and then she passes out of view as she 
               heads for the exit scottie turns to keep her in sight and 
               as she passes through the doors to go out to the courtyard 
               she turns a just a bit so that she is silhouetted slightly 
               in profile against the cuter light and once again surely it 
               is madeleine scottie heads for the door fast pushes through

               he breaks into a run and catches up with her and puts out 
               his hand to take her arm and as he does she turns startled 
               by his sudden appearance at her side  and they both stop 
               and stare at each other it is not madeleine a moment as

               madeleine he cannot be sure this girls hair is dark where 
               madeleines was light her features on closer inspection 
               seem heavier and she wears much more makeup and yet there

               he turns away slowly toward the door his eyes fall on some 
               framed photographs on the dresser and he pauses then moves 
               closer to see them clearly one is of a girl about sixteen 
               standing with a woman in her late thirties they have their 
               arms about each other they both have dark hair scottie

               she smiles pleased with the gallantry of his answer and 
               regards him thoughtfully

                         okay

                 he flashes her a smile and goes closing the door she 
               stares after him for a long moment then moves slowly and 
               sits down on the edge of the bed she stares straight ahead 
               thinking her face an impassive mask  the camera moves in 
               until her head fills the screen and her eyes are deep with 
               dark memory we dissolve through to what she sees the moment 
               in the tower of the mission madeleine is running up the 
               stairs of the tower scottie struggling desperately after 
               her she reaches the top opens the door darts into the 
               bell tower slams the door behind her and locks it she turns 
               gavin elster stands near the open arch holding his wife 
               fast she is dressed in a grey suit exactly like the one 
               madeleine wears  her body is limp she is obviously dead 
               already elster looks at madeleine then pushes his wife out 
               through the arch madeleine makes a futile gesture to stop 
               him and screams elster comes to quickly puts his hand 
               across her mouth and draws her back into the shadow behind 
               a masonry abutment they are lost from sight

               dissolve through to judy seated on the edge of her bed 
               staring with the memory of the horror of the moment  she 
               sits very still then slowly she rises and moves to the 
               window she looks out watching scottie go down the street  
               she turns away and goes to the closet and opens the door  
               she pushes some clothes along the rack we see the grey suit 
               she reaches into the closet and brings out a suitcase lets 
               it lie there just outside the closet and stares down at 
               it then she turns back goes to the writing desk sits down 
               and takes a sheet of paper she picks up a ball point pen 
               clicks out the point stares ahead for a moment then begins 
               to write as she writes we hear her voice

                                     judys voice
                         dearest scottie  and so youve 
                         found me this is the moment i dreaded 
                         and hoped for  wondering what i 
                         would say and do if ever i saw you 
                         again i wanted so to see you again 
                         just once now ill go and you can 
                         give up your search
                              pause
                         i want you to have peace of mind  
                         youve nothing to blame yourself 
                         for  you were the victim i was the 
                         tool you were the victim of a mans 
                         plan to murder his wife he chose me 
                         to play the part because i looked 
                         like her he dressed me up like her 
                         he was quite safe because she lived 
                         in the country and rarely came to 
                         town he chose you to be the witness 
                         the carlotta story was part real 
                         part invented to make you testify 
                         that madeleine wanted to kill herself 
                         he knew of your illness he knew you 
                         would never get up the stairs of the 
                         tower he planned it so well he 
                         made no mistakes
                              pause
                         i made the mistake i fell in love  
                         that wasnt part of the plan im 
                         still in love with you and i want 
                         you so to love me if i had the nerve 
                         i would stay and lie hoping that i 
                         could make you love me again as i 
                         am for myself and so forget the 
                         other and forget the past but i 
                         havent the nerve to try

               she pauses and looks up and thinks and wonders and tries 
               to see into the future and as she does the fear in her 
               eyes dissolve into anxious hope and then resolve

               she puts the pen down rises slowly takes up the letter and 
               tears it into small pieces and drops the pieces into the 
               wastebasket she turns to the closet pushes the suitcase 
               back in with the toe of her foot pushes the grey suit far 
               back into darkness and closes the closet door she walks to 
               the dresser and stares at herself in the mirror she opens 
               a candy box in which we see trinkets and pieces of junk 
               jewelry and takes out two plain hoop earrings she puts 
               them on and looks to see how much change they make she takes 
               up an eyebrow pencil and slightly exaggerates the arch of 
               her brows she stares at herself impassively for a long time

                                                               dissolve to

               int ernies restaurant upstairs room  night

               the room is filled with diners waiters come and go there 
               is a sound of chatter and a slight clatter of dishes at a 
               side table we are looking from the bar and at a table 
               against the far wall we see judy and scottie dining they 
               are talking amiable scottie is being genial and 
               companionable but there is no particular sense of intimacy  
               judy looks about quite a bit obviously admiring the room 
               and the food and the clothes of the people about her she is 
               dressed neatly but more simply and more cheaply than are 
               the other women in the room and she is conscious of it and 
               keeps fiddling with the shoulders at her dress

               during this a party of diners enters is greeted by the 
               captain and is led across the room toward an empty table 
               near judy and scottie we go with them winding among the 
               tables as we get very close to scottie he looks up and 
               becomes rigid and stares a woman has just gone by him to 
               take seat at the neighboring table her hair is blonde and 
               is done exactly as was madeleines from the rear she could 
               easily be madeleine but then she turns and sits down 
               glancing at scottie as she does and we see that it is not 
               madeleine a moment then scottie looks away judy is staring 
               at him anxiously it is her first defeat and her first 
               victory defeat in that although he is with her he is still 
               searching victory in that she is sure now that he does 
               not think she is madeleine

                                                               dissolve to

               ext judys hotel  night

               scotties car drives up and comes to a stop he gets out 
               comes around and opens the other door and helps judy out  
               they stand there for a moment then start for the front door

                                                               dissolve to

               int judy hotel upstairs corridor  night

               judy opens her door flicks the light switch and turns to 
               scottie in the doorway

                              no answer
                         thats not very complimentary
                              pause
                         and nothing would happen

                                     scottie

                         thats not very complimentary either

               she turns away and wanders into the room toward the window  
               she sits down in the chair to think it over looking straight 
               ahead in profile to scottie and to the window scottie stares 
               at her then suddenly reaches out and snaps off the light

                                     judy
                              frightened
                         listen whatd you do that for

               she starts to rise

                                     scottie
                              quickly

                         please and dont look at me

               she subsides in the chair and obeys looking straight ahead 
               again holding very still apprehensive the only light in 
               the room is from the street lamp outside and it silhouettes 
               judy in profile robbing her of haircolor robbing her of 
               makeup and scottie stares across at her unsure wishing he 
               could persuade himself

                                     scottie
                              softly

                                     judy
                              slowly anxiously
                         i suppose i could phone the store in 
                         the morning and say im sick

               another pause

                                     scottie
                              gently
                         good night judy

               he goes out closing the door judy sits still staring 
               straight ahead she raises a hand slowly and rubs the side 
               of her face

                                                               dissolve to

               comes upon another couple in a close embrace  the camera 
               moves on and discovers scottie and judy strolling along the 
               path at the foot of the slope judy is looking at the loving 
               couples with wistful envy scottie is admiring the scenery 
               in other direction he holds a bag of popcorn  judy looks 
               up at him with gentle longing he glances down at her and

               dancing romantically its romantic as hell we find scottie 
               and judy dancing nicely but rather sedately judy looks up 
               at him once in a while wishing she could get a bit closer 
               although he is not by any means keeping her at a distance

                         the gentleman seems to know what he 
                         wants

               she goes and whispers to the assistant during the following 
               and the assistant follows the model out

               the saleswoman has a sudden thought

                                     saleswoman
                         oh  i think i know the suit you

                         still have the model

               and she hurries away into the back room judy looks at scottie 
               with wondering understanding eyes

                                     judy
                         youre looking for the suit she wore  
                         for me

               scottie looks at her anxiously not wanting an argument

                                     judy
                              repelled

                         like someone dead

                         youre with someone thats dead

               she has risen from her chair appalled and close to tears  
               the saleswoman enters briskly

                                     saleswoman

               the saleswoman watches the altercation with interest the 
               two are out of earshot now but what theyre seems pretty 
               evident 

               scottie is being urgently persuasive judy is staring at the 
               floor shaking her head fighting the tears the following 
               is distant and blurred

               he whirls on her with blazing eyes and stares at her 
               commandingly and judy shrinks a little

                                     saleswoman
                              laughs embarrassed

               she goes into the back room judy and scottie remains as 
               they were their eyes fixed on each other but judy is cowed

               the legs start to walk and the scene opens up as judy walks 
               away from the camera and we find scottie seated watching 
               and a shoe salesman in attendance judy sways a bit on the 
               high heels in a way that could be reminiscent of madeleine  
               she stops and turns and stands staring at scottie without 
               expression

                                     scottie

               he looks at judy and meets her gaze steadfastly

               in the living room there is a fire in the fireplace judy 
               is seated on the floor before the fire bent forward with 
               her head and arms buried in the seat of the easy chair shes 
               been crying scottie enters from the kitchen carrying a bottle 
               of cognac and two glasses he looks down at judy then pours 
               cognac into the two glasses and sets the bottle down

                                     scottie

               she takes a large sip of cognac makes a face and puts the 
               glass away as she does

               scottie comes down to her and puts his hands on her arms and 
               holds her and looks into her eyes intently

                                     scottie

               she looks at him with a new spark of hope and her eyes are 
               almost willing him to kiss her but then he drops his hands 
               from her arms and the glow fades from her eyes and she 
               looks away

                                     judy
                              dully

               he rises and walks away toward the window she looks after 
               him then rises and almost runs to him

                                     judy

               they are face to face and scottie is studying her somberly  
               beyond them through the window we can see that magnificent 
               symbol the coit tower

               the first impact is of sound of the buzz of hair dryers and 
               the shrill cacophony of female voices talking and laughing  
               scottie is leaning at the doorway leading into the inner 
               salon the camera pans away from him through another door 
               and comes to rest on a big head of judy covered with soap 
               suds bent over a basin one of the beauty operators looks 
               out toward scottie then walks out to him

                         and the rest of 

               he waves a hand over his face

               he turns away after a last glance toward judy the last we 
               see of the salon is judys head as she turns to try to see 
               through soap suds to where scottie has been standing

               scottie is wandering impatiently smoking some of the 
               ransohoff boxes are piled in a corner then abruptly he 
               strides to the window he looks and becomes tense

               ext the street  day

               from scotties viewpoint judy is walking up the street  
               she wears the grey suit from ransohoffs the highheeled 
               black shoes and her hair is now blonde but it hangs about 
               her face in the usual way she does not look up she turns 
               into the entrance of the hotel

               int bedroom  day

               scottie watches her until he loses sight of her directly 
               below as she goes in the front door he turns and looks looks 
               toward the bedroom door and waits then impatiently he 
               strides to the door and goes out into the corridor

               int hotel corridor day

               scottie looks along the corridor

               from his viewpoint

               the corridor is empty

               scottie

               tensely waiting

               from his viewpoint

               judy turns the corner moving towards him

               as scottie watches critically

               judy comes up to him he backs into the room judy following

               int hotel bedroom  day

               as judy comes into the room scottie closes the door without 
               taking his eyes from her she looks at him gravely  and 
               holds out her hand as though hoping for praise for the 
               transformation her eyebrows have been plucked her makeup 
               lightened her lipstick changed and she now bears much more 
               of a resemblance to madeleine

                                     judy
                         well

               scottie abruptly goes to her takes her hanging hair with 
               both hands pulls it to the back so that her ears show  judy 
               looks at him halfangry halfscared

               scottie seeing the look in her eyes takes his hands away  
               the hair falls forward again

               they look at one another for a moment then scottie asks 
               almost humbly

                                     scottie
                         judy  please 

               judy doesnt answer for a moment then she draws a deep 
               breath and turns resignedly away she crosses to the mirror 
               over a chest of drawers scottie matches as she picks up a 
               couple of pins from a glass tray and scoops up a handful of 
               hair  scottie stands watching in silence his eyes follow 
               every move we hear the tinkle of pins of the glass tray

               from scotties viewpoint

               judy slowly turns from the mirror to face him she looks 
               exactly like madeleine  her hair pulled back and done in a 
               bun at the back of the neck she stands there looking at 
               him  scottie looks at her in wonder his eyes shining  
               judy takes a step towards him rewarded by his expression  
               scottie moves over and takes judy in his arms

               big heads

               of the two of them together the camera moves around the 
               big heads scottie holds her tighter and tighter  he looks 
               past her shoulder and we see that his eyes are closed because 
               at last he holds madeleine in his arms once more  he opens 
               his eyes  the camera swims around the room

               we are now in the livery stable at san juan bautista

               with scottie holding madeleine tight in his arms kissing 
               her we see this for only the briefest moment before it

                                                         dissolves away t0

               back in the hotel room

               scottie kisses her as he did in the livery stables as he 
               kisses her and she turns his kiss the camera pulls back 
               slowly and their two figures are held in the center of the 
               room

                                                               dissolve t0

                         beautiful steaks  and lets see 
                         to start

               during this she has taken a necklace out of the box and is 
               trying to fasten it around her neck but the clasp wont 
               work

                                     judy
                         oh help me with this will you

               she backs up a step still holding the necklace in place 
               and scottie rises from his chair and comes up in back of 
               her he takes the ends of the necklace from her

                                     scottie

                         the back of her neck

                                     judy
                         oh youre supposed to fasten it  

                                     scottie
                         all in good time

               he bites her again

                                     judy
                         scottie

                                     scottie

                         oh yeah there

               as he is fastening it he glances into the mirror and sees 
               the necklace clearly for the first time his eyes are 
               immediately startled with the shock of recognition and he 
               stares wondering why the camera zooms in to a closeup of 
               the necklace in the mirror then with a click the closeup 
               changes to a closeup of the necklace painted on canvas the 
               camera draws back to show the necklace around the neck of 
               carlotta in the portrait the same necklace now the camera 
               draws back to show the art gallery with the portrait of 
               carlotta on the far wall the scene clickchanges to a big 
               head of scottie staring and during this we hear judy 
               chattering away

                                     judys voice

                         lipstick where did i put it i had 
                         it a minute ago

                              her voice fading in
                         all right im ready

               his eyes move in the direction of the voice and now we see 
               her standing a few feet from him smiling at him she walks 
               to him with a loving smile

                                     judy
                         but first muss me a little

               she puts her arms around him and presses against him and 
               lays her head against his chest with a happy sigh

                                     judy
                         ah scottie i do have you now

               he raises his arms as though to embrace her moves his hands 
               to her shoulders and one senses for a moment that he is 
               going to press her too hard or that he may move his hands to 
               her throat but then he lays his hands gently on her back 
               and closes his eyes wearily and rests his head on the top 
               of hers

                                     scottie
                              softly

                         out of town for dinner  drive down 
                         the peninsula somewhere

               she moves her head and he raises his and opens his eyes 
               and she smiles up at him

                                     judy
                         all right if youd like

               she reaches up and kisses him briefly on the mouth he smiles 
               a small enigmatic smile

                         church

               scottie and judy

               he puts his arm around her protectively but firmly and begins 
               to impel her gently to the church

                         too late

               the camera pulls around as his tree hand goes to try the 
               door

                                     judy

                         too late

               he pushes her into the church with gentle firmness

               the darkness is relieved by shafts of moonlight scottie 
               impels judy toward the foot of the tower

                                     scottie
                         i couldnt find her then i heard 
                         her footsteps on the stairs she was 
                         running up the tower

               scottie comes into the area holding judy he looks up

               from scotties angle

               the open stairway spiraling upward

                                     scotties voice
                         she ran up those stairs and through 
                         the door at the top of the tower 
                         and locked it behind her then she 
                         jumped

               back to scottie and judy

               he is still staring up judy is rigid with fright and the 
               memory of that moment

                         and i couldnt follow her
                              he closes his eyes 
                              in the agony of 
                              remembering
                         god knows i tried
                              he glances down

                                     scottie

                         the stairs

               she starts up slowly unwillingly scottie follows behind 
               her fighting to keep the impending vertigo under control 
               trying to keep his eyes fixed on her back to avoid looking 
               up into space they move up in silence and in shadow their 
               faces occasionally lit by the shafts of moonlight that stream 
               through the open arches of the tower judys eyes are wide 
               and staring her face and body are stiff with the struggle 
               to keep from breaking under the strain of remembering the 
               last time she went up these stairs and scottie fights his 
               way up behind her

               judy slows down and comes to a halt at the landing that 
               scottie barely reached the last time at the moment of death  
               she leans her back against the wall for support scottie 
               struggles up and comes to a halt near her

               pause as he gathers himself for the last assault

                                     scottie
                              quietly

                         you went on remember

               she stiffens and stares at him

                         the necklace madeleine that was 
                         the slip i remembered the necklace

               a moment then suddenly she ducks and tries to run past him 
               down the stairs he grabs her wrist and holds on

                                     scottie

               he starts to drag her up the stairs and she fights it close 
               to hysteria

                                     judy

               they have reached the door to the tower and he stops with a 
               grim almost triumphant smile

               he pushes her through and follows her in

               int bell tower  night

               the black shadows are cut by shafts of moonlight heavy beams 
               support the great bell hanging at the center there are 
               additional temporary support beams judy backs up against 
               the stonework as scottie looks about

                                     scottie

                         til everything was clear then 
                         sneaked down and drove back to the 
                         city
                              glances at her
                         and then you were his girl what 
                         happened to you

               she stares at him wideeyed with apprehension

                                     scottie
                         did he ditch you

               an almost imperceptible nod from her scottie almost laughs

                                     scottie
                         oh judy when he had all her money

                         knew he was safe you couldnt talk  
                         didnt he give you anything

                                     judy
                              faintly
                         some money

                                     scottie

                         that was your mistake judy one

                         sentimental

               a moment as he stares at her then he advances on her slowly

                                     judy
                              apprehensive
                         what are you going to do

                                     scottie
                         i loved you madeleine

                                     judy
                              desperately
                         i was safe when you found me there 
                         was nothing you could prove but 
                         when i saw you again i couldnt run 
                         away i loved you so i walked into 
                         danger and let you change me again 
                         because i loved you and wanted you
                              she throws herself 
                              into his arms
                         scottie please you love me now  
                         love me keep me safe

               and she is in his arms pressing tightly against him in 
               desperation and he holds her tight and they kiss deeply 
               passionately the kiss ends but they remain together holding 
               together and scotties eyes are tight with pain and the 
               emotion of hating her and hating himself for loving her

                                     judy
                              softly pleading
                         love me keep me safe

                                     scottie
                              whispering
                         too late too late theres no 
                         bringing her back

               suddenly judys eyes looking past him go wide with horror

               from judys point of view

               the figure of a woman draped in black stands motionless in 
               the shadows by the door

               judy in scotties arms transfixed

               from judys point of view

               the black figure moves forward seems to merge with the shadow 
               and become part of them

               judy

               pulls out of scotties arms and backs away terrified

                                     judy
                              whispering
                         no no

               she is backing perilously close to the edge of the drop below 
               scottie stares at her for a moment then swings around to 
               see what she is looking at

               from scotties point of view

               the black figure advances into a shaft of moonlight it is a 
               nun

                                     the nun
                              simply
                         i heard voices

               there is a terrible scream  scottie swings around again 
               steps quickly to the edge and looks down he backs away his 
               face tight with horror and holds the stonework for support 
               the nun comes into the shot she steels herself to look below 
               she crosses herself

                                     the nun
                         god have mercy

               she reaches out for the bell cord

               int the bell tower  night

               the church bell is tolling it swings in and out of the 
               picture through the archway we can see the mission garden 
               below figures are hurrying across toward the church

                                                               dissolve to

               and ice she starts to mix a strong highball and does not 
               turn as she hears the front door open scottie enters and 
               closes the door behind him his face is a mask

               he moves slowly across the room and stands by the window 
               with the view of san francisco beyond him and looks straight 
               ahead thinking midge picks up the highball glances over 
               at him picks up the bottle and pours in another slug then

               looks across the room scottie stands quietly immobile 
               then raises the glass and takes a long pull at the drink he 
               stares out at the city

                                                                  fade out
