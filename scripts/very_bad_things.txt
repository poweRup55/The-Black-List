                         not its not a good thing but it 
                         was given the circumstances the 
                         smart play we did what had to be 
                         done and well im proud of 
                         us im proud of each and every one 
                         of us we performed under the most 
                         complex and nerve shattering of 
                         situations we stood fast and we

                                     boyd
                         wrong that is flat out wrong hell 
                         is for cowards for hypocrites who 
                         fear to live by the strength of their 
                         own convictions this is war given 
                         the circumstances and given the fact 
                         that we are alive and they are not 
                         we have chosen life over death two 
                         wrongs dont make a right so our 
                         conviction and execution would only 
                         mean more death here not less

                         unlock energy and see my options 
                         more clearly yes but to give him 
                         credit for this for all of this

                         oklahoma who under the brilliant 
                         leadership of yours truly rolled 
                         to an auspicious league record of 0

               again they search prodding into earth with their shovels 
               nothing

               fisher stops digging tired he pauses shines his light 
               around until

                         bingo

               moore and fisher quickly start to dig until finally moores 
               shovel makes contact

                                     moore
                         got it

                         ive been thinking about what you 
                         said that day the prayer about 
                         using this whole mess to bring out 
                         the good in me

               fisher is directly above moore holding the shovel looking 
               down at the back of moores head

                                     fisher
                         yeah

                         i think theres a lot of truth in 
                         that im gonna pursue some options 
                         i want to join that big brother thing

                              slowly raises the 
                              shovel over his head
                         thats a good one

                                     moore

                         brother thats a big problem it 
                         seems to me lack of racial 
                         integration thats a big one you 
                         think

               moore looks up to

               fisher tears running down his face the shovel high above 
               his head ready to bring it down hard onto moores skull

               moore confused and then realization cut between fisher 
               above poised to strike moore below still and vulnerable 
               their eyes locked for several beats finally

                                     moore
                         what do you think

               slowly fisher lowers his shovel

                                     fisher
                         i think youd make an excellent big 
                         brother

                                     moore
                              back to work
