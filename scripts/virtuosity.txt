                             third rewrite   august 24 1994


	two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street hunters
	hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle


	the sidewalk is crowded with people so is the street too
	many people not enough cement los angeles 1997


	summer probably august 103 degrees heat shimmers off the
	horizon making the sky look peculiar


	the men keep running passed a guy sitting at a bus stop
	watching a television in his lap you hear the newscaster


				newscaster v 0 
		as l a p d officers gather
		evidence at this grisly crime
		scene you can only ask yourselves
		—— what kind of lunatic would
		commit such unthinkable crimes
			a beat
		the three adjectives which best
		describe this killer are sadistic
		intelligent and dangerous

	the guy pays little attention to the broadcast he seems
	almost bored by it like this kind of news is commonplace or
	hes got more important things on his mind

	everybody is sweating including the two men struggling to
	swim upstream in the river of pedestrians

	their uniforms are freshly pressed their shoes just recently
	shined hair tightly cropped faces perfectly shaved clearly
	men proud to wear the badge of the los angeles police
	department the guy in the lead is

				parker barnes
		his body is a running backs his
		endurance a marathoners his face
		one youd want for your own hes
		in his 30s if he was in his 20s
		youd still be jealous

	his partner is john donley late 20s eager to prove himself
	he struggles to keep up with parker john accidently knocks
	over several pedestrians they give no reaction except to
	pick themselves up and continue on their way

	parker and john keep charging their conversation breathless

				john
		i cant get over how different you
		look

				parker
			ruefully
		five years can be a bitch huh

	they splitup the maitre d still facing the front doors
	repeats his greeting to no one in particular

				maitre d
		good afternoon may i help you

	parker spots sid 67 across the room without hesitation the
	hunter chases his prey  gun out and firing not what you
	would call standard police procedure

	bullets riddle sid 67s table as he dives from his chair he
	lands next to a bowling ball bag which sits beneath his
	table

	john charges from the other direction until a woman gets up
	from her chair standing directly in johns line of fire

				john
			to the woman
		lady move

	before she can do so sid 67 stands behind the woman
	grabbing her and throwing her across the table into parker
	crash they tumble to the floor

	in the same movement sid 67 removes a gun from inside his
	jacket and shoots john in the shoulder before he can fire
	johns gun flies from his hand sid 67 advances toward him

	parker struggles to his feet aims his weapon sid 67 does
	the same but without looking boom parker gets a bullet
	through his shooting arm his wound identical to johns
	parkers weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp

	parker charges him wildly but sid 67 brutally kicks him in
	the stomach in perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
	the background parker doubles over gasping for breath
	another kick drops parker to his knees

				sid 67
			to parker
		im going to rehearse with your
		friend a while then ill be back
		to perform a new piece with you

	he grabs his bowling bag and slams it into johns head
	knocking him out sid 67 puts johns unconscious body over
	his shoulder

				sid 67 contd
		if you get hungry id recommend
		the escargot theyre delicious

	he carries john and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen
	parker scrambles to his gun and races after sid 67

	inside the restaurant kitchen

	parker charges through sous chefs chopping vegetables who
	work undistracted the vegetables look plastic

	parker turns a corner stopping fast at the other end of the
	aisle stands sid 67 who presses his gun against the head of
	a frightened busboy sid 67 holds the busboys body in front
	of his own as a shield

				parker
			to sid 67
		wheres john

				sid 67
		performing solo
			a beat
		enjoying the concert so far

	advancing up the aisle parker levels his gun at sid 67 with
	his good arm now all work comes to a stop as the sous chefs
	watch the showdown

				parker
		recitals over asshole

	he fires directly through the chest of the innocent busboy
	hitting sid 67

	the sous chefs gasp in horror as the busboy drops through sid
	67s grasp to the floor dead

	sid 67 stares at parker in disbelief blood is now visible
	flowing from a bullet hole in sid 67s shoulder which was
	caused by the same bullet sid 67s arm dangles uselessly
	his gun lies on the floor

				sid 67
		surprised but pleased
		you and me arent so different
		after all

	parker again pulls the trigger click click click no
	bullets

				sid 67 contd
		like a violin without strings

	he takes off around the corner grabbing another clip from
	inside his uniform parker goes after him only to stumble
	over something sid 67s bowling bag blood flows through
	its zipper you now realize the object inside is not a
	bowling ball

	beside the bowling bag lies johns body which is convulsing
	his hands have been tied to bare electrical wire john is
	being electrocuted parker kicks away the wires but not in
	time

				parker
		shit

	he scans the room for sid 67 parker has no idea sid 67 is
	standing directly behind him sid 67 grabs parker by the
	throat

				sid 67
		i told you i was going to perform a
		new piece with you its called
		first you suffer then you die
		hope you like it

	parker gags unable to breathe he then starts to de—
	materialize from within sid 67s grasp

				sid 67 contd
			as if to god
		noooh you cant take him yet im
		not finished

	johns body also de—materializes as parker disappears
	entirely

	the blood seeping from sid 67s wound stops flowing and
	starts retracting into his body along with his bone
	fragments his shoulder is healing itself right before your
	very eyes we pull back to reveal what you are seeing is

	on a monitor

	the scene continues seamlessly sid 67s skin heals over his
	shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
	proper places no scar whatsoever

	his clothing also returns to perfect condition literally as
	good as new this is known as automatic resetting

	the previously dead busboy also auto resets his wound
	healing by itself we pull back further to reveal the monitor
	is one of several

	inside the law enforcement technology advancement center

	aka letac the facility is a converted aerospace research
	building in pacoima funded by government black book dollars

	the look is a mixture of industrial grime and hightech
	sparkle banks upon banks of computer equipment wires
	cables conduits connectors everywhere you look

	in complete disarray to the uninitiated but to those in the
	know this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
	world

	the building is partitioned into dozens of stations at each
	station a leading engineer in his field is frantically
	readying a prototype for demonstration each new technology
	designed to help fight the new cold war the war on crime

	the atmosphere is competitive voices are loud tension
	anticipation in the air only a lucky few will have their
	inventions approved for production

	letac is quite simply los alamos from 1940 meets sega from
	1994

	at a station in the middle of the room two unconscious
	bodies lie on narrow beds wearing formfitting skull caps
	made of polyurethane

	each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
	at points designated as neural primes each needle is
	directly connected to the participants nervous system

	the tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
	wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
	surrounding the beds

	each of these components isnt much to look at on its own
	but together with the rest of the apparatus are part of
	something very new —— a revolutionary law enforcement
	training device whose name you read

	virtual reality criminal investigation simulator

	to be perfectly clear the events you just witnessed
	involving parker john and sid 67 took place within virtual
	reality not the real world

	dozens of small character modules similar to todays
	nintendo game cartridges are plugged into the systems main
	console

	each of the modules bares a name and number such as maitre
	d 17 and sheila 32 there is no character version number
	greater than 40 until you see the module labelled sid 67

	the simulation timer stops at 17 hours 52 minutes 11
	seconds a clock reads 30432 pm

	four observers two men and two women watch virtual reality
	monitors positioned around the station one of the men wears
	an l a p d uniform his name is william cox 40s his
	nameplate reads chief of police

	one of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor
	intently following the action on screen studying it
	clinically her name is dr madison carter late 30s

	she is beautiful and charming but those qualities take a
	back seat to her intelligence she is one of the countrys
	foremost authorities on criminal psychology her concerns are
	empirical her quest is knowledge she has little in common
	with the other observers

	the other man is frederick wallace 5os chairmanceo of
	letac expensive suit commanding powerful but not as
	commanding or powerful as elizabeth deane 605 the
	presidentially—appointed crime czars

	elizabeth deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
	to letac as well as which prototypes will move on to
	production

				deane
			quietly to wallace
		what did cox pull him out early
		for

				wallace
		barnes used to work for him when he
		was still a cop in the field
		remember

				deane
			a beat
		dont remind me

	lab assistants remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
	two unconscious bodies the acupuncture needles remain in the
	caps you can now see the faces of the participants

	parker and john

	parker lies calmly his eyes fluttering as he gradually
	returns to consciousness he looks very different than his
	virtual rendering

	his hair is long and ragged his face is unshaven a scar
	across his cheek a hoop earring in one ear his outfit a
	filthy prison uniform

	johns outfit matches parkers physically he looks as
	clean—cut as his virtual rendering except that he is
	convulsing violently

	his flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
	him like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure its ugly
	frightening

				parker
			barely conscious
		somebody do something

	two paramedics burst through the doors and rush to john the
	paramedics inject him fibrillate him repeatedly

	the simulators designer daryl lindenmeyer 40s high—
	strung intense and brilliant beyond words stands by the
	equipment protectively he is far more concerned for the
	safety of his machines than he is for johns life

	johns body goes limp his vital signs flat the paramedics
	record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet
	they begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out

				deane
			annoyed to wallace
		what the hell happened

				wallace
			pointing to needles
		lindenmeyer developed neural
		connectors that tap directly into
		the nervous system if the
		simulator isnt calibrated
		properly experiencing death in
		this level of vr is like
		experiencing death within a dream
		the experience becomes real

				deane
			angrily
		simulations are supposed to give
		participants practice in realistic
		dangerous scenarios while
		protecting them from the risks they
		are exposed to in the real world

				wallace
			annoyed to lindenmeyer
		i was assured the problem was
		corrected

				lindenmeyer
		i did fix it i told you i did i
		dont know why it happened again

				deane
		again

				cox
			a beat
		my first two pairs of convicts
		suffered the same fate

				deane
			coldly to wallace
		why wasnt i told

				wallace
		black book dollars black book
		operation you pay me for results
		not how for how i get you there

				cox
			to deane
		ill tell you one thing — there is
		no way in hell we should allow any
		real officers to train in this damn
		thing

				deane
		then about all ive spent 37
		million developing is a very
		expensive way to control the prison
		population

	after giving wallace a cold hard stare  namely at his hand
	stitched lapel his gold watch and his diamondstudded
	cufflinks she exits wallace follows after her quickly you
	now notice that the chair dr madison carter had occupied is
	now empty she left a while ago

	cox remains lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as
	if it were his child there are several scratches but no
	major damage he looks relieved

				parker
			struggling to sit up
		heonly had a year left on his
		sentence

				lindenmeyer
			annoyed
		how much do you think i care

	parker still not fully conscious hurls himself at
	lindenmeyer

				lindenmeyer cont d
			hysterical
		dont touch medont touch me

	he flails his arms wildly nearly spasming this is clearly a
	man who should never drink coffee two armed guards whove
	been standing in the background pull parker off lindenmeyer
	and throw him to the ground

	lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
	parker in handcuffs and leg chains

				cox
		ill walk him out

	the guards back off as cox helps parker to his feet

				cox contd
			to parker
		you all right

				parker
			still clearing his head
		whyd you pull me out

				cox
		donley started experiencing the
		attack for real if i hadnt gotten
		you out the same thing would have
		happened to you
			a beat
		you may not believe this parker

	but i still consider us friends

	he helps parker toward the exit as he continues having
	difficulty with his balance

	outside letac

	the building is heavilyguarded razor wire land mines
	armed sentries nobody who shouldnt be here gets anywhere
	near here

	cox leads parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport
	the two guards walk behind at a distance two more by the
	transport the chain between parkers legs keeps his steps
	short

				cox
		what the hell did you have to shoot
		the busboy for

				parker
		he was a computer program for
		crissake

				cox
		you were supposed to act as if
		everything was real

				parker
		real my ass its an overblown
		game
			a beat
		anybody ever catch that fucking
		psycho

				cox
		before you nobody else had gotten
		close enough to sid 67 to take a
		shot at him hell nobody else had
		even been able to start tracking
		him before he got to them first
			eyeing parkers scar
		new scar —— you making it okay in
		there

				parker
			head down
		im getting by

	he starts walking ahead of cox distancing himself

				cox
			pausing for emphasis 
		youve got to know i tried keeping
		you out of general population
		goddam politicians

	his voice trails off as parker turns around and heads
	directly toward him

				parker
			locking eyes
		you want to know how im doing
		every day i lose a little bit more
		of myself
			a beat
		im becoming something else and it
		scares the hell out of me

	he turns back toward the transport cox follows two armed
	guards open the back doors for parker then stand poised with
	weapons out and ready

	inside the prison transport  rear

	cold metal benches no windows parker climbs in the only
	passenger he looks out the open doors to cox

				parker
			halfheartedly
		but with the six months off i get
		for being your guinea pig ive
		only got to survive another 17
		years 5 months and 23 days

				cox
		dont give up parker not ever

				parker
			a beat
		you know those cheesy christmas
		cards of your family under that
		tree in your back yard you keep
		sending me every year

				cox
		what about them

				parker
			a beat
		do me a favor —— keep sending them

	outside letac

	standing outside the transport cox puts his hand on parkers
	shoulder

				cox
		take care pal

	behind him johns body is loaded into an ambulance the
	guards slam the prison transport doors shut

	inside the prison transport  rear

	parker sits in darkness as the transport begins its trek the
	only light comes from a four inch portal covered in steel
	mesh through which the guards can keep an eye on him

				guard
			tauntingly
		hey parker —— im real sorry john
		boy got fried what do you think
		big reds gonna do when he finds
		out you came back without his girl
		friend

	parker sits in silence

					cut to

	inside letac

	sid 67 remains visible on the various monitors around the
	room as lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator

				sid 67
			from the monitors
		dont be angry with me daryl

				lindenmeyer
			a beat
		did you recognize the sonofa
		bitch who got away

				sid 67
		should i have

				lindenmeyer
		think hard  itll come to you

	wallace enters briskly

				wallace
		you embarrassed me in front of the
		highest—ranking law enforcement
		official in the country
			a beat
		do you have any idea how much money
		you just cost me

				lindenmeyer
		the reason you insisted on testing
		my system with prisoners is because
		of the increased risks involved
		with increased realism

				wallace
		of the six prison inmates youve
		tested —— all of whom have had at
		least some military or survival
		training — only mr barnes is
		still breathing

				lindenmeyer
		im still making adjustments

				wallace
		youve had a year—and—a—half to
		make all the adjustments you want
		lindenmeyer
			moving closer 
		elizabeth deane does not give
		second chances neither do i
		youre fired

				lindenmeyer
			hysterical
		im what

				wallace
			relishing his authority
		you are to turn over the sid 67
		program and all its documentation
		for immediate destruction is that
		understood

				lindenmeyer
			restraining himself
		i understand i understand
		perfectly

	wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door on the
	monitors sid 67 starts walking toward you into a closeup

				sid 67
			from the monitor
		hey wallace you really think you
		can shut me down

	wallace stops staring at a monitor in disbelief

				wallace
			to lindenmeyer
		how does he know who i am

				lindenmeyer
			pointing to microphone
		he hearseverything

				wallace
			approaching the monitor
		as a matter of fact i do

	he exits

	on the monitors

	around the room sid 67 walks to a pay phone and dials a
	number

	inside an industrial corridor

	wallace walks toward the buildings entrance his footsteps
	echo his cellular phone rings

	inside folsom county maximum security prison

	parker is led into the inmate receiving room at gunpoint he
	is ordered to remove his clothing

	he stands completely naked arms held out to the sides as he
	is strip searched every portion of the body in which someone
	could hide something is closely inspected

	without being graphic we watch the de—humanizing procedure
	he opens his mouth as wide as possible pulls his earlobes
	foreword to reveal behind them then bends over hands on the
	floor in front of him

	he is scanned with a metal detector so is his clothing
	which is then returned to him

					cut to

	inside the prison cafeteria

	parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates the food
	is unrecognizable the air thick with humidity and cigarette
	smoke nobody is talking just staring at parker

	parker forces down the remainder of his meal then returns
	his utensils to a bin and heads to the bathroom all eyes
	following parkers every move

	the other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of
	incredible size following parker 6 6 255 lbs his face
	covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago
	this is big red he follows parker into the bathroom

	inside the bathroom

	graffiti covers the walls red uses a stained urinal then
	turns to the stalls a pair of prison—issue shoes and socks
	are visible beneath one of them

				red
		time to hurt

	red kicks in the door to the stall revealing a pair of shoes
	and socks stuffed with a prison shirt red hears something
	behind him and turns around slowly

	parker stands barefooted and shirtless scars are visible
	around each arm just below the elbow you will learn what
	these represent momentarily

	parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than red
	but the punch parker delivers to reds face makes you think
	its the other way around

	you hear the sound of metal crushing bone red is thrown
	backwards into the stall blood splatters from his mouth
	adding another shade of redness to his face

	reds teeth stick out of parkers fist parker pulls out the
	teeth he does not bleed nor seem in pain metal is visible
	beneath the surface of his skin

	for the first time you notice small tattoos on the outsides
	of his palms they read wentlow model 17l and 17r
	followed by serial numbers

	red charges parker wildly parker dodges him like a matador
	does a bull then brings his fists down savagely on the back
	of reds head his skull cracks red drops to the floor

	parker jumps on top of him arms around his neck choking
	him red staggers to his feet his eyes wide his face now
	even redder

	parker maintains his mechanical grip red finally succumbs to
	the lack of oxygen he drops to his knees parker does not
	relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his
	head

				guard
		funs over

	parker lets go dropping red to the wet filthy floor

					cut to

	inside the prison hospital

	the room isnt clean the technology is outdated a large
	female nurse applies epoxylike sealant to the synthetic skin
	on parkers fingers

				nurse
		i still dont know why they wasted
		this fancy new technology on you
		every time i fix you up you only
		go and mess it up again

	she sandpapers off the excess sealant then places his elbow
	into an electronic sensitivity adjuster

				nurse
		tell me how this feels

	she pricks parkers finger with a pin

				parker
		ow

				nurse
			smiling
		ill dial it down a little

	she does so then pricks parkers finger again he grimaces
	in pain

	synthetic body parts lying strewn around one of the stations

	there are also various shapes and sizes of robots androids

	hidden from reillys view lindenmeyer the software expert
	who created sid 67 stares jealously through a narrow gap in
	a partition trying to contain his anger and failing
	especially as

	wallace enters the station carrying a bottle of dom perignon
	and two glasses wallace hugs reilly who does not return the

		in your world the lord giveth and

		doesnt have the balls to stop a

		and just walk you out of here

				sid 67
		i had something a little different

		instead of just playing peeping tom
		with reilly why dont you get him

	performing an outrageous strip—tease

				sheila 32
			seductively
		i hope watching me is as big a turn
		on for you as dancing is for me

	inside letac

	reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he
	could touch the contours of sheila 32s body

				reilly
		oh believe me it is it is

	he is so aroused hes shaking lindenmeyer on the other
	hand appears almost uninterested hes used to the routine

	on the monitor sheila 32 continues her strip—tease

	slowly sensually licking her lips grinding her hips

	putting on quite a show

	she removes her top revealing ideal breasts she fondles her
	nipples as well as the rest of herself

	lindenmeyer and reilly continue watching reilly can barely
	control himself

	sheila 32 is very very very good at what she does a
	virtuoso stripper reilly is transfixed until lindenmeyer
	pushes a button blacking out the virtual reality screens

				reilly
		hey

				lindenmeyer
		shows over unless i get to see
		what youve been working on after
		hours

				reilly
			paranoid
		i havent been working on anything

				lindenmeyer
			threateningly
		do i get to see it or not

				reilly
			a beat
		bastard

		sheila dont go anywhere ill be
		right back

	he rushes out sid 67 appears on the various monitors next
	to sheila 32 he kisses her cheek caresses her body sheila
	32 enjoys the attention

				sid 67
		shes some of your finest work
		daryl

				lindenmeyer
		all my work is my finest

	sid 67 continues appreciating sheila 32 as reilly races
	back in the monitors then all go black

	reilly completely out of breath holds a python by its
	head he dangles the snake right in front of lindenmeyers
	face terrifying him

				lindenmeyer
			backing away fast
		get that fucking thing away from
		me

				reilly
			laughing
		youresuch a wimp

	he grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the
	snake the half of the snake which drops to the floor stops
	moving

	but the half still in reillys hand begins regenerating a new
	tail literally growing a new one lindenmeyer cant believe
	his eyes he studies the snake closely

				reilly contd
		watching your vr people auto reset
		gave me the idea

				lindenmeyer
			in awe
		its nano—technology isnt it
		machines the size of molecules

				reilly
			proudly
		coordinated by polymer neural net

				lindenmeyer
			touching the snake
		it feels so real

				reilly
		its better than real its
		synthetic flesh synthetic blood
		synthetic organs
			a beat
		its a physiological machine

				lindenmeyer
			awed
		this is supposed to be years away

				reilly
		as far as the public is concerned
		it is the reason you got fired
		and i got my second demo into
		production is im a lot smarter
		than you i never give my best
		stuff away

				lindenmeyer
			restraining himself
		how do you kill it

				reilly
		separate the character module from
		the neural net

	using lindenmeyers scissors he cuts off the snakes head
	and removes a small character module connected to the base of
	the neural net the snake stops moving it dies

				reilly contd
		 and you get nano—death
			discarding the snake
		dont worry ive got a bunch of
		other ones

				lindenmeyer
		amazing i hate to say it but it
		is

				reilly
		i know
			a beat
		im ready to incubate something a
		little more advanced than a
		coldblooded reptile if you want to
		experience the future meet me in
		my office in 15 minutes and bring

		with you

	he exits as lindenmeyer reaches for the sheila 32 character
	module sid 67 appears on the screen in front of him and
	winks

				sid 67
		you catching my drift

				lindenmeyer
		i think i understand what you have

	and leads lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry
	as well as a large aquarium full of nano—pythons

				lindenmeyer
		you need a maid

				reilly
		what i need is a nymphomaniac

	he removes a tarp from a large rectangular metallic tank
	with a circular window in the middle of it

	clear plastic tubing which branches into hundreds of
	increasingly smaller and smaller branches floats in
	electrified fluid the tubing is a synthetic human nervous

	reilly turns to lindenmeyer

				reilly
		wheres the sheila 32 module

	lindenmeyer hands him the label—less character module reilly
	opens the incubator

	inside the incubator

	reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the
	synthetic nervous system

	the polymer neural net instantly crackles with life it grows
	around the module cells nano—mechanisms immediately begin
	adhering to the tubing forming the beginnings of a skeletal

	sent each year by chief cox

	the other two walls in the cell however look very
	different they are completely covered with primitive
	paintings —— darkly colored surreal images imagine the
	lascaux cave paintings as works—in—progress painted by dali
	except these images were created by parker barnes

	he kneels in a corner working intensely on another image
	completely lost in concentration his hands his clothing
	covered in paint he almost appears to be part of the art
	work

	the work is intricate it clearly takes parker a very long
	time which gives him something to do during the nights he is
	unable to sleep which is most of them

	he is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the
	constant taunts echoing throughout the cell block threats of
	the ugliest most vile kind the kind parker has had to live
	with every night for the last five years

	pausing to admire his work parker finally hears the taunts

	his face becoming a mixture of frustration guilt and anger

	parker immediately resumes painting

	reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later

	lindenmeyer sits off to the side looking no less anxious

	its close to 400 am

	through the circular window

	there is no liquid left in the incubator  its all been
	absorbed all that is visible is the silhouette of a human
	form crouched within steam the form stands

	inside reillys office

	the human form inside incubator opens the hatch steam pours
	out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly

	the figure stands within the mist admiring itself then its
	surroundings

	reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father
	about to see his newborn child for the first time
	lindenmeyer hangs back

				reilly
			expecting sheila 32
		baby what im gonna do to you

	his face drops when sid 67 steps out of the mist

	completely naked lindenmeyer smiles proudly fearfully
	wickedly

				reilly contd
			to lindenmeyer
		who the hell is this

				sid 67
		my name is sid sid 67

	he extends his hand as if to shake then grabs reilly by the
	throat and chokes him hard

				lindenmeyer
		sid —— no

				sid 67
		what do you expect me to do thank
		him

				reilly
			gasping for air
		this isnt possible

				sid 67
		sure it is — and its all thanks
		to the many long hours put in by
		you and daryl

	he watches reillys face with curiosity as the life drains
	from it a puddle forms beneath him he drops reillys body
	to the floor

				sid 67 contd
			to lindenmeyer 
		real instruments are so much more
		responsive than virtual ones dont
		you think

	lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen the office door is
	unlocked and open watching sid 67s expression you
	realize something isnt quite right

	his expression is exaggerated artificial only for a moment
	but its enough to remind you sid 67 is not human

	the billions of nano—mechanisms which make up his anatomy are
	still learning to function in a fullycoordinated fashion
	sid 67 is literally getting used to his new skin

	in various ways throughout his life —— be it a wandering
	eye or a momentary limp — you will be reminded that sid 67
	is a synthetic nano—organism unlike anyone has ever seen

	a surgical knife by the aquarium catches sid 67s attention
	picking up the knife he runs his finger across the razor—
	sharp knife blade cutting himself slightly a drop of blood
	appears sid 67 tastes his synthetic blood

				sid 67 contd
		tastes different somehow

	he then watches with interest as his wound regenerates
	healing itself the scar tissue is slightly off color

				sid 67 contd
		i think im going to like it here

		hes part of the mix sid 67 is a

	on the computer screen

	the graphics show you that sid 12 was a combination of
	charles manson and billy the kid you see what look like two
	viruses which represent each criminals psychological
	profile attacking each other the result is a molten blob

	berkowitz was added to create sid 13 a threeway
	psychological battle more hostile than the first occurs
	sid 14 adding the terrorist abu nidal makes the conflict
	even more violent and so on

	inside lindenmeyers office

	madison stares at the computer screen in awe parker flips
	through cdrom hard copies of the different versions of sid

				madison
		lindenmeyer put increasingly
		complex combinations of criminal
		psychological profiles together to
		develop the ultimate villain

				parker
			understanding
		creating a whole far more dangerous
		than the sum of its parts

				madison
		but rather than selecting pieces
		from each individual he simply let
		the stronger traits of each
		individual cannibalize the weaker
		ones

	she continues opening the files of the higher versions of
	sid version 59 consists of 67 different profiles the
	visualized psychological battle is intense and extremely
	violent the 67 version with 183 profiles is even worse

				madison contd
		its a good bet a couple of the
		dominant personalities teamed up to
		overpower the others
			a beat
		the question is which one of the
		dominants then finally managed to
		take control

	attempting to open the files of the composite profiles
	madison discovers they are protected by encryption

				madison contd
			re lindenmeyer 
		hell let us see the ingredients
		that went in but not how the soup
		turned out after stirring

	madison scrolls through the list of 183 names stopping at
	the name mathew grimes alarm registers on her face as
	parker comes over to look over her shoulder she quickly
	scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen he
	holds the sid 67 cdrom in hand

				parker
		this is getting you pumped up
		isnt it this is like the world
		series to you

				madison
		as a matter of fact it is

	parker points to a name on the screen	jeffrey dahmer

				parker
		remember the bowling ball bag sid
		carried with him in virtual
		reality

				madison
		dahmer carried the head of one of
		his victims in a bowling bag for
		over a week kept it in his locker
		while he was at work in a candy
		factory
			re sid 67 cdrom
		we need to get a look at sid 67s
		final profile

				parker
		what we need to do is stop playing
		with computers and go catch the
		son—ofabitch before he kills
		anybody else

				madison
		in order to find him we have to

	on the southbound platform

	passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted

	across the tracks

	on the northbound platform

	in the entire crowd there is only one person not watching
	the tv screen he is watching parker through his gun sight
	sid 67 pulls the trigger boom

	on the southbound platform

	parker dives to the ground just avoiding the bullet he
	scrambles behind a pillar for protection only to see the guy

	without emphasizing graphic detail sid 67 is decapitated
	his lifeless body drops back into the compactor

	his head tumbles to the street the force of the impact
	causes the sid 67 character module to separate from the

	the character module scatters into the street parker

	on the street

	parkers landing isnt pretty finally getting to his feet
	he sees the sid 67 character module is about to be run over

				sid 67 contd
		too bad you cant regenerate

	as the truck slows at an intersection he jumps to the

	pull back to reveal what you are seeing is

	on a monitor

	the scene continues seamlessly as you may now be guessing
	the monitor is connected to the simulator

	inside lindenmeyers station in letac

	parker lies unconscious on a bed he is connected to the
	simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull
	cap just like he was before

	the sid 67 character module is plugged into the systems
	main console lindenmeyer sits at the controls madison next
	to him her gun aimed at lindenmeyers head

	they are both watching parker chase sid 67 on the monitor in
	front of them parker continues experiencing intolerable
	pain a clock reads 400 am they are the only ones inside

				lindenmeyer
		i told you this would work by
		setting back the clocks he has

				madison
			a beat
		whats wrong with parker

				lindenmeyer
			innocently
		how should i know

				madison
			getting an idea
		show me his physical sensory level

	she clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel
	against lindenmeyers ear he does as told on a panel by the
	console you read participant physical sensory level 670

				lindenmeyer
		i wonder how that

				madison contd
		turn it down

	lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100

	on a monitor

	parker immediately returns back to normal his pace picks up
	he starts closing the gap between him and sid 67 as he races
	into a shopping mall

					cut to

	inside the shopping mall

	the place is a seven—story mecca of shopping an atrium
	allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh
	sid 67 rushes up the escalators going up to the second

	parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator

	throwing people out of his way

	on the seventh floor

	which is also the highest sid 67 veers out of view parker
	races up the final steps to the seventh floor sid 67 is
	nowhere to be seen

	parker searches methodically efficiently he finally spots
	sid 67 who has parkers head linedup perfectly in his gun
	sight parker is a sitting duck boom

	parker dives behind affluent shopper 21 who takes a bullet
	in his ascot parker quickly grabs him and uses his body as
	a shield against sid 67s constant gunfire until parker
	arrives behind a marble column

				sid 67
			surprised at parkers
		ruthlessness
		we really arent that different
		are we

	what he cannot see is that behind the column affluent
	shopper 21 is auto resetting parker puts his gun to the
	shoppers head

				parker
			whispering
		dont move and dont make a sound
		got it

	affluent shopper 21 nods his head repeatedly parker
	collects himself behind the column then pivots out from
	behind it firing in sid 67s direction each bullet finds
	its mark

	absorbing the blows sid 67 backs up against the atrium
	railing taking one final shot he falls backward over the
	railing

	parkers pov

	sid 67 tumbles through the atrium out of control

	speeding toward the ground seven floors below

	sid 67s pov

	the sense of momentum is exhilarating and terrifying if you
	get dizzy easily close your eyes

	from the first floor

	sid 67 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you
	a 200 pound rock wham

	he lands face down in the marble floor the impact is bone—
	crushing sid 67 does not move

	until he begins to regenerate his fluids begin returning to
	his body his bones regaining proper form within seconds
	his body appears as good as new

	technically because this is vr1 the proper term would be
	auto reset but since sid 67 thinks hes in the real world
	regenerating is what he thinks hes doing

	sid 67 stands dusting himself off

				sid 67
		man what a rush
			yelling up to parker
		adios amigo

	grabbing his gun he takes off out of the lobby

		whats wrong

	lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console

				lindenmeyer
		hes developing a hemisphere

				madison
		talk so i can understand

				lindenmeyer
		if i dont adjust the level of

		then fix it

	as lindenmeyer moves to parker madison stays right with him
	her gun aimed at lindenmeyers head lindenmeyer carefully
	removes one of the neural connectors from parkers skull cap
	before removing another he looks for a safe place to put the
	connector

				lindenmeyer
		i need you to hold this it cant
		get any dirt on it

	madison is reluctant but doesnt know what else to do
	lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free
	hand

				lindenmeyer cont  d
		all you have to do is hold the
		needle at the base just make sure
		not to jab yourself with the
		point

	she clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun
	with her right lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector
	from parkers skull

	holding this second needle at the base lindenmeyer makes
	several adjustments on the neural management computer then
	moves slowly back to madison

				lindenmeyer contd
		hand me the connector nice and

	he suddenly jabs his neural connector into madisons right
	forearm madison has no time to react 10000 volts of
	electricity instantly courses through her body

	madison drops to the floor unconscious the needle she had
	been holding falls from her grasp breaking the circuit she
	stops being electrocuted which saves her life

				parker
		i thought you liked me being in the

	sid 67 pauses to think about it

	the guest conductor

	whose back is to the audience leading the orchestra in a
	truly magnificent performance of tchaikovskys fifth symphony
	inside the hollywood bowl

	the guest conductor waves his baton wildly passionately
	brilliantly getting the absolute best from the members of
	the orchestra

	the musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to
	their musical limit

	as the guest conductor turns to the next page of his sheet
	music on the podium you notice seven small highfrequency
	sensors above an upcoming musical measure

	the sensors are wired together when the seven notes are
	played in sequence an electrical pulse will be triggered
	down the wires which run down the side of the podium beneath
	the stage

	beneath the stage

	the wires connect to several crates of c—4 positioned beneath
	the orchestra these seven notes will be the last notes these
	musicians ever play

					cut to

	outside the hollywood bowl

	madison screeches the vehicle to a halt she comes within
	inches of mowing down several people madison and parker bolt
	to the entrance flashing their badges to the guards

	inside the hollywood bowl

	the guest conductors movements grow even more intense more
	demanding as he looks to the violin section we now see the
	conductors face it is sid 67

				sid 67
			silently
		dont hold backgive it to me
		give it to me

	the orchestra plays with everything theyve got they hit
	every note perfectly including a high c

	on the conductors podium

	the first sensor is triggered then the second

	parker and madison

	appear at the back of the stage guns raised distracting the
	musicians as parker and madison charge through the horn
	section toward sid 67 the musicians stop playing

	on the conductors podium

	the fifth sensor is triggered then the sixthbut not the
	seventh

	sid 67

	cannot believe his eyes or his ears the entire orchestra
	has stopped

				sid 67
		come on play play

	in his rage his face contorts past points which can only
	be described bizarre frightening and not something you
	would ever like to see when you look in the mirror

	the musicians stare at sid 67 and then at parker and
	madison with concerned confused silence which is broken by
	parkers gunfire

	ducking behind the podium sid 67 desperately tries to
	rewire the sensors to trigger manually without luck he
	takes his 38 out of his jacket and starts firing

	pandemonium erupts throughout the hollywood bowl audience
	members run in every direction

	the members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives but
	keep their instruments with them even the oboist

	preventing parker and madison from taking any further shots
	at sid 67

	sid 67 bolts down into the crowd madison cannot get off a
	clean shot neither can parker he aims but does not fire
	he and madison struggle through the crowd after him

	outside the hollywood bowl

	parker and madison just catch a glimpse of sid 67 as he
	rushes up the entrance ramp to the hollywood freeway parker
	and madison bolt after him

	on the hollywood freeway

	parker and madison race past the cars waiting to merge into
	what is effectively a parking lot as is normal for this
	thoroughfare traffic is at a standstill

	sid 67 is nowhere to be seen parker and madison split—up
	wading through different lanes of traffic startling the
	already frustrated motorists who roll up their windows lock
	their doors and some of whom reveal weapons of their own

	madison pauses listening she has no idea that sid 67 steps
	behind her wham he cold cocks her with the butt of his gun
	madison crumples to the street

	which now leaves parker a clean shot at sid 67s head boom
	boom two hits two head wounds sid 67 falls behind a
	truck losing his weapon

	before sid 67s wounds have finished regenerating parker is
	already on top of him

				parker
			neighborly
		hey old buddy old pal good to
		see you again

	he empties his clip into sid 67 then discards the gun as
	sid 67s wounds heal themselves parker pounds him
	mercilessly

				sid 67
			losing it
		youruinedim going to kill
		you

	trading blows he manages to get to his feet

				parker
		now is that any way to talk to an
		old friend

				sid 67
			exploding
		barnes youre dead

	he knocks parker back with a good shot to the face then
	disappears around a van

	parker continues the hunt quietly carefully tension grows
	in the silence that follows

	he carefully makes his way around a truck only to see sid
	67 swinging a twobyfour directly at his head wham

	parker is knocked on his ass daze4 blood streams down his
	cheek he staggers to his feet blocking another blow with
	his arm which snaps the wood in two

	parker grabs one of the boards he battles with sid 67

	the fight between parker and sid 67 is intense exhausting

	parker gives it everything he has

	madison appears behind parker holding his gun she wavers
	having trouble keeping her balance she has even more trouble
	aiming her weapon

				madison
		hey parker

	she moves around trying to get a clean shot at sid 67
	which she does not have

				parker
		hows your pulse

				madison
			totally focused
		i couldnt tell you

				parker
		then shoot him already

				madison
		duck

	without hesitation parker hits the deck leaving sid 67
	completely exposed madison steadies her sight

				sid 67
			to madison
		you couldnt hit the side of a

	as he raises his two—by—four high over parkers head madison
	pulls the trigger smoothly

	in slow motion you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel
	of her gun and penetrates sid 67s skull between the eyes
	and exits out the back of his head

	sid 67 collapses on the ground next to parker

				madison
		what do we do now

				parker
		you wont want to watch turn
		around

	she does so parker reaches out of frame to remove the sid
	67 character module from within his skull then reveals the
	character module in hand

				madison
		what should we do with it

	glancing in the flatbed of a truck parker gets an idea and
	knocks on the drivers window as the driver rolls down his
	window classic rock  roll music can be heard from inside

				parker
		mind if i borrow a couple of your
		tools for a second

				driver
		be my guest

	parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck
	he offers one to madison

				parker
		care to join me

	madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer parker drops
	the sid 67 character module onto the pavement and together
	they start pounding the shit out of it wham wham in
	perfect time with the music which the driver cranks even
	louder as we roll credits

	the end
