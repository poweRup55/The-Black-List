	ext wall street  early morning

	fade in the street the most famous third of a mile in the
	world towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
	dreary grey flannel sky the morning rush hour crowds swarm
	through the dark narrow streets like mice in a maze all in
	pursuit of one thing money credits run

	int subway platform  early morning

	we hear the roar of the trains pulling out of the station
	blurred faces bodies suits hats attache cases float into
	view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
	now open releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed
	one of them bud fox

	ext subway exit  morning

	the bubbling mass charges up the stairs steam rises from a
	grating shapes merging into the crowd past the homeless
	vets the insane bag lady with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
	huddled in the corner of trinity church

	bud the fox straggling behind in a crumpled raincoat tie
	askew young very young his bleary face buried in a wall
	street journal folded subway style as he crosses the
	street against the light

				bud

	a car honks swerving past

	int office building  day

	cavernous modern lobby bodies cramming into elevators bud
	stuffing the newspaper into his coat jams in

	the elevator finally comes to a slow stop they wait
	plead beg screech with the eyes

	the door at last opens none of them acknowledging each
	other they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
	of release a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
	after a punishing wait

	the elevator tension is over but the killer grind continues

	int jackson steinem investment house  day

	credits continue to run bud moves past the functional
	reception area past carolyn a cheerful young black girl

				carolyn
		how you doing buddy

				bud
		great carolyn doing any better
		would be a sin

	he slips off his overcoat flicks some lint off his paul
	stuart 500 suit and enters the main trading room

	brokers mill by their desks gulping coffee scanning the
	papers the quotrons the digital clock by the big board
	counter clicks to 926 am  four minutes until the market
	opens you can smell the hunger

	bud takes a deep breath tosses the newspaper away and
	struts into the office  fuck it  its a new day

	moving past dan steeples a flushfaced oldtimer a blue
	and white yale tie with a carnation in his lapel

				bud

	lou mannheim strolls in a dignified looking older broker
	in his late 60s wearing an old brown brim hat with button
	down white shirt narrow tie very much a picture from
	another era a kind humor in his eyes but obviously
	ailing in the legs and breath department

				bud
			friendly

				mannheim
		jesus cant make a buck in this

				mannheim

		things sometimes take time

	the stentorian voice of office manager hieronymus lynch
	booms over the intercom

	we see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
	office tall balding with a perpetual worried look on his
	face

				lynch

	the annual teldar paper stockholders meeting is in session
	400 stockholders are there  many middle aged and older
	one bag lady cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
	front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky executives
	none of them weighing less than 200 pounds accountants and
	lawyers gekko in contrast seems like robin hood seated with
	alex harold bud and the other stockholders cromwell is
	delivering his prepared attack on gekko in a highly
	sarcastic gruff manner

				cromwell
		your company ladies and
		gentlemen is under siege from
		gordon gekko
		teldar paper is now leveraged to
		the hilt like some piss poor south
		american countryinstead of using
		our cash to build plants build our
		business all this man really wants
		is to get paid to withdraw his
		tender offer and that will cost us
		approximately another 200 million
		in greenmail which will be passed
		on to the consumer

	gekko seething jumps up

				gekko
		where do you get off speaking about
		me like that making remarks to the
		press i resent these remarks i
		demand the right to speak

				cromwell
		sit down sir youre out of order
		havent you done enough damage to
		teldar as it ishave you no
		sense of decency
			to shareholders
		how can your management

	gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
	catcalls let the man speak sit down gekko

				cromwell contd
		concentrate on long term growth
		when were busy fighting the get
		richquick short term profit slot
		machine mentality of wall street
		when we should be fighting japan
		the original fundamental reason for
		wall street was to capitalize
		american business underwrite new
		business build companies build
		america the deal has now
		succeeded goods and services as
		americas gross national product
		and in the process we are
		undermining our foundation this
		cancer is called greed greed and
		speculation have replaced longterm
		investment corporations are being
		taken apart like erector sets
		without any consideration of the
		public good i strongly recommend
		you to see through mr gekkos
		shameless intention here to
		strip this company and severely
		penalize the stockholders i
		strongly recommend you to reject
		his tender by voting for
		managements restructuring of the
		stock

						cut to

	gekko is now at floor level with a microphone hes calmer
	makes his pitch to the stockholders looking up at the
	management

				gekko
		i appreciate the chance youre
		giving me mr cromwell as the
		single largest stockholder in
		teldar to speak
			gets some laughter
			and applause loosens
		on the way here today i saw a
		bumper sticker it said life is a
		bitch then you die
			gets another laugh
		well ladies and gentlemen were
		not here to indulge in fantasies
		but in political and economic
		reality america has become a
		second rate power our trade
		deficit and fiscal deficit are at
		nightmare proportions in the days
		of the free market when our
		country was a top industrial power
		there was accountability to the
		shareholders the carnegies the
		mellons the man who built this
		industrial empire made sure of it
		because it was their money at stake
		today management has no stake in
		the company altogether these guys
		sitting up there own a total of
		less than 3 and where does mr
		cromwell put his million dollar
		salary certainly not in teldar
		stock he owns less than 1
		you own teldar paper the
		stockholders and you are being
		royally screwed over by these
		bureaucrats with their steak
		lunches golf and hunting trips
		corporate jets and golden
		parachutes teldar paper has 33
		different vice presidents each
		earning over 200000 a year i
		spent two months analyzing what
		these guys did and i still cant
		figure it out
			a big laugh


	cromwell is pissed

				cromwell
		this is an outrage gekko youre
		full of shit

				gekko
		one thing i do know is this paper
		company lost 110 million last
		year and id bet half of that is
		in the paperwork going back and
		forth between all the vice
		presidents
			increased laughter
			hes getting them
		the new law of evolution in
		corporate america seems to be
		survival of the unfittest well
		in my book you either do it right
		or you get eliminated teldar paper
		is doomed to fail its
		diversification into casualty
		insurance has not worked its crown
		jewels are its trees the rest is
		dross through wars depressions
		inflations and deterioration of
		paper money trees have always kept
		their value but teldar is chopping
		them all down forests are
		perishable forest rights are as
		important as human rights to this
		planet and all the illusory
		maginot lines scorched earth
		tactics proxy fights poison
		pills etc that mr
		cromwell is going to come up with
		to prevent people like me from
		buying teldar paper are doomed to
		fail because the bottom line
		ladies and gentlemen as you very
		well know is the only way to stay
		strong is to create value thats
		why you buy stock to have it go up
		if theres any other reason ive
		never hear it
			laughter
		thats all im sayingits you
		people who own this company not
		them they work for you and theyve
		done a lousy job of it get rid of
		them fast before you all get sick
		and die i may be an opportunist
		but if these clowns did a better
		job id be out of work in the
		last seven deals ive been in
		there were 23 million stockholders
		that actually made a pretax profit
		of 12 billion when i bought the
		ixtlan corporation it was in the
		exact same position teldar is
		today  i turned three of its
		companies private and i sold four
		others  and each of these
		companies liberated from the
		suffering conglomerate has
		prospered i am not a destroyer of
		companies i am a liberator of them
		the point is ladies and gentlemen
		greed is good greed works greed
		is right greed clarifies cuts
		through and captures the essence
		of the evolutionary spirit greed
		in all its forms greed for life
		money love knowledge has marked
		the upward surge of mankind  and
		greed mark my words  will save
		not only teldar paper but that
		other malfunctioning corporation
		called the usathank you

			bud
		thank you mr gekko first of all i

		from my dad its you guys that keep
		bluestar flying one  modernize
		our computer software is weak we
		update it we squeeze every dollar
		out of each seat and mile flown
		you dont sell a seat to a guy for
		89 when hes willing to pay 389
		effective inventory management
		through computerization will
		increase our load factor by 5 to
		20 that translates to
		approximately 50 to 200 million
		dollars in revenues the point is
		we can beat the majors at a price
		war two  advertising  more
		more and aggressive attack the
		majors three  expand our hubs to
		atlanta north carolina and dallas
		reorganize all our feeder schedules
		think big  guys were going
		after the majors

		if you mean what you say i think

		youve sketched some broad strokes
		id like to see the fine print but
		so far so good

				gekko
		fine if you dont want us stay
