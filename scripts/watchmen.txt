of the statue  the swat captain hoists a pair of binoculars

he glowers up at the owlship and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy

swat cop

swat cop ii

swat captain

12 ext liberty island  that moment  day
a hulking figure outfitted in scuba gear emerges from the water 
theres an evillooking rifle slung over his shoulder  as he
swaggers toward the base of the statue he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy costume underneath

superhero 4 the comedian  he pins a badge to his leather
breastplate incongruously its a happyface button  and it
matches his own nasty smile as he marches forward into battle

13 int base of statue  that moment  day
a trio of terrorists standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue  theyre holding a janitor at gunpoint  one of them is
fumbling with his walkietalkie which has inexplicably gone
haywire

terrorist i

flustered

terrorist ii
what the hell is going on

theres a sudden metallic clang behind them  they turn in unison 
just as the comedian struts into frame assault rifle in hand

panic  the three terrorists fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway  one of them grabs the janitor holds a gun to
his head

terrorist i
im not joking

the comedian shrugs okay  he lifts his rifle and fires two silenced
shots directly into the janitors gut  the old mans body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor stone dead

the terrorists stand there aghast  for an instant theyre too
stunned to shoot  the comedian breaks into a dopey grin 

comedian
the jokes on you

 and opens fire with a look of vicious pleasure on his face  as
the saying goes    its nice to see a man who enjoys his work

14 int owlship  that moment
rorschach and capt metropolis stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin  at the console night owl hits a button  then 

15 int observation room  a moment later  day
a sudden boom  a flash of color  the startled terrorists turn to
the nearest window and see a spectacular display of bicentennial
fireworks bursting above the harbor a short distance away

while the terrorists are distracted our attention shifts to a point
behind them  through an observation window we see capt metropolis
and rorschach sliding down a thin metal cable and landing on the
statues upraised torch

the terrorists turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch

ringleader
i dont like this  go downstairs and see whats up

16 ext statue  on torch  that moment  day
rorschach and capt metropolis pry open a metal door on the torch

rorschach

capt metropolis nods  he puts on a pair of ionized sunglasses and
goes through the door into the torch  rorschach waits
behind

17 int base of statue  a moment later  day
the comedian is wandering around with a map of the statues layout 
he spots what looks like a manhole cover set in the concrete floor
then strolls over and jimmies it open

another figure in scuba gear climbs out  but this ones different 
this ones a woman

silk spectre
about time  it stinks down there

comedian
bteams upstairs  we gotta find that bomb

wetsuit  you guessed it  a garish and kinda skimpy costume
underneath

silk spectre

comedian

18 int observation room  that moment  day
the terrorists tense up at the sound of footsteps  a moment later
capt metropolis appears on the stairs  the terrorists train their
guns on him  all but the ringleader who grabs a
tenyearoldgirl

ringleader
i dont know who you are pal but you just killed a little girl

capt metropolis
please  theres something id like you to see first

he holds up what looks like an oldfashioned photographers flash 
all at once the room goes white  and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed terrorists and hostages alike are toppling to the
floor their nervous systems temporarily fried

all except capt metropolis whos wearing his special sunglasses 
he pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work

19 int statue  near base  a moment later
an edgy terrorist all alone standing watch  suddenly hes grabbed
from behind  and the comedian is holding the point of a bayonet at
his throat

comedian
okay abdul  wheres the bomb

20 int observation room  a moment later  day
everyones slowly coming around  by now capt metropolis has the
terrorists tied up hes consoling a squawling threeyearold

he goes to a window gives the thumbsup sign to rorschach out on the
torch  rorschach signals the owlship

a metal ladder descends from the belly of the owlship  rorschach
secures it to the tip of the torch

22  int statue  midsection  that moment
silk spectre and the comedian marching up a long metal stairway

silk spectre

comedian

balls off

they look up  a terrorist is peering down at them from an overhead
landing  the comedian lifts his rifle thwip  before the terrorist
hits the floor the comedian has lobbed a gas grenade onto the
landing

23 int statue  stairway landing  a moment later
gas everywhere  the terrorists bomb and its a big fat one sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing with
unconscious terrorists sprawled all around it  silk spectre and the
comedian in gas masks march up the stairs to scope things out

comedian
well  they look distracted
turning to face her
dont suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies    

silk spectre
eddie  

suddenly panicked she grabs his shoulder points behind him  he
turns

one of the terrorists still has some life in him  he drags himself
over to the bomb and  with his last ounce of strength  flips a
switch on the housing

a timer begins to count down  thirty seconds  twentynine

comedian

he hits a trigger on his belt and a red signal light begins to
blink  he spots an elevator door runs over and pries it open  an
empty shaft the car is some twenty stories below them

silk spectre
what about the 

comedian
fuck em

theres a mountainclimbers carabiner on his belt he fastens it
around the elevator cable  and drops  silk spectre hesitates only
a second before following suit

24 int observation room  a moment later
capt metropolis is herding hostages down the stairway  all at once
he freezes  theres a red signal light flashing on his belt as
well

25 int owlship  that moment
yet another red light is flashing on night owls instrument panel 
he looks up at veidt on the monitor

night owl

night owl reluctantly agrees  he lets out the throttle

26 int statue  stairway landing  that moment
on the bomb  the timer shows ten seconds to go

27 int statue  elevator shaft  a moment later
the comedian and silk spectre plummet downward their belt clasps
throwing off sparks against the cable

28 int observation room  a moment later
capt metropolis at the window petrified with fear his hands
pressed to the glass  he watches as the owlship flies away  and
rorschach whos hanging onto the metal ladder is yanked bodily off
the torch

29 int statue  elevator shaft  that moment
the comedian makes a hard landing on the roof of a car  silk spectre
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open and the two of them dive through

30 aerial shot  moving over harbor  a moment later
rorschach clings desperately to the metal ladder as the owlship
streaks across the harbor  behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of lady liberty

three beats later a gaping hole blows open in her midsection

31  int owlship  that moment
a heartsick night owl pounds the control panel in frustration  on an
overhead monitor the upper portion of the statue is toppling

32 int statue  a moment later
smoke everywhere  the comedian and silk spectre are pressed flat
against a concrete bulkhead  an overhang protects them from falling
debris  which is raining down in copious amounts

33 ext ferry  a moment later
the furious swat captain watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into rubble and tumbles to the ground  he
turns away from the sight shaking his head in vehement disgust

swat captain
thats it  i quit

the water stirs  the boat begins to rock  on deck all eyes turn 

34 ext liberty island  that moment  day
 as a luminous blueskinned giant sixty feet tall wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island  he stares in dismay at the
demolished statue    like a modernday colossus of rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date

meet the last  and most powerful  member of our happy band dr
manhattan

down below the comedian and silk spectre  battered but intact 
are crawling out of the wreckage  the comedian looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them and shakes a gnatsized fist

comedian

timepieces of every description  pocket watches grandfather

fade through to

37 ext highrise  night
darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we tilt
up the towering facade of a fortystory apartment building  a blimp
drifts lazily through distant clouds the sounds of traffic echo
faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse  where
heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a shattered
plateglass window  super title

new york city  ten years later

38 ext street below  that moment  night
a ramshackle news kiosk  the owner fat and stubbly sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags staring at the
highrise across the street  three police cars  oddly truncated
bubbleshaped vehicles recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs  sit on the curb amid a throng of onlookers

a customer picks up a copy of the new york gazette new skirmish on
afghan border  russkies walk out on peace powwow

customer
crazy reds dont know who theyre messing with
indicating the cop cars
what happened over there

news vendor
some guy went sidewalk divin  twennyfive cents

39 ext highrise  street level  night
a riot of noise and color  a plainclothes cop takes a statement from
the doorman as pedestrians clustered around an nypd cordon stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk

patrolman
stand back  move along

we are not in new york as we know it in this strange offshoot of
reality everything  the clothes the cars the very look of the
city  seems just a touch off  the patrolman for instance
his standardissue uniform consists of full riot gear and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery  he clears
a path for a squad of paramedics who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance

det lt burns climbs out of his car squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague hyde the cop in charge of the
investigation

burns
had a lot of blood in him

hyde
you oughta see upstairs  its a slaughterhouse

burns
no idea whos behind this

hyde
small army from the looks of it  he put up one hell of a fight

burns nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window

burns
he would  you might as well know  its gonna get messy  we got a
call from washington

hyde
washington

burns
they want in  seems our friend here was hardcore ctu

hyde suddenly wideeyed at this new development stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic

40 ext street  another angle  that moment  night

tight on a large placard the end is nigh  the bearer of the sign
a hunched street crazy in a ratty raincoat plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer his back is to us but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright red hair

the news vendor eyes him suspiciously as he passes then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away  a small black kid leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book spots him too and makes a quick
crosseyed face  the street crazy lets out a low hissing growl in
response and plugs on

at the highrise a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks rivulets of water crisscross the street  as the street
crazy wanders along  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate

its a happyface button  a tiny diagonal fleck of blood stains its
surface like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight

the street crazy bends to retrieve it  he stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above

dissolve to

41 int highrise  hallway  night
camera drifts from the penthouse elevator down a long plushcarpeted
corridor  the hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
police line  do not cross  at the far end is a single door
sealed off

42 int penthouse apartment  night
moonlight shines on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window  at this altitude the wind is fierce and the curtains are
flapping wildly

a rope drops into view  a dark silhouette lands on the ledge outside

shards of glass crunch underfoot as this strange intruder steps
inside  he wears a slouch hat a heavy trenchcoat his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room

the apartment is as promised a slaughterhouse smashed art prints
gaping holes in the wallboard and gallons of blood everywhere  the
flashlight beam shines on the front door where three deadbolt locks
and an electronic alarm system are still in place undisturbed

the intruder turns suddenly  his beam strikes the splintered remains
of a fulllength wall mirror  and there in the cracked and spiky
glass we get our first good look at his face  or what passes for
his face

he has no eyes no nose no mouth nothing but a strange and
evershifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be  a living crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white

weve met him before  he goes by the name of rorschach

43 int penthouse  kitchen  that moment  night
rorschachs beam falls on the kitchen table  hungry flies walk
daintylegged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood 
offhandedly he brushes the flies away then he spots a sugar bowl 
he tips it over scoops up a handful of cubes deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket

44 int penthouse  bedroom  a moment later  night
the beam shines across rumpled bedclothes searches around the walls
and settles finally on the halfopen door to a walkin closet 
rorschach steps inside examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits

he shoves the suits aside  then mysteriously he begins to pound on
the wall with his fist moving left right up down thump  thump 
thump

he pauses  hes found a hollow section  he feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
concealed trigger  he presses it and a panel slides back revealing
a second secret closet hidden inside the first

he reaches up flicks on a light  inside the secret closet a
bizarre uniform  helmet mask and gloves a gaudycolored bodysuit
rows of exotic weaponry  on the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
photograph

rorschach examines the photo  its a group shot six men one woman
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms  the man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us  the comedians
costume

theyre all there all the watchmen night owl  silk spectre  capt
metropolis  dr manhattan  adrian veidt  and of course rorschach
himself  as he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by we

45 ext street corner  brooklyn  night
a light rain is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store  daniel dreiberg 44 thickset and bespectacled walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed  he seems meek defeated
 old before his time

he holds a hand to the skies sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella  then he turns down a deserted access street

46 ext access street  night
in an alleyway just off the access street theres a mugging in
progress two young street toughs their tinted hair tied up in
knottops rolling a middleaged man  across the street dreiberg
sees whats happening it takes some effort but he makes a conscious
decision to move on  then 

voice
hold up papasan

the knottops have emerged from the alleyway with their loot and
spotted dreiberg  an unwanted witness  menace in their eyes they
march toward him  he sets his bags down and turns to face them
almost welcoming the challenge and suddenly without warning we

47 flashback  processed footage
slowmo doubleframe or sepiatone you call it  but whatever the
gimmick it should suggest that the events were watching take place
in a stylized dreamtime midway between flashback and fantasy

its out old friend night owl duking it out with a gang of hoods in
an alleyway not unlike the one weve just left  theres a flurry of
fists the hoods topple in quick succession

 and all at once a burst of blinding light bleaches out the frame
transporting us back to

48 ext access street  night
realtime again  our reveries been interrupted by a shaft of
whitehot light sweeping across the street past dreiberg toward the
alley

loudspeaker
halt  do not try to resist 

the knottops run for it  dreiberg shields his eyes against the
light  which emanates from a police hovercraft hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head  the craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids

dreiberg bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway  he finds the old man slumped against a wall obviously past
help

49 int dreibergs apartment  night
three deadbolt locks slide back as dreiberg lets himself in  the
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the comedians
apartment but the decor is considerably less plush

dreiberg sets his bags on the floor removes his raincoat and hangs
it carefully in a closet  then he gathers his groceries heads for
the kitchen  and stops in his tracks confronted with a most
peculiar sight

dreiberg
   rorschach

50 int dreibergs kitchen  night
leaning back in a chair his feet propped up on the kitchen table is
the aforementioned rorschach  his inkblot mask is rolled partway up
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth and hes calmly eating a plate of
baked beans

dreiberg
how did you get in here

ignoring the question rorschach greets him in a soft rasping
utterly emotionless whisper

rorschach
hiya pardner  long time no see

dreiberg
did anybody follow you  see you come here

dreiberg is mildly panicked  rorschach  who couldnt care less 
emits his trademark hissing growl  he spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle

dreiberg cont
i cant believe youre back on the streets  good god man youre
wanted on fourteen counts of murder

rorschach
at least six of those are trumpedup   here

he reaches into his pocket finds the happyface button and flips it
to dreiberg  dreiberg eyes it for a moment automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red stain on its surface

rorschach cont
look familiar

dreiberg
sure  you got some kind of  bean juice on it

rorschach
human bean juice
beat
the comedian is dead

dreiberg stares down at the button suddenly getting the picture 
his jaw goes slack

rorschach cont
had a real nice place  penthouse suite forty stories up 
beautiful view 
hope he enjoyed it on the way down

dreiberg
jesus  what  a burglar    

rorschach snorts the possibility is too comical to consider

dreiberg cont
well god hed been working with the ctu for almost a decade  he
mustve had enemies

rorschach
so do i  so do you

dreiberg
rorschach that was a long time ago  i mean that  thats just
paranoia

rorschachs head jerks violently at the sound of the word  dreiberg
blinks involuntarily halfexpecting some kind of reprisal  but
rorschach merely stands adjusts his mask and starts toward the
front door

rorschach
maybe  or maybe somebodys finally caught up with us  somebody with
a grudge
pause
thought you might want to spread the word

dreiberg
hey  hey  if you dont mind use the back stairs all right

rorschach growls shakes his head in disgust  but complies  he
opens the back door pauses turns to dreiberg

rorschach
you the sentimental type daniel   brought you a souvenir

he reaches into his trenchcoat and hands dreiberg the framed photo
from the comedians wall  a moment later hes gone

dreiberg sits down unnerved  as he reaches for the wall phone
camera zeroes in on a face from the photo a blonde man in a purple
tunic and mask

oh  the ctu suspects a libyan hit squad

veidt
whats your theory

dr manhattan
life and death are unquantifiable abstracts  they dont concern
me

veidt peeks at laurie cocks an eyebrow same old jon  but laurie is
considerably less amused

laurie
i could use a drink  how about you adrian

veidt nods yes  dr manhattan meanwhile has moved off to another
part of the lab  he stands before a vast bank of machinery  and as
we watch a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side

a module of circuit boards chips and pin connectors slides out of
the hole  individual components detach themselves and hang in
midair  dr manhattan hasnt lifted a finger hes dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind

veidt has seen these parlor tricks before  he ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat

veidt
i guess youll be dismantling russian tanks soon

dr manhattan
you mean afghanistan
beat
it wont require my attention  what im doing here is far more
interesting

the module now fully reconstructed slides back into place  the
cover panel rises off the floor settles over the hatch and screws
itself shut

veidt
well    i wanted to bring you the news about blake but  as
usual  i cant tell you anything you dont already know  goodbye
jon

dr manhattan nods  just barely  veidt heads for the door finds
his coat where laurie put it  hes just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand

laurie
adrian  dont leave so soon  i 

veidt
ill take a raincheck laurie

laurie
please

theres a note of desperation in her voice  veidt glances over his
shoulder at dr manhattan  whos forty feet tall again playing
with his superaccelerator

veidt
hes a little farther gone every time

laurie
stay adrian  i just  every once in a while i need to talk to
someone human
beat
he doesnt think like we do  he doesnt even feel what we feel  i
mean  he even scares the research teams

veidt
laurie  hes the most powerful man whos ever lived  hes changed
the world

laurie
embarrassed
i know  i shouldnt be saying this  hes happy hes content hes
doing his work 

veidt
what about you

laurie
i suppose im serving my purpose arent i
pause
ill ring for the guards

she goes to the steel door hits a buzzer  veidt watches her
concerned  she coughs violently and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case

veidt
nasty cough   try one of mine
handing her a cigarette
darling you need to get out of the house  why dont you give
daniel a call  im sure hed be glad to hear from you

laurie
maybe ill do that

veidt
im sorry about blake

he pats her on the shoulder  the door slides open and the troops
appear to escort veidt back down the hallway

laurie takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover  he tinkers with his equipment then satisfied he turns and
walks through a solid brick wall  as if it werent there

a decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood
popular with denizens of the underworld accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level

56 int happy harrys  night
the usual crowd living it up  hookers line the bar  drug dealers
hover at the entrance to the mens room  assorted goons and thugs
stand clustered at the pool table watching a topless dancer bump and
grind  suddenly theres a terrible racket and everyone turns

over by the entrance rorschach is hard at work ripping a pay phone
off the wall  once he has it on the floor he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar then he strides casually over to the
bar  where the proprietor happy harry is nervously polishing
glasses

rorschach
harry

harry
petrified
rrorschach

rorschach
phones out of order  mind if i use yours

he reaches under the counter sets a phone on the bar  rorschach
picks it up and flings it at a nearby table scattering the patrons
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall

he turns and faces the assembled multitudes

rorschach
edward blake  friend of mine  fell through a window  mightve had
help
wandering through the room
thought maybe you could fill me in

enormous toughs sit riveted to their chairs staring up in horror as
rorschach strolls past

rorschach cont
you  gideon  whoremonger  nothing
moving on
johnny gobs  whats new at the schoolyard

behind rorschachs back a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit  rorschach pivots suddenly grabs him by the collar
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall

rorschach cont
nicky the jap  in a hurry  you keeping secrets nicky

nicky sits slumped against the wall quaking with fear  rorschach
extends a hand to help him up  he reaches out hesitantly 

 and rorschach grabs him by the wrist pulling him off balance  he
closes a gloved fist around nickys pinky finger twists it back and
snaps it

rorschach cont
edward blake  who killed him

no answer forthcoming  nicky lets out a horrible moan as rorschach
grabs his index finger and repeats the process

rorschach cont
who killed edward blake

nicky passes out  rorschach releases his grip lets nicky sink to
the floor and reaches for his crowbar  hes standing poised to let
fly at nickys ribs when a voice in the crowd shouts out

voice
jesus  hes in shock

rorschach
the comedian  who killed him

by now harrys pulled a sawedoff shotgun from underneath the bar 
without looking up rorschach spins and heaves the crowbar  it
catches harry in the jaw pitching him back into a rack of
glassware  the shotgun discharges two harmless blasts into the
ceiling

silence in the bar as the onlookers await rorschachs next move  he
looks at the bleeding harry shakes his head in disgust

rorschach cont
so many vermin    so little time

he bends pulls a topcoat off nickys quivering frame and tosses it
contemptuously at the nude dancer  then he turns to go pausing long
enough to hiss at the crowd

rorschach cont
go back to your heroin and your child pornography  ill be
around

empty

a luminous blue hand enters frame strokes her cheek gently  laurie
closes her eyes and sighs

dr manhattan
im here laurie

laurie
is it time  dyou have to leave for the funeral

dr manhattan
not yet theres plenty of time

a second blue hand strokes her hair  laurie stretches luxuriantly 
dr manhattan kisses her softly on the throat

laurie
mmm  you feel so good  do you have to go

the blue hand runs down the length of lauries shoulder and arm
toward her hip  she sighs dreamily

dr manhattan
would you like me to stay

laurie
mm hmm

dr manhattan
i could stay and go

laurie
   and just how would you manage that

she leans up to kiss him  the second blue hand continues its
downward progress almost colliding with a third blue hand which is
massaging lauries thigh

third blue hand  wait a minute  lauries eyes go suddenly
wide  she sits bolt upright in bed

dr manhattan is stretched out beside her  he is also sitting at the
foot of the bed  there seem to be two of him

laurie

dr manhattan i
laurie  are you 

dr manhattan ii
dont be upset

this unique menage a trois proves a bit much for lauries
fragile nerves  she climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown

laurie
jon please  i dont enjoy these tricks  just  be one
person again please

the big blue twins stand up spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as laurie stalks past

dr manhattan i
laurie i did it to please you  i thought 

dr manhattan ii
 you would find it erotic

laurie
all right all right  its just  my nerves im going stircrazy
in this place i 

while fumbling in her purse for a cigarette laurie happens to glance
through a doorway into the lab outside  to her utter astonishment
she sees a third dr manhattan out there calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys  she marches angrily through
the door    

58 int lab  a moment later
   to confront dr manhattan number three

laurie
youve been out here all along havent you  running one of your
stupid experiments 

dr manhattan iii
yes i thought i could finish up before i leave for washington

laurie
so you sent your your proxies in there to  jon really how
could you do this

dr manhattan iii
you seem to feel ive been neglecting you  isnt that the case
pause
i thought id solved the problem quite elegantly

laurie
thats all it is to you isnt it  just another problem you
can 

she doesnt see the other two dr manhattans who have just entered
the room behind her  they speak in perfect unison

dr manhattans i  ii
laurie please 

laurie pivots lets out a little squeal of shock  she turns back
slowly steadies herself on a lab table

laurie
jon  just go to washington all right  and take them with you  i
could really use the time alone

she storms back into the living quarters past dr manhattans i

beautiful in full makeup and lowcut evening gown  but its largely
wasted on her preoccupied date

at the moment shes filling him in on life with dr manhattan

laurie
the governments really worried  he gets so flaky sometimes  i
guess its no picnic being the worlds only superhuman
mockmacho
i have to keep him in line

she flexes her bicep and holds the pose waiting for dreiberg to
laugh  he doesnt  in fact he barely even notices his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room

laurie cont
excuse me  where exactly are you tonight

dreiberg
sorry its this thing with blake  i mean you dont really think
anyones out to get us  do you

laurie
dan are you really that paranoid  lets face it eddie blake was no
mother teresa

dreiberg
psychotic pig  he had it coming  mr ctu    

laurie
now wait  we all had the same option as blake  it was work for the
government or do time

dreiberg
fine but the civil terrorism unit  its a fucking gestapo  dirty
tricks  political assassinations 

now hes got laurie nervous  she scans the restaurant quickly then
leans forward and speaks in hushed tones

laurie
okay okay  you made your choice  you went underground  some of us
made other choices

dreiberg
shaking his head in disgust

yeah  that pig blake gets buried at arlington full military honors
   and im still in the psycho file with rorschach

laurie looks at him a moment  she starts to chuckle

dreiberg cont
whats so funny  have i got food in my teeth

laurie
im just wondering what you wouldve said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now
raising her glass
well heres to the comedian  cause the fact is hes dead

dreiberg makes a face  and smiles despite himself

1 ext rooftop outside restaurant  night

which overlooks the manhattan skyline  theyre holding big snifters
of brandy and theyre both pretty well drunk

dreiberg

dreiberg

sentries stand at attention  theyve blocked off the part of the

been spotted nonetheless and word of his presence is spreading like

mourners and tourists are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman  with all due
respect for the dead arlington nationals turning into a zoo
gawkers are lined up three or four deep  the sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd

a kid breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to

out

the major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off  the
guards stand at attention then fall in behind them as they pass

adamson holds the car door open  lauries climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic

the entrance to the research center has just opened  and emerging
from it onto the walkway are a halfdozen men in full radiation
suits

donutshaped housing traverses its length repeatedly head to foot
foot to head sending a threedimensional readout telemetrically to

furious she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window  the agents exhange cool glances  like all experienced
torturers they understand the value of patience

laurie cont
i want to get dressed   and id like a cigarette

one of the agents pulls a pack from his coat shakes a cigarette out
for laurie  as hes lighting it  a perfect gentleman  the door
opens and a lab technician enters with a clipboard

he passes the clipboard to schmidt who examines its contents  and
tilts an eyebrow  laurie looking on is about to burst with
curiosity

are all close associates of dr manhattan  they have something else
in common as well

takes it  then sets it down staggered by what shes read

what does this mean  what does it 

schmidt

see why its so vital that we locate your    friends

thats it  this is all a trick isnt it  some kind of horrible
joke to make me 

she scans the room  no ones laughing  schmidt gets up signals to
his comrades and heads for the door

schmidt

a navyblue doublebreasted suit a white shirt and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern

the tie doesnt quite suit him  his brow wrinkles and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate widered job with diagonal
gold stripes

too staid  dr manhattan frowns and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royalblue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration

it does nice things for his complexion  satisfied he turns from the

applause from the crowd  angle widens to include doctor m seated at
brinkleys right  he nods in acknowledgement

brinkley cont
i suppose the topic on everyones mind this week is afghanistan
where russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion  now
since youve dealt successfully with similar situations in the past 
  ill ask you pointblank has the administration requested that
you intervene

dr manhattan
i will not intervene in afghanistan

a hubbub goes up among the crowd

72 angle on military liaison
looking on from offstage  he rolls his eyes in frustration

73 angle on set  brinkley and dr manhattan
hands are already shooting up among the newsmen in the audience 
brinkley ignores them

brinkley
youre saying you would refuse a direct request

dr manhattan
there will be no request  i will not intervene

brinkley
well doctor its widely understood or rumored that you can
actually see the future  does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in afghanistan will blow over

74 angle on military liaison
hes steamed but like everyone else in the studio hes hanging on
dr manhattans every word  he turns apprehensively to a colleague
in the shadows behind him  and snaps his fingers once

liaison
i want a phone line to the booth  now

75 angle on brinkley and dr manhattan
dr manhattan
i see the future only as it relates to me  i have no control over it
long pause
i can only repeat    that there will be no request  and i will
not intervene

he sits there like a big blue buddha  brinkley shrugs and presses on

brinkley
well then  i hope we can take that as an optimistic sign  ill
open up the floor to questions now  doug

reporter

roth

have to

77 angle on set  brinkley roth dr manhattan

diagnosed  now for the record doctor  is there a

by now the crowd is about to erupt  roth is shouting to make
himself heard over the din  brinkley whos just gotten a message
from the booth touches his headset and announces

brinkley
im told its time for a break  well be back after this brief
message 

within seconds the military liaison has rushed out onto the set
flanked by two colleagues in mirrorshades

liaison
that does it  no more questions  shows over

the three of them all but yank dr manhattan out of his seat  then
pandemonium breaks loose as eager newsmen bolt the gallery and mob
the set

random newsmen
dr manhattan  are these allegations true  do you cause
cancer

dr manhattan
i dont wish to answer any questions

random newsmen
you see the future  did you know in advance 

liaison
the doctor will not answer your questions  now step
aside

the liaison and his boys form a wedge in front of dr manhattan but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable

random newsmen
how long have you known  why is the government concealing this
information 

dr manhattan
please get out of my way

the liaison throws an elbow knocking a reporter to the floor 
scuffling breaks out  just as its getting vicious dr manhattan
lets out a thunderous shout

dr manhattan
i said leave me alone

in the wink of an eye the soundstage is empty  no newsmen no
microphones no cameras  nothing but the lone figure of dr
manhattan and still sitting in the chair behind him brinkley

brinkley swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie  a moment later
theres an angry flash of white light  and dr manhattan vanishes
leaving brinkley alone on the deserted set

light  the gecko runs wildly as dr manhattan steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth

the rupture heals itself and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as dr manhattan trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of gila flats  he wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen tables are overturned bottles broken but the long
mahogany bar though pitted and scarred stands intact

a desert rat scurries down its length as dr manhattan looks on  we
move in on his emotionless glowing eyes and

dissolve to

81 int canteen flashback  day
its twentyodd years ago and were looking at dr jonathan osterman
 a big boyish cleancut guy of twentysix dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat  hes at a table sipping a mug of beer wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion

janey slater os
nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor  youd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger

jon laughs looks sheepishly down at his hands  hes utterly smitten
with dr janey slater his colleague at the test base shes a couple
of years older than he and pretty in a heavilycoiffed way  just
close enough to laurie that youd notice the resemblance  and shes
probably the only one in the room who cant see just how bad a crush
jon has on her

jon
ill say  if we ever get off this looneytune project im gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak

janey
with lots of ketchup

smiling she indicates jons plate  hes emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries

jon
nothing wrong with ketchup

janey
jon osterman you dont act like a princeton boy  whats a big lug
like you doing in a place like this

jon
anything for science i guess
long hesitant pause
janey theres something 

janey
simultaneously
we should get back 
realizing shes cut him off
what

jon
nothing  what were you going to say

janey
we should get back to the lab
staring at him chuckling
you okay jon

he stares at his hands afraid to meet her eyes  after a moment he
pipes up

jon
oh yeah  you go ahead  ill be right behind you

the lad seems a little screwy today  janey shrugs gets up and heads
for the door  jon takes a moment to collect himself then looks after
janey  shes paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch

his face goes a little pale  he screws up his courage rushes up
behind her

janey
stupid watch  stopped again  do you have the 

jon
blurting it out
janey will you marry me

she turns and looks him squarely in the face  hes wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict

janey
jon  what

jon swallows hard and the two of them stare at each other eyes
locked  for a moment its as if theyre the only souls in the
canteen  but just then two scientists come bustling through the
door clipboards in hand deep in a conversation of their own and
one of them  dr wally weaver  walks smack into the startled
janey causing her to drop her wristwatch

theres a loud crunch  jon and janey snap out of their private
trance as wally bends to retrieve the watch

wally
christ janey i think i stepped on your watch

janey
oh wally dont feel bad  it was cheap it never worked anyway 

jon
i can fix it

janey
 what

jon
my dads a watchmaker  ill put it back together for you  better
than ever

he holds out his hand  their eyes meet for a long moment

wally
take him up on it  itd make me feel better

chuckling wally and his colleague head off to find a table  janey
hands jon the watch his hands close around her and he gazes at her
with bassethound eyes  she realizes hes still waiting for his
answer

but before she can speak jon produces a small box from his pocket 
he thrusts it abruptly into janeys hands 

jon
here  ill trade you

 and hustles off  she opens the box finds an engagement ring 
with a little smile she tries it on and turns to show jon  but
hes already gone

she stares at the ring  her smile broadens

82 int laboratory  day
jons at a lab table papers stacked all around him  in the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with jewelers
tools

its his lunch hour and hes fixing janeys watch  he tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap

with a big childlike grin of satisfaction  the boys in love
remember  he gets up and starts for the door  the lab is jammed
with oversized arcane machinery the centerpiece is a concrete test
chamber with twofootthick metal walls  mounted on either side of
it are particle cannons  great bulky devices which look like
antiaircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils

he stops spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner and
walks over to grab it  as hes putting it on he hears a tiny squeak
from the direction of the test chamber

mounted above the chamber is a digital clock  hours minutes
seconds tenths of seconds  just now its 1358 and change  jon
eyes the clock hesitates briefly then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber

inside the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform  and a mouse which scurries into the corner when it
hears jon coming  he steps inside sets janeys watch on the
concrete block and swings the broom at the mouse

jon
cmon little guy outta here    

the mouse legs it out the door  jon follows smiling broom in
hand

jon cont
   dont wanna screw up a milliondollar experiment

he stops  feels around in his pocket  realizes hes left the watch
inside

he looks at the overhead clock again  135930 and counting 
agitated now he races back toward the chamber pauses in the
doorway spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block  he dashes inside circles around the concrete
block reaches for the watch 

 and freezes at the sound of three warning beeps behind him

whitefaced he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block  too quickly  he nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber

before his eyes a massive steel door is sliding into place 
trapping him inside

he lurches toward the door gets a hand through  the door keeps
sliding  he jerks his hand back a halfsecond before the door slams
shut

83 int lab  entry  that moment
1300 hours sharp  a halfdozen scientists stroll into the lab  one
of them is passing out goggles  to his colleagues and a pair of
military bigwigs who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities

scientist
 actually we dont know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field  all weve managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell

general
joking but worried
no danger of    fallout is there

scientist
no sir  the chambers radiationproof once its sealed  thats why
we waited outside

the translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red

the crowd draws closer goggles in place  theres a dim distant
thumping

the scientists look at the chamber  and go slackjawed in perfect
unison

general
whats the matter

scientist
sweet jesus  

we dolly in rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber  leaded glass two feet thick  behind it is the
terrified face of jon osterman  pounding frantically on the glass
screaming soundlessly

pandemonium in the lab as the scientists rush right and left
punching buttons twisting knobs  to no avail  the general comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization

general
say theres a man in there

the coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow  one
scientist stands at the observation window and shouts 

scientist i
stay calm jon  well try and kill the power

 while another barks furiously into a wall phone

scientist ii
building six  kill the power  ostermans trapped in the if
chamber

the general stands there looking rather nonplussed

general
well  why doesnt someone let him out

scientist iii
its a timelock  it cant be opened once the sequence
starts
to scientist ii
whats the word

scientist ii
covering the phone
theyre sending a crew to the generator building 

scientist iv
twenty seconds

in a glass box on the wall is a fire ax  with the instructions in
case of fire break glass  wally weaver jons friend from the
canteen wraps his lab coat around his forearm punches through the
glass and grabs the ax

scientist i
wally  what are you doing

wally
the power cables

and now another figure enters the lab  the unsuspecting janey
slater

janey
am i late for the 

she stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab  scientist iii spots her grabs her tries to push her back
through the door

scientist iii
janey  get her out of here  get out

but she resists  shes just spotted wally with his ax poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor  the cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant luminous white

janey
what in the name of  wheres jon

scientist iii
janey  please  go

wally strikes at the cable  nothing  he takes another whack and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall

sparks fly but the process continues  the room is full of white
light  janey fighting her way past the scientist gets a good look
at the observation panel  and the blood drains from her face

janey
jon

84 int test chamber  that moment
jon backs away from the glass panel a look of disbelief on his
face  he blinks his hands fall limply at his sides the watch
which hes been holding all along falls on the floor and shatters 
  

   and everything in the room goes blue

85 int lab  that moment
the scientists slowly cluster around the observation panel unable to
tear their eyes away  janey past hope wanders up unsteadily behind
them

janey
jon   
shrieking
jon

86 int test chamber  that moment
jons back is arched  his arms go up  his face is a mask of
unbelievable agony

a moment later his skin is gone  a black skeleton  like a
photographic negative  stands in his place

then the skeleton bursts   into its constituent atoms  the
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken jon osterman to
pieces

and then the test chamber is empty  the blue light begins to dim
and were looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the scientists  one by one they back away    leaving only janey
who gazes into the chamber with a blank soulless stare

dissolve to

87 int ruined canteen present day  night
the desert rat chitters on the bar  on the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock which stopped some twenty years ago
at 1148 pm

for a moment dr manhattan even more abstracted than usual watches
the rat  then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen

88 ext desert  night
dr manhattan walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound

89 int mens room flashback  night
two scientists washing their hands at the sinks  they glance up into
the mirror simultaneously and blanch  behind them a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair  a brain eyes a dangling spinal
cord wriggling neurons  a gruesome disembodied central nervous
system

they pivot shrieking just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light

90 ext desert  night
dr manhattan keeps on walking

91 ext test base flashback  night
horrified sentries fire their rifles then turn and run  a
partiallymuscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and screams
for several seconds before vanishing altogether

93 int gila flats mess hall flashback  night
dinnertime  janey and wally at a table

janey
i cant help it  im going to quit this place  it feels    it
feels haunted

wally
itll be all right janey  you need time thats all
tugging at his ear
do you hear some kind of  whistling

indeed she does and within moments it builds to a deafening whine 
odder yet wallys hair is standing on end  and so is janeys 
everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon

utensils rise from tables and drift magically into the air  without
warning the overhead lights blow out  and a brilliant blue glow
suffuses the room  all eyes turn toward the source of the glow   

   the fully formed figure of dr manhattan floating above them
nude hands spread like some majestic blue messiah  metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him throwing off sparks

janey gapes at his face  she recognizes it instantly  her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible endless shriek

janey
jonnnn

dissolve to

94 ext desert  night
the shriek dies as dr manhattan stares up into space  he turns
stares at the ground  nothing but sand  he stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig

a couple of inches down he finds what hes looking for an ancient
tattered photograph faded almost beyond recognition  young jon and
janey slater  shes holding up her hand showing off her brandnew
engagement ring

his fist close around the snapshot  his eyes slowly shut

95 series of shots
quick almost subliminal visions of the past and future

 jons black skeleton bursting to atoms in the test chamber

 janey shrieking in the mess hall her face bathed in blue
light

 laurie at a breakfast table drinking coffee reading the paper 
theres a sudden flash of light the windows shatter inward a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones    

 a city demolished by a nuclear blast the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly blotting out the sky

96 ext desert  on dr manhattan
fists still clenched he stands  grimacing distraught alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert  he rises into the air slowly at
first then faster    finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground

97 ext outer space
all at once were back in the starry void hurtling away from earth
at unimagined speeds    through empty space past the moon on

the red planet looms larger and larger finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the martian surface 
individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct
vast canyons oceans of fog volcanoes the size of missouri 
herschels famous canali  and finally the argyre
planitia an enormous shallow crater its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and to the south a ragged semicircular
ridge

their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit em

pacific and the arctic circle and veer toward russian turf

well sir    in a worstcase scenario    wed assume that
twentyfive percent of the russian birds get through

what kind of time frame are we talking about

thirty minutes maximum  of course i assume wed be in the fortified

commercial theme  on the tv a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a wedding picture framed in silver

laurie

rorschach lets himself in

tv chorus

rorschach
moloch

no reply from moloch who sits in an easy chair his back to camera
seemingly glued to the tube  rorschach casts a cautious glance
around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair  onscreen
the woman at the vanity opens a jar and smear limegreen goo on her
face

her tone is unmistakably flirtatious  dreiberg hesitates  then
with a noncommittal smile he moves to the record cabinet

123 int tenement flat  night
rorschach making a hasty exit  an amplified voice booms out

loudspeaker
rorschach  this is the civil terrorism unit  you have one minute to
come out

he goes to the window and peeks through the blinds  on the street
outside bubble cars are massing blocking off the intersection  a
ctu swat team prepares to raid the building

loudspeaker
you wont be harmed  come out  its all over

hes walked into a trap  as he lets the blinds fall all sound dies
 and a bouncy tinkling piano theme comes up underneath

124 int dreibergs apartment  night
the piano music emanates from dreibergs stereo an old fats waller
tune sposin  hes slow dancing with laurie their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television  with a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses then deposits them in his shirt
pocket

dreamily she rests her hand on his shoulder  her nearness is making
him nervous  she pauses in midstep and takes his face in her
hands  he tries to look away but she pulls his face around  so
that he cant avoid her gaze any longer  and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth

the piano intro ends and fats teasing vocal begins

sposin i should fall in love with you    
do you think that you could love me too   

125 int tenement  that moment  night mos
song continues underneath cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie  rorschach races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic mop bucket plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans 
ordinary household supplies  he enters the kitchen rummages around
under the sink finds another handful of bottles cleaning fluid 
rubbing alcohol drano

almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove turns on all the
burners  and blows out the flames

sposin i should hug you and caress you    
would it impress you   

126 int tenement  front stairwell  that moment mos
a contingent of armed ctu men rushing silently up the stairs

or would it distress you  hmm

127 int tenement  that moment mos
rorschach dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol  theres a pile of bottles  only halfemptied 
resting next to the front door  the ctu cops are pounding on the
front door trying to break it down  rorschach crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room

the door finally gives way and the cops tumble in  rorschach
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an aerosol can 
creating a minature flamethrower  the cops heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches  and a moment later the pile of
bottles explodes engulfing the doorway in flame

sposin i should say for you i yearn    
yeah i yearn  sure i do
would you think im speaking out of turn   

128 int dreibergs apartment  night
dreiberg and laurie horizontal on the sofa their clothes in
disarray  laurie kisses him hungrily  but hes distant panicky
unable to respond  its been a long time for him  its not going
well

sposin i declare it

he wriggles beneath her  she takes his hand presses it onto her
breast

129 int tenement  that moment  night mos
instrumental bridge continues underneath as rorschach backs through
the kitchen with his bucket  smoke billows in from the living room

he empties two bottles of cooking oil on the linoleum floor  then he
ducks through a door into the back stairwell

130 int stairwell landing  a moment later mos
rorschach opens a bottle of cleaning fluid stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck  the first wave of cops  coughing and hacking from
the smoke  makes it into the kitchen just as he ignites his molotov
cocktail and tosses it inside

the cops pitch backward as the bottle blows up  by the time they hit
the floor the cooking oil has burst into flame

rorschach bolts up the stairs by now another squad of ctu men is
coming up with back way behind him

131 int kitchen  a moment later mos
charred cops leaping flames  camera zeroes in on the gas stove

132 ext tenement  that moment  night mos

hails down on the ctu units outside  reenter fats on vocals

133 int dreibergs apartment  night
laurie is fumbling with dreibergs pants  finally he cant stand it
anymore  and with a pained stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa  his head sinks into his hands  at first she
doesnt understand then her face softens and she moves to his side
embracing his shoulders gently stroking his hair

   or would it distress you

134 int tenement  back stairwell  that moment mos
rorschach huddled on the uppermost landing just below roof level 
by now the whole building is ablaze  two flights down a pair of ctu
cops are fighting their way through the inferno still on his tail

he still has his mop bucket its halffull of water  he reaches for
his last can  a can of drano  and empties it into the bucket
where it begins to hiss and sizzle

sposin i should say for you i yearn    
would you think im speaking out of turn   

the cops are almost on him racing upward two steps at a time  he
steps out in front of them and  before they can hoist their
weapons  heaves the bucketful of boiling drano into their faces

the cops shriek soundlessly and topple backwards into the flames as
rorschach turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof

135 ext tenement roof  a moment later  night
rorschach emerges  and a blinding light catches him full in the
face  hovering not twenty feet overhead is a police airship  a
blimplike craft of the sort we saw earlier  a spray of machinegun
fire peppers the roof

sposin i declare it
would you take my love and share it   

rorschach scuttles along the edge of the roof finds a rickety fire
escape and dives over  unfortunately hes now exposed on the front
of the building  pinned to the wall by gunfire from the swat team on
the street  tongues of flame dart from nearby windows  he turns and
tries to climb back upward but more cops  frm the justlanded
airship  are already spilling over the edge of the roof

i aint sposin im in love with you

the song ends  and on the last note rorschach emits an ungodly howl
of fury  diving over the metal railing plunging to the street
below

136 ext street  that moment
three stories down he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans  and
lies there spent twisted wracked with pain  the ctu cops are on
him instantly kicking him pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts

cops
get him  get his mask  lets see the little fuckers face

rorschach
gnaaaahh  no no

in seconds the inkblot mask is off  revealing a pocked doughy face
topped off with a shock of matted red hair  its a familiar
 face    the face of the street crazy who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world

cop
christ  hes got fiveinch heels  the fuckin runt wears
elevator shoes

rorschach
no  no  give it back

he kicks and claws at the cops as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van

cop ii
so thats the terror of the underworld  that ugly little zero

rorschach

the van doors slam shut on rorschach  just as the first fire trucks
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement

follows

the others are on him in an instant pinning him against the serving
counter  instead of resisting rorschach vaults backward  he brings
a knee up into goon iis chine grabs a fistful of goon is hair and
tumbles back over the counter  dragging goon is head face down
into a steam tray full of bubbling soup

landing on his feet keeping his grip on goon is hair rorschach
uses his free hand to bury a fork in a cafeteria workers gut  goon
ii lunges at him across the counter  he grabs a vat off a nearby
burner and with a single sweep of the arm douses both goons  with
hot cooking fat

all this has taken five seconds maximum  whistles shriek as the two
disfigured goons writhe on the floor in hideous agony faces cracked
and smoking  cafeteria workers clear a path as prison guards rush in
with billy clubs drawn

the german shepherds romp in the dying light  we close in on the
dogs until we see what it is theyre tussling over a big bloody knob
of bone

rorschach vo cont
decided to wait for the owner    

150 int factory  entry  night flashback
keys in the lock  a moment later the door swings wide  a fat man
enters and whistles to the dogs

fat man
fred  barney  dinnerti

rorschach steps out of the shadows and bashes him over the head

151 int interrogation room  day
rorschach master of suspense decides to take a break in the
story  he leans back in his chair  finally dr long dreading his
reply asks

dr long
then what happened

rorschach
   made a little trip to the butcher store  locked up tight  had
to break in

152 int factory  night flashback
the fat man squirms on the floor a gag in his mouth  hes
handcuffed to an exposed pipe  rorschach strides into frame with a
grocery sack

he kneels beside the fat man and loosens his gag  then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack

fat man
what  what are you d

rorschach silences the fat man by cramming a fistful of raw hamburger
into his open mouth  hes got several pounds of the stuff and he
spends the next few seconds smearing it all over the fat mans face
throat and hands stuffing the leftovers down his shirt  when hes
done he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of steer
blood    and empties it over the fat mans head

frantic scratching from outside  rorschach strolls over to the door
and  as the fat man wriggles in helpless terror  lets the dogs
inside

then he stands back and enjoys the carnage

153 int interrogation room  day
dr long looks on goggleeyed as rorschach cheerfully wraps things
up

rorschach
when they finished eating picked up a cleaver     split their
skulls  died happy  full bellies
leaning forward
see god didnt kill the little girl  or the man that killed
her    or the dogs or me  if god saw what any of us did
he didt seem to mind

dr long
that man then he was the first  the first you 

rorschach
saw the world that night  random empty hideous  god didnt make
it that way  we did  we make the world  in our own image
slight smile
what else can i illuminate

longs had enough  he reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
prison guards file in  rorschach gets up before he turns to go he
points a finger at longs inkblot

rorschach cont
no right and wrong doc  you said so  maybe not a dog  maybe   
just a mans face
pause
see it now

the guards drag rorschach out  dr long still queasy empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry  after a
second he reaches for his briefcase as hes gathering his cards he
stops suddenly  his gaze riveted to the random symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack  its seems to shift before his eyes

long blinks swallows hard  we move in tighter and tighter on the
rorschach blot inky blackness filling the screen as we

dissolve to

154 ext barn  toward dusk
a rural treelined area outside the city  a compact bubblecar pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops dreiberg gets out goes to
the padlocked doors fumbles in his pocket for a key

after a moment laurie wanders up beside him

laurie
enough is enough daniel  where exactly are we

dreiberg

he opens the padlock ushers laurie inside

155 int barn  a moment later
inside the barn is a huge oblong shape covered with a tarpaulin

laurie

dreiberg
gimme a hand with the tarp would you  you take that side

she goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp  the two of them pull
it back to reveal   

the owlship  night owls hightech hovercraft  its a bit
tarnished from years of disuse but its still an impressive sight 
dreiberg stands back to admire it an impressed laurie wanders around
to join him wearing an eartoear grin

laurie
the owlship  i cant believe it

dreiberg
 i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check

156 int owlship  that moment
the two of them enter  dreiberg sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while laurie wanders through the cabin
reliving days gone by

laurie
wow this brings back some memories  does it still fly

dreiberg
i took her out a couple of summers back  scared the hell out of some
cows   i wonder if shed make it down to antarctica

laurie

dreiberg
adrians headed down to his secret retreat  he invited us to come
along
pause
ive been thinking  if things do get nasty    it wouldnt be a
bad place to sit out a war

laurie
would you want to sit out a war  i mean  what would be
left

dreiberg
you and me

he looks directly at her  suddenly uncomfortable she averts her
gaze gets up and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin  dreiberg turns back to the control panel feeling subtly
rejected

dreiberg
   yeah youre right  probably wouldnt make it down there
anyway

behind him laurie lets out a little squeal of delight  shes just
opened a compartment door inside it are a handful of gaudy costumes
 their old superhero togs

laurie
dan  the spare costumes  i cant believe you kept them

dreiberg
me neither  mine barely even fits
chuckling
the thing is i try to remember why we did it and i cant  helping
people or righting wrongs or trying to save the world    i dont
know  it all seems so abstract

lauries holding her old costume up against her shoulders eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink

laurie
god you sound like jon   turn around

dreiberg
what are you up to

laurie
dont look  turn around

smirking he complies  laurie begins to undress in the back of the
cabin

dreiberg
thisd better not be what i think it is

laurie
okay

dreiberg turns around  lauries in full costume looking quite
imposing and in a perverse way quite beautiful  he feigns
shock

dreiberg cont
my god its the silk spectre  scourge of the underworld defender
of the weak

laurie
in the flesh

she ambles over to the control panel embraces dreiberg from behind
and strokes his thinning hair

laurie cont

dreiberg

smiling
maybe we can still save ourselves

157 ext south street seaport  dusk
a massive peace rally downtown  thousands of citizens have turned
out placards and protest signs are everywhere  each remark is met
by cheers and chants by raucous 
boos as well    and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks theyre all frightened as hell

things are much the same in london berlin  possibly even moscow 
the end is nigh and passions flare  its anarchy waiting to

end of the world

the two of them grapple at the mike and the heckler falls off the
stage  on cue the crowd erupts  fights break out cops start
swinging rifle butts

as pronukers swarm the stage our gaze turns upward  a trio of
hovercraft hangs in the air above the seaport  their undersides 
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets  bear the initials
ctu

ctu men watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy

wiping his hands on an oily rag  he calls inside to laurie

dreiberg

no reply  curious he climbs aboard

161 int owlship  that moment
lauries standing by the monitor over the instrument console  her
face is distraught agonized

laurie
daniel you ought to take a look at this

onscreen its total screaming chaos  cannons on the bellies of the
ctu hovercraft swivel randomly spitting automatic fire at the mobs
below

dreiberg
what the hell  

laurie
its a peace rally  the ctus just opened fire on the crowd

dreiberg
oh laurie  jesus  no

he turns away paralyzed with horror  laurie watches awestruck

laurie

162 flashback  processed footage
were back in slomo sepia land the golden age of superheroes  the
owlship emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame
like the seventh cavalry arriving to save the day  as it draws
closer the perspex canopy coming into view we can just make out
night owl at the helm with silk spectre riding shotgun

theres a frenzied mob below racing right and left their aimless
motions stylized and surreal  theyre beset by a sudden windstorm as
the owlships powerful blowers clear the tear gas from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza  faces turn skyward fingers point 

 and suddenly the footage were watching undergoes a subtle
transformation  colors bleed in sound comes up the pace of the
action quickens  and when we cut back to the ship overhead were in
fullcolor and realtime

 because the owlship is really there    and by god the
watchmen are back in action a quartermile above the south st
seaport

164 int owlship  that moment
the three ctu ships are now visible through the cockpit dome

dreiberg
okay laurie lets see if weve still got what it takes

on the panel a computer targeting device homes in on a ctu ship

165 int ctu hovercraft  that moment
a radar man stares at his console in puzzlement

ctu radar man
sir weve got an odd blip off starboard    

the ship rocks violently as a sudden explosion 

166 aerial shot  on ctu hovercraft
 blows the cannon mount cleanly off its underside  the ruptured
ship wobbles trying to right itself but to no avail jets
sputtering it lurches toward the harbor and slaps down hard against
the water

167 angle on crowd
pointing at the skies in disbelief

voice in crowd

he barks into a microphone

dreiberg

169 ext seaport  that moment  dusk

owlship and the ctu talk some serious trash

owlship loudspeaker
 or well blow your asses out of the sky

ctu loudspeaker
unregistered craft  identify yourself

owlship loudspeaker

the crowds in a frenzy  most of them are taking it on the lam  but
a dozen hardy souls are standing stockstill transfixed by the
strange sight overhead

voice in crowd
   its the watchmen

excitement ripples through the crowd as the ctu ships bob in the air
clumsily turning to face their attacker  soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair squaring off facetoface a wild west
showdown  on the prows of all three craft missile launchers rotate
into position

170 int owlship  that moment
dreiberg with his hand poised on the throttle

dreiberg
were gonna have to shave this one close

an instant before the ctu rockets fire dreiberg shoves the throttle
fullforward

171 aerial shot  on owlship
with a burst of flame the owlship blasts off  the two rockets
converge on the point where the owlship was hovering a millisecond
before  and collide  boom  the owlship meanwhile hurtles
forward  slicing directly between the two ctu ships  the crowd
cheers

172 int owlship  a moment later  night
dreiberg rides the joystick  laurie watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship

laurie
theyre following us

dreiberg
all right  mission accomplished

hes no sooner said it than machinegun fire peppers the rear of the
ship  he arcs hard left and drops taking evasive action

173 ext world trade center  night
the owlship streaks between the twin towers  a second later the ctu
ships rip past on either side

174 ext street  night
astonished pedestrians gape at the bizarre dogfight above them  the
owlship doglegs around a darkened office building  a ctu missile
blows a hole in its facade

175 aerial shot  on owlship
firing two missiles aftward at the pursuing craft

176 int owlship  that moment
dreiberg exhilarated  laurie worried checking the radar
readout

laurie
missed em dan  youre aiming high

dreiberg
i dont want to take em out  just want to keep em interested

laurie
checking the monitor
theyre practically on us    

dreiberg
that detroit shit  im so worried

he punches a button on the dash  its labelled turbo

177 aerial shot  on airship
the turbojets kick in and the owlship accelerates to 400 mph leaving
the ctu craft in the dust

178 ext holland tunnel  night
a line of traffic enters the tunnel  the owlship swoops suddenly
and  just clearing the arch  enters above them

a moment later the lead ctu ship tries to follow  bad move  the
lessmaneuverable craft rams into the lip of the arch  and
explodes

the second ctu ship hurtles toward a similar fate  but at the last
moment  retrojets blasting at full force  it manages to stop
itself  it backs up slightly edges up over the tunnel and settles
for the airborne route

179 int holland tunnel  a moment later
the owlship zooms through the tunnel mere feet above the tops of the
cars  horns honk  brakes screech

theres an oversized truck directly in its path  the owlship nudges
up slightly  and clears the truck by inches throwing off sparks
against the roof of the tunnel

180 int owlship  that moment
the end of the tunnel is coming up fast

dreiberg
fog blowers on  activate radar shields

181 ext holland tunnel  opposite end  night
the owlship emerges from the tunnel and noses upward at an
almostvertical angle spewing dense clouds of billowing fog in its
wake  a few seconds later the lone remaining ctu ship arrives 
but seeing only fog and no trace of the owlship it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water

182 int owlship  a moment later  night
theyre in the middle of a cloudbank  dreiberg is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as laurie nervously checks the radar

laurie
we lost him

he flashes her a smug little smile  laughing uncontrollably she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands

laurie cont
oh daniel    we are in deep shit now

fade through to

183 int prison mess hall  night
the usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line  a prison trusty in hospitalorderly whites enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line  he nudges the con in front of
him

trusty
just left the infirmary  lost otis about twenty minutes ago

the con nods and whispers to the man in front of him  the news goes
through the serving line like wildfire  within a matter of seconds
its reached the jailbird at the front of the line  a hulk named
tbone

con in line
otis went down

tbone nods and carries his tray to a nearby table where a cadre of
six enormous thugs are munching away  presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen  who happens ironically to be a midget
little bigger

tbone

nodding to himself
this joint goes up  tonight

184 ext aerial shot  on owlship  night
drifting lazily through a cloudbank  the blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight

185 int owlship  that moment  night
through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud  were taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere slow and elegant  somewhere billie holiday is
singing youre my thrill

instruments blink and peep on the panel  no ones at the
controls

the ship lurches  a wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor  a womans hand reaches for it sets it
right

its laurie whos midway through a twominute kiss with dreiberg 
the pair of them are locking in a tight postcoital embrace on the
cabin floor their clothing in heaps around them

laurie
better  much better

dreiberg starts to say something settles back with a serene smile
instead

laurie cont
i bet i know what made the difference this time

dreiberg
what

laurie
smirking
the costumes  am i right

dreiberg seems mildly shocked by the proposition  then despite
himself he starts to chortle  she pokes him playfully on the arm

laurie cont
come on  admit it

dreiberg
no way  im not that much of a pervert

laurie
yes you are

dreiberg
drily
no offense laurie but it was silk spectre i had the crush on
pause then seriously

laurie
thats because 

dreiberg
its because theres nothing to be afraid of anymore  the worlds
about to end
a weird smile
i feel like i could save it

he grabs his cloak wraps it around him and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel  he throws a few switches arcs the owlship
hard right

laurie
youre full of yourself  what are you doing

dreiberg
long as were on the subject of perverts    
turning to face her

187 series of shots  the prison
 and as sly stone once said theres a riot goin on  sirens howl
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful convicts running wild
disabling guards overrunning cell blocks liberating weapons
throwing food

188 int owlship  that moment
dreiberg and laurie back in full costume  dreibergs eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls

dreiberg
i think were just a trifle late

laurie
jesus dan  out of the frying pan    

the monitor shows a magnified view of the prison complex below
them  the prisoners have taken the quad and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower  its an ugly bloody mess

dreiberg
i know hes totally bugfuck but he saved my life a half a dozen
times

189 int cell  night
sirens blaring everywhere  rorschach sits on his bunk his legs
drawn up before him his eyes darting swiftly around the cell

190 int maximum security block  night
smoke and confusion escaped convicts racing to and fro past
sprawled unconscious guards  in the midst of all the chaos four
menacing figures stride purposefully through the cellblock  its the
psychotic midget little bigger with his three henchmen carlos rafe
and tbone

wheeling an oversized electrical arc welder before them they stop
outside rorschachs cell and grin in anticipation

little bigger
find an outlet for this thing
shouting
rorschach  i did fifteen years because of you  its payback time

rafe finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder  carlos is carrying
a big nasty meat cleaver he slides back the panel in rorschachs
door rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame

carlos
see this runt  were gonna take your puny little balls off   
and pickle em
chortling
aww  i think he just wet his pants

hilarity all around  tbone shoves carlos aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door

tbone
lemme see  lemme see

little bigger
relax boys  everybody gets a slice of turkey  but i get to carve
to tbone
whats he doin now

no response from tbone who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel

little bigger cont
you deaf  i said whats he 

he gives tbone a nudge  tbones legs buckle and he topples over
backwards landing flat as a board on the floor  a soup spoon
quivers ion the air its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket

rafe
boss  jesus

little bigger
son of a bitch  were coming rorschach  were gonna peel you like
a grape
to rafe
light the torch

rafe ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
rorschachs cage

inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red

earmuffs

dreiberg
okay im turning on the screamers  well have to hit the roof
running    

he throws a switch on the control panel

193 ext prison complex  a moment later  night
windows shatter in the guard towers as a wailing ultrasonic screech
splits the air  on the roof of the complex paralyzed guards drop
their weapons escaped prisoners clutch at their burst eardrums as
the owlship descends and gently touches down  

194 int rorschachs cell  that moment
the lock is bright red and smoking  over on the bunk rorschachs
face is lined with exertion  his back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell his legs straining against the lip of his
toilet

grunting and groaning he manages to knock the toilet off its
mounting  the pipes spew  within seconds the floor of the cell is
flooded

195 int cellblock  outside door  a moment later
rafe kills the arc welder and stands back

rafe
okay boss that oughta do it

they give the door a shove  it swings inward and gallons of water
come gushing out  little bigger steps back in disgust

little bigger
what the 

rafe and carlos gape into the cell  they see the broken toilet but
theres no trace of rorschach

carlos
rorschach  companys calling   

rafe
where is the fuckin runt

carlos advances cautiously toward the cell the cleaver in his
fist

196 int cell  that moment
in answer to rafes question rorschach is hiding behind the door 
he slams it shut on carlos outstretched hand the redhot metal of
the lock catches carlos wrist he shrieks and drops the cleaver  

   giving rorschach just enough time to snatch it up  he jumps
monkeylike and stands poised on his bunk as the door swings wide
and an enraged carlos charges in clutching his scorched forearm

carlos
youre mine now you little 

from the bunk rorschach flings the cleaver  it strikes the floor
between rafe and carlos 

 neatly severing the power cord of the arc welder 

 which is sitting in an inch of standing water  rafe and carlos do
a herkyjerky dance as 20000 volts course through their bodies 

 and pitch facedown into the water  all lights in the cellblock
dim and die

little bigger backs off in gibbering horror as rorschach climbs down
off his bunk emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead

rorschach
your move    runt

the midget kingpin lets out a scream and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him

197 int prison corridor  a moment later
dreiberg and laurie move down a dark abandoned corridor trying to
get their bearings

laurie
where are we  what happened to the lights

dreiberg
generatorsll kick on in a minute  we should be close to solitary 
 

their heads turn toward the end of the passage where a second
corridor crosses the one theyre standing in  as they watch a
screaming midget sprints past  and disappears

dreiberg and laurie blink in disbelief huh  a moment later a
familiar figure with bright red hair strides past

dreiberg
   rorschach

rorschach pauses  he stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half  then keeps on walking

198 int prison  cross corridor  a moment later
the terrified little bigger realizes hes just hit a dead end  he
throws a glance over his shoulder sees rorschach moving up on him 
desperate he ducks into a mens room

rorschach follows his pace measured and deliberate  behind him
laurie and dreiberg have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor

laurie
rorschach  is that you

he turns and holds up a finger one moment please  then calm and
dispassionate he enters the mens room  dreiberg and laurie stand
at the end of the corridor mildly boggled

laurie
whats he doing

dreiberg
i think hes going to the john

laurie
my god  we bust him out of jail in the middle of a riot and
he stops to take a

on its underbelly a video camera grinds and rotates

208 int owlship  night
dreiberg and laurie watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city  he punches up a series of progressive magnifications
gradually zeroing in on a single city block  its been cordoned off
police bubblecars are parked up and down its length

dreiberg
theyve got my building surrounded
looking up at her
they mustve been following you all along

she stares at him  the ship lurches as dreiberg kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds

dreiberg cont
so much for dan dreiberg ordinary citizen

laurie
welcome back night owl

dreiberg
what now  fly south  hook up with adrian

rorschach
ctu  could be behind dr manhattan frameup

dreiberg
what do you mean frameup

rorschach
obvious pattern  all ties in 

dreiberg
are you saying that someone would risk starting world war iii just to
get back at us
spreading his hands
what about all those poor shits with cancer

tight on laurie whos listening to all this with mounting
distress

rorschach
how do we know theyve got cancer  could be part of massive
propaganda scheme    

dreiberg
come on rorschach  gimme a break 

laurie
interrupting him
its not

rorschach
not what

laurie
not propaganda
pause then blurting it out 
christ im one of them  ive got it

dreiberg swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at laurie his face
bonewhite  she stares at the floor afraid to meet his eyes her
grim secret revealed  for an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say

then rorschach his mind already back on the case breaks the
silence

rorschach
hnrrr  changes everything  lets get moving

209 ext waterfront warehouse  night
rorschach is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around swatting angrily
at a rat which scampers out of the hole  the owlship hovers
above

210 int owlship  that moment
dreiberg disconsolate holds laurie gently by the shoulders

laurie
i shouldve told you dan  im sorry  i just wanted things between
us to be  happy  for a while  i 

dreiberg
it doesnt change a thing laurie  i love you

he tries to pull her close but she turns away her eyes welling up
with tears

laurie
i love you too dan i  why dont you give me a minute to get
myself together okay

211 ext warehouse  that moment  night
a distraught dreiberg descends the rope ladder from the owlship 
rorschach has uncovered a spare blotmask with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head  when he turns he sees
dreiberg staring slackjawed at an inexplicable sight

above their heads the owlship has begun to glow  bright blue

212 int owlship  that moment  night
laurie backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of dr manhattan

laurie
jon  what are you doing here

dr manhattan
im not here  im still on mars  ive come to collect you

laurie
collect me

dr manhattan
in the immediate future were on mars  im telling you goodbye 
youre trying to convince me to cure your illness    

laurie
jon no  i cant 

dr manhattan
it will happen laurie  ive already seen it  neither of us
can do anything to change it

dreibergs frantically climbing the ladder  he pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see laurie reaching out for dr
manhattans hand

dreiberg
laurie  dont 

hands touch  a shimmering blue halo surrounds dr manhattan and
laurie and the two of them dissolve

stunned dreiberg clambers aboard  theres obviously nothing he can
do  rorschach is only a second or two behind them

rorschach
wheres laurie

dreiberg
i dont think shes coming with us

dissolve to

213 ext mars  night
a blue slit opens in the sky mere inches above the martian
surface  dr manhattan steps placidly through and a moment later
laurie tumbles out behind him  she takes a couple of halting steps
then gasps soundlessly  and pitches forward onto the shifting red
sands

dr manhattans gone several paces before he realizes theres a
problem  eventually though he turns  and spots laurie clawing at
the air trying and failing to draw a breath  he walks patiently back
and extends his hand  laurie grabs it and is magically surrounded by
a halo of oxygen

dr manhattan
the atmosphere  im sorry  these things slip my mind

laurie
jesus jon i nearly choked to  where are we 

ignoring her he turns  she hurries to keep pace with him  then she
stops in her tracks

before her in the distance looms dr manhattans new abode a
palace of glass vast and resplendent towering over the barren
sands  at its heart stands a gargantuan rubycolored hourglass
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets spires and
pendulums    the guts of a clock transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle

dr manhattan
i live here now

he strides placidly forward  laurie boggled stumbles along after
him

glow of the instrument panel  rorschach sits calmly behind him

rorschach
heading south  whats the plan

dreiberg
were running rorschach  weve got no place to go  were
hightailing it down to adrians

rorschach
veidts assassin  leads to follow  cant just 

dreiberg
exploding
cases leads  they dont matter rorschach  the worlds about to
end  if someone is trying to kill us it doesnt
matter

rorschach
coward  giving up

dreiberg
shut up rorschach

rorschach settles back lets out a soft thoughtful hiss

rorschach
sorry daniel  youve always been a good friend  i know that
pause
sorry about laurie

dreiberg
choked voice
okay lets just    thank you

for a few moments they fly on in silence  rorschach cant leave well
enough alone  deep in thought he scratches his chin

rorschach

215 ext mars  dr manhattans palace  night
laurie follows dr manhattan up a rubycrystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle  off to her side the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are shifting meshing
 like the quartz movement of a fine swiss watch

laurie
this whole place is ticking  does it  keep time

dr manhattan
yes  in about    thirty seconds for example youll tell me
youre sleeping with dreiberg

laurie
you  you know about me and dan

he gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level

dr manhattan
time is the key laurie  if i can unlock the origins of time ill
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity

laurie looks at him crosseyed  and heaves a sigh

laurie
jon does anybody know what the hell youre talking about
flustered
dans just an ordinary guy but he talks to me  when he looks
at me hes seeing something more than just a  a collection of
atoms

dr manhattan
startled
then youre sleeping with dreiberg

laurie
well i just you just said  dont act surprised

dr manhattan
thats how time works laurie  everything is preordained    even
my responses
nodding
were all puppets  im just a puppet who can see the strings  
thirty seconds

she groans in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower  the martian plains spread out for miles
below them above the stars stretch to infinity  a chill violent
wind whips across their faces

dr manhattan
ill be here for the next year or so  then im going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe
staring out at the landscape
utterly uncorrupted by man  isnt it beautiful

she moves to the edge of the balcony gazes off at the bleak and
fissured martian surface  suddenly she feels very alone  and
frightened

laurie
jon  theres something i have to know  did you love me
once

dr manhattan
yes i loved you  i left the earth when i lost you

laurie
yet you mustve known all along that youd give me cancer  just be
being with me

dr manhattan
i didnt give you cancer laurie  not you not the others  i dont
know what did

laurie
but you knew that id  die

dr manhattan
memories of the future are just like any others  ive tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones    
pause
you wont die of cancer laurie  there wont be time for that

lauries blood runs cold as she realizes what hes telling her

laurie
then its going to happen  the worlds going to end   and youve
always known

dr manhattan
nodding
always  ever since the day i died

he walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding martian landscape  behind him laurie buries her face in
her hands

dr manhattan cont
do you understand me laurie  do you see what its been like for me
these last years  knowing that everything i knew and loved would be
destroyed    and that by leaving earth i would be the helpless
agent of its destruction

laurie
sobbing
then why dont you    do something about it

dr manhattan
because 

laurie
because you cant i know its preordained  so sorry  i forgot
angrily
jon  this this script youre following    who writes it

dr manhattan
i dont know yet  i should be able to tell you in  roughly six
hundred years

that about tears it for laurie  she storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders

laurie
i cant stand any more of this  i want to go back  if im going to
die i want to be with  other people

dr manhattan
please laurie  not yet  ive got eons stretching before me a
universe to explore  ill be alone
reaching for her hand
youre the last human being ill ever see

finally he manages to get the ship righted  rorschachs taken a bad
tumble he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks

the owlship takes a hard bounce against the snow  the hull crumples as the craft tips sideways and plows into a deep drift

a hatch springs open and dreiberg and rorschach dig their way out  theyre slightly underdressed for the weather  spotting the lights of karnak in the distance they turn up their collars and press on

223 int karnak  information room  that moment
veidts eyeing the closedcircuit security monitor which shows the exterior of the complex  he spots two tiny figures slogging through the blizzard

as he watches the screens for london and paris go white

nothing happens  dreiberg pounds against the doors

rorschach drags the helpless dreiberg around the side of the complex where snow blows in flurries at the mouth of a tunnellike structure

veidt alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall coolly eating dinner  behind him above the mammoth entry doors hangs a tapestry  alexander slicing through the gordian knot

two battered figures creep silently into the hall 

veidt sits calmly betraying nothing  at his side the mutant lynx
growls  his hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animals

it catches rorschach on the chin and sends him sprawling  dreiberg
backs against a wall in horror as the lynx comes sprinting toward
him teeth bared

veidt claps his hands twice and the cat relents  he reaches for a
futuristic stun gun which has been lying on the table all along 
part of the place setting  and advances on his old colleagues

rorschach
hes the one  hes been the one all along  stalking us

veidt
yeah  see ive been working on a little project  top secret of
course

uh huh  you might recognize the names  quite a few of them worked
at gila flats

at his heels

 to create their own nuclear superman  it wasnt russia
tapping his chest
it was me  when he figured that out of course i had to kill
him  the rest of it  rorschachs capture my assassination 
that was just to keep you busy  all that really mattered was getting
rid of dr manhattan

what

veidt
i couldnt let him interfere with my project

rorschach
veidt  youre the one who started world war iii

veidt
no  i just hastened the inevitable
smiling
hes been ready to blow for years  i knew all it would take was a
little push  so i uh    gave his friends and associates
cancer

dreiberg
laurie  youre responsible for 

veidt reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case  he pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box

veidt cont
one thing ive learned about cancer  its much easier to generate
than it is to cure

dreiberg enraged charges at him  the lynx roars  veidt swings the
stun gun across dreibergs face knocking him to the floor  and
levels the futuristic weapon directly at his head

veidt
lets get something straight  if you try that again ill kill you
without a moments thought

theyve reached the entrance to veidts information room  200

oh god  im no more than a bug on a windshield to you

youre the only human being i care for

then do me a favor  if the worlds going to end it shouldnt matter
a bit
pause
i want you to cure me

dr manhattan
i wont do that

laurie
you have the power to do it  i want you to do it  please

dr manhattan
i explained this  i cant  thats not the way it happens

laurie
jon  if you ever loved me  if theres anything human left in you
 then do it

eyes wild she grabs his great blue hand  and thrusts it into her
chest where it disappears up to the wrist

her fingers tighten around his forearm  their gazes lock  dr
manhattan shuts his eyes and grimaces as if hes got to make the
hardest decision of his life  and then    

a brilliant blue aura engulfs them both  it spreads and grows in
intensity suffusing the sky finally blotting out the vast martian
landscape altogether

with a sudden pop the aura begins to die  for a splitsecond we see
the figures of laurie and dr manhattan suspended against a great
white void  then colors begin to appear the crystal castle and the
martian desert gradually materialize around them

the two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues awestruck  neither one seems quite sure whats happened

laurie
what  am i 

dr manhattan
cured yes

utterly spent he staggers to the edge of the balcony grabs a
handrail for support  he looks like a man whos just had a heart
attack

laurie
jon what is it  whats the matter

when he looks up at her hes desolate  his face filled with
dread

room at gila flats to shame  in the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a glowing blue dome  a bubble of pure energy

inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of gila flats  jon
osterman tightens a screw and sets the movement of janeys watch into
its brass housing  totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twentyfour years in the future

veidt
gentlemen the past  unfolding before your eyes
pause
stand back from the field  itll blow you to bits

dreiberg
what is it  how does it work

veidt
its a tachyon chamber  it generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time
smiling
there are other worlds daniel other timelines  existing
parallel to our own 

dreiberg
adrian  youve lost it

veidt
pointing at the tachyon bubble
ive seen them  ive seen them in there
pause

in some of them  only a few  the human race survives  and it
survives because dr manhattan never existed

he draws closer to the tachyon bubble  off to one side is the camera which feeds the monitor in the video room  and beside it mounted on a tripod is a highpowered telescopic rifle

veidt cont
the creation of dr manhattan was a flashpoint in history  he threw the world balance of power totally out of whack  and his absence  for even a week  virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war
wildeyed
do you understand now  do you see what im going to do  im going to change the past

232 ext outer space  that moment
dr manhattan and laurie materialize in orbit around the earth enveloped in a bubble of oxygen  far below the nuclear birds are already aloft tiny pinpricks of light flash over new york and san francisco

were too late

laurie
jon  what

dr manhattan
the south pole  times flowing backwards

233 int karnak  lab  that moment
inside the tachyon chamber jon osterman fits the glass crystal back into place on janeys watch  veidt looks on in fascination

veidt
at first we could only watch the past  now we can reach out and touch it

he steps over to the rifle peers through the telescopic sight

veidt
it ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half  but last week i managed to open a dimesized hole for almost three seconds
turning to face them
in a minute ill do it again  and if my aim is true ill put a bullet through jon ostermans heart    and dr manhattan will never be born

dreiberg and rorschach trade looks of disbelief

rorschach
   and they call me a fucking nut

dreiberg
adrian  its too late  the world is blowing up as we stand here

veidt
dont be obtuse daniel  if i kill jon in the past none of this will happen  we wont even be here will we

dreiberg
and what if youre wrong

veidt
im not

dreiberg
what if youre wrong

dr manhattan
veidts complex

235 int karnak  lab  that moment

twentyfour years ago jon osterman is packing his jewelers tools folding his swatch of black velvet  in the present veidt is raving

veidt
your problem dan is a lack of vision  you spent all those years
chasing after muggers and drug dealers and jaywalkers   
as if the world was any better for it  as if any of it mattered

dreiberg
you ruthless son of a bitch  you really believe this madscientist
bullshit is going to save the world

veidt
wed better hope so   its almost time

he kicks a floor switch  giant nuclear generators begin to hum 
then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight

236 veidts pov  through crosshairs
in the past jon osterman is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a squeak  he picks up a broom    

237 int karnak  lab  that moment
a luminescent white spot appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble  theres a hideous whine as a tiny hole begins to open up
  directly in front of veidts rifle  his finger closes around the
trigger    

   and with a terrible crash the lab wall collapses behind him 
veidt dives backward dodging rubble    

   as a blue giant thirty feet tall steps into the lab  with
laurie at his side

dr manhattan
what are you doing veidt

veidt
jon  get back  you dont understand

dr manhattan stares down at the tachyon bubble and sees
himself  his former self  chasing a mouse out of
the if chamber at gila flats  his eyes go wide  even hes
surprised

in the ensuing panic dreiberg dives at veidt  veidt manages to
sidestep him frantically trying to get to his rifle  the hole in
the bubble has grown to the size of a quarter

veidt lunges toward the rifle  lauries directly in his path  he
shoves her aside they grapple he flings her to the ground and
points his stun gun directly at her 

 and a millisecond later hes aiming at nothing  dr manhattan has instantaneously teleported laurie across the room out of his line of fire

veidt looks up in horror just in time to see a blue bolt of lightning launching itself from dr manhattans outstretched finger 

veidt
no

 and in the wink of an eye hes vaporized  all thats left is a pair of charred boots still standing upright

dreiberg rushes over to laurie takes her in his arms

laurie
what was he doing

dreiberg
trying to change the past  he said it was the only way to save the world 

dr manhattan stares at the tachyon bubble mesmerized  inside the door to the if chamber has just swung shut on a terrified jon osterman

dr manhattan
he was right

rorschach laurie and dreiberg stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement  dr manhattan begins to shrink to normal size  he runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble bright blue sparks shoot off in all directions

dr manhattan
he did it  veidt broke the code  its so elegant  its so obvious

dr manhattans off in another world as usual  he wears a beatific smile as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber

laurie
jon 

dr manhattan
space and time  i finally understand laurie  i see it all now

laurie
jon  for gods sake what do you see

dr manhattan
i see what the watchmaker made  i see the universe

he lifts his arms particles of light appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies  the lights in the
room dim its as if dr manhattan is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame

dr manhattan
my work here is finished    

the others cower  they sense that something large is about to
happen  in the past jon osterman is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber in the present dr manhattan reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time

he does and in a blaze of blinding blue light the tiny rift expands
into a shimmering fissure  dr manhattan peels back its edges and
steps through    into the past

238 int test chamber  that moment
jon osterman turns away from the observation panel  to his utter
bewilderment a huge blue figure  surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously  has materialized in the chamber behind him

dr manhattan
dont be afraid jon  ill be here with you

a second before the particle cannons kick in dr manhattan steps
forward  and fuses with jon their bodies becoming one

for a moment jon is still visible with dr manhattans frame
surrounding him like a translucent shield of pure energy then dr
manhattan coalesces into a solid protective husk around him  as the
chamber begins to glow a network of hairline cracks spreads across
the shell of his body  blue light spills through the seams he
spreads his hands  no in pain but in triumph and with a blinding
flash dr manhattan explodes outward a million fragments merging
with nothingness   

   to expose a dumbstruck jon osterman in his place  the blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal  miraculously hes
alive  astonished but perfectly intact

239 int gila flats test lab  a moment later
the timelocked door pops open and jon staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues whove seen everything through the observation
panel

scientist
what in the name of god    

the scientists advance cautiously toward the chamber  janey
sobbing rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed jon  as
she clings to him her face pressed tightly against his chest he
looks down at his hands his fist is still closed around    

jon
your watch janey  i fixed your watch 

scientist ii
look

the scientist is staring wideeyed at the rear wall of the chamber 
  which isnt there  instead theres a rippling irregular
rupture  a pulsating hole in time  and visible beyond it are
three oddlooking and very frightened figures dreiberg laurie and
rorschach

astounded scientists

laurie

dreiberg
he saved himself  he changed the past

laurie
where did he go

before dreiberg can suggest an answer the cleft in time begins to
throb and shimmer slowly sealing itself off before their eyes  for
a moment everythings back to normal 

 and then to their mounting horror the room theyre in begins to
dissolve around them    fading away into a blank white void

a sudden percussive pop  the white void seems to shrivel around
them collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into    

241 ext vortex effect
dreiberg laurie and rorschach spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color  if space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant eticket joyride this
would be it  their bodies contract and distend warp and elongate
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks and then before they
know it they find themselves deposited 

242 ext new york street  night
 smack in the middle of a busy intersection  the three of them
materialize from nowhere a southbound van swerves to avoid them
slamming into a row of parked cars and a northbound taxicab does the
same knocking over a fire hydrant

laurie

dreiberg
those cars  what year is this

laurie
everythings changed 

its a disorienting world theyve landed in  in fact its
our world our new york and everything  the cars
the clothing the very look of the city  seems just a trifle out of
whack    

rorschach
hnrrrrr  we never happened

bystanders cluster about laughing and taunting highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst  there are of
course no costumed heroes in our world and their sudden
presence prompts a babel of speculation among the onlookers 
nuts  fruits  outofwork actors

rorschach takes a swing at one of the curious who gets a touch too
close and the mood begins to turn hostile  the crowd now grown to
several dozen people is threatening to block the intersection
altogether a mounted policeman rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill whistle

dreiberg
oh my god they still ride around on horses

world the headlines are only mildly discouraging russian summit
talks collapse  like everyone else our old friend the news vendor
is gapin at the ruckus on the street

news vendor
jesus christ it must be halloween

his sidekick the small black kid who reads comic books points to
the befuddled trio on the street and laughs in gleeful recognition

kid
shit man  its rorschach  and night owl

news vendor
what are you talkin about

kid
superheroes  check it out

he thrusts a comic book into the news vendors hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers  the news vendor stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book  watchmen 
then throws a cockeyed squint at their reallife counterparts on the
street

kid
all right  they must be on a case

244 ext street  that moment  night
horns blare  all traffic has stopped  the intersection is mobbed
with curious onlookers  by now a halfdozen beat cops have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order

cop i
break it up  stand back

cop ii
come on you three  if this is some kind of publicity stunt 

dreiberg laurie and rorschach have fallen into a tight circle 
they dont know what to expect and theyre poised for a brawl  the
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room even the cops are hesitant
to advance

laurie
dan  what do we do now

dreiberg
panicked
wherever we are its better than what we left  backs together 

laurie
well tell them whats happened  theyll listen to reason wont
they  

rorschach

and on rorschachs final vicious hiss we shock cut to black and

fade out

the end
