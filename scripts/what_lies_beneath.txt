                                      june 14 1999

                

               fade in

               moving through a murky haze dark blues and greens shafts 
               of prismed purple a pale shard appears in the distance

               gliding closer a group of tiny fish dart before the camera

               were underwater arriving at the form it finally sharpens 
               into focus its a womans body submerged in dark water 
               arms floating lazily at her side the face is obscured by 
               flowing hair all that is visible is a pair of cold staring 
               green eyes which blink closed

                                                                  morph to

               then open as blue eyes as a different face emerges from 
               water claire spencer awakens from this unsettling dream in 
               her bathtub she pivots the large brass shower head the 
               kind that moves up and down on a pipe off to one side 
               reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being 
               pulled

               int bathroom  day

               a hazy shape  accompanied by a whirring sound

               a steam covered mirror is cleared with a blow dryer claire 
               starts to come into focus the dryer stops she presses the 
               red gfi button on the socket zap a big blue spark shoots 
               out claire pulls her hand back and the dryer starts 
               whirring again

               she clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook she 
               regards herself in the mirror and attractive elegantlooking 
               woman around forty

               claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable scar 
               above her left eye then slowly drops the hand to her cheek 
               as if confirming her existence

               int claires house  day

               claire now dressed presses her face against a door 
               listening for the sounds of stirring from within silence

               she quietly pushes open the door

               int room  day

               claire makes her way past halffilled boxes and duffels to a 
               window then pulls the curtains to reveal

               a lovely wooded lake it couldnt be more picturesque a 
               24 sailboat is moored at the dock and an old stone lighthouse 
               sits on a point across the lake

               the sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from a figure 
               still shrouded by covers

               claire sits beside the sleeping form she scans the room 
               briefly taking in a greenpeace flag and a picture of a 
               tomboyish ten yearold girl at camp

               she gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same 
               face now a waifish pretty seventeen yearold with chopped 
               hair and tiny nose ring claire leans over and inhales the 
               sleeping scent of her only daughter caitlin she places her 
               hand on a cheek the girls eyelids flutter softly

                                     claire
                         morning beauty

               caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly

                                     claire
                         lets go or well never leave on 
                         time

               from out of the pillow comes caitlins voice

                                     caitlin
                              muffled
                         im totally ready

               claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes

                                     claire
                         come on ill make you some waffles 
                         maybe well squeeze in a trip to the 
                         mall
                              beat
                         caitlin

               claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is caitlins behind

                                     caitlin
                         mother

               claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from 
               the floor then folds and neatly stacks them on a box

               caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow

                                     caitlin
                         youre such a morning person

               claire turns at the door

                                     claire
                         it is unwise to heckle the keeper of 
                         the plastic

               she starts to leave caitlin calls out

               claire smiles as she closes the door behind her

               int hallway  day

               claire bends down to pick up one of caitlins socks when 
               she stands something catches her eye out a window she gazes 
               down transfixed

               angle

               through a stand of trees over a high wooden fence a young 
               couple is in the midst of a heated argument next door claire 
               watches as the husband a large imposing man with an unruly 
               shock of red hair snarls at his wife across the hood of 
               their huge old buick she tries to get a glimpse of the woman 
               but all thats visible is the back of her blond head

               a tan sinewy arm encircles claires waist she lets out a 
               small gasp as a hand closes on her breast its claires 
               husband dr norman spencer nibbling gently at her neck

               hes older than she pushing fifty with silver streaks 
               beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him 
               look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the 
               prominent academic that he is claire however cant take 
               her eyes off the scene below

               she continues to gaze downward the man leans over the hood 
               murmuring darkly at his wife though for claire and norman 
               the scene is entirely silent

               begins once again to nuzzle claire her eyes close but 
               then she gently demurs

               they start to kiss its slow and a bit methodical in the 
               manner of long time lovers suddenly the sound of a woman 
               wailing can be heard they stop

                                     norman

               they listen the sounds start to become louder it is clearly 
               two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love 
               making

                                     norman

                         what is he doing to her

               they lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on

                                     norman
                         and we moved out here for the quiet

                                     claire
                         night

               they lie together in the darkness as the feurs finally climax

               int caitlins room  day

               claire pushes open the door to caitlins room carrying an 
               armful of folded laundry she moves quickly to the bureau 
               not wanting to spend much time in here then grabs a tiny 
               black top from the pile and drops it into a drawer shes 
               just about to close it when something catches her eye

               claires pov

               she drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered old 
               juilliard tshirt with a very seventies logo from the drawer

               claire gazes around the room which is a reliquary of 
               caitlins recently concluded childhood pictures trophies 
               stuffed animals

               she brings the now faded tshirt to her face and drinks in 
               the smells she stares down at the word juilliard

                                                              match cut to

               int basement  day

               juilliard now its on the same tshirt only claires 
               wearing it and shes much younger its an old photograph in 
               an album younger norman stands next to her in the shot his 
               arm draped around her waist a cello case stands beside her

               claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and 
               sees propped in the corner the cello case she gazes at 
               other photos

                claire in her wedding dress norman beside her in a tux 
               with a very wide bowtie

                claire and norman in front of a university building a 
               tiny caitlin rests on her hip

               claires chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob

               ext front yard  day

               her face streaked with tears claire stumbles out into the 
               immaculately manicured rose garden

               the yard is surrounded by a high wooden fence she collapses 
               into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside suddenly 
               she hears something coming from next door

               she cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound it 
               is ironically the sound of a woman crying claire makes 
               her way over to the fence the womens sobbing becomes more 
               plaintive and fevered

               she places her face against the prickly vine covered fence 
               and tries to peer through the crack all she can make out is 
               a dark blue blur that seems to be rocking claire gathers 
               her nerve and calls out

                                     claire
                         hello

                         mrs feur

               the sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering the blue 
               shape vanishes from view

                                     claire
                         wait a minute i just want 

               something bumps against the fence claire draws back she 
               hears heavy breathing

                                     mrs feur
                              sniffling

                         is everything alright

               claire leans closer to the tiny crack she sees a fleshy 
               blur and what might be part of an eye theres no response 
               just the breathing

                                     claire

                         dont you

               tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into 
               the feurs driveway

                                     mrs feur

                         wait dont go

               claire listens to the sound of naked footsteps followed by 
               a large front door swinging shut a car door swings open and 
               a mans shoes follow down the path

               claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence 
               as the door closes a second time she sits there for a moment 
               listening but all is quiet

                                     claire vo
                         she sounded terrified

               storm she pads out to normans turreted library rain pelts 
               the glass her face is briefly illuminated by the lighthouse 
               beam

               she hears the sound of a door closing and moves to get a 
               better view of the feurs nothing but blackness just as 
               shes turning to go back to bed a lightning flash lights up 
               the night claires eyes go wide

               claires pov

               in the split second of brilliance she sees mr feur in 
               shirtsleeves drenched dragging a large duffel toward the 
               open trunk of his car

                                     claire
                              in a hoarse whisper
                         norman

                                     claire

               another flash illuminates norman at her side

                                     claire
                         look

                         what is it whats the matter

               she stares down into the darkness

                                     claire
                         nothing there was i thought i

                         is it gone

               the beacon illuminates the empty driveway she nods

                                     norman
                         come on lets go back to bed

               yet another bolt of lightning reveals claire still at the 
               window

               ext backyard  morning

               claire sets up a camera and tripod she steps back and aims 
               her camera she glances up at a large upstairs window at the 
               feurs house one side of the curtain seems to be pulled 
               open but no ones there

               feeling selfconscious she turns back to the camera the 
               morning sun hits the flowers just right and she snaps several 
               pictures of them against her lovely house

               she glances back at the feurs window the curtain is now 
               closed

               she walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it

               when this doesnt work she drags a lawn chair over and peers 
               across the fence she can barely see over but glimpses

               a deep furrow in the mud of the driveway just then a car 
               pulls into the driveway claire scrambles down from her perch

               ext driveway  day

               claire walks out to find her best friend jody pretty in 
               her forties wearing hip hippieish clothes

               jody drives off claire walks down the driveway to her front 
               door and sees mr feur staring at her from a window she 
               starts to wave but the curtain is drawn shut

               claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch 
               the doorknob she stops a faint rustling can be heard from 
               within claire quietly opens the door and moves into

               int foyer  day

               claire stops inside the door now it sounds like whispering

               two voices tense impassioned it seems to be coming from 
               normans study she gathers her nerve then bursts into the 
               room

               int normans study  day

               but the whispering has suddenly stopped

                                     claire
                         hello

               the lovely circular room is completely empty she looks 
               around puzzled cooper the familys aging lab casually 
               ambles over

                                     claire
                              to cooper

               ext lake  day

               claire and cooper out on a walk emerge onto large rocks at 
               the waters edge claire tosses a long stick for cooper who 
               bolts out onto the long wooden dock claire gazes at the 
               lighthouse across the lake and a long bridge in the distance

               cooper starts barking and looking down into the water

               claire arrives at coopers side and stares down into the 
               dark water

                                     claire
                         cooper what do you see

               she looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection after 
               a moment she notices a faint white shape directly in the 
               reflection of her face cooper rumbles a low growl the shape 
               seems to be gaining definition

               rrring

               claire gasps quietly then reaches into a pocket in her 
               sweater and pulls out a cordless phone

                                     claire
                              into phone

                         hours

               claires smile fades

                                     claire
                         oh

                         no no its fine

               claire slowly leans out over the water to check her 
               reflection

                                     norman vo

               she clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water

               int work room  night

               claire sits in a small workroom at a computer she focuses 
               intently on the screen

               angle

               its alices computer solitaire she flips the last card and 
               an animated queen of hearts accompanied by a series of 
               musical notes parades across the screen

                                     queen of hearts
                              on computer
                         you lost off with your head

               claire hits new game and watches as a fresh hand of cyber 
               solitaire is dealt she suddenly has a thought and disappears 
               into the kitchen

               int kitchen  night

               she glances at jodys tea smiles then refills her glass of

               without warning the radio dial rips cacophonously past

               eye to a coat rack mirror which reflects directly into the 
               study

                                     claire

               to string drawing in a breath at the power of the sound

               claire takes another deep breath then launches into a 
               beautiful and melancholy piece of music shes very very 
               good eyes closed her body begins to sway slightly as her 
               left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck

               she reaches a difficult transition and falters she seems 
               almost surprised she attacks the transition again and again 
               falters claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again 
               this time failing completely

               she sits back in the chair despondent almost as an 
               afterthought she sadly drags the bow across strings at the 
               end of the tone something catches her ear she can just 
               make out the hint of a faint feminine voice echoing the tone

               she sits up and plays a different note then another each 
               time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct finally 
               she plays a sharp higher pitched note the voice echoes 
               with a distinct unsettling shriek

               crash

               int normans study  dusk

               claire walks in and sees

               insert 

               lying on the floor a framed newspaper photograph of norman 
               and claire

               the caption announces that hes being promoted to the 
               distinguished dupont chair in genetics through the spider
               webbed glass norman can be seen shaking hands with an older 
               academic hugging a smiling claire to his side

               claire kneels down to gather the picture a single shard of 
               glass is missing she finds it a foot away by a distinctive 
               knot in the wood floor

               she notices a copper glint in the point of glass but when 
               she moves it its gone she places the pieces of broken 
               glass on the frame and stands

               out of the window directly in front of her sees mr feur 
               removing a dirt covered shovel from his trunk she glances 
               down at the picture then back up at mr feur who carries 
               the shovel around back

                                     claire
                         oh no

               claire wraps up the broken picture she hears a car door 
               slam and glances out the window in time to see mr feur 
               driving off

               ext garden  day

                         mrs feur

               claire glances down as she walks past the furrow she looks 
               up at the house which seems quite placid then slowly heads 
               around back

               ext feurs back porch  day

               she takes in the lake view from the large porch the wind is 
               really blowing her eye catches on something propped against 
               the back door

               the soil covered shovel

               claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it 
               then knocks at the back door theres no answer she knocks 
               again nothing shes turning to go then the door swings 
               open the smile fades from claires face

               claire stares back at the house

               int kitchen  night

               claire rakes the binoculars across the feurs house past 
               their car parked in front until she finds a light on 
               downstairs

               the tall powerfully built mr feur walks into the room and 
               sits by himself at the dining room table which is set for 
               one he eats a tv dinner slowly chewing and staring straight 
               ahead he sips from a can of beer

               just then a hand grabs claires arm she lets out a screech 
               and turns to see norman standing beside her

               at the window paging the curtain she squats down pulling 
               norman with her

               late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes

                                     claire
                         no

               theres a pause

                                     dr drayton
                         why is he worried

                                     claire
                         because i dont know because 
                         sometimes sometimes i forget 
                         things and ever since caitlin 
                         left ever since my daughter left 
                         for school thereve been i fainted

                         why is this so hard

               dr drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny red 
               fireballs next to his chair he proffers it to claire

                                     dr drayton
                         fireball

                                     claire
                         youre joking

               he shakes his head she shrugs then grabs one and pops it 
               into her mouth

                                     dr drayton
                         its hard because im a complete 
                         stranger and what were talking about 
                         is incredibly personal besides the 
                         first time most people come here a 
                         part of them is wondering if im 
                         gonna think theyre crazy

               she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods

                                     dr drayton
                         dont worry im required to have at 
                         least three sessions in order to 
                         commit

               her eyes get a little wider

                                     dr drayton
                         now thats a joke

               she manages an unsteady smile

                                     dr drayton
                         i have some training at helping people 
                         through the stressful moments in 
                         life one of which you may or may 
                         not be experiencing if you want to 
                         get some stuff off your chest great 
                         if not

               he smiles and shrugs no problem she stares at him for a 
               moment

                                     claire
                              re fireball

                                     dr drayton
                         mmhmm

               she studies him for a moment

                                     claire
                         theres a ghost in my house

               he nods slightly as if shes told him i have some anxiety 
               claire goes on

                         turned on the radio she likes 
                         rock and roll angry rock and roll

                                     dr drayton

                         she was filling the bathtub

                                     dr drayton
                         what does she look like

                                     claire

               he thinks for a moment then

                                     dr drayton
                         try to contact her

               claire nearly swallows her fireball

                                     claire
                         what

                                     claire
                         are you humoring me

               she seems satisfied by his sincerity

               claire walks in carrying a halfempty bottle of wine she 
               looks over at jody who turns off the lights jody then 
               strikes a match and lights a large candle she unveils her 
               carved antique ouija board

                                     jody

                         have to pee

               jody turns to her deadly serious

                                     jody

               jody indicates the wooden pointing device each woman grasps 
               an edge

                                     jody

               jody closes her eyes claire follows suit

                         i call forth the entity that is 
                         haunting this house

               they look down at the planchette which hasnt moved

                                     jody
                         mrs feur

               jody focuses intently

                                     jody
                         reveal yourself to us

               a long moment passes its starting to seem like a bust

               suddenly the candle flares even jody seems startled

                                     jody
                              to the spirit
                         who who are you

               at first nothing happens then slowly the planchette starts 
               to move across the board

                                     claire
                         are you doing that

                         im not doing that

               the planchette comes to rest on the letter m moments later 
               it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on e

                                     claire
                         oh

                         me

               it starts to drift again moving slowly toward the space 
               between e and f the planchette stops on f jody removes 
               her fingers from the device

                                     jody

               claire catches up to the completely spooked jody outside the

                         claire this is this is

               claire transfixed walks in

               int work room  night

               she stares at the computer screen which is being filled 
               with letters at an amazing speed

               mefmefmefmefmefmefmef

               she hears the front door swing open

               claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the 
               karmanghia tearing out of the driveway she turns and goes 
               back into the house

               crash

               she edges into

               int normans study  night

               the picture has once again tumbled from its spot she drops 
               to her knees over the picture this time the glass is 
               shattered when she picks out the remaining shards the 
               newspaper photo slides out claire glances at the benign 
               news stories on the back

               she looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack 
               in the floor boards by the knot

               claires pov

               the piece of glass wedged next to what looks like a copper 
               coin in the crack its too big to be a penny

               she tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free but 
               recoils a tiny drop of blood appears on her finger which 
               she pops into her mouth

               int bathroom  night

               still sucking on her finger claire walks in and begins to 
               clean up the remains of the seance she bends down to pick 
               up the ouija board then stops when she notices that the tub 
               is again full to the brink of overflowing

                                     claire
                         what do you want

               claire peers around frustrated half waiting for a reply

               there is only silence she reaches in to pull the plug nearly 
               scalding her hand when she turns for a hand towel she finds 
               a message traced into the steamedup mirror

                                        you know

               she draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom

               ext lab building  night

               norman nods to a security guard as he leaves a darkened 
               university building he sees claire standing at the foot of 
               the steps

               claire moves past a huge black skinhead doorman into an 
               entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club

               she looks out over the mob of seething young people swaying 
               to a pulsing powerpop band punks and club kids push past 
               her as they move into the throng she looks up and her face 
               changes

               claires pov

               a shaggy trio of musicians on the stage pumping through a 
               jangly but surprisingly melodic song her eyes race across 
               the faces of a butch female drummer an emaciated 
               guitaristsinger and stop on the bass player caitlin she 
               rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line eyes 
               closed swaying to the music

               claire is transfixed her face a mix of pride and sadness

               the song ends and caitlins eyes open she smiles for a 
               moment then the smile fades as she spots claire panicked 
               claire ducks behind a pillar

               ext cbgbs  night

               the last groups of young people file out of the club a couple 
               of them glance at claire who seems very out of place standing 
               on the bowery late at night

               she thinks for a beat

                                     claire
                         yes yes thats what i want

               she takes his hand and kisses it

               ext claires house  day

               claire walks up to the door when she touches the knob she 
               hears the whispering she opens the door and moves into

               int foyer  day

               the same intense whispered exchange she glances into the 
               mirror and sees shapes moving bodies a flash of silver

               she turns the corner and again no ones there

               int normans study  day

               she walks in and stands before

               the repaired photograph of herself and norman at the party 
               for the dupont chair

               she takes it from the wall stares at it for a moment then 
               smashes it on the edge of the desk she extricates the picture 
               from the broken glass the caption reads

               dr norman spencer being awarded the distinguished dupont 
               chair in genetics by dean of sciences torvald ackerman

               she stares at the picture for a moment then flips it over 
               and scans the stories on the back one tells of a hotly 
               contested city council race another contains details of a 
               large alumni donation to the university

               she notices the bottom corner of another story she hadnt 
               noticed before its only a small portion of one column but 
               it seems to detail the search for a missing girl

               int work room  day

               claire online logs onto a missing persons website she 
               narrows her search to new england a screen pops up with a 
               list of names she scrolls down the list until she finds 
               frank madison elizabeth

                                     claire
                         mef

               claire double clicks on it then waits breathlessly as a 
               blurry cyber photo fills the screen slowly higher resolution 
               moves down the image

               its the ghost

               under the photo is the legend

                             disappeared  october 22 1998

               claire stares at the familiar face then shakily hits print

               later

               claire is staring down at the girls face on the print out

                                     voice

               bag

               face in the photo

               ext madison franks house  day

               claire parks in front of a small clapboard house in a 
               neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own 
               she gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch

               ext porch  day

               claire rings the bell a drawn looking woman in her early 
               fifties answers the door

               she starts to close the door claire leans forward

                         then again she didnt say much about 
                         her college friends

               before him stripped down to a skirt and slip top theres a 
               different physicality to her movements a different rhythm

               int normans study  day

               norman finds claire seated on his desk her legs spread

               she grabs his belt and pulls him into her then holds the 
               apple to his mouth norman tentatively takes a bite she 
               mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly

               when he chews the huge bite a glistening drop of juice runs 
               down his chin claire leans forward and licks it off

               she brushes past him

               int foyer  night

               he catches up beside himself

                                     norman
                         please dont go

               claires nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst 
               she turns at the door and looks back

                                     claire
                         you made it impossible for me to be 
                         someone you could be in love with

               she leaves

               int living room  morning

               norman rumpled and unshaven is passed out on the couch a 
               half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table he 
               awakens to find claire sitting across from him

                                     claire
                         i want you to answer one question

               he waits

                                     claire
                         did you have anything to do with her 
                         disappearance

               claire goes pale

                                     norman

                         more i tried to distance myself the 
                         more desperate she became finally 
                         she showed up at the new house

                                     claire

               norman can hardly look at her

                                     norman

                         was going to kill herself or you 
                         i never thought shed go through 
                         with any of it but then she was 
                         gone

               he trails off

                                     claire
                         she did it

                         of course she did norman what else 
                         could it be

               the enormity of this hits norman his head drops into his 
               hands

                                     norman

               he walks out claire walks over and stands before the box

               int bedroom  night

               claire walks into the bedroom the shower can be heard through 
               the bathroom door which is partially ajar steam drifts out 
               through the crack

               she stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her 
               weary distraught countenance in the mirror she glances 
               down

               claires pov

               the necklace still in her hand

               she looks up again into the mirror her face goes strangely 
               blank and almost mechanically she clasps the necklace onto 
               her neck

               suddenly she stares over at the cordless phone lying on the 
               bed for a long moment she walks over picks up the phone 
               and looks at it

               claires pov

               the redial button

               she stares at the bathroom door then hits the button two 
               rings then

                                     voice
                              on phone
                         directory assistance

               claires eyes widen in terror she clicks off the phone 
               and taking it with her starts moving toward the door to 
               the hall she keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom 
               she quietly pulls open the hallway door

               suddenly a hand with a washcloth is thrust over her face

               claire shoves normans hand away and runs past him down the 
               hall

               int hallway  night

               shes nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts 
               to falter she tumbles over dropping the phone which 
               clatters down the stairs before her

               claire is pulling herself down the stairs moaning in terror

               norman can be seen calmly following her waiting for the 
               halothane to take its full effect finally she freezes

               norman picks up the phone and stands over her

                                     norman
                         god how did we come to this

               he picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her 
               slowly up the stairs

                                     norman
                         the ghost stuff that was impressive

                         i figure you saw her that day in the 
                         house and just gradually intuited 
                         the whole damn thing that would be 
                         pretty astonishing a passive
                         aggressive masterpiece

               int bathroom  night

               and into the bathroom

                                     norman
                         wasnt until the shower that i 
                         realized you actually believed it 
                         nearly froze to death waiting for 
                         you thought the circuit breaker 
                         would kick back over and id be toast

               then shes lowered into the tub

                                     norman
                         the crazy thing is i have never 
                         for one moment stopped loving you

               he actually wipes a tear from his eye he kisses her lips

               we can feel her revulsion his face over her

                                     norman

                         in some tragic way thisll bring us 
                         closer together

               he turns on the faucets then moves out of her line of vision 
               sound of a number being dialed

                                     norman os

                         mind stopping by to check on her in 
                         the morning

               she glances down and sees on the edge of the tub a 
               prescription bottle of valium with her name on the label 
               her eyes go wide

                                     norman os

                         anymore

               norman lit periodically by the sweep of the light house 
               beacon squats with the phone and gazes down at her

                                     norman

               claire mute glances frantically around one of her fingers 
               begins to flutter

                                     norman
                              tearfully

               the tub is rapidly filling he checks his watch then reaches 
               for the valium as much from will as the drug beginning to 
               fade claire lets out a garbled cry

                                     claire
                              sloppy guttural

                                     claire
                              slurry
                         mauduh

               norman stops

                                     norman
                         what

                         madison

               norman seems unnerved that shes still clinging to her belief 
               in the ghost

                                     norman
                         thats a little much dont you think

               he sees the necklace on her neck

                                     norman
                         oops cant have that

               he puts down the bottle of valium then reaches around 
               claires neck to remove the necklace when his hands close 
               on the clasp his face suddenly goes slack

               normans pov

               his arms around madisons beautiful corpse

               norman explodes backwards slamming his head into the brass 
               shower nozzle he staggers out of the bathroom before 
               collapsing with a thud the water finally rises above claires 
               nostrils

               claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and 
               yank it free the water slowly descends

               when it seems that her lungs must burst her mouth finally 
               clears the descending water she chokes in great gulps of 
               air

               the drug is finally wearing off claire sits up normans 
               unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway she 
               turns off the water and stands unsteadily

               she looks around for the phone and finally spots the little 
               antenna protruding from under norman she delicately pulls 
               the phone out of his back pocket only to discover that its 
               been broken by his fall she drops it and walks quietly out 
               of the room

               int stairway  night

               claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs

               int foyer  night

               she fumbles for some keys in a basket by the door then looks 
               at the cell phones recharging cradle its empty

               she spots normans coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles 
               through the pockets she finds the phone and flips it open 
               to see if its working a drop of something splats on the 
               phone then another its blood

               she looks up and sees norman his forehead gashed glaring 
               down from the landing

               she reaches for the door knob but the keys and cell phone 
               in her hand make it difficult to open norman hurls himself 
               over the banister thud

               a bloody hand yanks her backwards claire slams into the 
               corner by the armoire norman advances on her at the last 
               moment she throws her shoulder into the armoire which tumbles 
               over on norman

               ext driveway  night

               claire races over to the volvo which is blocked by normans 
               pickup the dark hulk of the sailboat on a trailer behind 
               it

               she starts to get into the pickup then remembers to look in 
               the bed nobody there

               int pickup  night

               the truck is cold and doesnt want to turn over she stares 
               at the door for signs of norman

                                     claire
                         come on come on

               and vroom the truck roars to life claire spews gravel 
               as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway 
               constantly watching the door

               when she veers to the right out of the driveway she looks 
               into the rear view mirror the boat momentarily blocks the 
               open door then clears still nothing

               ext dirt road  night

               claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a twolane road

               int pickup  night

               shivering with cold and adrenaline she tries to work the 
               ancient heater she turns onto the bridge

               ext bridge  night

               the pickup and boat race across the deserted bridge

               int pickup  night

               angle

               claire through the windshield her face striped by the 
               reflection of the bridge lights which whip onebyone across 
               the windshield she flips open the cell phone and punches in 
               911 it blinks no service

                                     claire
                         shit

               she glances into the rear view mirror

               claires pov

               a stern section of the boats covering tarp untied flapping 
               in the breeze

               claire desperately punches the talk button again no 
               service shes past the center of the bridge she looks 
               again roam claire punches the talk button again

               smash

               a trailer crank punches through the window normans arm 
               follows coiling like a python around claires neck his 
               grim visage pressed against the glass

               she squashes down the accelerator

               ext bridge  night

               the trailer starts to weave from side to side swerving the 
               pickup claire chokes then blacks out

               ext bridge  night

               the pickup and trailer smash through the railing barreling 
               over bumpy terrain straight toward the boat ramp

               the truck hits the water at fifty and norman is hurtled 
               through the rear window and into the passenger side dashboard

               int pickup  moments later

               claire is unconscious in the drivers seat a trickle of 
               blood runs from her nose norman stirs briefly as claire 
               groggily comes to she hears the hissing of the smashed 
               radiator then sees norman a shattered bloody mess on the 
               floor of the cab

               she leans over to see if hes dead hears a squeak and 
               realizes that the pickup with the battered sailboat and 
               trailer miraculously still attached is rolling deeper into 
               the water

               before she can get the door open the truck is half submerged 
               she frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts 
               to pull herself out

               her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks 
               onto her ankle and yanks her inside norman pulls her down 
               until theyre face to face

                                     claire
                         norman no

               she yanks the emergency brake but its too late the 
               submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp

               the truck is nearly submerged

                                     claire
                              desperately
                         norman please

               the water is up to the windows norman shakes his head slowly 
               as he blinks away blood from his eyes

                                     claire
                         think of caitlin

               water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and 
               momentarily blinds norman claire jerks free and scrambles 
               out of the drivers side window as the truck sinks

               just as shes free of the window she jerks to a stop she 
               looks down and sees norman half out of the window one hand 
               clamped onto her ankle

               there is a wrenching metallic creak the truck lurches 
               downward then silence it doesnt sink the boat buoys it 
               like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake

               the headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater 
               drop off claire tries to swim free but normans not letting 
               go

               suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer

               it hurtles downwards and the stillglowing headlights 
               reveal

               madisons submerged mustang

               smash

               when the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car 
               the mustangs windshield shatters a pale shape floats upward

               norman is suddenly entangled by something he tries to brush 
               it free but comes facetoface with madisons ghastly 
               decomposed face the last of his air bellows out of him in a 
               scream as he releases claires ankle

               his dead staring face separates from madisons as the truck 
               slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom

               ext lake  dawn

               claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air

                                                                    cut to

               underwater  dawn

               the sound of a furious cello solo

               cold staring eyes

               norman half out of the truck arms floating

               follow his eyes to the pale corpse drifting above tethered 
               to the mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle

               move through the murky water toward the corpses clothed 
               back as she twists into view

               morphs into madisons pale beautiful face at peace

               camera drifts moves upward and breaks the surface as the 
               distant lights of emergency vehicles approach

                                                                    cut to

               fingers

               filled with moist earth a hand tosses the clump of dirt 
               onto

               the grave a tiny arm snakes around her waist she glances 
               down to see caitlin her eyes shining clasping her mother 
               tightly claire takes a last look into the grave

                                     claire

               fingers

               racing across the neck of a cello the solo continues and 
               now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped claire 
               before

               int a living room  night

               claire her hair short and sexy eyes tightly shut brow 
               beaded with sweat the piece builds to a dark passionate 
               crescendo

               her eyes remain shut for a moment then flutter open

               a new york apartment the glimmering skyline visible through 
               a large window cooper gazes up attentively

               claire sips a glass of wine her face unsmiling but serene
