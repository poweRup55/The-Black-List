	44	int evening dentists office  steckler is in his office sat behind a
	desk light from a neon pours in through the window as he rearranges
	the things on his desk

	he leans back in his chair rubbing his lower aching back

	he looks up  there is a slight opening in the doorway to the surgery
	reception there is a little movement as janet the nurse finishes off
	her chores

	he watches her until she sits down she crosses her legs one of her
	feet falling into the light of the door opening steckler can see
	nothing but the lower quarter of her leg and her white tall heeled
	shoe it glows out to him

	steckler watches the foot  wanting and needing but hes not dumb

	steckler is drawn to the window

	he examines the figure of the woman her curves her face and smile

	hassling a blonde girl kate the girl is young but fights back
	vigorously  its all getting a bit nasty

	steckler crosses the road


	46	ext alleyway night  the spiv is shouting about money and for her to

	spiv senses that this could get nastier and lets the girl go
	concentrating on steckler

						spiv
			 come on grandad

	without warning steckler lunges and snatches the spivs hand forcing
	him to drop the knife the spiv screams in pain as steckler bends his
	two fingers back  there is a loud crack as steckler snaps his
	fingers the spiv howls and steckler releases him  he runs into the
	night nursing his hand

	steckler turns to the girl on the floor  she is young afraid and dirt
	smeared her hair is bleached white and she wears a white dress

	he exits


	50	int day miks room  we move along makeup and girls things they are
	all in use classical music gently plays in the background

	we move up to the mirror as a pretty girl with dark long hair looks up
	slowly we realise that it is steckler we pull wide to see his hairy
	chest he smiles at the illusion

	steckler begins rummaging through miks things her cupboards her
	drawers  he spends a moment running his hands through her underwear
	drawer before becoming a little bored


	51	int day hallway  steckler walks out of miks room wearing nothing but
	his wig makeup and a pair of joggers


	52	int carters room day  steckler looks round like a child at the fair
	ground

	he moves to her cupboards and drawers  curiously ignoring her makeup
	clothes and underwear

	he begins to search under drawers behind cupboards behind books
	above the curtain rail

	eventually he gives up and lies back on carters bed looking at the
	ceiling suddenly he flips over and looks under her bed  still
	nothing he pulls himself back up when he notices a slight rip in the
	mattress he pushes his fingers in and the flap gives way  it is a
	velcro held opening steckler places his hand in and slowly removes the
	hidden contents  a small case


	53	int stecklers room day  steckler is sat at his table with the case
	he is removing his makeup with a towel and is now wearing a t shirt

	he inspects it closely before opening it inside is tightly packed he
	smiles as he removes the letters written from cut out newspapers  he
	delves deeper  a passport is there stephen carter ellens husband
	steckler moves on excited by his find

	a small but sharp knife a wedding ring a newspaper cutting from a
	small column which reads famous novelists husband disappears he
	finds a small gold statuette  her prize from the awards at the start
	of the movie steckler feels honoured to hold it and inspects it
	closely before moving on

	curiously enough he finds the plans of the house he inspects them
	closely  the kitchen the hall the bedroomsthe living room 
	something looks odd different wrong


	54	int day living room  steckler is stood in the living room getting his
	bearings in relation to the plans he looks round and then at the wall
	to his right

	he goes over to it running his hand over the surface  there is a
	slight bump where extra work had been done

	he thumps hard on the wall moving along as he does so  suddenly the
	echo changes

	he takes an involuntary step backward

	cut to  the screen is black there is a heavy thud and another
	suddenly a brick falls from its place and another  steckler is
	knocking the wall down

	excitedly he makes a hole big enough for him to fit his head and arms
	through he turns on his torch and leans in

	the recess is dark and his torch cuts a beam in the dusty air he looks
	down  sure enough there are the crumbling and crusty remains of a
	corpse steckler is almost jubilant at his discovery and begins to
	laugh

	we see the face of the dead man his skin dry and old stretched in a
	deathlike grin

	fade to black


	55	ext day 66 acacia avenue  carters car pulls into the driveway and she
	parks up the sky is heavy and there is a distant rumble of thunder as
	she steps out of her car  she senses something  a still  a quiet


	56	int day hallway  carter enters the house hangs up her coat and picks
	up her mail she walks past the living room and into the kitchen she
	stops dead in the kitchen and backtracks

	she drops her letters to the floor as she looks into the room  a huge
	gaping and black hole is all that is left of her husbands tomb

	a great pile of bricks lie to the side

	she moves forward  desperate but not wanting to inspect the contents
	of the hole

	she steps forward takes another step and another  all the time
	getting closer to the shadowy hole


											continued

	56	continued

	and then she is there slowly she leans inand it is empty she leans
	back out and jumps as she realises steckler is standing right behind
	her

	for a long time she doesnt know what to say  everything is moving too
	fast and she has to be careful

						carter
			 with difficulty what have you done

	steckler smiles and walks behind the sofa  enjoying the moment 
	savoring the atmosphere

						steckler
			 i knew you did it  i just couldnt
			 figure out what you had done with the
			 body

	carter is really not sure what is happening anymore why hadnt he told
	the police what did he want she cannot speak  just listen

						steckler
			 i knew you had killed him  i just felt
			 it  im surprised that the police
			 didnt suspect foul play  everything
			 pointed that way

	carter looks at the gaping hole in the wall

						steckler
			 smiling oh i admit its a rather
			 vulgar method  but i needed to fire
			 your searching imagination

	carter is still a little blank

						steckler
			 the reason i knew you killed your
			 husband  apart from the fact that he
			 disappeared  is that you stopped
			 writing  he must have been a bastard to
			 you  anyway smiling im going to
			 give you a second chance to start anew

	steckler looks down searching for a way to tell carter something

						steckler
			 you had better sit down


											continued

	56	continued 2

	dutifully carter sits  shes too confused to do anything else

	steckler stands opposite the sofa forming a barrier between them
	steckler looks deep into the empty tomb  into the blackness

						steckler
			 you see ellen there are parts of me you
			 havent encountered  parts that are
			 more important  that most people dont
			 or wont understand

	steckler turns to face carter fire in his eyes

						steckler
			 i want you and your words to make people
			 understand  im commissioning a book

	carter is starting to get afraid for her safety

						steckler
			 i want people to understand the power
			 any man can use  to take what he needs
			 to take what he wants  i want people to
			 know why i do what i do  so that when i
			 am finished they will understand the
			 truth of my actions i want the ellen
			 carter to write the life story of leslie
			 raymond steckler

	steckler stops for a moment  carter is looking out of depth

						steckler
			 i dont have much time ellen  they have
			 my finger prints  they will catch me

	carter is beginning to shake

						steckler
			 im not going to hurt you smiles 
			 youre not my type  i need your skills
			  enthused dont you see the divine
			 perfection  you and i are both carved
			 from the same stone  it will be the
			 perfect partnership  your words  my
			 story

	steckler calms down looking back into the darkness of the tomb 


											continued

	56	continued 3

						steckler
			 and dont think of calling the police 

	steckler shows carter a photo of a weird looking tree with a spade
	stuck in the ground

						steckler
			 thats where your husband is  its not
			 too far from here but far enough i
			 have marked the map reference near the
			 tree and lodged it in my family safety
			 deposit box

	steckler puts his arm down his shirt and dangles a key in front of
	carter

						steckler
			 should anything ever happen to me 
			 should i die get hit by a truck  or
			 disappear then i have instructed the
			 manager to turn the contents  along
			 with an explanatory letter over to
			 scotland yard  so lets just hope
			 nothing happens to me

	steckler moves to the other side of the room

						steckler
			 otherwise you are free to do as you
			 will

	he looks at her  her eyes are red rimmed and she is shaking

						steckler
			 as long as you write my bookthinks

	he turns and makes for the door opening it  he stops but doesnt
	turn

						steckler
			 you have no choice ellen you will write
			 this book

	steckler exits carter sits absolutely still like a rabbit after a
	truck has passed  she hears the front door click shut and sees
	steckler walk down the garden path

	carter suddenly leaps to her feet and runs into the kitchen


	57	int day kitchen  carter tears in and grabs the biggest knife she can
	find in the knife rack she whips round pointing it out  her back to
	the wall

						carter
			 quietly fuckoh fuck oh fuck


	58	ext night crime scene offices  a heavy sky looms overhead  police
	sirens wail


	59	int night true crime offices  the offices are dark only the
	occasional light illuminates the night a street lamp cast weird and
	ugly shadows across the walls

	carter sits in a pool of light cast from a nearby desk lamp her eyes
	are blood shot her face blank a cigarette burns in her fingers her
	fingers dart through a rolidex

	suddenly there is a slight noise behind her a click a creak slowly
	she wraps her hand around the knife she had in the kitchen

	without warning she spins round brandishing the blade  only to
	confront dezerae campbell  her boss

	dezerae nearly dies of a heart attack  only narrowly avoiding a
	spillage of her coffee which she clasps in her hand

						dezerae
			 oh my gawd

						carter
			 im sorry  i didnt think

						dezerae
			 a person could get killed round here
			 just for working late

	carter smiles at dezeraes curt response

						carter
			 i thought you were someone else

						dezerae
			 well im glad im not them  what are
			 you doing here so late come to that
			 what the hell have you got that for

	she points to the knife

	carter laughs as dezerae turns and leaves carter watches her as she
	enters her office wittering to herself

	she picks up the phone and returns to her rolidex  she stops at a card
	 alan smith


	60	int night house  the phone ringsa little girl with a party hat
	picks up the receiver

	62	ext night cash point  carter is at a cashpoint everywhere is
	deserted she feels intensely lonely  and very very afraid of the
	shadows she glances at her watch as she withdraws a huge wad of notes


	63	int night hardware store  we see a pile of cans which read ant
	poison carter takes one down and looks at it  paying attention to
	the contents it reads 85 arsenic  poison

	she takes it and walks to the checkout


	64	ext night spare parts shop  carter pulls up in front of a run down
	scruffy shop with spare tyres in the window the lights are off

	she clambers from her car and knocks on the door  after a moment the
	door opens to reveal an odd looking man dark with a slight limp  he
	replies with a broad cockney accent 

						john
			 alan sent you  right

	carter nods


	65	int night car shop  carter steps into the shop which is filled with
	car spare parts seats tyres windows  everything you could ever
	imagine its cramped and claustrophobic 

	john walks behind the counter  reaches under and retrieves a very
	large and oddly shaped tool box 

	carter watches anxiously  john opens up the case to reveal a vast
	array of weapons  from small pistols to fully automatic assault
	riffles 

						john
			 what do you want

	carter is obviously a little weapon shy  if not downright ignorant


											continued

	65	continued

						carter
			 i want a gun  embarrassed  theres
			 this guy i think hes watching me  you
			 know id just feel safer with a gun in
			 the house  i wouldnt use it  just for

	john frowns and reaches in pulling out an ouzi sub machine gun

						john
			 thisll stop anything that moves

						carter

	he replaces the weapon and withdraws a small handgunhe racks it
	checking the chamber and the mechanismcarter jumps slightly at the
	loud metallic chang

						john
			 browning 9mm  holds 13 in the clip one
			 in the chamber  and ill throw in two
			 extra clips and a silencer

	he holds out the extra bullet clips before screwing the silencer onto
	the front of the gun he passes it to her she holds it clumsily if
	not a little repulsed by it

						carter
			 i will need the bullets

						john
			 no problem  thats a good gun  got a
			 nice action  try it

	carter holds the gun up at arms length  unsure of what to do she
	squints and aims before pulling the triggerclick

	cut to 

	a huge wad of notes is dropped on the counter carter turns to leave


	66	int night hallway at 66 acacia avenue  carter enters her front door
	closing it quietly behind her she doesnt turn the lights on


											continued

	66	continued

	the faint sound of classical music and laughter comes from the living
	room  slowly she walks toward the closed door she reaches out and
	opens it


	67	int night living room  she steps into the room steckler and mik are
	sat at a table together having dinner  mik looks round smiling

						mik
			 ellen youre back  come and join us

	mik crunches hard on a bone 

						mik
			 oh come on ellen theyre the nicest

	steckler walks out of the room  carrying the huge platter

						steckler
			 dessert is on its way

	he leaves the room

	mik gives carter a scrumpled tipsy look

						mik
			 i think i misjudged him  hes really
			 quite cute

	carter is not smiling at all  mik sees this mik gets up and wanders
	over to the other side of the room  she selects a tape and inserts it
	into the cassette deck and presses play she removes her jacket to
	reveal a tight white vest

						mik
			 wiping brow you ought to get the
			 heating seen to  its so hot

	heavy thudding dance music pumps from the speakers mik begins to dance
	on her own  she is very very sexy as she swings her hips

	carter is exasperated  on top of everything she has a headache the
	last thing she needs is a drunk girlie flirting with a psychopath
	carter stands up and turns the music down

						mik

						carter
			 awkwardly  quiet i would prefer it if

	mik laughs at the ridiculousness of the statement

						mik
			 you dont own him you know  you cant
			 tell me not to see him

						carter
			 calmly yes i can

	miks attitude changes  this is no longer a funny situation  ellen is
	serious 

						mik
			 huh  fuck you  who trampled on your
			 grave

	mik turns the music back up  and continues dancing carter looks over
	to the kitchen  expecting steckler to be watching this display  but
	hes not

	she looks harder then she sees the reflection of his face in a
	mirror in shadows he is watching and has been watching mik from the
	safety of a mirror he doesnt move just watches

	carter turns  she must speak now whilst she has the strength she
	turns the tape off

						carter
			 im giving you notice i want you out

	mik stops dead in her tracks slowly turning

						carter
			 i want you out now

						mik

						mik

											continued

	67	continued 3

	steckler appears at the door of the kitchen mik is bubbling with
	anger but she restrains it tears forming in her eyes

						mik
			 oh i understand stepping forward

	she turns and exits running upstairs carter looks at steckler who
	returns a silent stare the sound of mik thundering back down the
	stairs can be heard and she enters with her jacket and a small bag her
	eyes are red  she looks like she is about to burst into tears

	she walks up to carter offering her a wad of notes

						mik
			 its the rent im due  take it then we
			 are equal

	reluctantly carter takes the notesmik is very distressed fighting
	hard to keep her voice from wavering she keeps her head bowed

						mik
			 ill be at deklans and ill come over
			 to collect my stuff in the next few
			 days dont mind my stuff if some guy
			 you fancy turns up  just leave it in
			 the garden  i thought you were a nice
			 girl ellen  looks like i was wrong

	she turns and walks out pausing at the door to look at carter carter
	can say or do nothing steckler watches silently  he knows his place
	he continues to wash the dirty dishes mik leaves

	dissolve to 


	68	int night carters room  a huge plank wedges the door shut  on the
	table is an ashtray with a cigarette burning peacefully  a box of
	shells lies open carter sits silently listening through headphones
	to her miniature tape recorder the interview with alan smith

	she checks out her gun  shes never handled one before and the action
	is stiff  she learns how to load the clip how to rack the gunshe
	feels the weight in her palm before gently squeezing the trigger 
	click

	carter turns her attention to the bottle of ant killer she had
	bought


											continued

	68	continued

						voice of smith
			 oh yeah anyway  when he got them
			 weakened with the arsenic just
			 sprinkled it on their food for a few
			 days  like i said just weakened them
			 enough for him to get them where he
			 wanted them without any resistance

	carter takes a spoonful of the white powder from the ant poison and
	sprinkles it into the sugar bowl she mixes it in with the spoon before
	tasting a little just to check if it can be detected she cant
	taste anything

	she replaces the sugar bowl lid and looks up


	69	int night hallway  carter walks down the stairs the sugar bowl in her
	hand she has no expression  just a resolute stare


	70	int night kitchen  she enters the kitchen and boils the kettle 
	making two cups of coffee slowly and methodically


	71	int night living room  carter enters the room with two mugs of coffee
	on a tray  and the sugar bowl

	steckler sits opposite watching banal television he looks up to her
	as she passes him the coffee

						carter
			 sugar

						steckler
			 yes one and a half please

	carter dunks the sugar in the coffee and swirls it round she passes it
	to steckler watching him intently as he sips

						carter
			 i will write your book

	steckler breaks into a broad smile  carter does not

						carter
			 but i have one demand  you will not
			 kill whilst i write


											continued

	71	continued

	steckler stops grinning and thinks then smiles once more

						steckler

			 before they identify my prints  and
			 then it is over  i will destroy all the
			 evidence in my safety deposit box  your
			 secret will die with mepleased im
			 so glad ellen

	carter doesnt look so cheerful


	72	int night living room  the screen is filled with the white noise of a
	video recorder image  it stabilises and shows steckler sat in front of
	the camera  gaudy pixilated colours seep through  it appears very
	documentary style

						voice of carter

						steckler
			 embarrassed what do i do what do you

			 one girl i think her name is debbie 
			 she had broken down on the motorway and
			 i offered to take her to a service
			 station to call for a tow truck  she
			 just got in and i drove away when i
			 pulled into the layby and took out my
			 knife  she just froze and said  what
			 do you want  i said you know what i
			 want  but she didnt getting rid of
			 the bodies is just as easy  the first i
			 cut up put in bags with bricks in and
			 tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad
			 daylight pause the real problem with
			 my work is the blood  there is so much
			 of it  and it all spurts out so fast 
			 like a fountain it made such a mess of

	72	continued 2

						steckler contd
			 my car  i stopped working from my
			 car pause she could have stopped me
			 you know  if she really wanted too
			 that is the difference between the
			 confusion of humanity and the purity of
			 the beast  if a dog attacked you  you
			 could easily kill it without any damage
			 to yourself  why then do people get
			 bitten by dogs  savaged why

						carter
			 i dont know

						steckler
			 because a dog will attack with a
			 ferocity and force that we poses but
			 centuries of social contamination has
			 run it out of us  that is what sets us
			 aside from the purity of the
			 beastssociety is rotting  men who
			 once were strong and kept everything
			 working are getting soft  women are
			 making them soft  by the time a pretty
			 girl has reached twenty  she has had
			 three lifetimes worth of fun and
			 attention so she doesnt deserve any
			 more 

						carter
			 didnt debbie deserve anymore

						steckler
			 no she didnt

						carter
			 what did you do with her

						steckler
			 you know everyone accuses me of being
			 sick  the press the tv  but im not
			 you know  they are  i dont watch it
			 for entertainment every night  i dont
			 sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner
			  they all say how could he cut her up
			 she was dead  i cant hurt something
			 dead  and all this whilst they slobber
			 down their processed beef burgers by the
			 dozen  i couldnt eat one of those
			 burgers you dont know what has gone in
			 them wry smile

	72	continued 3

	there is a long pause 

						carter
			 the press think that the white angel is
			 a woman  why is that do you dress up
			 leslie

						steckler
			 awkward i dont want to talk about it
			 

						carter
			 ok the press call you the white angle
			 because you only kill girls wearing
			 white  why white  white clothes
			 blonde hair

						steckler
			 i dont know

						carter
			 is their colour an expression of their
			 inner self by that i mean extroverts
			 wear bright colours  so what are people
			 who wear white

						steckler
			 to carter i dont know

						carter
			 is white an expression of innocence do
			 you crave innocence leslie

						steckler
			  let me ask you why do you wear
			 black ellen carter what are you running
			 from

	carter is indeed wearing black  there is a long pause as steckler
	stares carter out  even though he cant quite see her

						carter
			 do you feel sorry for the girls you have
			 killed

						steckler
			 why should i feel sorry  theyre dead



	73	ext night roadwaycar  the white lines of the road streak silently by
	carter sits silently in the car with steckler as they drive into the
	night passing car headlights dance on carters face  they say nothing
	to one another  there is a sombre quiet


	74	ext house night  steckler pulls up in front of a house 


	75	ext day night  the door to the house opens steckler and carter stand
	in the doorway

	the man in the doorway looks puzzled he obviously doesnt know carter
	or steckler

						steckler

						graham

	76	int night grahams living room  the room is cosy and dark a log fire
	burning in the background we pan along a series of pictures some with

	shot with a glass of brandy for steckler

	to have guests for a change  especially nice people

						graham

			 smudgy

						graham

	steckler turns to carter looking her right in the eye

						steckler
			 oh we got in a little tussle once  and
			 thats when i saw it

	carter is beginning to look a little uncomfortable

						steckler
			 so if you dont mind me asking  how did
			 it happen

	graham takes a deep breath  its been a long time since has told
	anyone about this

						graham
			 well  she was out late one night  just

			 cigarettes  and she didnt come back


											continued

	76	continued 2

	steckler watches carter

	we stay on carters face for the entire monologue  the glow of the fire
	dances on her face

						graham
			 three days later some kids found her in
			 some bushes gets very difficult to
			 talk  she had beenshe had been
			 they said she died instantlybut i
			 dont know how long she had to suffer
			 before that bastard killed her

	carter is almost in tears

						graham
			 the worst thing was i had to go down and
			 identify her  she was so small and pale
			 

	we cut back to graham

						graham
			 how can any human being do that to
			 another

	carter doesnt have a clue


	77	int car night  carter sits silently as steckler drives

	suddenly a figure can be seen in the roadway  a hitcher a girl with
	blonde hair cut off jeans and long legs 

	steckler slows down to stop  carter is about to violently object  but
	steckler speeds on before she can say anything he looks over to carter
	with a wry smile

	carter is wide eyed and shocked


	78	ext day 66 acacia avenue  stecklers car pulls into the driveway and
	halts carter and steckler clamber for it running from the rain that
	pelts down they approach the house and enter

	slowly we move backwards to reveal inspector taylor sat in his car with
	a thermos flask and the infamous doughnut he watches them intently


	79	int night carters room  carter drowsily tosses and turns she glances
	at her clock its 330


	80	int day hallway  steckler stands in the hallway fixing his tie he is
	very smart he examines a piece of paper which is headed shosters bank
	of credit  he glances down at the letter  appointment at 10am
	steckler glances at his watch and turns decidedly to the door

	quietly he unlocks it glancing up as he does so  he doesnt want to
	make much noise

	he gently shuts the door behind him


	81	int day carters room  but the click of the latch still awakens the
	slumbering carter she looks very much the worse for wear the last few
	days have been very tough

	drowsily she climbs from her bed and peers out of the window  she sees
	steckler walking down the garden path and round the corner out of
	sight

	she thinks to herself


	82	int day upstairs hallway  carter appears in the hallway dressed in
	thrown on track suit bottoms and a vest 

	she walks down the hall to stecklers room looking round as she does 
	she knows hes not there but she has to settle her paranoia

	slowly she takes a hold of the door handle and turns  to her amazement
	the door swings open


	83	int day stecklers room  carter is left in the hallway hesitant 
	slowly she enters  fearful of what she may find

	the room is well lit and organised  yet disorganised whilst
	everything is neatly put in its place its not quite right  clothes
	are crumpled books upside down on the shelf

	a sleeping bag lies on the floor recently slept inthe bed
	immaculate

	the wall has several pictures on it  prints of classical paintings in
	tacky small frames

	she begins to rummage through cupboards  but finds only clothes she
	opens a set of drawers and riffles throughnothing


											continued

	83	continued

	down the side of the cabinet are some leather bound books  carter
	opens the first  ancient stamps

	she moves on to the next press clippings she leafs through them
	they begin years ago with local press reports of mass dog killings in
	the hamlet of dedington soon the clippings develop a more sinister
	feel woman found dead on common local girl goes missing

	writer wins award  we see ellen carter holding up a copy of her book
	smiling broadly for the photographers 

	carter is stunned that steckler has kept this old clipping she
	continues to flick and discovers more and more white angel killings
	reports

	she closes the book and replaces it carefully

	she turns her attention to the case we saw steckler struggling with 
	filled and over heavy she lifts it and places it on the bed slowly
	she unlatches it  and finally removes the belt

	the lid creaks open  carter holds her breath not wanting to open it 
	but it is filled with bizarre dentistry tools scalpels probes  a gas
	cylinder and drill a tiny piece of black cloth protrudes from a
	brown parcel  carter unravels it to reveal a black dress wig and red
	stiletto shoes  perfectly arranged carters frowns

	she replaces everything and moves on

	she opens a drawer and rummages taking out a pile of letters she
	leafs through and discovers a bank statement  depository section of
	the shosters bank of credit  and the address 44 anthony street
	barnet

						carter
			 bingo  whispering to self  searching
			 the key

	we pull focus to reveal the key hanging from the bedheadcarter
	doesnt see it


	84	ext day street  steckler is walking briskly down the street  he stops
	suddenly clasping his chest  he has forgotten the key he turns on
	his heel and begins walking back  fast


	85	int day stecklers room  carter delves deeper into stecklers drawer 
	intrigued she takes some photos out  mostly polaroids one is of a
	very pretty girl in a car another is of a woman  huge and
	domineering she is in her kitchen smiling broadly

	85	continued

	another photo is of a young boy with an older girl by his side 
	presumably steckler with a sister she finds a crumpled shot of an old
	house huge and mansion like she delves deeper into the papers she
	finds a document  an adoption document the date 1962  the name
	leslie raymond anderson

						carter
			 mouthing my god


	86	ext day 66 acacia avenue  steckler is getting closer walking up the
	garden path to the door  his finger touches the doorbell but he
	hesitates  he steps back and looks at carters bedroom  her curtain
	still shut he shrugs and removes his keys


	87	int day stecklers room  she moves on to a small album of polaroids

	the first is of steckler and his wife sat on a sofa stecklers arm
	around his her there are a few mundane photos before carter finds
	one of a different girl once more steckler embracing

	carter glances over at the table  a polaroid camera sits with a small
	tripod attached

	she flips through the other photos  all different girls  all vacant
	stares  all dead


	88	ext day front door  steckler twists the key in the lock and the door
	swings open 


	89	int day stecklers room  carter delves deeper into another drawer
	suddenly she hears a click  her head spins round her heart
	pounding


	90	int day stairs  steckler is creeping up the stairs


	91	int day stecklers room  carter frantically tidies everything away


	92	int day stairs  but steckler is getting closer still almost at the
	top of the stairs


	93	int day stecklers room  carter has finished tidying when she suddenly
	spots the key hanging up  she reaches out for it  the door handle
	turns  carters eyes widen

	the door swings open and steckler steps in he looks round cautiously 
	the key is still in its place but swaying ever so slightlyand no
	carter

	we see stecklers bed carters foot disappears under it

	we see carter huddling amongst the boxes and a huge parcel beneath the
	bed  she watches stecklers feet

	steckler grabs the key and puts it around his head he pauses again 
	looking round  it is as if he can sense someone has been here

	without further thought he turns and exits closing the door

	carter listens as he goes down the stairs and out of the front door 
	clunk  she takes a deep breath

	then she sniffs something smells bad she turns to see the huge
	parcel beneath the bed beside her  slowly she reaches out to pull the
	sacking back

	it is just an old pillow some boxes and other junk  she doesnt know
	what she expected but shes glad its nothing else

	she clambers from under the bed and shakes herself down  without
	hesitation she moves for the door  but its locked

	carter groans in disbelief

						carter
			 oh come on


	94	int day miks room  the camera moves slowly through miks room 
	suddenly there is a movement from the window  carter appears
	clambering along the window ledge awkwardly  she reaches through the
	open slip and lets herself in

	clumsily she falls to the floor in miks room  glad to be safe

	she lies on her back and realises that she is still holding stecklers
	small polaroid album in her hand she starts to laugh  and laugh and
	laugh  and then as suddenly she had started she stops laughing and
	closes her eyes

	dissolve to 


	95	int night stecklers room  the door to stecklers room opens and carter
	silently steps in steckler lies in the moonlight asleep the key
	carter is so desperate to have is sitting on his bedside cabinet

	slowly she moves forward sweat dripping from her forehead

	she reaches out for the key further and further nearer and nearer

	her finger clasps the cold metal suddenly steckler jumps up behind
	her screaming  he raises his arm bringing the meat clever he holds
	crashing down on her hand severing it cleanly from her body


	96	int day living room  carter abruptly wakes from her dream  she is sat
	in her high arm chair  the room is darkened the curtains shut

	slowly she makes out the form of steckler sat shadowed in a chair
	opposite he doesnt move or say anything

						carter
			 how long have you been watching me

						steckler
			 i have something i have to show you

	he stands up  the room is still laid out from the previous evening
	the video camera still on its tripod

	steckler wanders over to the tv set and inserts a tape into the video 
	the tv flickers into life  a home video shaky and out of focus a
	couple are chatting and enjoying a picnic by a monument in a park it
	is steckler and another woman  presumably his wife steckler looks
	very different his hair unkempt his clothes scruffy the woman is
	thin with waves of blonde hair  shes wearing a bright coloured
	outfit  her face caked in makeup

	but worst of all she nags

	steckler looks round at carter  the light from the tv flickers on her
	face he looks back to the tvthe couple are eating their picnic

	the picture and sound is very bad  adding to the authentic fly on the
	wall documentary feel

	the camera is being helmed by steckler who is off shot  and soon an
	argument breaks out over the contents of the sandwiches as usual
	everything is stecklers fault cant he do anything right this woman
	is your worst nightmare

	suddenly the camera tiltsthen falls to the ground its focus system
	tries to focus on the background but cannot instead it focuses on the
	picnic basket


	96	continued

	a fight can be heard  suddenly stecklers wife stops shouting at him
	there is a pause then a crash as something falls over

	carters eyes widen as her mind fills in the visual blanks from the
	sound there is a loud but muffled crack

	the camera is picked up again getting a brief glimpse of the inert
	form of the woman on the floor the picture goes fuzzy as the recording
	ends

	carter looks up at steckler who in turn has just turned off the camera

	cut to 

	the wheels of the video cassette turn in the video camera  the record
	light flashes

	we see the video screen steckler sits there  looking into the lens

						carter
			 tell me about your wife

						steckler
			 my wife  my wife was the only one who
			 really deserved it mimicking leslie
			 do this leslie do that leslie its
			 your fault she used to tell me what
			 to wear where to go what to do  she
			 mothered me

						carter
			 then why did you marry her 

						steckler
			 it seemed like a good idea at the time 
			 why did you marry your husband

	there is a pregnant pause  carter continues

						carter
			 what didnt you like about her

						steckler
			 intensely i hated being treated like a
			 failure  looked down on  my sister
			 used to do that  i hated it  i should
			 have known when we got married  in a
			 registry office of course  she wore
			 maroon  i just wanted a white wedding
			  i think she thought i was a ticket
			 to the good life i had a good job
			 prospects and she was a slut  i didnt
			 know until too late one day i came

	96	continued 2

						steckler contd
			 home early and found her in bed with
			 another man i dont know who he was it
			 didnt matter she never saw me i sat
			 and watched for half an hour before i
			 knew what i had to do

	there is a pause as steckler thinks

						steckler
			 i hated her for that and i hated her
			 for not wearing white at our wedding i
			 was cheated i couldnt have what
			 everyone else could have  all my life i
			 have denied puritythe only time i
			 really was at one with my wife was those
			 precious few hours before i had to cut
			 her up  she was accepting of everything
			 then

	steckler stops talking carter waits

						steckler
			 i had to kill her she was rotten and
			 like my mother said  cut away the dead
			 wood or it will stop you doing what you
			 must do the world is a better place
			 without her you should understand
			 better than anyone

	carter draws her legs up under herself

						steckler
			 you are the first person i have ever
			 told any of this to we are birds of a
			 feather ellenwere in the same league

						carter
			 i dont think sothis isnt a game you
			 knowthere arent points or leagues
			 sure i killed my husband  but i am no
			 killer

						steckler
			 youve killed but youre not a killer

						carter
			 thats rightdont ever think that you
			 and i are the same  were not even
			 remotely similar i did what i had to do
			 for myself for my own self preservation
			  not to live out some bizarre role
			 playing fantasy my husband was sick 

	96	continued 3

						carter contd
			 he beat me up  he abused me  and i
			 just snapped

	there is a pause as carter gathers herself steckler waits patiently
	wanting more

						steckler
			 tell me how it happened

						carter
			 why should i

						steckler
			 why not please  it would help me

	carter waits for a moment  then opens up

						carter
			 theres not much to tell  i had just
			 won my prize for the book  and he hated
			 me for it he had hated the book he
			 hated my success for so long  so he
			 decided to make my life hell there are
			 things i cant tell you what he made me
			 do  things i couldnt tell anyone i
			 wanted a divorce but he said he wouldnt
			  then opportunity just popped uphe
			 was in the garage and i was in the
			 cari just let the clutch up  he
			 couldnt get out of the way i didnt
			 really mean to kill him just teach him
			 a lesson  i guess if i had been
			 thinking straighter i wouldnt have done
			 it i knew that if i was discovered i
			 would go to jail  even if it was
			 manslaughter i would do time  and any
			 time would have been too much  ive
			 seen what happens to people when they go
			 to prison  and what happens to them
			 when they get out i wasnt going to be
			 one of them

	it is a strange reversal steckler listening to the confessions of a
	killer both feel something 

						carter
			 i knew i had to get rid of the body  so
			 i strung him up in the bath slit his
			 throat and drained him  covered him in
			 salt  to avoid the rotting  and
			 bricked him up everyone believed me
			 when i told them he left the country  i

	96	continued 4

						carter contd
			 think they were glad he was gone
			 everyone except for that damn cop he
			 knows somehow he just knows

	steckler watches carter there is love and tenderness in his eyes

						carter
			 and i have never told that to anyone
			 before

	both carter and steckler smile

						steckler
			 and how did it feel to be rid of him

						carter
			 wonderful  like a great release  he
			 was a malignant cancer and i had to
			 remove him  the world is better without
			 him

	carters smile fades steckler looks at carter  their eyes do not break
	from each other as a silent message is transmitted


	97	ext day park  carter and steckler are walking through a huge london
	park the trees are spider like and bare  winter has really taken a
	grip

	there are a few other people around  joggers business men on lunch
	people just enjoying the break from the concrete nightmare surrounding
	this green haven

	steckler stops and turns to carter

						steckler
			 there is something special about this
			 place  the green  in destruction there
			 is creation  flesh rots to fertilise
			 the ground for life to thrive on

	carter and steckler stop steckler points out a patch of ground in
	front of him the grass slightly taller than everywhere else

						carter
			 looking and thinking what


											continued

	97	continued

						steckler
			 that is my wifenothing ever dies  it
			 just changes i changed my wife

	carter fumbles in her bag and retrieves her camera

						steckler
			 i come here every so often  to pay my
			 respects

	steckler turns to carter looking strangely different

						steckler
			 im weary ellen  of holding everything
			 inside of me  thats why i need this
			 book  in a few weeks it will be over 
			 the police will have me  i will make
			 you a lot of money and your career will
			 be back on track 

	carter thinks about his comment before turning her attention to her
	camera to take a photo  steckler looks at her questioningly

						carter
			 for the book

	we see down the lens of the camera steckler stood on the grassy mound
	carter focuses  then click the image freezes in black and white


	98	ext day park  a bunch of pigeons fight over a few morsels of food
	carter and steckler are sat on a park bench steckler tossing pieces of
	bread to the pigeons

	across the way a big lawyer sits talking on a portable phone  a
	bottle of perrier in his other

	carter has her camera and is taking a few portraits of steckler she
	moves about looking for the best shot

	the big lawyer opposite cannot take his eyes off carters legs and bum 
	it doesnt help as she is wearing a fairly short skirt and when she
	bends over

	the big lawyer laughs down the phone  he is obviously telling the
	person on the other end of the line what he is doing

	carter finishes her roll and sits back down


											continued

	98	continued

	steckler has finished with his bag of bread for the pigeons and looks
	over at a waste bin twenty yards away he spots a can under the bench
	and stretches to pick it uphe stands and wanders over to the bin

	carter wrestles with her camera which has jammed  but she finally gets
	it free she takes out the film and pockets it

	she looks up at the big lawyer who is blatantly staring at her legs he
	doesnt even look away when carter sees him

	suddenly from behind steckler appears and leans over close to the big
	lawyer carter watches on

	steckler leans close to the lawyer and whispers in his ear the lawyers
	face goes pale hurriedly he gathers his things and shuffles off

	steckler smiles to carter as he wanders back  a dont look at me
	expression written all over his face

	carter doesnt know how to react  grateful that her honour has been
	defended  but at the same time wishes it was someone else

	they walk off into the distance


	99	int night carters room  writing montage carter is writing furiously
	at her computer  we see her fingers working wonders  the letters just
	fly up on the screen we see her with her head in her hands desperate
	for inspiration  she fans herself with a piece of paper and steckler
	watches mesmerised by the sensuous display  and then carter is typing
	furiously once more

	photos are printed and scanned onto computer  we see the printer
	printing out pages of script

	at last ellen carter has begun writing once more carter shuffles a
	pile of papers  ten pages or so and looks at the cover

			 the secret diary of dr leslie raymond
			 steckler  introduction

	she places them down and looks at a small black and white photo of a
	stern looking woman and a lost little boy  steckler and his mother

	she examines closely  almost obsessed

	she places it down and begins writing looking at the computer
	screen

			 was a mistake  my natural mother was a
			 whore  that makes me

	steckler is beginning to crack up

						steckler
			 i want it to stop  it all to stop

						carter
			 then make it stop

	steckler looks up at carter  he believes in her


	102	int day living room  steckler sits at a table near the window reading
	the book silently carter sits nearby  nervous as hell steckler turns
	the page

	its just too intense for carter  she gets up and goes to the kitchen


	103	int day kitchen  carter fills the kettle up and reaches for the sugar
	she glances over her shoulder  steckler is still sat reading

	slowly she opens the sugar bowl  it is empty for a moment she
	deliberates what to do  before reaching under the sink to a remote
	spot and retrieving the ant poison

	at all time she nervously switches between what she is doing and where
	steckler is  her heart pounds as she fills the bowl up with sugar 
	and then mixes in the ant poison

	she glances over her shoulder  steckler is stood only two feet away 
	carter jumps  steckler holds up the book

						steckler
			 i need to talk to you

	unseen carter manages to slip the ant poison into a drawer behind her


	104	int day living room  carter and steckler sit down carter taking care
	of making the tea

	steckler looks a different man  the intensity and lines from his
	forehead gone he slumps in the chair rather than sits in an angular
	position

	the two look at each other for a long time before curiosity gets the
	better of carter

						carter
			 what

						steckler
			 i know this sounds insane ellen but
			 telling you all of this writing the
			 book it feels good dont get me
			 wrong  i feel like a weight is being
			 lifted from my shoulders when i tell
			 you what i have done  i cant believe
			 it is meyet i know it was this is
			 like a purging for me

						carter
			 psychiatrists would say that you are
			 confronting your demons

						steckler
			 demons this wouldnt have been
			 possible without you you have given
			 me incentive ellen  i can see clearer
			 now

	carter looks at steckler slightly differently  as a doctor would at a
	condemned patient who is showing miraculous signs of recovery

	steckler sits up and puts sugar into his tea  carter watches  a mass
	of confused emotions

						steckler
			 whats wrong

						carter
			 nothing could be better

	steckler takes a sip of his tea  its sweet

						steckler
			 i really must cut down on sugar  itll
			 be the death of me


	105	ext day stecklers surgery  it is a brisk winters day the street is
	busy the road packed with traffic

	the figure of a biker hurtles between the cars expertly weaving
	through them it is mik wearing her usual hip biker kit but with a
	tight white top

	she pulls up in front of the dentists grapples in her bag and
	retrieves a parcel she looks up checking the address  then smiles


	106	int day building foyer  she enters the building resting her bike up
	against the wall inside before running up the stairs


	107	int day dentist foyer  mik swaggers in and leans on the desk the
	secretary is there

						mik
			 is dr steckler here


	108	int day hallway  mik is leaning up against the wall when a door opens
	up at the end of the corridor steckler walks out his hands filled
	with bizarre instruments

						steckler
			 i thought it was you  how are you

						mik
			 im good  i was just making a delivery
			 near here so i thought i would see if
			 you were about

						steckler
			 yes come on in

						mik
			 no i cant ive got a million things to
			 deliver i just wanted to say thank you
			 for the other night  i know it all got
			 a little out of hand

	mik suddenly feels very awkward

						mik

	mik smiles

						mik
			 good  ive got to dash  cautiously
			 say that i said hello to ellen for me
			 would you

						steckler
			 yes  of course

	mik gives one last smile and turns to leave steckler does not move
	and watches her as she leaves the building


	109	int day building foyer  mik bounces down the stairs grabs her bike
	and exits as she does so she brushes up against someone entering

	inspector taylor looks up the stairs and begins his ascent


	110	int day dental surgery  steckler is in his surgery with janet
	examining x rays of teeth  the door opens and inspector pops his head
	in

						taylor

											continued

	110	continued

						janet

						steckler
			 how can i help scotland yard then

	steckler busies himself by washing his hands and sterilising his
	instruments as taylor talks

						steckler
			 i believe you live with a mrs ellen
			 carter

						steckler
			 mrs i thought her husband was dead

	taylors eyebrow raises and he moves into the room

						taylor

						steckler
			 or was it she wished he was dead 
			 thats it  i believe he left the
			 country with another woman  all rather
			 sordid

						taylor
			 so she didnt mention anything more
			 about it

						steckler
			 no  she isnt in any trouble is she

						taylor

	110	continued 2

						steckler
			 i shouldnt really  im not your
			 surgeon

						taylor
			 who said anything about surgeryitll
			 only take a moment

	steckler thinks to himself

						steckler
			 ok  just hop up

	taylor grins and climbs onto the dentists chair leaning back steckler
	moves behind him he takes taylors head and moves his head right back
	exposing his throat and mouth

						steckler
			 now open wide

	steckler looks down at his tray of weapons  a scalpel glistens at
	him for a moment his hand hovers before he takes a probe and mirror

	he inserts them in taylors mouth and conducts his examination

						steckler
			 mmm yes  there is a cavity here just
			 tell me if this hurts

	without any more warning steckler jabs very hard on taylors tooth
	taylor jumps and cries out in pain steckler retracts his instruments
	and taylor closes his mouth

						taylor
			 bloody hell now i remember why i didnt
			 want to go to the dentist

	he clambers from the chairholding his mouth

						steckler
			 you really should have that filled

	once more the painful sound of the drill from the surgery next door
	screams through

						taylor
			 thanks for your time  dr steckler


											continued

	110	continued 3

	he turns on his heel and exits nursing a very numb and sore mouth

	steckler smiles to himself  serves him right


	111	ext night stairway  once more steckler is locking up his surgery he
	descends the iron fire escape and into the alley way


	112	ext night shop front  stecklers eyes find a way to the shop front and
	the collection of the shop dummies  especially the one wearing the
	white dress steckler hears a noise behind himself


	113	ext night alleyway  once more the street punk is hassling a girl 
	steckler walks briskly up

	the street punk has a knife in his left hand his right bandaged  he
	demands her purse  but she wont give viscously he lashes out with
	the blade cutting the womans leg  she shrieks out in pain before
	relinquishing her purse

	the punk picks it up just as steckler moves out of the shadows 

	the punk turns round brandishing his blade

						street punk
			 you got a prob

	steckler steps out of the shadows the punks face drops  without
	warning he spins on his heel and runs for his life

	steckler smiles  amused by him he turns his attention to the girl on
	the floor


	steckler turns to the woman who is lying amongst some old card boxes
	blood seeping out over her clothes from the cut on her leg

	she looks up at steckler as though he were lancelot

						steckler
			 im a doctor  my surgery is just around
			 the corner


	114	int day stecklers surgery  the door opens into darkness as steckler
	helps the girl mary in an alarm beeper sounds he flicks on the
	lights and the flourescents illuminate a cold and clinical room  a
	modern torture chamber for some


	114	continued

						steckler
			 ill just turn off the alarm

	steckler disappears off around the corner and down a hallway pulling
	keys from his pocket

	mary limps into the room  her eyes fixed on an array of tools probes
	scalpels  all bright silver and very nasty

	the alarm sound stops there is a distant crash of something falling
	to the floor

	silence

						mary
			 hello

	silence

						mary
			 getting nervous hello

	suddenly steckler appears behind her putting his hand on her shoulder
	 she jumps a little

						steckler
			 sorry about that  lets get you up
			 here

	he helps her onto the chair blood freely seeps from a wound on her
	upper thigh

						mary
			 i dont know how to thank you  i think
			 he was going to rape or kill me

						steckler
			 if i were you id stick to daylight and
			 wide open spaces from now on  lets get
			 this off

	steckler helps the woman remove her jogging trousers she winces and
	groans as he does so steckler inspects the wound

						steckler
			 its not bad  it looks a lot worse than
			 it is you probably wont need
			 stitches


											continued

	114	continued 2

	he takes a swab and wipes away the blood the wound can clearly be seen
	and it looks pitifully small

						mary
			 is that it some war wound that turned
			 out to be

	steckler laughs

	he takes a swab and makes her hold it on the wound

						steckler
			 this will stop it making too much of a
			 mess

						mary
			 im terribly sorry

						steckler
			 dont mention it

	his eyes wander up her leg  to her pants  white and very skimpy he
	takes an involuntary deep breath her rather unflattering position one
	leg on and one leg off the chair strikes a sexual image that runs
	shivers down stecklers spine

						steckler
			 ill call a taxi and make some tea while
			 you wait


	115	int night utility room  steckler stands in a plume of wild steam from
	the kettle spout his eyes fixed and unmoving on his tool box  a
	hammer sits atop


	116	int night surgery  steckler enters with a tray and one cup of tea he
	places it on the steel table next to the chair and the woman who has
	now covered herself up

	she looks up from her bloody wound and smiles

						mary
			 thank you  but dont you want a cup

	for a long time steckler hovers behind her  not saying anything


											continued

	116	continued

						steckler
			 no im not thirsty thank you i called
			 a taxi  they are very good here  he
			 should be here very

	there is a beep beep outside both mary and steckler smile at the
	timing she stands

						mary
			 thats not too bad 

	she turns to steckler

						mary
			 i dont know how to thank you  you have
			 been so kind  if only more people in
			 the world could be more like you

	she moves closer and lightly kisses him on the cheekshe extends her
	hand

						mary
			 im mary stanley  nice to meet you

						steckler
			 smiles leslie steckler

	she turns and exits the surgery


	117	extint night streetsurgery  mary climbs into the taxi and waves as
	it pulls away

	steckler returns the wave

	he turns and walks over to his chair and lies back in it  a little
	like a psychiatrists chair he sips her tea slowly he raises his arm
	up  he is holding the hammer he rests it on his chest

	fade to black


	118	ext day shop front  we see the shop front slowly we move into the
	window which has the three dummies display the centre dummy which was
	wearing the white dress is being undressed by a shop assistant


	119	int night living room  cut to a huge close up of the tv screen
	steckler cannot speak  something holds him back  we move from the
	camera to him 


	119	continued

						steckler
			 turn it off  i cant handle that thing
			 anymore

	carter turns off the machine  she senses something is different 
	steckler moves forward craving human intimacy

						carter
			 whats wrong

						steckler
			 i am ashamed of what i have done ellen
			 when i read what you had written it made

						steckler
			 you dont disappoint or let me down
			 ellen i want the woman who helped me
			 put the past behind me by my side  if
			 she will have me for the short time i
			 have left

	carter sits silent and dumfounded

	steckler produces a large box gift wrapped he passes it to carter 

						carter
			 what is it

						steckler
			 open it

	with trepidation carter opens the box she discovers the white dress
	from the shop window beautifully folded with a pair of matching
	shoes

						carter
			 you want me to wear this for you


											continued

	119	continued 2

						steckler
			 yes

						carter

						carter
			 but for how long  what will set you off
			 again youll be walking down the street
			 and some girl will be wearing a white
			 hat  and that will be it  back on the
			 merry go round

	carter stands  completely engulfed in disbelief and anger

						carter
			 you cant just flush your past down the
			 toilet of life  you want a second
			 chance  what about the girls you killed
			  did they have a second chance  no 
			 because you killed them and im good to

			 youve got me by the short and curlies 
			 i dont have a choice either i go to
			 jail or to the grave in answer to your
			 question leslie  no i wont have you
			 never

	she picks up the package and tosses it back to steckler the contents
	spill out all over the floor

	carter storms out to the kitchen

	steckler slowly retrieves all his gifts replacing them in the box  he
	is deeply hurt


	120	int night kitchen  carter is shaking  she quickly lights a cigarette
	to calm her

	steckler walks out of the living room and collects his jacket from
	behind the door


											continued

	120	continued

	suddenly hit by doubt and worry carter turns to him as he exits

						carter
			 where are you going

						steckler
			 out  i may be some time

	steckler leaves

						carter
			 wait leslieii


	121	int night carters bedroom  carter is sat at her desk flipping through
	notes a huge pile is stacked by her the word research scribbled
	across it  and a bottle of vodka to its side

	she sits back reading a photocopy of a newspaper article titled what
	ever happened to the modern serial killer

	she looks at the photos of modern mass murderers  sketches of others
	one in particular grabs her eye the inscription below reads the
	french hillside slasher

	carters eyes wander down the article

						carters voice
			 and what of those killers which
			 stopped there have been many documented
			 serial killers who merely ended their
			 reign of terror  jack the ripper being
			 one of the most sensational others the
			 french hillside slasher  took nineteen
			 lives then mysteriously stopped what
			 happened to him  did he die was he
			 arrested and jailed for other charges
			 did he leave the country  or was his
			 carnal need fulfilled  his anger
			 discharged only he will ever know

	carter looks up from her article thinking


	122	int night hallway  the front door slams and steckler briskly walks
	into the kitchen pausing only to hang his jacket up

	carter walks down the stairs


	123	int kitchen night  steckler is washing his hands in the kitchen sink
	when carter enters from behind she leans up against the door frame 
	pausing for the right moment to speak

						steckler
			 weve got nothing to talk about

						carter
			 leslie im sorry  i  i didnt know
			 what to think

	steckler turns round

						steckler
			 i thought we had a relationship built on
			 trust  and you just slap me in the
			 face

						carter
			 long pause i am sorry

	there is a long pause as steckler shuffles his feet looking at the
	floor like a little lost boy

						carter
			 leslie he looks up is that good
			 enough

						steckler
			 yes  i suppose so

	the tension breaks

						carter
			 its late and ive had too much to
			 drink i cant think straight now 
			 well talk about it in the morning

	carter turns and walks out

						steckler
			 ellen

	carter turns back

						steckler
			 i have stopped  you must believe me

	a smile breaks out on carters face


											continued

	123	continued

						carter
			 yes  i believe i do

	she turns and walks back out  steckler watches  his face shows long
	furrowed lines of familiar stress


	124	int night hallway  carter walks into the hallway and is about to walk
	upstairs when she spots stecklers jacket crumpled on the floor  it
	must have fallen from the hook

	she leans over to pick it up  but as she does so she notices
	something on the floor underneath

	she leans over and picks up a pair of biker glasses crackedthey are
	miks glasses

	carter rummages in stecklers pocket and withdraws a handkerchief 
	covered in blood

	carters eyes widen in horror  she was so close to believing it all 
	and she would have probably been persuaded to wear the dress and
	what would have happened to her

	steckler shuffles about in the kitchen before walking into the living
	room  the tv turns on

	she places the coat back on the hook  a panic running through her
	what can she do

	she regains her composure

	slowly she moves over to the telephone and gently picks up the
	receiver she keeps her eye on the living room door at all times  not
	daring to breathe

	she flips open her address book and looks up the name deklan sure
	enough it is there with miks fella scrawled after it

	she dials the number and waits for it to ring and ring and ring  but
	noone answers

	carter holds the phone to her chest  she was nearly so very wrong

	125	int night carters bedroom  carter lies asleep in her bed  the
	moonlight picking out the curves of her body she is sweaty and looks
	like she has been very restless


											continued

	125	continued

	there is a quiet picking at the door before it silently swings open
	steckler is stood there in his vest and trousers he steps into the
	moonlight his eyes black

	he leans close to carter caressing her body  an inch above her skin
	he knows he cannot touch her though

	as silently as he had entered he leaves

	as the door clicks shut carters eyes flicker open  there is a loud
	click from near her head as we see her gun which she grips firmly under
	her pillow

	she sits up looking round she clambers out of the bed and slips on
	her jeans and a jumper she jams her gun into her belt grabs a jacket
	and opens the window

	slowly she climbs out slipping and sliding but just managing to hold
	on she clambers down the drain pipe and is on ground level in a flash


	126	ext night tower block  the night is cold  the streets deserted
	carter appears outside a huge block of flats  an urban monstrosity

	she checks a piece of paper and looks upwards at them


	127	ext night corridor  carter walks along an external corridor looking
	for flat number 80 she finds it

	on the door the sign mik and deklan is written in colorful lettering
	carter knocks on the door but as expected there is no answer

	she takes a torch from her back pocket and shines it in through the
	letter box trying to see in she looks through a small window at the
	side of the door she cant see much just a table overturned but its
	enough

	she looks round and finds a brick she heaves it and crashes it through
	the window she leans her arm in and unlatches the door from the
	inside


	128	int night mik and deklans flat  carter shuts the door behind her and
	switches on the lights she walks past a photo of herself and mik taken
	last year  the tv still buzzes silently

	as she had seen a table is overturnedand a chair


											continued

	128	continued

	she moves further into the room  suddenly she sees it her hand
	involuntarily clasping her mouth

	a large pool of blood stains the light carpet  an electric knife lying
	at its side dried blood dulls its blade


	129	ext night garden  steckler is stood in the garden a fire raging
	before him at his feet is a box filled with press clippings articles
	paperand video tapes computer disks

	he picks up the fist lot  a computer disk titled introductionhe
	tosses it on the fire he takes the pages of ellens book looks at
	them before sending them on their way

	he watches the flames as he pulls the tape from video cassettes 
	eventually sending them to the conflagration


	130	int night hallway  carter silently lets herself back in at 66 acacia
	avenue slowly she moves through the house and to the stairs when she
	notices a slight flickering on the walls of the room

	she moves over to the window to take a look out back

	to her horror she sees steckler filling in a hole in the garden he
	digs hard with his spade and his job is almost done a small fire
	flickers and steckler goes over to it dropping some paper onto it

	suddenly he turns and walks straight for the house and the doorway
	carter panics not knowing what to do she looks round for somewhere to
	hide 

	steckler is still advancing

	and it is too late the door opens and steckler enters with the spade
	in his hand

	he closes the door behind himself  carter is nowhere to be seen
	steckler places the spade down and opens the fridge taking out a
	bottle of milk

	the light illuminates the area  and carter who is hiding close up to
	a cupboard  her eyes are wide as she is frozen to the spot

	steckler closes the fridge door and slowly exits walking up the
	stairs


											continued

	130	continued

	carter takes a silent but deep breath


	131	ext day street  carter dressed in jeans and a jacket walks
	determinedly down a street packed with people there is a resolution
	about herself


	132	ext day public loos  carter enters some public loos


	133	int day loos  carter enters one of the little cubicles once inside
	she begins to strip off  and changes into a bright and skimpy dress
	with black tights stilettoes she dons heavy makeup and wears a pair
	of brightly coloured glasses she looks very girlie

	satisfied she picks up her bag and exits


	134	ext day bank  carter arrives in her costume outside the bank she
	checks a piece of paper  a bank statement with a curious logo the
	same one that she found in stecklers box

	she enters


	135	int day bank managers office  carter sits before the bank manager

						carter

						carter
			 yes  its about bank safety deposit

	the manager smiles nervously  she is a good looking girl he takes
	off his glasses and pockets them

						manager
			 well miss tandy  its not our policy to
			 show people round  but if you were a
			 potential client  that would be a
			 different matter

			 before we close then i could show you
			 everything and going for it then we

	smile begins to fade when suddenly carter smiles broadly

						carter
			 thats very kind of you mr griffiths

						manager
			 brian

						carter
			 but  if you could show me round now 
			 and ill meet you later

	the manager is about to object when carter crosses her legs  exposing
	a tantalising bit of thigh  the manager is caught hook line and
	sinker


	136	int day vault  carter and he stand in the vault a vast array of
	safety deposit boxes reach high up above

						manager

	and hip

						manager
			 and these are the keys  one for you 
			 and one for me

	he passes carter one

						manager
			 we insert together  and out it comes

	they both laugh as the box comes out of the wall  shes fully aware of
	his game and playing along with it


	137	int day viewing room  the manager and carter step into a cramped
	viewing room with a small table

						carter
			 and this is where the client can view
			 their contents in private

	she brushes lightly over the manager

						carter
			 its cramped in here isnt it brian

						manager
			 clears throat yes it is

						carter
			 tell me brian what would happen if the
			 client lost the key

						manager
			 then we would have to call in our
			 locksmith to break the lock

						carter
			 so there is only one key

						manager
			 thats right

						carter
			 and it cant be forged

						manager
			 i didnt say that  im sure it could
			 be but our clients must sign in first
			 checking signatures and a photo ident 
			 we had a nasty theft two years ago and
			 weve been very strict since then

	the manager is obviously getting rather aroused  he glances at his
	watchcarter is distant and in serious thought

						manager

			 your face when i gave some to that
			 detective  whats wrong ellen  you
			 look pale  maybe you have been eating
			 the wrong kind of foods lately  it
			 could be food poisoning

	carter suddenly feels sweaty and sickened  she involuntarily takes a
	deep breath holding her throat

	steckler lurches for carter grabbing her by the throat and holding her
	hard

						steckler
			 i thought you believed me oh dont
			 worry ellen i poured the ant poison
			 down the drain  i just wanted you to
			 know what it felt like when i found out
			  unpleasant isnt it

	carter rummages in her bag pulling out her kitchen knife she has kept
	with her

	she is absolutely bubbling with anger  but she channels

	she holds the knife to stecklers throat  steckler loosens his grip on
	carter  she looks real mad  almost insane

						carter
			 whispering i could kill you now 
			 noone would ever know  i would have
			 won already  unpleasant isnt it

	carter breaks away  the tension leaving  she drops the knife to the
	floor

	steckler is shaking now  but he still manages a defiant remark


											continued

	140	continued 4

						steckler
			 you couldnt do it  its not because
			 you cant kill  its the not knowing 
			 if the bank would send my package  what
			 would you do when the police come
			 knocking

	carter turns on the spot 

						carter
			 dont be so sure

	carter exits steckler calling out behind her  suddenly unsure of
	his position

						steckler
			 turns and steps forward i love you
			 ellen i would never hurt you


	141	int night forensic lab  the computer is still ticking down  like a
	time bomb the screen reads 67 done


	142	int morning hallway  carter exits her bedroom and walks to the
	bathroom she is a mess her hair unkempt  she looks like she has been
	driven over by a bus

	the sound of steckler having a shower can be heard she walks past the
	bathroom glancing at it the door is slightly open she spots steckler
	stood behind the curtain  showering

	then she spots it  her last chance for salvation the key  the bank
	key its hanging from the razor light of the wall


	143	int day carters bedroom  carter enters her bedroom and closes the door
	behind her she rummages on top of her cabinet and finds what she is
	looking for  an tiny odd looking metal case which opens up to reveal
	two slabs of putty

	she turns round and throws off her robe and crumpled bed shirt  she
	rummages through her drawers  her hand hovers over a white shirt
	before she decides for a striped shirt  light in colour but not
	white she slips it on  it is very tight and low cut  sexy but not
	too provocative

	she puts her robe back on and pauses for a beat  she takes a long hard
	breath


	144	int day bathroom  carter enters the bathroom  she stops dead in her
	tracks surprised steckler stands in the shower  totally naked

						carter
			 oh  im sorry  i didnt realise you
			 were

	carter involuntarily glances at the key  steckler is frozen to the
	spot

	carter turns to exit  but stops

						carter
			 leslie  about you and me  ive been
			 thinking about what you said

	she turns back to steckler  he is still rooted to the spot she
	advances on himher bath robe loosened provocatively

	still steckler does not move 

						carter
			 maybe i have been fooling myself  i
			 really dont know

	she waits for a reply  but none comes  steckler still silent in the
	shower water splashing off his face he is like a teenager on a
	first date  and its getting hot and heavy way too fast

	carter realises she is going to have to take the lead  she takes
	another step forward loosening her robe until it drops to the floor 
	her long slender legs are completely exposed steckler glances down
	carter smiles as she lifts her arm up to touch stecklers face  he
	winces as she does so but carters touch is soothing

						carter
			 what do you say

	carter glances at the key  it is directly adjacent  somehow she is
	going to have to get his back turned to the key

	in her left hand the small metallic case nestles unseen

	carter steps into the bath tub  into the shower

	steckler is wide eyed  he hesitates before kissing her  it is awkward
	and rather unimpassioned

	steckler draws back looking at carter  she smiles at him he moves to
	kiss her again but carter diverts his kiss to her neck suddenly
	steckler gives in he begins kissing and licking her neck
	passionately

	144	continued

	carter reaches out for the key  but cant quiet reach  she pushes her
	body up against him so as to get closer to the key

	her hands reach out further and she clasps the chain quickly she
	opens up the case and makes two impressions of the key in the putty 
	water splashes everywhere as steckler becomes more aroused

	slowly carter closes the case and slips it in between a plant pot and
	the wall on a shelf

	she reaches out with the key  she is just about to replace it when
	steckler pushes her backwards looking her in the eye  he kisses her
	passionately on the mouth and she has no choice but to give in slowly
	she tries to edge her way back stecklers hands all over her body her
	back her breasts her shirt clings to her soaked body as steckler
	moves down on herkissing her tummy his hands caressing her rear

	she reaches harder  but still cannot get the key to its hook

	stecklers hands move up carters inner thigh  higher  higher  her
	eyes widen as she makes a herculean effort  and gets the key on its
	hook

	instantly she moves back  anxious not to look too obvious yet trying
	to get him off her as quick as she can

	she takes his hands kissing them  he forces to her breast but slowly
	she pulls away smiling to him she steps from the shower

	steckler is absolutely dumbstruck 

						steckler
			 whats wrongwhat have i done wrong

						carter
			 nothing leslie  i just think we should
			 wait

						steckler
			 exploding wait for what

	carter jumps at stecklers outburst

						steckler
			 what do you want its not fair

	carter is obviously scared  but she tries her best


											continued

	144	continued 2

						carter
			 leslie thats not the way grown adults
			 act 

	she steps forward  she takes a towel and dries him

						carter
			 they understand each other  the time
			 isnt right  tonight will be right  i
			 have some woman things to take care of
			 before we do anything

	steckler looks confused

						carter
			 tonight will be the night  mothering
			 now get dressed and get off to work

	steckler obeys and begins drying himself off

	carter exits steckler stands in the shower for a moment before
	climbing out and grasping his key putting it round his neck he looks
	at the steamed up mirror and wipes a tiny bit away  he looks at his
	reflection


	145	ext day 66 acacia avenue  carter stands at the front door as steckler
	leaves pulling out of the drive

	she smiles and waves goodbye  he waves back and then he is gone
	down the street carters smile soon disappears


	146	int day hallwaybathroom  she enters the bathroom and snatches the key
	imprints from the shelf  she examines them  two perfect
	impressions


	147	int day carters roomstecklers room  kitting up montage we see

	the living room


	149	int day carters room  kitting up montage carter puts heavy makeup
	on looking at a photo of steckler and his wife she changes into
	clothes which look similar and puts the wig on finally she puts a
	pair of dark sunglasses on


	150	ext day 66 acacia avenue  for all intents and purpose mrs l steckler
	leaves the house


	151	ext day bank  carter appears outside the bank  takes a deep breath
	and walks in


	152	int day bank foyer  once inside the bank carter is plunged into a
	tunnel her heart pounds everyone moves in slow motion there is
	silence aside from the pounding of her heart and her own heavy
	footsteps

	she sees guards which she didnt see last time

	everyone is looking at her  or are they

	slowly she walks toward the counter and the teller girl

						teller girl
			 may i help you

	carter does not answer  she is fighting the urge to turn and leave
	now

						teller girl
			 may i help you

	carter speaks up in a perfect english voice

						carter
			 producing key yes i would like to
			 open my safety deposit box please my
			 name is angela steckler mrs

	the girl takes the key and scribbles down her name

						teller girl
			 one moment please

	she disappears across the room carter looks round at the bank the
	doors the cameras the alarms

	she looks over to where the girl went to her horror she sees her
	talking to the manager the manager nods to the girl and looks over at
	carter carter instantly looks away adjusting her glasses maybe she
	should cut her losses and run


	152	continued

	but its too late  the manager is walking over

						manager
			 hello mrs steckler  we havent seen you
			 for a long time

						carter
			 no  ive been abroad for a long time

	the manager busies himself with paperwork

						manager
			 there have been some changes since you
			 were last here  we now require a
			 signature

	the manager produces a pen and form  waiting for carter to sign  he
	obviously thinks something is wrong

						manager

			 remind me of someone i know

						carter
			 oh really  you must remember me from
			 when i was a regular customer

						manager
			 i wasnt a manager here then mrs
			 steckler  dont you remember

						carter

	carter takes the pen and produces a signature

						manager
			 no  its someone i met recently

	the manager picks it up smiling he compares it with the specimen
	signature he has  he examines for what seems to be an age

	he then checks a passport size photo against carter

						manager
			 could you remove your sunglasses please


											continued

	152	continued 2

	slowly carter removes her sunglasses  looking him squarely in the
	face the manager looks down at the photo once more

						manager
			 fine  could you follow me mrs steckler

	the manager leads her round to a big steel door which he opens carter
	realises that she is effectively walking into a prison  but she has no
	choice


	153	int day deposit bank  the manager takes both keys and locates the
	safety deposit box he looks at carters key

						manager
			 this must be one of the old keys 

						carter
			 yes  i have had it for years

	the manager slots the keys into the keyhole and slowly turns carters
	hair is standing on end  will the key work

	there is a little resistance before  click

	the manager smiles at carter


	154	int day viewing cubicle  carter puts the box on the desk in her
	private viewing room and eagerly opens it up

	as she had hoped there is a map a polaroid etc inside there are also
	more grisly items  small bottles with body parts embalmed in them

	she empties the entire contents into her bag


	155	ext day bridge  carter walks across a bridge which spans a river she
	pauses for a beat before glancing each way  its clear  she picks up
	two bricks dumping them in the bag she feels the weight before
	heaving it over the side and tossing it into the river

	it disappears without trace


	156	int night hallway  the doorway opens and steckler steps in holding a
	bunch of flowers and a bottle of wine


											continued

	156	continued

	confused steckler tries to switch on the lights  but they dont work
	he enters light from outside lamps casting huge shadows

						steckler
			 ellen ellen im home

	but there is no answer confused he places the wine down on a table
	and continues into the house

						steckler
			 ellen are you there

	there is a slight noise coming from the kitchen  and light too
	steckler heads for it


	157	int night kitchen  steckler steps into the kitchen doorway there is a
	woman with her back turned to him doing house work

	slowly the woman turns round stecklers face is filled with fright as
	he sees his wife 

						steckler
			 angela it cant be  i killed you

	carter raises the gun pulling the wig off

	without warning she lets fly several rounds  but the gun jams
	steckler is hit squarely in the shoulder blood spraying all over the
	wall

	he falls back into the darkness

	carter wrestles with the gun  finally getting it to cock she moves
	swiftly to the door where stecklers body lay  but he is gone
	suddenly the shadows hold more than fear  they hold steckler

	as if on cue  the kitchen light goes out  carter is left in the
	darkness  her heart pounding

						voice of steckler
			 ellen  why are you trying to hurt me
			 why have you gone mad

						carter
			 screaming shut up you sick fuck

	she steps forward becoming the hunter


											continued

	157	continued

						steckler
			 i dont want either of us to come to any
			 harm  please

						carter
			 you killed my friend

	carter suddenly sees steckler in the shadows  aims and fires a full
	clip at him

	the mirror shatters  carter realises she was shooting at a reflection
	she ejects the clip and nervously inserts the next

	her body is trembling with fear

						steckler
			 please ellen  put the gun down

	she walks down the hallway  each step feeling like a million miles


	158	int night kitchen  we see a hand grip around a pair of scissors
	steckler doesnt look too good  blood and sweat streaked he opens a
	cupboard and rummages around he finds what he needs some pain
	killers he unscrews the jar cracking open several tablets and pouring
	the powder onto his hand

	he rubs it into his shoulder wound  he screams out in mortal agony 


	159	int night hallway  carter spins round pointing the gun she is
	suddenly completely afraid  her breathing is laboured if she doesnt
	calm down shes going to give herself away

	she waits silence

	suddenly steckler hurls himself from the darkness at carter  her gun
	is knocked from her hand and spins off behind her

	steckler lands heavily on her  his eyes wild they tumble backwards
	brawling on the floor carter screams out in pain as her leg doubles
	over a loud cracking sound can be heard

	her hands grapple in the darkness and she finds a door stop

	she grabs it swinging it hard and hitting steckler on the head
	steckler slumps backward dazed but alive


											continued

	159	continued

	carter drags herself back to the shadows where the gun fell

	she searches for it  discovering it under a small telephone stool

	she snatches it cocking it

	steckler looks up and sees carter with the gun with incredible agility
	and silence he leaps for the doorway and is back in the shadows before
	carter can aim

	carter points the gun out  her back to the wall for the moment she is
	relatively safebut only for the moment

	she bends her leg back fighting to contain the pain

	she grapples with the gun once more  it is jammed she ejects the
	unspent bullet to the floor her clip is now empty she ejects it and
	discovers the reason for the jam  the clips spring hangs out
	loosely she has no bullets left


	160	int night living room  carter crawls into the living room to the
	cabinet on top of which she hid the last clip

	she tries to climb up to reach it but she cannot

	she looks round  the settee  she plunges her arm down and retrieves
	the knife she sits back to take a breath  at all times looking round
	she looks into the kitchen and spots the empty clip she used earlier

	she looks round at the telephone stool  and spots the unused bullet
	she ejected

	she has an idea 112she slides the knife into her pocket like a
	sheath


	161	int night carters room  we see the white of carters dress which
	steckler had bought for her  a droplet of blood falls onto it we pull
	wider to reveal stockings stilettoes and a hatall neatly arranged
	on the bed in the form of a woman lying down

	steckler stands above it  blood dripping down his arm which grasps a
	pair of scissors


	162	int night hallway  carter fumbles for the bullet on the floor she
	grasps it and instantly begins to crawl to the kitchen  to the bullet
	clip and her only hope


	163	int night carter room  steckler is stood over the bed slowly he looks
	over his shoulder


	164	int night kitchen  carter has made it to the kitchen she rests up
	against the cabinet and fumbles with the clip

	there is a movement in front of her  way down the hall she sees
	steckler  the glint of scissors in his hand his grip tightens as he
	begins to walk toward her

	she fumbles with the bullet getting it into the clip but it wont
	go she begins to climb to her feet

	steckler begins to walk faster

	the bullet slips in and carter rams the clip into the gun standing
	erect with the aid of the cabinet behind

	steckler is getting closer and moving faster  his eyes wild

	carter racks the gun but it jams  she looks up in horror  steckler
	is almost upon her she racks hardertears of frustration and
	terror in her eyes

						carter
			 to gun come on

	the gun goes off hitting carter in her leg a huge gout of blood
	spatters to the floorshe screams in pain  steckler in anger

	and it is too late  steckler is upon her

	he crashes into her grabbing her by the lapels and she drops the gun
	he looks at her sympathetically before kissing her carter offers no
	resistance  she is a beaten woman

						steckler
			 i loved you ellen  why did you do this

						carter
			 its what you would do to me

	carter remembers the knife in her pocket her fingers slide around the
	handle and she pulls it out she stabs steckler in the back but it
	doesnt go in very far steckler winces in pain  then smiles

						steckler
			 smiling pain is an illusion


											continued

	164	continued

	steckler steps back bringing up the scissors carter sees her moment
	his feet tangled in the rug below

	she raises her arm  steckler confused she caresses his face gently
	before giving him a slight push backwards steckler tries to balance
	himself but his feet wont let him

	he begins to topple backwards his arms flailing out for something to
	grab onto  but there is nothing with gathering speed he falls back 
	arcing like a huge statue

	the knife still in his back impacts with the floor and is driven right
	though his body

	stecklers body twitches life ebbs away

	carter slumps to the floor  her vision blurring she passes out


	165	int night hospital  carters eyes flicker open her face has been
	cleaned as she rests on white hospital pillows and sheets she looks up
	seeing the round examination light above  her focus clears and she
	frowns

	she realises that she is in no hospital  she is strapped into her own
	living room chair which has been dragged into the kitchen her wound
	has been dressed and cleaned  but her waist ankles and wrists are
	bound and she is wearing the white dress blood smeared and dirty
	now

	the door swings open and steckler shuffles in  the image of death and
	evil incarnate his face is pale smeared with bizarre makeup
	eyeshadow blusher and mascara  an image of pathetic misguided
	sexuality he is drained of blood his shirt red and clammy

	he carries a bizarre canister and some silver tools which carter seems
	to recognise she realises that they are the dentistry tools steckler
	had in his room

	carter writhes  but she is firmly strapped

	steckler shuffles over his head moving loosely on his shoulders

	carter manages to get a finger free on her right handshe gently
	works on a second

	steckler smiles to her his voice is deep and gurgling as his lungs
	have begun to fill with blood


											continued


	165	continued

						steckler
			 i had a look while you were asleep
			 pause  i think that i am going to
			 have to have two root canals done

	he raises his hand the drill whirring into terrifying life

	carter has to think fastshe smiles as best she can and opens her
	legs as much as the straps will allow

						carter
			 dont you want me now leslie

						steckler
			 no  ill have you after

	steckler steps forward  carter violently writhing and trying to get
	free  she manages another finger

	steckler produces another strap which he uses to hold down her head
	steckler leans forward bringing the drill up close

						steckler
			 open wide

	but carter wont open her mouth steckler doesnt bother he rams the
	drill into her lips carter screams out in pain as steckler inserts
	the drill into her mouth blood spurts as she violently battles to get
	free

	steckler withdraws he begins to change the drill bit  to a
	miniature rotary saw blade

						steckler
			 this one is used for cutting through
			 tooth and bone

	he turns the blade whirring carter manages to get her arm free and
	punches steckler in the bullet wound he screams out recoiling and
	dropping his whirring drill it lands on carter and dances around like
	a man snake carter grabs it and cuts her other arm free  then her
	legs

	but steckler is soon back grabbing her around the throat  carter
	topples him over and he lands on the chair  the whirring drill between
	them

	carter is stronger and the tip of the blade begins to cut into
	stecklers nose a fine spray of crimson spattering stecklers face


											continued

	165	continued 2

	steckler manages an enormous push throwing carter to the floor dazing
	her

	he turns round and reaches behind the chair he produces a large axe
	brandishing it maniacally 

						steckler
			 i always wanted to do it this way

	he raises the axe high above carter the house begins to rumble as a
	jet climbs overhead for a moment steckler is distracted

	carter spots the spade which steckler had buried his victims in the
	garden with she leaps for it grabbing it and swinging it

	stecklers eyes widen

	the spade impacts with stecklers head  his head separates from his
	body spinning through infinity


	166	int day living room  carter has bandaged herself up and fashioned a
	makeshift splint for her leg

	she is bricking up the hole in her living room wall  stecklers corpse
	is dumped unceremoniously in it

	she pushes the last brick into place

	the doorbell rings


	167	intext day hallway  carter opens the front door after covering
	herself and her leg with a bathrobe

	her eyes widen  it is mik dressed in black with dark glasses  she
	holds out a bunch of flowers

						mik

	carter begins to look more distant  her eyes wandering over to the
	bricked up wall

						mik

			  you know  to make matters worse some
			 bastard broke into our flat the other
			 day  the police came round to

	mik continues talking about her inane life  carters eyes glazed
	wander over to the window  miks voice tails off to a non existent
	echo


	169	int day 66 acacia avenue  slowly we move backwards  carter sits
	looking out of the window

	we track back through her back garden it is very pretty very normal
	a small dog hurriedly digs at something in the rose patcha hand and
	a foot can be seen  and the puffed up half rotted face of the street
	girl who steckler brought back
