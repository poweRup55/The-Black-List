super  a true story  mystic harbor connecticut 1994

credits over

wind on the water  soaring gulls and sand pipers glide
over the pilings and sagging bulkheads

          though i hadnt seen or spoken to
          sheldrake in over thirty years it
          seemed impossible that his heart was
          the thing that had finally failed
          him


int  late model car  same

chuck gieg 49 thin windswept and handsome is behind
the wheel  he pulls down a narrow cobble stone street
that leads to the wharf

                         older chuck vo
          i never got close to him nobody
          did  but by the time we made tampa
          i was sure i knew who he was that i
          understood what he saw what
          nourished his soul and tested his
          faith


ext  wharf  day

chuck stares out across the harbor  in the distance the
echoes of singing masts  shrouds and canvas softly ping
the small boats of mystic tug restlessly at their
moorings

                         older chuck vo
          he had taken us to worship where
          what was for him the holiest of
          holies  and for us too by the
          end


ext  doctors office  later

chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of
people  they surround a small building a neighborhood
clinic  a worn gray stone long in the earth dedicates
the structure

         in memory of natalie alice sheldrake md
          captains wife and ships surgeon of the
             brigantine albatross  may 2 1961

next to the stone a funeral urn  a young minister gropes
for meaning

                         minister
          i didnt know richard sheldrake
          personally but his many friends who
          knew and worked with him wanted to
          make sure that he was returned home
          here to be remembered with his
          beloved wife

chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor the ministers voice
fading away  the afternoon wind is coming up with the
tide  he quietly heads towards the water  drifting
drawn lost

                         older chuck vo
          though he had moved on with his
          life now even for the years to
          hear him eulogized by strangers
          seemed strange  he had been a
          hewner of stones a pilot by the
          silent stars  like me alone among
          many  but most of all for us the
          crew of the brigantine albatross he
          was always and would forever be
          our skipper

a ships bell turns him around  ding ding  ding ding  a
beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips
into port  a picture out of another time another place
it takes him away

                                            dissolve to

ext  forest  water tower  day

a towering monolith surrounded by tall oaks and
sycamores  the tower is immense  a single ladder runs up
to the top

at the top

just above the tree tops the view is spectacular  chuck
gieg 16 sits thin and unsteady  chucks gaze is drawn
upward  to the building spring cumulus clouds  chucks
older brother will 18 stout self assured pulls himself
to the top

                         will

                         tod
          to tell you the truth i think it
          was her father

at the top of a hill the harbor comes into view

                         rick
          well gentlemen there she is

the cab stops  besides many colorful fishing boats is
the albatross  at ninetytwo feet she dwarfs everything
in the harbor  her white hull glows like ivory and her
twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck
breathtaking

                         charlie
          home sweet hell on the water


ext  dock  day

the boys pile out of the taxi  what seemed like a
pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up
close  the white paint is streaked and barnacles cover
the hull  looks of disappointment

                         chuck
          what happened to it

a voice from behind turns chuck

                         bill
          she cleans up  well have her ship
          shape before we shove off

this is bill butler 15 removed the youngest of the crew
and first mate  bill gives chuck a friendly slap on
the back and climbs aboard  he is greeted by a viking
giant of a man lawford 37 and bearded the ships
english professor

puffing on a huge havana cigar he stares coolly down at
tod and the others  he speaks with the voice of moses

                         lawford
          that this same child of honor and
          renown this gallant hotspur this

          would they were multitudes and on
          my head  my shames redoubled  for
          the time will come

chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the
intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins
their eyes lock

                         lawford
           that i shall make this northern
          youth exchange his glorious deeds
          for my indignities

then the man is gone  haunting  only chuck has seen
him  tod smiles back at lawford impishly

                         tod

          yourself some bunks

chuck and the others climb aboard


int  main cabin  day

chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main
cabin  other crew members are already unpacking

the sleeping arrangement is pullmanstyle with two rows of
bunks on each side of the cabin  in the middle of the
room is a gimbaled table  this is where the crew will eat
and study

                         rick
          listen up  this is chuck gieg

among the crew  feature robin weathers 16 a cherub
with soft puffy cheeks and terry lapchick 17 skinny and
rodentlike

robin approaches with a hand extended  he carries a 8x10
photo of a young man in a football uniform

                         robin
          im robin

chuck regards the photo

                         robin
                  flat
          thats my brother  hes dead

apprehensively chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk
robin tacks up the picture above his bunk  terry unpacks
in front of one of the lower berths

a loud thud turns everyone around  a duffel bag lies
at the bottom of the companionway  a large imposing
figure climbs into the cabin

this is john goodall 17 over six feet big and broad
his hair is slicked back dean style and wears a full
days growth of bread on his face  compared to the
others he looks all man  everybody clears from his path
he stops in front of the lower center bunk terrys bunk
and drops his bag

                         john
          ill take this one

                         terry
          you probably didnt notice but this
          bunk has been taken

john just glares at him then dumps all of terrys things
onto the blanket on the bunk gathers it up and tosses it
into the remaining upper berth  terry watches
intimidated

                         john
          anybody gotta problem with that

                         rick

          el capitan

snickering

                         terry
                  aside
          maybe hes getting his wooden leg
          waxed

laughter  a sound stops the laughter  almost on cue the
sound of slow methodical footsteps pace the deck above
them  then a shadow falls across the skylight blocking
the light  ominous  they all notice and look up

                         lawford
                  mysterious
          youll meet him  soon enough


int  main cabin  sunrise

dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin  the
only sound is the heavy even breathing of slumber
suddenly a booming voice rumbles down the companionway

                         lawford os
          arise arise arise

chuck wakes disoriented  terry bolts upright and hits
his head on the low ceiling  ouch

tod rick and charlie are up instantly  lawfords voice
echoes through the ship

                         lawford os
          exultation is the going of an
          inland soul to sea past the houses
          past the headlands into deep
          eternity bred as we among the
          mountains can the sailor
          understand the divine intoxication
          of the first league out from land
                  pause
          but i suppose well answer that
          question soon enough gentlemen
          soon enough

                         terry
          what question

chuck tries to assimilate lawfords words  robin swings
his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look
john rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head

                         robin
                  foggy
          what the hell is going on

                         chuck
          maybe its an air raid

in crisply pressed shorts and shirt bill butler steps
through the aft bulkhead  he raises a bowswains  whistle
and blows  ooowwweeeeooo  chuck and robin grab their
ears  its a nightmare  terry jumps and hits his head
again

                         bill
          roll out sailors  all hands on
          deck  sixty seconds  sixty
          seconds

he blows the whistle again  this time it brings even john
to his feet staring down at bill in a blind rage  bill
looks up and casually notices him

                         bill
          you gotta problem goodall

                         john
          you blow that thing again ill shove
          it so far up your ass youre gonna
          need dental floss to get it out

                         bill
          just get on deck

bill turns and disappears topside


ext  deck  dawn

the sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew
staggers onto the deck shirtless and shivering

                         bill
          line up  single file  single file

the crew lines up  john is the last one through the hatch
and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed

                         bill
          everybody swims

the boys are aghast

                         lawford
          dont think people just go  go
          go go go go  swim you win
          stay you pay

rick is the first one through the gunnel door followed by
tod and charlie  they howl and scream as they hit the
water  the rest follow like lemmings  but john stands
defiantly with his arms folded

                         bill
          now whats the problem goodall
          everybody swims

the crew are piling back on deck  george stands in the
open galley door  the smell of fresh bacon is
intoxicating

                         john
          i dont

                         lawford
          you will if you wanna eat  right
          george

george nods wielding a butchers knife  the crew stand
shivering waiting on john

                         john
                  to bill
          you gonna swim for your breakfast

bill gives john a long look then strips to his shorts
swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard
arm  he looks down at the water some twentyfive feet
below  its a long way  robin turns away

lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor

                         lawford
          down down beneath the deep that
          oft in triumph bore him he sleeps a
          sound and peaceful sleep with the
          salt waves dashing over him 
          lord byron gentlemen

with that bill leaps and hits the water with a huge
kersplash  he swims to the boarding ladder pulls himself
up and gets in johns face

                         bill
          everybody swims  now ive been in
          twice  so i guess ill be eating
          your breakfast too

john considers him then strips off his shirt  but
instead of walking over to the gunnel door he jumps into
the ratlines climbs to the foretop and looks down

he manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of
ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard
arm  the topgallant  its a pissing contest and
everybody knows it

                         mike
          i got five bucks says he doesnt

                         chris
          i got five that says he doesnt
          live

                         tod
          ill take a dollar of that

                         robin
          this is crazy

robin refuses to watch  the others share a look

john makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the
end of the yard  he tosses a look towards bill but with
no way to back down he launches into the air  everyone
gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive
falling falling falling

                         chuck
          jesus

                         robin
          i cant watch this

john hits the water like a bullet  the crew run to the
side waiting for him to come up  nothing  finally he
breaks the surface  easy  he climbs up waiting somehow
to claim victory

suddenly they all feel it  a presence  he has appeared
silently on top of the chart house like a phantom gazing
down at them back lit by the sun the boys must squint to
see him

richard sheldrake skipper ageless and windswept
casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and
glides to the deck  he is powerfully built and bronzed
from the sea and sun  he carriers the burden of command
like a cross  softspoken and remote he is a man to be
reckoned with  the crew know they are in the presence of
someone larger than life

                         bill
          skipper on deck

the crew line up clumsily  skipper has a gaze that blazes
right through them

he looks out to sea  searching ominous  he waits until
the silence is filled with everyones attention

                         skipper
          you know whats out there  wind and
          wave and rain  endless glassy pools
          thatll hold a sailing ship for
          weeks and then spit her out into the
          eye of the kind of hurricane  a
          blow that could knock the bridge off
          a battleship  reefs and rocks and
          sandbars thatll tear the belly from
          her and enough fog and night to hide
          it all

he spits into the water  the crew sheepishly throw
glances to the horizon

                         skipper
          so look out there and explain to
          me why any man in possession of any
          sense at all would take on the sea
          with sail

skipper turns his gaze back to the boys  there is a fire
in his eyes  nobody dare answers

                         skipper
          because theres something else out
          there  it beckons in the wind and
          sings in the shrouds  voices
          whispering

his ear to the wind

                         skipper
          theyre voices of men  calling  men
          you dont even know  men you cant
          even imagine  its a seed a wish
          that part of you and i that aches to
          be alive that was banished by
          everything weve ever been taught or
          told  its a part of us that can
          only be found on mountain tops and
          deserts in the deepest caverns
          smoking battle fields and across
          oceans

he turns back to the sea dark

                         skipper
          out there is where it all waits

                         older chuck vo
          he was everything i had expected
          part ahab part queeg and even bligh
          he spoke in whispers and answered
          all queries with efficiency and
          directness  he had gone to sea for
          the first time at fifteen the same
          age as bill butler  and as he
          looked upon us that first day it
          must have been as though he were
          staring into a mirror

skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the
chart house  he pats a small brass sign that is welded to
the main mast and reads the inscription

                         skipper
                  reading
          where we go one we go all

with that he disappears below  nobody moves  this is
exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits
the fan

                         terry
          this  is gonna be a long eight
          months


int  main cabin  day

the boys devour a hearty breakfast  tod is the galley
slave and fills glasses with orange juice

                         tod
          chow down boys  the milk and eggs
          are the first things to go once we
          put out

john enters balancing two plates heaped with food

                         rick
          you know we gotta dumbwaiter for
          that

john looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall

                         rick
          not that one  todo here

the guys groan

                         tod
          har har har

john approaches the full table glaring down at terry who
doesnt notice him  finally he looks up startled

                         terry
          im done  im finished

he scrambles to get up and clear his plate  john sits
down without a word  the others notice the two plates of
food

                         rick
          hungry goodall

he just grunts and starts eating  robin watches him

                         john
          whats your problem

                         robin
          whyd you jump

                         john
          because i felt like it
                  sharp
          what do you care

                         robin
                  aside
          i couldnt do it

                         john
          well as soon as you grow some
          balls let me know

robin bristles

                         robin
          screw you

                         charlie

          excuse me

                         charlie
          you heard me

john grabs charlie by his private parts and hoists him
into the air  charlie gasps the air sucked from his
lungs

                         john
          dont ever call me stupid

                         robin
          come on he didnt mean anything

john shoves robin to the floor with his free arm

                         john
          let me tell you girls something  i
          do what i wanna do  when i wanna do
          it  and i dont give a shit what
          old ahab up there thinks either
          any questions

john releases charlie who crumples to the floor  john
resumes eating

bill enters and reads the duty roster

                         bill
          okay heres the duty  gieg

john continues to eat  when he realizes his name hasnt
been called he looks up to meet bills eyes


int  head

pissed john tries to figure out the head  pumps going
in pumps going out

                         older chuck vo
          we were all thirteen individuals
          wed arrived the sum total of our
          limited experiences and the result
          of our parents best if not narrow
          expectations

john pulls back on the lever belching water de le
toilet all over him


ext  ship  day

chuck sits in a bowswains chair over the side with a
paint roller in his hand  the ruststreaked hull is being
transformed

                         older chuck vo
           some of us were there for
          discipline some for escape  but i
          could see a small piece of myself in
          all of them and though i fought the
          notion for me i knew now this
          would be home

a radio crackles in the bg

                         announcer
          president eisenhower today
          acknowledged that a secret american
          spy plane was in fact shot down over
          the soviet union  the pilot has
          been confirmed as francis gary
          powers

robin terry and mike are on the deck within earshot of
chuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at the
rust

                         terry
          why couldnt it have been a wooden
          boat

                         mike
          steel boats dont leak

mike lights up a cigarette  robin notices  marlboros

                         robin
          hey can i have one

mike sizes up robin for a moment then tosses him the pack

                         robin
          thanks daddyo

robin lights up grimacing with the first drag

                         terry
          well dont brush too hard  looks
          to me like the only thing holding
          this bucket together is the rust

a voice booms up from the dock

                         francis os
          ahoy there

they turn  standing on the dock is francis boutillier
self important and overbearing with his son philip who
looks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment
skipper appears

                         skipper
          good afternoon

francis boards without being invited  philip follows in
his shadow  he scrutinizes the condition of the boat

                         francis
          albatross  doesnt inspire a lot of
          confidence

                         skipper
          oh on the contrary the albatross
          is considered a very good omen  it
          is said they embody the spirits of
          sailors passed on  its very bad
          luck if you kill one  and dolphins
          too

the boys chuckle

                         francis
          im francis boutillier  this is my
          son philip

                         skipper
          i know

francis looks the skipper over reading him smiling

                         skipper
          youre a day late  we keep a
          schedule aboard ship  lives depend
          on it
                  to philip
          hello philip

                         phil
          sir

skippers directness bugs francis

                         francis
          your cable said you wouldnt be
          putting out until midoctober

                         skipper
          as you can see theres a lot to do

                         francis
          indentured servitude is not what my
          son had in mind

                         skipper
          this is a working ship  promptness
          is not a luxury its a necessity
          as is the work to maintain her  had
          we been ready i can assure you we
          would have sailed

something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation

                         francis
          and i would have expected
          compensation for my time and expense
          coming all the way down here

                         skipper
          happily it all worked out this
          time
                  to bill
          bill take philip below and help him
          find a bunk

phil follows bill down the companionway

                         francis
          ill be frank with you  this was
          his mothers idea  a romp through
          the caribbean on a sailboat sounds
          more like a vacation than an
          education if you ask me

                         skipper
          it will be more than that i can
          promise you

                         francis
                  cool
          take good care of my son

there is threat in his tone

                         skipper
          well do our best  youre welcome
          to say goodbye

                         francis
          hes a big boy

francis leaves the boat  skipper and the crew watch as he
climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off

                         lawford
          well that was neighborly

                         skipper
          he didnt get to be under secretary
          of the air force by being
          neighborly

lawford shakes his head  bill comes up through the
companionway

                         skipper
          everyone aboard young bill

                         bill
          yes sir

                         skipper
          good
                  beat
          lets go sailing


ext  albatross  open water  day

the albatross is under full power  there is a sense of
excitement and anticipation  charlie rick robin and
lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail  skipper is
at the helm with alice and bill nearby  skipper calls
over to chuck who stands alone at the rail

                         skipper
          come over here and take the wheel

chucks eyes light up as he walks over and takes the
wheel

                         skipper
          hold her steady into the wind
          southwest by west

                         chuck
          yes sir

                         skipper
                  to all
          gentleman when you hear an order
          sing out  i want to know that
          youve heard and understand
                  quietly to bill
          raise the mainsail

                         bill
                  calling out
          raise the main

lawford and his group bellow out

                         together
          raise the main

lawford coaches the boys sending two scurrying on top the
chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy
furled canvas to the main boom  he guides another to the
midships pinrail where the main halyard which raises the
huge sail is made fast to a belaying pin  he loosens the
halyard and hands it to robin

                         skipper
          take a turn under the pin and lead
          it out to the others  you guys in
          the rear take up the slack  heave
          together now

in a beautiful tenor voice bill begins to croon a sea
chanty an old whaling song with an irish lilt

                         bill
                  singing
          when the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup

the more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the
beat

                         boys
          when the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup

                         lawford
          come on the rest of you sing  belt
          it out like men

the newer guys like chuck john robin and terry look at
each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever
heard of

                         bill
                  singing
          not one of us was a sober

the boys return the verse half heartedly  lawford ties
off his line and stares them down  skipper notices that
the work has stopped

                         skipper
          whats wrong mr lawford

                         lawford
          it seems were short on singers

skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew

                         skipper
          everyone sings aboard a wind jammer
          gentlemen  it lets everyone know
          youre in sync  it shows unity
          that all thoughts are one  a crew
          that sings together stays together
          besides i like it  so pipe up and
          be sailors

                         john
                  in a whisper
          everybody swims everybody sings
          whats next  tap dancing

lawford and rick leap up onto the line pulling it down
with their body weight  they sing out the chorus  the
crew returns the song somewhat reluctantly as the great
mainsail starts to rise

                         lawford
          tie it off

                         skipper
                  to bill
          outer

                         bill
          outer jib

                         charlie
                  confused
          outta what

coached by tod another group in the bow awkwardly hoist
the jib

                         skipper
                  to bill
          well bear off to port and run down
          wind

                         bill
          mr lawford stand by to ease the
          mainsheet  rick get on the jib
          sheet  george john philip tim
          and dick go aloft to unstop the
          forecourse  george will show you
          what to do  tod show your men the
          forward pinrail and stand ready on
          the buntlines and clewlines
          forecourse first work upward

the newcomers watch bill with newfound respect  george
john and the others climb to the forecourse and out onto
the footropes  its unsteady work and theres confusion
everywhere  but through it all they continue to sing

lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the
others move into their positions  when bill sees the
yardarm crew is in place

                         bill
          unstop the squares

                         yardarm crew
          unstop the squares

                         skipper
                  to chuck
          fall off to port  ease her around
          to a heading of northeast  sing out
          when youre there

as the tops are released the giant forecourse drapes into
a scalloped pattern  as the bow falls off the wind the
snapping main and jib billow  stiffening to the wind the
ship heels and surges forward

before her awakening power everyone changes their stance
and grabs for a handhold  lawford slowly pays out the
mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines
releasing the stops on the other squaresails

                         chuck
                  in a whisper
          ah northeast sir

                         skipper
                  barking
          speak up boy

chuck jumps startled  he selfconsciously calls out

                         chuck
          northeast sir

                         skipper
          unfurl the squares

tods group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and
the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending
a shudder through the rig  the bows wake sizzles with
the added surge  as each of the squares fall alice and
lawford move to their sheets setting each sails
position

chuck looks up amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty
of the canvas that the albatross carries

                         bill
          raise the inner jib  raise the
          forestaysail

                         skipper
          watch the telltales chuck  if we
          jibe now well have a lot of people
          in the water

                         chuck
          yes sir

                         skipper
          all stop on the engine

                         bill
          all stop on the engine

bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves
it to the stop position

                         skipper
          behold gentlemen  the power of the
          wind

as the sails billow the albatross seems transformed
everyone stops and looks up  the vessel heels and with a
powerful surge launches into the waves  white foam
splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through
the water  chucks face is full of wonder  it is a
magical moment  then the crew begins to cheer

                         skipper
          did we lose anybody

                         alice
          not yet

long shot

the albatross under full sail is the handsome powerful
image of another time  and yet here she is

on deck

each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment
music builds

                         skipper
          chart us a course for the windward
          side

alice considers his request

                         alice
          that low passed through last night
          may be a little bumpy out there

                         skipper
          its time these boys saw some real
          blue water


ext  the open sea  later

the bow of the albatross explodes through the top of a
fifteen foot swell  the sky is clear but the wind is
fierce  in spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and
sailing well

the crew has never seen mountains of water like this
disaster seems imminent  bill has assembled them in front
of the wheel house  they are all holding on for dear
life  even john seems shaken  skipper magically stands
effortlessly before them on the rolling deck  he remains
perfectly dry

                         skipper
          well now that i have your
          undivided attention id like to
          take this opportunity to make a few
          points

                         terry
                  aside
          this guy is certifiable

                         phil
          suicidal

                         skipper
          the first thing is i dont like
          people talking when im talking so
          the two of you shut up

caught terry and phil button up

                         skipper
          second the next one of you who
          doesnt jump like a bunny when mr
          butler gives an order is gonna spend
          the rest of this trip scrubbing
          bilges  hes a better sailor today
          than any ten of you will be when
          this is all over

skipper directs the next comment directly at john

                         skipper
          and if i catch anybody ever
          jumping off a yard arm again i will
          personally break what bones are left
          and send you home in a wheel chair

a wave explodes over the bow  a wall of water crashes
over the deck knocking down several of the boys  terry
cant take it anymore and explodes

                         terry
          were gonna die  were all gonna
          die

he lunges at skipper but lawford one arms him

                         skipper
          excellent point  as you might have
          noticed being out here pretty much
          puts you in the moment  if you
          panic if you lose your head you
          die  maybe you take your mates with
          you  howd you like to have to bet
          on terry here getting us home today
          each one of you is responsible for
          the rest  where we go one we go
          all  if your buddy is asleep at
          the switch were all fish food

hes making his point which is lost on no one

                         skipper
          the ship beneath you is not a toy
          and sailing is not a game  the
          albatross will take us far
          gentlemen but she demands constant
          attention  respect her and well
          do fine  oh and one more thing
          there is nothing that goes on on
          this boat that i dont know about
          she speaks to me in the night  so
          dont test me  not even a little

skipper walks over and puts an arm around terry who is
fighting sobs

                         skipper
          nothing like experience to put
          things in perspective  huh son
                  to bill
          alright  lets go home


int  chart house  day

lawford addresses some of the crew  chuck robin and john
are among them  john glares at lawford  the guys giggle

                         lawford
          thats not a satisfactory answer

                         john
          look save it for somebody else will
          ya  this ancient shit doesnt have
          anything to do with me

lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes
theatrically

                         lawford
          shit

he slams a text book into johns hands

                         lawford
          read for me please the words of mr
          keats at the bottom of the page

john stares back simmering  robin interrupts the
potential confrontation and reaches for the book

                         robin
          ill read it  i mean i dont mind

                         john
          shut up donut

john pushes robins hands away and studies the page for a
moment  he begins reading but struggles with the cadence

                         john
                  reading
          much have i traveled in realms of
          gold and many goodly states and
          kingdoms seen round many western
          islands have i been which bards in
          fealty to apollo hold oft of one
          wide expanse had i been told that
          deepbrowed homer ruled as his
          demesne

                         lawford
          you know what he is talking about
          here

blank faces

                         lawford
                  ranting
          awe  humility  hes telling you
          that he has traveled the seas as
          homer did  as ulysses had before
          him as he tried to find his way home
          to ithaca after the trojan wars
          that deep browed homer

he points to his head

                         lawford
          brilliant seasoned wise of the
          mind  ruled as his demesne
          he commands the voyage of the
          imagination like a god
                  pause
          that is what one of the greatest
          literary minds of modern times mr
          boutillier has to say about homer

he snatches the book back

                         lawford
          you think the odyssey is dull  ill
          tell you something its about each
          one of you  right now  doubt and
          expectation  friendship community
          self sacrifice and accountability

he holds up the text

                         lawford
          this isnt just a story  its
          history made allegory  it is a
          philosophical handbook for life  it
          holds the secret of this very
          voyage

                         john
          what is it the secret

lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh

                         john
                  confused
          what

                         lawford
          if it were only that simple my
          young friend  read on gentlemen
          read on


ext  albatross  establishing  day

aerial shot  the albatross is under full sail leaving
bermuda for the last time

                         older chuck vo
          and so it was the albatross that
          took to the open sea with the wind
          in her snapping canvas and a bone of
          white foam in her teeth in each
          of us were feelings of anticipation
          and hesitation for the man at the
          wheel and of the unfamiliar world he
          was leading us into

she crashes through the surf  driving majestic music
building

deck  day

the crew hauls in the line raising the mainsail  chuck
struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in

aloft

the crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the
rigging

bowsprit net

the crew pull down the jib trying to furl it  most of the
sail ends up dragging in the water

above

the squaresails are dropped simultaneously

wide

white foam boils from the bow of the albatross as she
crashes through the waves

at the wheel

alice smiles and puts her arms around skippers waist
its coming together

foretop  same

skipper stands at the rail looking out  the seas are up
and the masts are pitching widely from side to side

chuck is high above the deck in the footropes wrestling
with one of the squaresails  the pitching mast catches
him by surprise and he slips  he tumbles down tangled in
the lines  a rope wraps around his neck choking him
robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly

                         robin
          bill  skipper

robin freezes  skipper leaps into the rigging like a
spider and in a few seconds wrestles chuck free and
carries him down to the deck  chuck coughs catching his
breath  the color is gone from skippers face  this was
a close call

                         skipper
          you all right

                         chuck
          it was my fault  i slipped

alice examines chuck making sure hes okay  skipper
turns to robin who is shaken  he never raises his voice

                         skipper
          why didnt you go up there

robin stands silently

                         skipper
          speak up

still nothing from robin

                         charlie
          hes afraid to climb

                         skipper
          what
                  to robin
          is that true

robin looks away

                         skipper
          why wasnt i made aware of this
          bill

                         bill
          i didnt know sir

                         skipper
          its your job to know  if something
          goes wrong up there the other
          eighteen people aboard cant be
          wondering if hes gonna do his job
          or not

skipper returns his gaze to robin measuring him
finally

                         skipper
          swing up son

                         robin
                  trembling
          what

                         skipper
          up you go  right now

robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung
then the second  he stops and steals a peek up  the mast
is swaying  he freezes his lip starts to tremble  all
eyes are on him  phil chuckles

                         skipper
          do you have something to say

                         phil
                  smug
          no

                         skipper
          then keep your mouth shut

phil backs off stunned  robin cant move

                         skipper
                  to robin
          whats it going to be

                         robin
          im sorry

                         skipper
          sorry wont cut it

robin holds on frozen  skipper turns to the crew

                         skipper
          survival means discipline and
          assimilation  there are no special
          cases here
                  to robin
          now get going  get up there

humiliated a tear slips down his face  excruciating

                         skipper
          what are you blubbering about

                         robin
          i dont know

skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines  his face
is but inches from robins

                         skipper
          one hand in front of the other son
          well do it together

robin reaches for the next rung  he looks down  skipper
growls at him

                         skipper
          dont look down  look in my eyes
          climb  well do it together

                         robin
                  sobbing
          i cant

                         skipper
          you climb damn it or so help me
          ill haul you to the foretop by your
          diaper and leave you there

                         robin
          aaauuuhhh

skipper gets right in his face and snarls

                         skipper
          are you hating this  are you

                         robin
          i hate you you son of a bitch

                         skipper
          no  hate the fear inside of you
          climb like a man mister  hate it
          hate it away  hate your way up one
          more rung  do it right now

with every ounce of strength robin reaches for one more
rung screaming as he reaches  skipper climbs and screams
with him

                         together
          auuuggghhh

robin clutches the rung with a death grip  then he looks
down  his bladder releases  hot urine runs down his legs
and splashes steaming onto the deck  the crew is
horrified  robin weeps

                         robin
          oh god

skipper backs off

                         skipper
          dont hate yourself  hate your
          weakness  all right  get down

robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others
mortified

                         skipper
          im only gonna say this one time
          im not here to wipe noses and
          asses  im not your mother  trust
          funds and blue blazers dont get you
          a thing out here  you wanna act
          like babies then get off my boat

stunned the crew is speechless  chuck instinctively goes
to help robin  skipper snaps like a turtle

                         skipper
                  to chuck
          he can take care of himself
                  to others

                         phil

                         skipper

                         skipper
          remember something sooner or
          later we all have to face it

                         chuck
                  aside
          face what

the question hangs in the air like a cloud


int  chart house  dusk

the chart house is the communication and navigation center
for the boat  it also serves as the officers dining room

around the small table sipping coffee

glance  skipper catches it

                         skipper

george looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin

                         george

                         george
                  sarcastic

          a skipper is the worst thing  its

lawford lets out a belly laugh

                         lawford
          ive seen him snatch the tail of the
          tempest and stuff it screaming
          into a bottle  the bilges are full
          of them

                         george

          edge of the abyss and back  hell

          real salt  theres no malice in him
          and theres nothing more dear to him
          than his boys  so sleep well my
          friend

lawford seductively produces a pair of havana cigars
passes one to george and winks


int  galley  dusk

robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching
through the cabin window as the sun slips below the
horizon  chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of
food

                         chuck
          how ya doing

                         robin
                  without turning
          fine

                         chuck

                         robin

          concern and all but like he said i
          can take care of myself

                         chuck
          i just brought you something to eat

robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods  they
stand silently  its awkward

                         chuck
          i feel like i got you into this

                         robin
          forget it

                         chuck
          im used to spending a lot of time
          alone  i guess thats what i
          thought it would be out here  but
          its not is it

                         robin
                  beat

          there

                         chuck
          it doesnt matter  really  im
          just sorry you got chewed out

robin nods  they both stare out at the rising moon

                         robin
          my brother and i used to climb to
          the top of this old beech tree in
          the back yard and watch the moon
          come up just like this  my parents
          would fight all the time so wed
          sneak out there where we couldnt
          hear em and recite scenes from our
          favorite movies

robin grows quiet

                         robin
          would you believe i miss it  the
          middle of paradise and im homesick

chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back

                         chuck
                  ironic
          well i wouldnt worry  itll all
          be there when we get back


ext  deck  day

the sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls
and pitches  chuck sees terry heaving over the side
john and tod hear the sound and turn

                         john
                  disgusted
          come on man  show a little
          backbone
                  to tod
          you believe that

tod is fixated on terry  suddenly without warning he
breaks for the rail and lets fly

phil and charlie are next  chris climbs through the
companionway but doesnt make it to the side  spontaneous
regurgitation  bill and lawford jump up onto the wheel
housing to avoid being sprayed  suddenly everyone is
heaving

                         chris
          sorry

                         lawford
                  to bill
          were gonna have nobody left up here
          to crew  better let skipper know

bill nods and disappears  john joins chuck watching the
events around him

                         john
          well gieg im glad to see im not
          the only guy on this boat that can
          take a little rockn roll  bunch of
          wusses i swear

chuck watches each of his shipmates  then suddenly out
of nowhere  projectile vomit all over john  he looks at
chuck horrified then he too cuts loose over the rail

                         john
          son of a bitch

chuck looks at john furious with himself and begins to
laugh  but after a moment he starts to laugh too  its
infectious they crack each other up  then in the middle
of belly laughing they simultaneously retch again over
the side


int  skippers cabin  day

skipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in
front of him  theres a knock on the door

                         skipper

                         bill

                         bill

          west

skipper looks up

                         skipper
          thats part of it too


ext  deck  dusk

skipper stands at the wheelhouse with lawford george and
bill studying the horizon through binoculars  dark
clouds  chuck watches skipper  everyone looking for a
cue

                         chuck
          that a storm skipper

skipper stays glued to the binoculars

                         skipper

          what do you think

                         skipper
          barometers dropping  the first
          blowll come from the south  might
          get interesting

                         chuck
          shouldnt we turn away

                         skipper
          you cant run from the wind son
          you trim your sails face the music
          and let the chips fall  bill lets
          close her up dog tight

close on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched
tight

below decks

bulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly

in the galley

pots and pans crash around

in the main cabin

the cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books
on top of alice  she turns and looks at the mess
annoyed


ext  deck  same

                         skipper
          furl the squares reef the main and
          bend on the storm jib but keep it
          furled  drop everything but the
          inner jib  i want everybody down
          before we get any lightning

bill bolts forward with lawford barking orders  most of
the crew are still ill but climb into the rigging and
begin dropping sail

                         george
          whys it always happen at night

skipper regards george annoyed

                         skipper
          george i want hot food in
          everybody  get to it

george returns to the galley  alice joins skipper at the
wheelhouse handing him foulweather gear

                         alice
          looks like weather

                         skipper
          yep

he slips on a yellow slicker

                         skipper
          do me a favor and tell bill once
          shes dogged down i want everyone to
          break out their slickers and make
          sure their gear is stowed or well

          hit the racks

                         phil
                  impulsively
          im not staying out here

skipper fires off a look that frightens even phil

                         skipper
          no  thats for sure  charlie take
          his place

phil goes below a little ashamed  the crew scatters
chuck still at the wheel pipes up

                         chuck
          if its all the same id like to
          stay on deck

skipper regards chuck who looks back with both fear and
eagerness  suddenly he sees something in this kid  maybe
himself  he almost smiles  almost

                         skipper
          take the wheel


ext  foretop  same

dark clouds blot out the sky and stars  thunder rumbles
far away  the seas have built but theres no wind yet
with no steerage the ship is tossed

tod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl
the mast swings from side to side but the air has gone
dead calm  skipper looks up anticipating

                         skipper
          everyone out of the rigging now

                         bill
          everybody down  on the double

                         tod
                  shouting
          here it comes

on the deck

the crew in the rigging scamper down to the safety of the
deck

                         skipper
          bill on the wheel with chuck

bill joins chuck and takes hold of the wheel  then it
hits

a wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of
thunder and flashing lightning  the bow explodes through
twelve foot swells  this is what the albatross was born
to do


int  main cabin  same

its all the crew can do to stay in their bunks  pots
crash books and personals go flying  the guys are
scared

on deck

the main and jib sheets tighten  skipper looks at chuck
and bill  it all comes down to moments like these and he
loves it

suddenly there is a loud crack  a violent flapping
noise  skipper leaps to the port and looks forward  tod
comes running back

                         tod
          we blew the inner

                         alice
          ill go

                         skipper
          bring it down and run up the storm
          jib  well fix it later  stay out
          of reach of the blocks

tod and alice disappear

                         skipper
                  with a twinkle
          well were in it now

chuck studies him frightened but reassured


ext  bow  same

the shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind
the block smashes into the gunnel rail shattering it  no
one dares go near it  for a moment it seems to hang
there seductively  john naive of its power leaps for
the rail and grabs it

                         alice
          nooo

suddenly the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling john
high off the deck and over the side  he holds on for dear
life screaming

at the wheel

                         skipper
                  to chuck
          hold her steady

skipper bolts forward

at the bow

alice uncleats the jib halyard leaving one turn on the
pin and shoves it into tods hands

                         alice
          release this when i tell you

skipper joins tod as alice scrambles along the deck and
pulls herself into the bowsprit netting  when the block
and jib swing inboard she grabs for the leach of the sail
yelling

                         alice
          now

as john is snapped inboard alice leaps up grabbing the
sail leaning out over the open water  waves explode
through the netting  as tod releases the halyard john
falls to the deck bruised humbled but alive  lawford
and skipper pull alice from the bowsprit

skipper looks her over  relieved  no broken bones  good
work  but then this is what he expects  he respects her
and now everyone can see why  he looks at john sprawled
on the deck

                         skipper
          be careful will ya

                         john
          what ever you say cap

                         skipper
          lets get that storm jib up

skipper gives alice a private look then returns to the
stern where chuck holds tightly onto the wheel

                         older chuck vo
          the storm lasted sixteen hours and
          it set us all on equal footing  it
          was the first time that we shared an
          episode on an even plane  as we
          stood our watches we were equally
          out of control of our situation
          regardless of our physical abilities
          or social backgrounds  and though
          our real feelings lay hidden beneath
          bravado and defiance we were no
          longer strangers


ext  deck  day

the crew is cleaning up  alice supervises repairs to the
jib while others stow line scrub the deck and chip paint
lawford paces

                         lawford

the more experienced crew members have heard this all
before

                         lawford
          if it moves salute it  if it
          doesnt move pick it up  if its
          too big to pick up paint it

the boys mockingly salute lawford as he walks by  john
stands before a porthole combing his brylcreem hair into a
da

mike and chris climb on deck with several large boxes

          hey you cant do that
                  to chris

john flops in a deck chair  chris shakes his head and
starts closing up the boxes

                         chris
          sure he can


ext  stern  later

chuck sits alone away from the others reading  on cue
half of the crew descend dragging him kicking and
screaming into the bowswains chair and over the side
the guys cheer

                         chuck
          come on you guys this isnt funny

the seat spins twists and swings from behind the boat

                         charlie
          come on chucky  show us a little
          grit

they lower the chair so it glides just above the surface
when the boat noses into a swell chuck gets quite a ride
once he has the hang of it fear turns to elation

                         chuck
          yeee haaaa

                         charlie
          okay whos next

                         phil

                         rick
          no self respecting shark is gonna
          take a bite out of you

chucks hauled back in and terry pushes his way to the
front of the line

                         terry
          im next

terry goes over the side  once he gets the hang of it he
gets into it  he maneuvers the chair like a plane
forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back
to the surface

off the port side

robin is trolling  the line takes a tremendous hit and
robins reel screams  tod is at the wheel and turns

                         tod
          there she blows

two hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken
the bait  the crew turn and look  skipper looks out at
terry still in the bowswains chair

                         skipper
          get him in

bill waves at terry to come on in

                         bill
          come on in

terry waves him off and disappears back under the waves
they cant pull him up while hes going under the water

                         skipper
          do it now bill

terry pops up pissed that theyre reeling him back in

suddenly the animal on the other end of robins line
explodes out of the sea  its a six foot thresher shark
terry sees it too and freaks suddenly thrashing and
screaming

                         terry
          get me out  get me out

                         mike
          oh my god  its a

                         skipper
                  calmly
          shark
                  to robin
          dont lose it son

george grabs a gaffing hook while robin fights the rod
trying to bring in the big fish

                         george
          keep it coming

robin battles the fish  george clumsily tries to help
the crew make their way to the rear to watch

                         charlie
          whoops

charlie and rick and the others heave to get terry up
finally he makes it  sprawling onto the deck

                         terry
          oh jesus  oh jesus christ

the crew turn and cheer robin on as he brings the shark
alongside

                         george
          he must be two hundred pounds
          bring him in close and try to hold
          him steady

george leans out over the rail trying to get the hook
into a gill  several of the boys hold onto him as the
fish flops around violently

                         george
          got him

skipper comes down to inspect the catch  the shark is
longer than terry is tall and thrashes in the the water
snapping and twisting  terry stands shaking freaked
all of them are

                         rick
          damn terr youre whiter than sister
          mary annes butt

the guys laugh nervously  terry just stares at the man
eater but its infectious  after a moment hes laughing
too  skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile

                         skipper
          well now you have something to
          write home about

more laughter  suddenly tom who is lookout on the
foretop cries out

                         tom
          land ho  land ho

everyone turns around to look  the guys at the stern let
go of george and he nearly tumbles overboard  in that
instant the shark slips off of the gaff and disappears
back into the sea  robin and george share a stunned look

                         george
          shit

                         robin
          theres more where that came from

skipper returns to the wheelhouse with alice  together
they scan the horizon  clouds build over the land ahead

                         alice
          cheated death again

he slips an arm around her

                         skipper
          yep

approach in the long boats

chuck gazes across the strange landscape  as the boats
dock the crew pile out and scatter  local children
follow them wherever they go  chuck robin and john find
themselves alone  most of the buildings are primitive
they wander over to a shop

          quite as refreshing as a cold ten
          cent coke that only costs ten cents

the three clink their bottles  mike and chris slink away


ext  colonial fort  day

a crumbling fort overlooks the harbor  below the
albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water
large bronze muzzleloading cannons still lie in their
gunports aimed at the sea waiting for pirate ships that
will never come

caribbean view

ext  albatross  harbor  night

the boat moves off leaving the lights of antigua behind
chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon


ext  deck  day

the wind is up and the seas are high  the ship is under
full sail driving at top speed  foam sprays from the bow
as it slices through the water  what she was born to do
the crew line the starboard rail thrilled to be part of
the performance

tod is at the wheel with chris nearby  the sails tower
above him like a mountain of silk  he wrestles the wheel
careful to hold his course against the powerful trade
winds

skipper making his rounds inspects the heading on the
compass and nods

                         skipper
          its a good sail boys

tod and chris beam  compliments are rare from this man

                         tod
          thank you sir  shall we trim the
          main skipper  i think we could get
          another knot or two

skipper turns and looks at tod a twinkle in his eye

                         skipper
          as you like

gravy  the two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet
tackle  phil joins them

                         phil
          what do you say i have a crack at
          the wheel

                         tod
          id say fuck off junior

they laugh  phil slinks behind the chart house hurt and
angry  he spots a spear gun stowed against the chart
house

as tod and chris pull in the main it strains and
stretches against the powerful wind

phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the
chart house and silently fires  there is a wicked pop as
the spear punctures the sail passing through it followed
by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits

                         tod
          jesus christ  let it out  let it
          out

the sound brings skipper onto the deck like a shot

                         skipper
          hard to port  hard to port

calamity as tod cranks the ship into the wind  the
canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop  people
dive everywhere to drop sail

                         skipper
          start the engine  all ahead full
          scallop the square and drop the
          rest

he shoots a glare at tod and chris

                         tod
                  bewildered
          i dont know what happened skipper
          it just blew out

skipper turns to the task at hand without a word  what
had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and
confusion

phil still hidden behind the chart house returns the
spear gun and smiles to himself at tods arrogance turned
humility

ext  beach  night

the drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach
as they ready the boat for the trip back robin looks out
to sea

                         robin
                  alarmed
          jesus h christ

                         terry
          holy shit  whered she go

the crew is suddenly stone sober  stunned

                         mike
          shes gone  the boats gone

phil breaks into sort of a blind panic

                         phil
          oh jesus oh jesus  man i knew we
          shouldnt have gone  i tried to

                         mike

                         robin
          i did  why

                         charlie
          maybe she pulled free

                         mike
          what if they dont know  if shes
          adrift if theyre asleep she could
          run aground  she could break up on
          the reef

                         phil
                  to robin
          maybe you didnt check it good
          enough

                         robin
                  defensive
                   frightened
          i did  i swear

oddly its phil who stands up for robin

                         phil
          yeah well youre really gonna have
          some bad dreams if we find out you
          didnt

                         john
          thats enough

                         phil
          how the hell are we gonna get outta
          here

                         john
          well think of something

                         phil
          oh praise the lord
                  announcing
          relax everybody  everything is
          under control  the jug heads going
          to think of something

without warning  john lunges at phil  phil screams
trying to defend himself  the guys all dive in  suddenly
its an all out brawl

john out of control pounding phils head against the seat
of the boat

suddenly from behind comes a blistering thwack as
chuck breaks an oar over the back of johns head
stunned john lets go of phil and turns blood dripping
from the back of his head

                         john
          nobody calls me an idiot

he weaves then passes out falling face down in the sand
the guys stagger to their feet trying to recover

                         phil
          god damn it man  i think he broke
          my nose

                         chuck
          shut up phil

chuck tosses the broken oar handle kneels over and
vomits

                         terry
          well thats just great  now what
          are we supposed to do

chuck and robin hoist john up and drag him under a palm
tree propping him up  the others huddle to stay warm


ext  beach  morning

the crews asleep in the tropical heat of day  bloodied
and sun burned  a fly buzzes around ricks face waking
him  he sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus  he
gazes across the water stupefied

                         rick
          ohmygod

the others stir and follow his gaze  the albatross sits
in exactly the spot where they left her

                         robin
          im not sure if this is really good
          or really bad


ext  albatross  day

the sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly  george tries
to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his
hands

                         george
          i got a live one

skipper alice and bill watch the shoreline as the boys
launch the long boat into the surf  george is struggling
a beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water but skipper
never takes his eyes off of his boys

                         skipper
          the thing about fishing george is
          you need to let em run some  give
          em just enough slack so they dont
          break the line  but at the same
          time youve gotta keep enough
          tension to wear em down bring em
          in slowly so they dont really know
          theyre hooked

suddenly georges line goes slack  he nearly falls over
backwards

                         george
          ill try and remember that


ext  deck  day

hound dog and hung over bloodied and burned the boys
stand before skipper and the others  skipper looks dark
and angry

                         skipper
          you know what a loose cannon is
          bout the worst thing that could
          happen to a wooden ship  all it
          took was one crashing around the
          deck in a storm itd smash
          everything in its way maybe take
          out a mast or punch a hole right
          through the hull  think about it
          just one cannon not tied down not
          anchored could take a whole man of
          war straight to the bottom

                         mike
                  aside
          but we dont have any cannons

chris jabs him in the ribs

                         chris
                  hushed
          shut up

skipper turns and faces them

                         skipper
          now if the skipper were smart if
          he could see a storm building why
          hed cut loose every gun on his
          boat  even though it would leave
          him at a disadvantage in battle
          hed push em into the sea  better
          chance running for port than risk
          the entire ship his crew

he takes a pause making sure he has their attention for
this part

                         skipper
          people are like that sometimes
          they cut loose and before you know
          it theyre knocking holes in
          everything  so you gotta ask
          yourself if it might not be better
          to just put em off before they sink
          the whole thing  i mean after all
          you can always get new cannons

he walks back to his place at the rail

                         skipper
                  beat
          i want a tight ship everybody
          shaved and in clean clothes when we
          make curacao  if it goes well if
          your mid terms are acceptable i may
          reconsider my decision about the
          rest of the trip  thats all

dejected the crew goes below


ext  deck  day

under sail  skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the
crew taking exams  each writes furiously as alice
scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the
chart house door

as the boys scratch out the problems john seems
paralyzed  he looks over at phil and copies down his
answer  he checks crib notes hidden in his shorts  chuck
and robin both see this and exchange looks


int  aft cabin  day

john makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the
head  robin follows  chuck drops down the aft
companionway intercepting john

                         chuck
          where you going

                         john
          to take a piss

                         robin
          really

john turns around surprised sandwiched

                         john
          yeah thats right  you wanna come
          in and shake it for me

                         chuck
          if youre gonna cheat you might as
          well copy off somebody whos gonna
          get the answer right

                         john
          youve gotta be kidding  get the
          fuck outta my way

chuck throws open the engine room door and they shove john
inside

                         john
          what the hell

chuck manages to pin john  robin checks his pockets and
comes up with the crib notes  chuck lets go  john
snatches them ashamed

                         chuck
          takin a piss

john turns away

                         robin
          why man

                         john

                         chuck
          yes you do stupid  because if you
          dont im gonna go right up there
          and have a heart to heart with
          skipper and youll be on the first
          plane back to idiotville

john lunges at chuck sending them both sprawling  robin
leaps on top of john

                         robin
          cut it out man  stop it  whats
          the matter with you  if phil had
          caught you hed have ratted you out
          in a second  you get caught
          cheating youll get kicked off the
          boat

john explodes tears flowing

                         john
          i cheated to get on the boat  all
          right

                         chuck
          what

he lets go of chuck and stands up trying to hide his
emotions

                         john

          cut  im a moron okay  you

          spell  while everybody else is
          sleeping im in the rack with a
          flashlight and a dictionary

          rule

the three turn around startled

                         robin
          how long you been standing there

                         phil

signs of their fight

                         phil
          me too

                         john

          because were your friends


ext  curacao  harbor  dusk

as a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea the
albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks
several hundred yards away  on the dock the students of
the school wait  as soon as the ship is in view they
start to cheer  chuck squints

                         chuck
          what are they doing

                         robin
          i cant make it out

robin calls up to phil who is at the wheelhouse

                         robin
          hey phil swing up the binocs
          and tell us what you see

phil picks up the binoculars and focuses

                         phil
                  puzzled
          theyre waving handkerchiefs or
          something

                         rick
          what

                         charlie
          maybe theyre surrendering

                         phil
          wait a second

phil lowers the binoculars and turns to skipper

                         phil
          theyre girls  theyre all girls

skipper shares a knowing look with alice

                         tod

everyone on board rushes to the port side  every single
person on the dock is a young girl waving a white
handkerchief  spontaneous cheers from the boys

as the big a pulls to the dock john and tod run for the
gunnel door and swing it open  the girls flood the deck

                         bill
          good morning ladies

they chatter in dutch and hurry aboard  like wall
flowers robin phil and chuck stand on top of the chart
house watching utopia unfold before them

                         robin
          what are we supposed to talk about

                         phil

                         phil
          there are some things that everybody
          does in the same language

                         chuck
          yeah but how are you supposed to
          make the first move

                         phil
          like this

phil reaches up for a free line  with a running start he
swings out over the water

                         phil
          yeeee haaaaa

he careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two
startled but impressed girls  robin and chuck applaud
phil takes a bow  all hell is breaking loose

everyone stops and freezes  phil turns disbelieving
its his parents francis and peggy boutillier standing

skipper shoots a look over at phil who is staring a hole
in the deck

                         skipper
          what is it we can do for you today

                         francis

          little break from the monotony

                         phil

francis flushes red

                         francis
          never the less

he turns and joins peggy on the dock  phil is suddenly
full of rage  this is an invasion of his privacy
everyone feels it

                         francis
          hop to boy  we havent got all day

phils anger turns to resigned humiliation  he stops
staring down at his parents  skipper puts a hand on his
shoulder

                         skipper

phil nods head down and walks down the ramp  all watch
him go feeling for him


ext  open water  day

the sails begin to rise but unlike earlier the guys sing
out like the vienna boys choir and its having the desired
impressive effect on the women

                         crew together
          when the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup and not one of us
          was sober kerry thought she saw a
          picture but it really was the sun
          then we knew the party was over

the weather was perfect brisk and steady under the trade
wind swells  the voices trail away as the ship moves off

                         older chuck vo
          curacao seemed out of a dream
          somehow makebelieve  but as ohio
          drew further and further away it
          was home that began to seem unreal
          drifting somewhere in the foggy
          reaches of our memories  and i knew
          that each of us was falling in love
          but not only with these wonderful
          women or the swaying palms and
          porcelain beaches we were falling
          in love with the experience we were
          sharing and with who we were
          becoming


int  main cabin  night

the crew is getting ready for a farewell party  each

                         terry
          screw you valentino  i havent
          seen you swapping spit with anybody

tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket
its a pair of girls cotton underwear

                         tod
          thats because im discrete moron

the guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him  just
then skipper descends the companionway

ms boyde is so flattered it is all she can do to extend

          and i danced under the stars

          on the deck of the yankee the night

          werent much older than they are

by the hand

                         skipper
          would you allow me

shes sixteen again  theres something about him that
still makes her blush

skipper leads her to the dance floor  he hesitates
looking deeply into her eyes  as they begin to dance the
boys notice and exchange looks

lawford and george sit across the quad sipping punch and
smoking cigars

                         george
          if i didnt know better id say the
          old man was acting almost halfway
          human

                         lawford
          he is halfway human

one by one the couples clear for the skipper and his
bride  they glide lost in each others arms  they dance
a dance for the ages  as if it might be for the last
time  the music swells

chuck and bregitta are at the end of the pier a full
moon hangs above the horizon  bregitta doesnt understand
what chuck is saying but its clear shes enjoying him

          about myself a place someone like
          you  weve come such a long way
          seen so much  but nothing like this

bregitta smiles and takes chucks hand  hes nervous

                         chuck
          im not the best at expressing
          myself  maybe the only reason i can
          now is because i know you dont
          understand me
                  beat
          i like you so much  too much  but
          how could i  i mean if we cant

tenderly  then in perfect english

chucks eyes widen astonished  bregitta smiles takes
chuck by the hand and leads him to a small covered boat
moored to the pier

chuck and john hold phil still as robin picks shards of
glass out of his feet  phil clenches his jaw but his
eyes are dry


ext  albatross  day

the ship is under fullsail driving before a brisk
following wind  it takes two on the helm to keep her
safely on course  those not on watch are sprawled about
the boat scraping and redleading or reading  chuck
and robin sit forward with john studying  lawford paces
the deck chiding the crew

                         lawford
          the rust wont wait for you to read
          conrad goodall

                         john
          then he shouldnt have written such
          a long poem mr lawford

                         lawford
          read on young john  read on
          college boards are coming

john looks down dejected  suddenly tod cries from the
foretop

                         tod
          there they blow  there they blow
          dolphins off the bow

everyone rushes to see  dolphins leaping out of the
water  its a magnificent game they play with ships  the
crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea close
enough to touch

isolated phil watches  angry cut off  chuck eyes him
worried

bill and charlie rig the bowswains chair and lower rick
into the water  suddenly the dolphins are everywhere
rick pets them as they swim back and forth  shear joy

phil reaches for the spear gun  nobody notices as he
loads and takes aim

suddenly with a crack everyone spins around  a large
female dolphin leaps out of the water bloody foam
spraying from her blow hole  she lets out an agonizing
scream  phil holds her fast

                         chris
          jesus christ

the crew can only watch stunned  phil is suddenly
defensive as if waking from a dream

                         phil
          fuck off man  its just a fish

                         rick
          no phil  its a mammal

skipper steps on deck sees the dolphin and phil with the
spear gun

                         skipper
                  quietly
          bill lower a long boat  well
          bring her up with the davit

a dory is lowered with john and bill inside  once near
the water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a
canvas harness  the crew hoist her with the davit tackle
swing her inboard and gently lower her to the deck

they gather around the gasping animal  alice checks the
wound  skipper kneels beside her

                         skipper
          what do you think

alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin

                         alice
          its through her lung

skipper turns to phil

                         skipper
                  to phil
          nice shot

phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away
chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last
to look away  skipper grimly walks over to one of the
deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds
it out to phil

                         skipper
          finish it

phil looks at the mallet horrified

                         phil
                  stammering
          im not gonna kill it

                         skipper
          you already have  now go on  do
          it

phil backs away  skipper stares at him for a moment then
walks over to the dolphin  robin looks away  the
sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the
animal seems to silence the world  there are one of two
thumps of her tail and its over

skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and
approaches phil his face flushed with anger  he grabs
the spear gun and snaps it across his knee and throws the
pieces into the sea

                         skipper
          what the hell is wrong with you

phil begins to shake with rage

                         skipper
          come on  you got so much fight in
          you you wanna kill something  take
          your best shot  the first ones
          free

robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away
for a brief moment phil looks as if he might take skipper
up on the challenge  then the impulse passes

                         skipper
          thats what i thought
                  beat
          youre done  youre going home

skipper turns  the humiliation is more than phil can
take  he lunges after skipper  lawford grabs him  phil
swings wildly

                         phil
          you meanassed bastard  you son of
          a bitch  you cant do this  you
          cant do this  god damn you
          god damn you

the dead dolphin stunned

everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say  phil
turns to get a second load

                         phil
                  regretting it

          about yourself

                         chuck

                         skipper

chuck does as he is told

                         skipper
          why do you think im sending him
          home

                         chuck
          he killed the dolphin

skipper looks at chuck for a moment

                         skipper
          the dolphin was a symptom

                         chuck
          of what

                         skipper
          of a fight he cant win out here

          its his father sir  hes
          suffocating him  weve all seen
          it

                         chuck
          i mean he has all these expectations
          and he doesnt even know who his own

          they send us because they want us to
          change or grow up or something and
          then they try to keep us the same

skipper sits up and studies chuck for a moment

                         skipper
          let me tell you something about
          phils father and yours too  how
          do you think you got here  you
          think this is all free that they
          owe you something  you think they
          enjoy riding subways and commuter
          trains driving buses or pulling
          lobster traps  work fifty weeks a
          year to keep you in tennis shoes and
          private school  look around at how
          the rest of the world lives chuck
          were the luckiest people alive
          every one of us  they gave it up
          for you and phil and me too my
          friend

chuck chews on it

                         skipper
          there are ground rules in families
          just like on this boat  if you and
          phil dont like it im sorry
          someday youll understand that and
          if youre lucky youll come home
          and find your best friend has been
          there all along waiting for you to
          forgive him for being a father
          itll be the way it used to be
          when you were ten and your dad was a
          giant

watching him  he senses it

          im all ears

alice smiles

                         alice

                         skipper

          theyre a crew  thats why he came

skipper puts a loving hand on alices shoulder

                         skipper
          why did we begin this

                         alice
          we were idealists

                         skipper
          because we believed we could make an
          impact out here  self reliance and
          community through the disciplines of
          sailing

                         alice
          i havent forgotten

                         skipper
          phil hes not looking inside  hes
          just striking out at the world

                         alice
          he has a lot of hurt inside him

                         skipper
          well he better learn to own it
          actions have consequences
                  beat
          its not what happens here alice
          its what they take away with them

alice runs her hands across his face

                         alice
          youre still an idealist

skipper turns and slips into her arms

                         skipper
          oh hell

is robin  with the ships bell in his teeth he is
sweating every rung  perspiration glistens on his brow
the crew watches transfixed as he fights his way towards
the foretop


ext  dock  same

phil turns to skipper  working up some courage to say
something anything  but all that comes out is

                         phil
          im sorry

a pause between them

                         skipper

his hand in a single wave of acknowledgement  the ringing
stops as his eyes meet robins  waves back  skipper

robin watches as the limo pulls away  he rings the bell
wildly  the crew below wave in a show of silent protest

                         older chuck vo
          as robin rang him out we waved in
          silent protest against skippers
          decision  and in the days that
          followed the low morale was matched
          only by a sense of arrogance that
          perhaps the master should step down
          and let his students take over

slowly away as we climb turning higher and higher

grabs chuck by the arm and pulls him aside  morale is
extremely low

          tod

alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest  tod starts
to pull up his shorts

                         alice
          not so fast

she pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic
needle  tods embarrassment turns to alarm


ext  deck  later

the crew stand in line pissed  lawford and george man
the deck with skipper and exchange amused looks  the door
opens and chris exits red faced rubbing his backside
he glares at tod who sits on the paint locker

                         chris
          waytago valentino  i never even
          copped a feel in curacao

          havent had

                         charlie
          so much for vestal virgins

lawford swings up a pair of binoculars  a vessel under
power is coming up fast behind them  he holds the binocs
out to skipper

                         lawford
          what do you make of that

skipper turns and looks

                         skipper
          i dont know

the ship pulls along the port side keeping a couple
hundred yards between them  the boys move to the rail
george sees them first

                         george
          jesus  shes got guns

                         skipper
          shes cuban

everyone becomes alarmed  even alice looks concerned
suddenly a puff of smoke discharges from the gun boat

                         skipper
                  shouting
          get down  everybody down

the entire crew hit the deck as a shell rockets across the
bow exploding in the water

                         skipper
          jesus were americans  were
          americans

skipper grabs the american flag and starts waving it

                         terry
          jesus theyre gonna sink us

                         skipper
          bill drop everything  do it now

the crew scrambles for the rigging frantically dropping
sail

                         skipper
                  hitting each word
          who the hell do they think they are

as the sail comes down the albatross slows to a stop
the cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud
speaker in spanish  the seas are high and the two ships
rise and fall with the large swells between them

                         george
          they want us to identify ourselves

chuck returns with a bull horn

                         skipper
          tell them were the american school
          ship albatross

george replies in spanish over the bull horn  the cubans
answer

                         george
          they think were carrying cuban
          refugees
                  beat
          skipper they mean to board us

                         skipper
          not a chance  remind them that
          according to the geneva convention
          firing on a civilian vessel on the
          high sea is an act of war

another exchange between george and the cubans  the crew
lay flat on the deck terrified

                         george
          they say they are acting on the
          direct authority of fidel castro

skipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail  the
cuban captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps
into the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels
around pointing both barrels at the albatross  skipper
stands firm between the shrouds  silence  a standoff

                         skipper
          tell em to come aboard

george sends the return message  there is a pause then
the murmurs of the relieved crew  skipper swings down but
never takes his eyes off the gunboat

                         skipper
                  to crew
          weve come a long way gentlemen
          but this is no time for heroes  i
          know youre much more but i need you
          to be boys right now  thats an
          order  now scatter and find your

scrambles to dig up his passport  terry sits among his
things dazed  bill notices

          whats wrong


ext  deck  day

a small launch filled with cuban soldiers approaches the
albatross  the crew climb on deck and line up along the
chart house with their passports  lawford walks up to
skipper

                         lawford
          weve got a problem

                         skipper
          whats that

                         lawford
          terry left his passport in curacao
          we could hide him

                         skipper
          no  bring him on deck with the
          others

the cubans cast their lines up and climb aboard carrying
side arms  terry reluctantly joins his crew mates  the
commanding officer faces skipper as his men go down the
line checking the passports  others search the ship

                         commander
          chicken is a fools game captain

                         skipper
          so is violating international law

                         commander
          but you invited is aboard

                         skipper
          your cannons made a compelling
          argument

one of the cubans pulls terry out of line and brings him
forward  he alerts the commander in spanish

                         commander
          stow away

                         skipper
          he left his passport in curacao
          its being mailed to panama

                         commander
          that is unfortunate  well have to
          take him with us

terry is petrified

                         lawford
          if hes a cuban castro wears a
          dress

                         skipper
          nobody aboard my ship is going
          anywhere

skipper stares him down  the commander signals to one of
his men who disappears into the chart house

                         commander
          perhaps in appreciation for our
          countrys pursuit of peace you
          might offer us some token of
          gratitude

skipper doesnt really have a choice

                         skipper
          what do you want

the cuban returns from the chart house with the ships
sextant and hands it to the commander

                         commander
          this  and

pointing to the ships compass

                         commander
           and that

                         george
          youve got to be kidding

                         skipper
                  cold
          take it

without hesitation the cubans pull the large brass compass
from its base

                         skipper
          now get the hell off my ship

as they leave the ship they pause  the commander looks
back at the skipper then deliberately drops both sextant
and compass into the sea

                         commander
          youll really have something to
          teach your students now

skipper stands towering above them  the cuban captain
smiles up at him  amazingly skipper addresses him in
perfect spanish

                         skipper
          las estrellas es lo unico que un
          marinero verdadero se mesesita para
          encontrarse  verdade patron

the cubans stare back frowning amazed as they motor
away

the crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed
skipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration humility
and complete respect  he joins alice at the helm  they
linger for a moment

                         chuck
          whatd he say

george smiles impressed as well

                         george
          he told them real sailors need only
          the stars

with a new attitude they turn to skipper

                         skipper
          alright then lets get outta here

the crew bolt to there positions

                         older chuck vo
          with staff and string he showed us
          how to build a sextant  as we rode
          the trades he shared the ancient
          secrets of how to read the waves and
          follow stars  and some mornings
          later bathed in the orange glow of
          a sunrise panama rose from the sea
          like a phoenix

panama appears on the horizon  the albatross is dwarfed
by the huge freighters moored around her as she moves
through the locks  the crew stand on deck in quiet
reverence


int  main cabin  night

the sounds of slumber fill the cabin  all seems well with
the world  suddenly silhouettes in the darkness  a huge
bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a
trident in his hand

chuck wakes with a start  he bolts upright to see the
horrible figure of neptune himself lawford towering
before him  he tries to scream but hands cover his
mouth  he is dragged struggling up the companionway


ext  deck  night

the albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship
where the sails once were only shredded fabric  all of
the crew have been brought on deck  powdered faces glow
surreal

johns head has been shaved into a mohawk  robin rick
and chris have been reduced to crew cuts  the shears
start over chucks head  neptune and his sidekick davey
jones george and two mermaids bill and alice emerge
with the rest of the crew

                         neptune
          hold fast that polliwog and make him
          presentable

chuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face
powdered

                         neptune
          let it be known that on this day in
          the year nineteen hundred and sixty
          one there appeared within the limits
          of my royal kingdom the sailing
          ship brigantine albatross bound for
          galapagos  all vessels that sail my
          domain shall be subject to the
          scrutiny of the underworld

terry is brought topside kicking and screaming

                         neptune
          silence

terry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest

                         neptune
          tonight you shall all enter the
          order of the shellbacks  only when
          you have been duly initiated shall
          you enjoy the mysteries and
          protection of the trident  so let
          the festivities begin

member of the crew present themselves  robin dressed like
a pig and crawls around snorting

a rain dance  chuck with flippers on his hands and feet
hops around like a frog  rick is in drag as neptunes
girlfriend and must sing everything he says  charlie is
dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck
frenetic chaos


ext  deck  later

neptune and his court lead a procession around the
perimeter of the deck  the crew follows  they stamp
their feet and chant

                         all
          hell is to drift heaven to steer
          hell is to drift heaven to steer
          hell is to drift heaven to steer

they move faster and faster around the boat  they shout
louder and louder faster and faster until they have all
worked themselves into a frenzy


ext  bow  dawn

davey jones holds a large turtle shell over the crews
heads  as each one passes before him he pours blood from
the turtle shell onto their heads  it runs down
streaking their floured faces and necks  as the ritual
progresses neptune speaks

                         neptune
          by virtue of the power inherited by
          me i do hereby command all of my
          subjects such as mermaids sea

          and turtles from eating playing
          with or otherwise molesting this

ext  galapagos islands  day

the crew stop their celebrating and gather at the port
bow  ahead glowing orange with the dawn the islands of
galapagos  its desolate landscape of silent volcanoes
and ancient lava flows that spill into the sea

the faces of the boys still streaked with the indignities
of the nights ordeal stand silently before their final
destination

                         older chuck vo
          we had journeyed over six thousand
          miles to the very edge of the earth
          like darwin before us we would
          witness the bliss of nature in the
          absence of man  and it was as if
          the albatross had forded time
          leaving it behind  in the heat of
          those equatorial days on the virgin
          onyx beaches and shifting coral
          dunes one could expect to find
          sunning iguanas nesting frigates
          and perchance the footprints of
          god


ext  beach  shipwreck bay  day

the albatross rests at anchor  on the beach the crew
watch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the
ancient guano cliffs  so unaccustomed are these creatures
to man that they have no fear

batting an eye  chuck and robin watch as the iguanas
sneak into unattended nests and steal eggs

finches darken the sky circling the black sand beach
pure magic


ext  beach  day

beyond the anchored albatross rocks and bounces in a
bluesky gale  chuck john robin rick chris and tod
stand by a dory watching the sea build  they wear only
tattered shorts their hair sun bleached and their skin
dark

tight  the eyes of predators  sharp cunning hungry


ext  black sand beach  day

a lone wild goat grazes on the beach  it looks up
sensing something unfamiliar then returns to its
grazing

tight  thundering bare feet on the black sand

the goat looks up again this time it sees five
homosapiens bearing down on him  they come naked
swinging their shredded clothing above their heads like
lassos  shouting whooping primal  the goat bolts for
its life

pounding through the waterline like the wild horses of
sable the hunters charge after the hunted closing  the
goats eyes are full of a terror it has never known

the beach is broad and long with no cover  the hunters
are gaining on the goat  splashing feet pound closer

suddenly they are upon the goat  but instead of
attacking it they just run through it passing it  the
goat pulls up and stops breathless watching the naked
humans run

close on the faces of brothers matching each other step
for step  the music builds as we

freeze frame


ext  beach  night

wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man
the rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting
the heaping of driftwood into piles  taught and powerful
the glistening bodies of young men

blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone  a
flame is born  voices howl in guttural triumph

as the flames leap and singe the darkness silhouettes of
men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance

the goat watches from the shadows bemused as the dance
builds to a frenzy  the night sky is filled with the
building sound of raging fire pounding surf and chanting
voices


ext  albatross  same

the wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water
the flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning
the white hull of the ship a deep flickering orange  the
word albatross has been spelled in huge flaming
letters  alice joins skipper at his place by the rail
watching

                         alice
          what are they doing

                         skipper
          claiming their place in the world


ext  shoreline  dawn

the white surf hisses as it washes among the cinders of
the evenings ritual  the galapagos have been returned
for now to the frigates and the iguanas

across the water against the rising sun the albatross
under full sail is bound for home

the crew stand at their posts  the yards and foretop are
trimmed with sailors their faces taught and their bodies
hard  no one looks back

in her hands

int  main cabin  dawn

the crew sleep in their bunks  lawfords voice rumbles
down the companionway

                         lawford
          a wet sheet and a flowing sea a
          wind that follows fast and fills
          the white and rushing sail and
          bends the gallant mast arise arise
          you salty dogs  the watch is on

chuck tom john terry and tod roll out  the dumb waiter
clatters down from the galley with the mornings

eating

the albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage
of what little wind there is  the skies are gray and
dank  tod and terry are at the helm  chuck and john are
amid ship  john relieves bill on the forward watch

                         chuck
          looks like were gonna get wet

                         bill

          save some for me will you

                         bill
          you got it  im going below

suddenly a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky
and strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard
beam  everyone jumps

                         tod
          jesus

skipper bolts onto the deck

                         skipper
          everybody okay

the crew nod sheepishly  a very close call

                         skipper
          all hands keep out of the rigging
          and stay clear of the masts

the clouds grow dark but no more lighting  tod laughs
nervously  everybody joins in  its contagious  even
skipper manages a smile

                         skipper
          all right gentlemen  thors had his
          fun  lets keep a keen eye

skipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly a
powerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree
list to the starboard  skipper stops and turns

instinctively john and chuck spring for the rigging to
drop sail

                         skipper
                  sharply
          no  stay down

skipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra
waiting  the wind eases  it becomes eerily still  the
ship slows and the sails go slack  silence  skipper
maintains his vigil

close on water

foam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like
the invisible footprint of a locomotive  john sees it
first

                         john
                  shouting
          here it comes

everybody turns and looks  skippers eyes suddenly widen
as he realizes

                         skipper
                  in a whisper
          white squall

the charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard
it send a shudder throughout the ship  the wheel is
nearly ripped out of tods hands  instinctively he tries
to turn the ship into the wind

                         skipper
          hard to starboard  hard to
          starboard

confused panicked tod keeps turning to the left into
the wind  skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when
the ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the
deck

                         tod
          no hard to port

                         skipper
          turn the god damned wheel to the
          right

finally tod does as he is told  but as soon as the ship
starts to come about the vicious wind drives her further
onto her side  as the deck becomes vertical chuck half
slips half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel


int  main cabin  same

robin chris bill mike and rick are seated at the table
finishing breakfast as the ship starts to go  they all
share growing alarm as they watch the table reach its
maximum angle  dishes start sliding off

                         bill
          get out  everybody out


ext  deck  same

skipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house
and cuts the mainsheet with a single blow  but its too
late  the tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails
scoop tons of sea water pinning the albatross on her
side

of the wall and strikes her  she drops to her knees  the
door swings open in front of her  she reels for a moment
and then loses consciousness

bunks  the world is suddenly sideways  lawford leaps up
pushing the others towards the companionway ladder

          go go go  topside  come on
          charlie  george get them out

george disappears into the main cabin  lawford manages to
get charlie out  as lawford reaches the top of the ladder
sea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back
into the bowels of the ship


int  main cabin  same

robin is through the companionway in the chart house with
mike right behind him  but instead of exiting he holds
the door open against the sea so that mike can escape

mike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it
closed pinning robins arm  he struggles to push
through


ext  deck  same

john slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat
with his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged
to the bottom  he scrambles through the collapsed rigging
tangled above him for the port lifeboat

at the stern

the albatross is going down  fast  chuck and tod stand
on the after skylight  chuck catches glimpses of the
struggle going on below

                         chuck
          my god theyre drowning

skipper catches a glimpse of alice through the skylight
water washes over her but she doesnt move

                         skipper
          oh please no  not this woman


int  skippers cabin  same

skippers face is pressed hard against the skylight  his
muffled voice penetrates the cabin  alice stirs  she
looks around delirious

                         skipper
          alice get up  come on girl

he pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the
planks fingers bleeding  alice looks up confused but
calm and finds skippers eyes

on the deck

panicked for the first time in his life slipper swings the
ax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of
splinters into the water

                         skipper
          get out  get out  jesus christ
          please god alice get out

but after only two swings the albatross and alice slip
beneath the sea


int  main cabin  same

water thunders in from every possible exit  chris and
rick push bill towards the dumbwaiter   

                         rick
          bill you go  well be right behind
          you

before he can say no rick and chris jam bill into the
tiny shaft  suddenly from below a tremendous geyser
smashes him to the top knocking him unconscious  but the
pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the
galley and out onto the deck


ext  deck  same

skipper struggles to reach john and the second life boat
but sees that it is tangled in the rigging

                         skipper
          johnny its not good

john defies him and keeps cutting  the ship is almost
completely submerged

                         john
          i can get it

suddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges
into the water taking lines and rope with it  john
becomes tangled and is dragged into the water  only his
superior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and
keep cutting

the albatross slips beneath the surface  instead of
trying to free himself john keeps slashing at the lifeboat
lines as he disappears swallowed by the sea


int  forward compartment  same

eerie silence  lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket
debris float around  he begins to panic as the water
around him rises

                         lawford
          my god  oh god im dying

he takes a deep breath and the water consumes him  then
suddenly the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure
within

on the surface

lawford is catapulted from the grip of death to the
surface


ext  surface  same

chuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house
door as the ship takes the deep six  suddenly the ship
rolls 180 degrees her screws exposed and keel jutting up
like a huge dorsal fin


ext  underwater  same

chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still
finds robins arm  they clasp tightly but chuck just
cant budge the door  then strangely robin releases
chucks arm and pulls it back through the door  chuck
looks up startled  the small round window in the door is
illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside

through the glass chuck meets robins frightened eyes
he fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket  robin takes
a last gulp of air then a calm comes over him

he meets chucks eyes again but this time with a strange
acceptance  they both know whats happening  but robin
has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him  he
presses his hand to the glass  chuck does the same  then
with a smile robin pushes himself away from the door
disappearing into the darkness and eternity


ext  surface  same

chuck breaks the surface gasping for air  he looks
around frantic  he sees nothing but the sea swells and
debris  all that remains is the sound of the wind and
rain on the water

suddenly beneath him a massive rumbling and explosion of
foam  then the tops of twin masts rise out of the water
like shattered lances as the ship rights herself
underwater  she holds herself steady for a moment as if
in a final attempt at resurrection the albatross begins
to rise  faster and faster until her entire length
explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave

on the deck

like ahab before him john appears lashed in a web of
tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long
boat

and for a moment it looks as if she might stay there as
if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea  some
of the boys begin to cheer prematurely  but skipper knows
better  shes filled to the gills with sea water

she shutters  then like a stone she just drops sucked
to the center of the earth johns hands still slashing
as she finally goes

pull back to reveal

survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the
watery tempest  strangely the wind subsides  the sea
becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the
water

                         chuck
          oh god

his scream echoes for the grief of all

on the surface

there is an explosion of bubbles and then she slips
beneath the waves like a stone  the stunned crew can only
watch

then as if by magic the second life boat erupts to the
surface

skipper fights off his emotions  he knows what it means
john died cutting it free

terry and bill hang onto a life ring  blood runs from
bills head  charlie mike and several others hold onto
the side of the other freed life boat which has been
swamped  lawford floats on his back unconscious but
alive  several of the boys help pull him towards the
boat

skipper swims to the second boat desperately looking for
those not accounted for  but they are gone

among the wreckage the roof of the chart house  the only
sound left is the ominous tolling of the ships bell
robins bell still secure in its fitting


ext  life boat  day

the boats have been floated and tied together  skipper is
in one lawford in the other  one of the two boats has
been rigged with sail  skipper stands in the bow staring
into the ink blue water

                         skipper
          raise your sail bill  north north
          east  keep a sharp look out for
          florida

bill studies him for a moment then

                         bill
          maybe we could wait around a little
          longer sir

there is a long pause before skipper answers

                         skipper
                  quietly
          shes gone shes gone

there is something remarkably touching about this young
man trying to take care of him  he puts a hand on
skippers shoulder  it almost makes him crack  he pats
bills hand gently

                         skipper
          carry on

                         bill
          yes sir

                         skipper
          north northeast
                  beat
          and dick please make a note of our
          final position

lawford nods sullenly  chuck looks out at the floating
wreckage around them silent lost

suddenly there is a thump on the hull of the boat  the
survivors share a confused look  then it comes again

chuck looks out at the surface of the water  its
suddenly alive with sharks

                         lawford
          hands and feet inside the boats

they come by the dozens  ramming the boats and rummaging
through the debris  they swarm around the boats until it
seems as if the water is boiling  chuck picks up an oar
and starts beating wildly at the sharks

                         chuck
          aaaahhhh

the others take up the cause and in a moment they are all
screaming and cursing the sharks  its a frenzy of grief
and anger

                         older chuck vo
          we slashed at the sharks as if
          striking out at the finger of god
          and we all begged silently for the
          ability to understand what had
          happened  but if there was a god
          that day his answer came only in
          the moaning wind and our questions
          were left to drift unanswered in
          the titanic ocean of our deepest
          grief

exhausted chuck stops slashing and stares out  lost

                         chuck
                  hushed
          wake up  wake up  123 wake up

like robins nightmare of his brother this is all too
real

door where sobbing escapes from the other side  chuck
turns the handle and cracks the door

look of shock comes over chucks face  skipper has come
completely unglued sobbing deeply

                         chuck
                  tentative
          skipper

skipper turns slowly looking up  his eyes are red and
his face streaked with tears  he looks at chuck almost as
if he doesnt know who he is  lost

                         skipper
          im sorry  im so sorry

chuck reels  it sounds more like a confession than an
outpouring of sadness  chuck closes the door

dressed in the clothes from the gran rio perspiration
beads on his skin

                         chuck
                  calling out
          okay

tears stream down his face  he looks up and sees himself
in the mirror  the eyes that look back are eyes of the
ages  involuntary sobs  he begins to shake  the tiny
booth suddenly like a crypt  tight with no air  chuck
lets out a gasp

                         chuck
          oh god

someone pulls open the curtain  a man from the next
booth fat and middle aged stands before chuck in a pair
of pants still sporting the price tags  he looks down

                         man
          you okay kid

chuck is suddenly in the throws of a fullon anxiety
attack  he leaps up and pushes past the man


ext  dressing room  same

chuck explodes out of the dressing room  running almost
blind he crashes into a rack of clothes  charles looks
up as he scrambles to his feet and bolts for the doors

          felt like you would take care of
          things that everything would be
          okay

          but you cant make this okay can

and walk back towards the boardwalk and the world


int  coast guard headquarters  night

skipper sits across from a coast guard officer tyler 60
tyler pulls out a file and lays it on the table

                         tyler
          there are allegations questioning
          your competence with regard to the
          command of the albatross  i have
          been instructed to convene a formal
          tribunal to determine whether or not
          negligence played a part in the
          sinking

                         skipper
          i understand

                         tyler
          may i ask you something

skipper nods

                         tyler
          howd you manage to piss off a guy
          as powerful as francis boutillier

                         skipper
          it wasnt hard

                         tyler
          i used to helm a school ship  a
          long time ago

                         skipper
          the coast guard eagle  she never
          lost a race while you were skipper

tyler is taken aback by skippers knowledge

                         tyler
          thats right we didnt  i miss it
          sometimes  but there are other
          things a skipper can do

tyler removes his glasses and studies skipper

                         tyler
          the families want your ticket
          turn it in we forget the whole
          thing  everybody goes home

                         skipper
           absolutely not

                         tyler
          the papers are going to eat you
          alive  even if you beat it youll
          never get another commission
                  beat
          they want someone to be accountable

                         skipper

          to know that

                         terry
          thats not what skipper thought  he
          was trying to spill air from the
          main

                         bill
          it was coming four points off the
          bow terry  he never could have
          gotten her around

                         terry
          were you on deck  i was standing
          right there and all i know is he
                  indicates tod
           disobeyed an order twice and
          the boat went over

                         tod
          it didnt go over til i turned her
          starboard

                         bill
          it was an act of god for christs
          sake

                         terry
          it was an act of stupidity

tod lunges at terry  bill and charlie pull them apart

                         tod
                  screaming
          was it my fault we were running all
          that sail  was it my fault she
          wasnt dogged down  huh  i
          couldnt help that the ballast
          shifted  you son of a bitch
          it wasnt my fault  it wasnt

tod breaks down sodding on his knees

                         bill
          its okay tod

terry drags on a cigarette then grinds out the butt

                         terry
          then whose

tod looks up along with bill and charlie all confused

                         terry
          after the lightning strike we tried
          to go aloft to drop sail  wed done
          it a thousand times  we didnt have
          to wait for an order  but skipper
          called us down

                         charlie
          if the foremast had taken a strike
          everyone in the rigging wouldve
          been fried  what would you have
          done

                         terry
          we would have scalloped the squares
          from the deck  right bill

bill turns and stares into the water troubled

                         tod
          thats right thats right  bleed
          the sails from the deck and she
          couldve taken a hurricane

its a strong argument  even charlie is troubled by the
implication  there is a long moment of silence between
them

                         chuck
          this is crazy  nothing could have
          prevented what happened

                         mike
          you guys are missing the point
          this is all because of phil  phil
          and his dear old dad

                         bill
          what

                         mike
          how do you think they got this
          together so fast  hes been laying
          for skipper since the first day

                         charlie
          come on  like hes got a vendetta
          or some such shit

                         mike
          you got it
                  to chuck
          i told you he was a turn coat the
          day we kicked him off the boat

chuck frowns troubled

                         chuck
          no  youre wrong

                         mike
          im telling you the only way to
          change this is to get phil to call
          off his old man  and that aint
          gonna happen  so the way i see it
          its skipper or us

the guys react  its a no win situation


ext  motel  night

chuck knocks quietly on the door  phil answers the door

phil meets chucks eyes then looks away

                         phil
          im sorry

he turns again and reaches for the door

                         chuck
          wait

chuck hands him something  phil looks down disbelieving
its the ships bell  robins bell  their symbol of
unity of putting loyalty above fear

                         chuck
          we figured hed have wanted you to
          have it
                  beat
          you do what youve gotta do phil

he leaves phil standing alone on the porch full of
emotion trying to grasp it all


int  hearing room  day

a small courtroom  the room is filled with the crew
members and their families including the parents of the
victims as well as the media  phil sits with his father
and dodges chucks eyes  coast guard officers tyler
downing and sanders head the proceedings

                         tyler
          the united states coast guard has
          been asked to conduct this maritime
          hearing to consider the revocation
          of captain richard sheldrakes us
          master seamans certificate


int  hearing room  later

bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are
leveled at him  chief petty officers sanders and downing
ask most of the questions as tyler oversees the
proceedings

                         sanders
          why didnt you drop any sail

                         bill
          skipper called us out of the
          rigging

                         sanders
          but your instinct was to lose sail

                         bill
          my instinct was to not get
          electrocuted

                         sanders
          how old are you son

                         bill
                  hesitating
          fifteen

                         sanders
          thank you

later

phil is at the table with francis  sanders asks the
questions

                         sanders
          philip why were you discharged from
          the albatross

phil doesnt look up and speaks in whispers

                         phil
          skipper thought i was a challenge to
          authority

                         sanders
          were you

                         phil
          i dont know

later

                         francis
          captain sheldrake exhibited an
          arrogant controlling attitude in my
          presence on more than one occasion
          i believe he had a personality
          conflict with my son from the start

                         sanders
          well if you dont mind my asking
          sir why did you let your son stay

francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly

                         francis
          it was his dream to go  i could
          hardly stand in the way of that
          could i

phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode


int  hearing room  later

it is skippers turn at the table

                         sanders
          is it true that you forced robin
          weathers to climb the mast when it
          was clear that he was acrophobic

                         skipper
          he climbed when he was ready

                         sanders
          were you aware that his brother was
          killed in a fall

chuck and the others look up astonished  mike shoots a
look towards phil

                         mike
          he did it man  he sang like a bird

skipper hesitates

                         skipper
          yes i was

whispers fill the room

                         sanders
          sir were you aware at any time of
          the use of alcohol among the crew

                         skipper
          yes i was

                         tyler
          and you didnt do anything about it

                         skipper
                  beat
          no  i didnt

again the crew members are struck  charlie turns to
chuck

                         charlie
          theyre twisting it all around  why
          doesnt he say something

                         sanders
          had you ever seen a white squall
          before this incident

                         skipper
          no

                         sanders
          what makes you so sure it was one

                         skipper
          i cant be sure

                         sanders
          you really felt that your crew were
          up for the conditions

                         skipper
          wed come twelve thousand miles
          together through every kind of seas
          imaginable

                         sanders
          except a white squall
                  beat
          with all due respect captain
          sheldrake theyre only boys

                         skipper
          they are much more than that sir

                         sanders
          is it true that the reason you
          expelled philip boutillier

                         skipper
                  cutting him off
          for killing a dolphin

                         sanders
           and that you invited him to
          strike you  to fight it out on the
          deck of your ship

skipper looks over at francis  phil stares at the floor
skipper manages an ironic smile

                         skipper
          yes thats true

                         sanders
          do you think this is funny  some
          kind of joke  you lost six people
          out there

                         skipper
                  white hot
          i dont think one second of this is
          funny sir

skipper stares down sanders  he turns to tyler

                         sanders
          i have no more questions at this
          time

he turns to sit down then stops

                         sanders
          oh one last thing isnt true
          that your father was a sea captain

skipper bristles

                         skipper
          yes

                         sanders
          isnt also true that his vessel went
          down off of nantucket  lost
          everyone on board  in fair weather
          no less

skippers silence is suddenly filled with rage  tyler
sees it and tries to intercept

                         tyler
          what does this have to do with
          anything mr sanders

                         sanders
                  smug
          oh nothing  i was just curious

                         skipper
          my father was more seaman more of
          a man than you might ever hope to
          be

sanders returns to his seat rattled  tyler pounds his
gavel

                         tyler
          well take a brief recess


ext  building  day

the crew huddle in the parking lot  fractured confused
chuck tod charlie and bill stand off by themselves

                         tod
          theres still a way

                         bill
          what do you mean

                         tod
          its me dont you see  terrys
          right im the escape hatch  i
          disobeyed order

                         chuck
          you taking the order wouldnt have
          changed anything

                         tod
          they dont know that
                  beat
          we were the only ones on deck
          look theres nothing they can do to
          me right  im a kid

                         chuck
          but thats not the point

                         tod
          that is the point and skipperll
          slip off the hook

later

tod is on the stand

                         downing
          why didnt you turn hard to port as
          the wind hit

                         tod
          i thought wed have a better chance
          if i headed into the wind so we
          could spill air from our sails

tyler removes his glasses

                         downing
          but the captain ordered you hard to
          starboard

                         tod
          twice

                         downing
          is that what you were trained to do

                         tod
          no

                         downing
          then what do you think he was trying
          to do

                         tod
          let the blow drive the boat down
          wind  neutralize our canvas

skipper is becoming uneasy  he sees what is coming

                         downing
          so when the captain gave you an
          order contrary to your training you
          thought he was making a mistake

                         tod
          no

                         tyler
          then why son why didnt you follow
          his order

tod meets skippers eyes

                         tod
          because  i panicked

the room is suddenly buzzing  tods father stands up

                         tods father
          thats not true tod

                         terry
                  to mike
          what the hell  what is he doing

                         mike
          son of a gun  he just sent skipper
          a life boat

tyler turns to skipper

                         tyler
          if this young man had responded
          instantly to your command do you
          believe the ship might have been
          spared

                         skipper
          i dont know that anything could
          have prevented what happened

                         tyler
          then what are you trying to say
          then

skipper stands

                         skipper
          maybe you cant see whats happening
          here but its clear to me
                  to tod
          i appreciate what youre trying to
          do tod  maybe you could live with
          it but i couldnt
                  to tribunal
          if you think im going to let a
          sixteen year old take
          responsibility then you
          underestimate me  the albatross was
          my ship  the ocean academy was my
          school  her loss is mine and mine
          alone
                  to others
          i cant bring your sons back  if
          you want my ticket if that will
          ease your loss its the least i
          can do  this

skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license

                         skipper
          this is easy  living with it
          thatll be hard

skipper turns and lays his license down in front of tyler
then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the
room

the room erupts  crew members and their families hurl
accusations and blame  cameras flash  tyler tries to
regain control  suddenly chuck stands tall

                         chuck
          no  dont you walk away  not
          now  not after all of this

skipper keeps walking  his head slumps  tyler pounds his
gavel

                         tyler
          that enough son  order  please

tears begin to stream down chucks face  his father
charles slowly stands meeting his sons eyes  go for it

                         chuck
          tell me skipper was it all just a
          lie  where we go one we go all
          we listened to you  we believed it
          and were still here

skipper keeps moving

                         chuck
          shame on you then skipper  shame on
          you

skipper reaches for the door  suddenly a sound stops him
cold in his tracks  phil slowly rises  tears streaming
down his face  tightly in his hands he grips the ships
bell  ding ding  ding ding  ding ding  it is the
ringing of the truth  the tolling of their unity

                         francis
          sit down

phil ignores him  skipper slowly walks over his eyes
never leaving phils  he stops facing him  he gently
takes his hands and silences the bell  then he smiles and
puts a hand on the back of phils head fighting his own
emotions  he turns to chuck

                         chuck
          tell them the truth  make them
          understand

the room grows silent

                         skipper
                  smiling
          you tell them chuck

chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room

                         chuck
          its simple  bad things happen
          sometimes  it wasnt skipper or
          tod  it was all of us  everyone in
          this room  because we all knew the
          risks
                  to parents
          you sent us you paid our tuition
          you allowed us to go  so to invent
          a reason for why this happened to
          pin it on one person well that
          wont change anything  itll just
          make our experience meaningless

he turns to the tribunal

                         chuck
          if you want to judge this man judge
          him by his crew  judge him by alice
          and george  chris and john and
          robin  in one way or another each
          one of them gave their lives saving
          one of us  this may sound crazy but
          the albatross wasnt just a ship or
          even a school  it was something
          that we made thats inside us
          thats who skipper is  thats what
          he taught us  i guess what it
          really was about was the
          privilege of sacrifice

chuck turns to skipper

                         chuck
          isnt that right

skipper nods

                         skipper
          thats right

the room is silent  then a voice  a golden tenor
singing like the wind  everyone turns  its bill

                         bill
          when the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup and not a one of
          us was sober

one by one the crew members stand and begin to sing
chuck turns surprised to see his father rise and stand
with him  words or not

                         crew together
          jenny thought she saw a picture when
          it really was the sun then we knew
          the party was over

they all stand facing skipper and sing  the voices build
sweeping over everyone like a wave

                         crew together
          oh my heart is sad for leaving you
          today but i know well meet again
          when the moon is in the valley and
          the leafs are on the trees we will
          come to clearly in the glen

skipper meets chucks eyes and those of his mates  only
now is his job finished  he beams back  the music swells
like an anthem building like a swell lifting a small
wooden boat over a jagged reef until it rests safely in
the calm waters beyond

the crew come together around skipper one last time  they
embrace


ext  mystic seaport  harbor  day

older chuck has returned to the small building where the
funeral services were held earlier  the people have gone
but the funeral urn remains


ext  pier  day

chuck walks to the dock  he has the funeral urn in his
hands  he steps aboard a small sailboat and begins
untying her  the harbor master notices and steps out of
his office

                         harbor master
          what do you think youre doing

he walks over to the dock

                         harbor master
          all right friend out of the boat

he tries to board the boat but chuck greets him with the
sharp end of a gaffing hook

                         older chuck
                  softly
          stand away

he looks into chucks eyes and sees that he means
business  he backs off  chucks pushes away and raises
the sail  the harbor master watches perplexed as the
small boat moves off for open water


ext  open sea  sunset

bathed in the orange glow of the sun chuck stands naked
against the ivory sail

          they didnt take his ticket that
          day  but why he never returned to
          the sea id never know  perhaps he
          hadnt been able to free himself
          from the anchor of grief that had
          driven him to his knees aboard the
          gran rio or that he no longer cared
          for the solitude and isolation of
          command without his alice  or maybe
          it was just that the waves that had
          spoken to him for so long had grown
          silent  whatever it was that
          thing it had always troubled me
          because fate offers up no reasons
          and maybe thats what i have
          traveled these thirty four years to
          say  maybe that is all i really
          know and that one man cared

          rest easy old salt  for together
          again well sail

with a powerful heave he hurls the skippers remains at
the sinking sun and into the arms of neptune

                                            dissolve to

ext  beach  sunset

the same sunset but from another time  four young men
walk along a deserted beach  a small boat has beached and
rocks gently in the shallows  the boys run up and look at
it  on the stern are painted the words  brigantine
albatross

slowly pull back to reveal endless white sand blue water
the young men and the boat

                         older chuck vo
          some time later we learned that one
          of our long boats had been
          recovered  several young men found
          it washed up on a nameless beach
          somewhere on the island of
          hispaniola  no one seemed to know
          who they were or where they came
          from but they seemed to know of the
          albatross
                  pause
          sometimes in my dreams those
          faceless young men reveal themselves
          as my lost companions and on the
          twilight coral sands of forever
          between my slumber and conscious
          state we race naked again so open
          and in love with those precious
          moments running ever laughing
          ever young ever free

                                            slam cut to
