               the sign reads kids playing  speed bumps

                                                                    cut to

               with a whine from hell the front tire of the motorcycle 
               hits a speed bump

               the motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices 
               itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a datsun 
               kingcab

               in the air the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they 
               fly by

               the motorcycle bounces off a black 66 chevrolet and makes a 
               sound like the end of the world

               the rider hits the same chevy a moment later like a broken 
               ragdoll shot from a cannon the man punches through the back 
               window blowing glass for a block he stops somewhere under 
               the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose

               the motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear
               piercing howl for one entire city block

               pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits 
               off it and feeding them to the dogs

               and the box of tiny canines after him once he and his 
               belongings are deposited on the roadside lula hops back in

                         this island of yours sounds like a 
                         kind of unpredictable place

                                     reggie
                              laughs
                         it has its moments of uncertainty

                         man johnnie one difference between 
                         your country and mine is that in the 
                         islands it does not pay to reveal 
                         ones intelligence others may use 
                         what they perceive against us

               and six or seven men stand at the bar everyone in the place 
               is black except for one white woman who is sitting alone at

               when he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail

               when they sat behind the confederate soldier

               when they danced to slaughter house
