               the tape is paused  freezes on kellys face on screen

               back to ray gloria  hunter

                                     hunter
                         no little girl can ever make me 
                         come jesus too bad we might have 
                         some physical evidence

               ray and gloria stare at the screen

                                     gloria
                         i dont know it feels wrong

               ray and hunter look at her

                                     hunter
                         why

                                     gloria
                         i think shes acting i think she 
                         set it up to be alone with him because 
                         she wanted him to come on to her
                              beat
                         i think maybe shes upset that he 
                         didnt

                                     ray
                         or maybe she thought that was what 
                         she wanted and she got a little more 
                         than she bargained for

                                     hunter
                         the line i get on this guy is that 
                         hes done half the women in blue 
                         bay

                                     gloria
                         that doesnt make him a child rapist
                              beat
                         theres something else this girls 
                         had some problems wrecked a couple 
                         of her moms cars ran away

                                     gloria

                                     ray
                         that would make it about the time of 
                         her old mans suicide you dont 
                         think that could explain some erratic 
                         behavior

                                     gloria

                                     ray
                         and she began to cry and you put an 
                         arm around her

                         i cruised the place but i didnt 
                         see her i figured she was probably 
                         there but that she was angry and 
                         didnt want to be found i dont 
                         know maybe i should have called

                         care of herself i figured wed just

                         putting your arm around her isnt 
                         that against the rules

               an approaching sunset at last he slows turning off the 
               highway and onto a narrow dirt road

               a sign pokes out from the tall grass  smilin jacks fish 
               camp

               the taurus bounces along the washboard road

               ray gives her a look gloria shrugs

                                     gloria
                         thats what they called it when i 
                         was in juvenile its a pretty dismal 
                         place

                                     ray
                         its a shithole but she was dirty 
                         what was i gonna do

               they pass a sagging chainlink fence entering a quarter
               mile run of shabby trailers and cheap shacks

               the squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty 
               of the glades where the waters have gone to the color of 
               polished brass beneath an immense darkening sky

               ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and 
               peeling paint a sign reads night crawlers 1 a bucket  
               the jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves

               as they get out of the car something catches glorias eye  
               along the bank of the canal

               angle on bank

               where a tall man walter with long white hair and tattooed 
               arms kneels inside a pen slapping a huge gator on its snout 
               the reptile lifts its upper body hissing opening its jaws

               walter takes a stick from his hip pocket passing it through 
               the gators mouth the jaws snap shut incredibly fast with 
               a hollow snapping sound

               gloria jumps instinctively then watches aghast as walter 
               slaps the creature once more this time moving round to the 
               front of the gator sticking half his arm inside its mouth

                                     voice os
                         hes just showin off for you now

               gloria starts then turns to find a woman ruby has walked 
               up beside her the woman is in her sixties shes dressed in 
               polyester her hair is piled on top of her head  too dark 
               to be anything but a dye job a cigarette bobs from her lips

               before gloria can respond ray steps up behind than

                                     ray

               ray and the old lady look at each other

                         you know the way

               she watches as the detectives cross the road then calls to 
               them as they start up the steps

                                     ruby

               sam gives up lays back as kelly undoes his pants then moves 
               to get him inside her

               suzie watches she takes another drink then tosses the 
               bottle pulling off her top revealing her small white 
               breasts a couple of tattoos a pierced nipple she slips 
               behind kelly fondling kellys breasts as sam arches beneath

               ray duquette in an aloha shirt waiting as his computers 
               printer finishes a job as suddenly

               a new light rushes into the room ray turns to find gloria 
               standing in the doorway he stops as his printer finishes 
               the job he pulls out the paper looks at it smiles gloria 
               walks to his desk

                                     ray

               ray nods

                         yeah well i told you they were 
                         gonna make us look stupid

               ray gives her a long look gloria waits a moment shrugs

                                     ray
                         hey dont back away from it you 
                         were right we did look stupid

               gloria just looks at him puzzled

                                     ray
                         think back before the suit was filed

                         affair with sandra right
                              gloria nods
                         so why not tell us about the affair 
                         i mean it could be a hell of a motive 
                         for kelly to fabricate her charge in 
                         the first place

                                     gloria
                         maybe lombardos attorney was saving 
                         the affair for the trial

                         mans surrounded by wealth and 
                         privilege but for him its just

                         decided we should all get together

               a sickening hollow thwack  an arc of blood and two teeth 
               fall silently on dark stone

               kelly begins to run stumbling through the sand to sams 
               jeep where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind 
               the seats she stuffs it under her arm then runs back along

               the champagne bottle swings loosely at the end of one arm 
               it looks shiny now dripping with suzies blood

               kelly goes to him she looks at the bottle then throws 
               herself against him  a hard kiss

                         gotten her to tell him everything  
                         she was weak and dumb

               ext the beach  day

               ray and jimmy walk along the sand moving in the direction 
               of the big rocks jimmy wears bagger shorts a surfer tshirt  
               ray wears a suit he carries the coat over his shoulder

                                     jimmy
                         its those rocks up there

                                     ray
                         you and suzie used to come out here 
                         together

                                     jimmy
                         yeah sometimes lots of the kids 
                         hang out here
                              beat
                         you really think something bad 
                         happened to suzie

                                     ray
                              ignoring the question
                         lombardo ever come out here

               jimmy looks at him surprised sees that ray is serious  
               still the idea generates a laugh

                                     ray
                         i say something funny

                                     jimmy
                         no but i mean just the idea that 
                         mr lombardo would

                                     ray
                         way i hear it he was pretty tight 
                         with the kids one of the guys

                                     jimmy
                         yeah but

               he breaks off as ray kneels over a big flat rock ray brushes 
               away some sand drapes the sport coat over his arm taking 
               tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets

               jimmy moves closer curious seeing what ray sees

               close on gloved hands

               as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone

               ray straightens holding the teeth in the palm of his hand

               jimmy stares at the teeth

               ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket hands them to 
               jimmy

                                     ray
                         im going to be staying here jimmy  
                         you can catch a bus up there at the 
                         lot okay

               jimmy looks a little sick but he takes the money he starts 
               toward the lot

               ray watches for a moment then calls out to him

                                     ray
                         people arent always what they appear 
                         to be kid remember it

               jimmy looks at him trying to make sense of what ray is 
               saying clearly disturbed by the implications but he asks 
               no more questions he turns trudging alone back through the 
               sand

                                                               dissolve to

               ray gloria and hunter watch as dave merritt a forensic 
               expert bags the teeth he passes the bag to ray then bends 
               to the rocks where he begins to take a blood sample

                                     ray

               intensity he might make them disappear

               gloria turns to the grave site her eye lingers on the open

               huge obelisk of black marble beneath the angel is a carved 
               scroll and upon it the words

               wet spots lead toward the bungalow

               sam listens everything is quiet

               san watches then jerks open the shower door the steam clears  
               revealing a tall athletic body and now the face 

               ray duquette grinning at sam out of the swirling steam

               himself in a towel theres a fresh raised scar across one 
               shoulder and ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about 
               his waist he looks at himself in the mirror touching the 
               scar

               lounges on the deck the boat sails easily before the wind

                         for me shes luffing

               ray cranes his neck to look at the winch

                                     ray
                         you mean this thing

                              pointing at pieces 
                              of the rigging
                         and these are shrouds and these are 
                         stays

                         yeah or get me drowned

               ray kneels he begins to tighten the winch

               sam watches him for a moment then reaches around behind his 
               back to unhook the short line which holds the boom

               the mainsail catches wind swinging the boom in a wide arc 
               directly at ray

               ray looks up sees it coming just in time to catch it on his 
               arm

               the blow is enough to send him sprawling through the 
               lifelines where he just manages to grab one of the nylon 
               cords

               sam ducks as the boom continues to swing erratically above 
               the deck watching as ray hauls himself on board

               the boat no longer driven by the wind bobs up and down on a 
               small ground swell

               the two men face each other

                                     sam
                         jesus man you okay

                         out suzie get me to hang it on kelly 
                         then dump me in the ocean

                         come off it man it was an 
                         accident

               ray nods then reaches down pulls off the winch handle and 
               starts with it toward sam

               sam looks around he jerks open a storage compartment a 
               divers weight belt tumbles out sam grabs it swings it 
               over his head in circles letting the weight pick up momentum 
               preparing to throw

               ray crouches still brandishing the winch handle the boom 
               sweeps the deck

               sam throws the belt

               ray grabs a shroud dances out of the way then steadies 
               himself a mean grin spreading across his face

               theres no tine for sam to look for anything else

               ray moves quickly across the deck  a menacing sight  
               tall wellmuscled the handle gleaming in his hand

               sam pulls himself out of the cockpit ray jumps in but thats 
               as far as he gets

               whoosh  a spear pierces rays thigh he screams goes down 
               the handle skittering across the deck

               ray follows it with his eyes reaching out then freezing as 
               he sees something else he draws in his hand as if bitten

                                     ray
                         you youre

               he scuttles backward pulling himself onto the deck clutching 
               at his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been 
               severed

               but his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks

                                     ray
                         youre dead for godsake
