the wild wild west

			fade in

			camera moves over the warehouse district of town  its 
			night  a dog barks in the distance  a train whistle 
			blows  then silence

				  super san antonio texas  1873

			camera stops on


			ext  warehouse  night

			a deserted cobblestone street leads downhill to a bleak 
			warehouse


			int  warehouse  night

			start close on a combination lock  pull back to reveal a 
			large ornate safe  a safecracker slim is hard at work 
			listening with a stethoscope as he spins the tumblers

			reveal a tough gang of train robbers  the safe sits in 
			the back of a wagon that was used to carry it there

			the gangs leader larson is one coldblooded character

			he paces occasionally glancing out the windows

							larson
					come on come on  how much longer

							slim
					keep your britches on  this is a 
					tough one  railroads getting 
					tired of losing their money


			ext  warehouse  up the street  night

			close on a pair of feet scurrying along the cobblestones  
			move up to reveal walters a pudgy local sheriff wheezing 
			as he runs along  hes headed for the warehouse when 

			a hand shoots out of the darkness and bodily yanks him 
			into a shadowy doorway  he yelps in panic then realizes 
			hes face to face with a us marshal 

			captain james t west  from his distinctive western attire 
			to his colt singleaction army this guys the real 
			thing  hes here to catch bad guys and nothing else  
			this is one dog you dont turn your back on

							walters
					jesus marshal  im like to have 
					wet myself

			jim is wound up itching for action glancing toward the 
			warehouse every few seconds

							jim
					well

							walters
						placating
					theyre coming

							jim
						gritting it out
					when are they coming

							walters
					theyre rounding up a posse  figure 
					an hour

							jim
						re the warehouse
					in an hour theyre gone

			jims eyes dart everywhere  hes going to will a solution 
			into existence  he spots something  an idea hatches  
			he whips out his colt saa  then grabs walters pistol 
			too

							walters
					hey

							jim
					youre not going to use it are 
					you

							walters
					well come on thats half a dozen 
					armed men

							jim
					right

			and jims gone

			angle  a freight wagon

			sits at a loading dock across the way parked on a grade 
			the rear wheels chocked piled high with a load of 
			supplies barrels etc  jim races over and eyeballs the 
			sloping street  it leads straight down toward the 
			warehouse

			he yanks out the chocks and heaves on the spokes of the 
			rear wheel  with an ominous creak the heavy wagon starts 
			to roll backward  he moves to the front grabs the wagon 
			tongue tilts it back against the seat and leaps aboard

			the wagons ironrimmed wheels clang along the cobblestones 
			as it rumbles faster and faster  jim stands atop the 
			load steering the unwieldy rig by muscling the tongue 
			left and right like a ships tiller

			its not easy to control  first the wagon scrapes along 
			an iron fence  sparks flying  then it veers the other 
			way taking out a row of horse hitches  but jim wrestles 
			it back on course straight for the warehouse doors

			closer  closer  he gets ready to duck


			int  warehouse  night

			slim swings the safe door open and the men start swiftly 
			transferring cash and gold bars to saddlebags  but now 
			they hear the thunderous clatter of the approaching wagon  
			larson peers out a window in the warehouse doors

			he staggers back panicstricken

							larson
					what the hell  look out  look 
					out

			the gang scrambles back across the room  they dive for 
			cover as the wagon explodes into the warehouse crushing 
			everything in its path finally smashing into the wagon 
			carrying the safe  the room is choked with dust

			before they can get their bearings jim leaps up on the 
			load of barrels two sixguns ready

			the men get up slowly realizing its just one guy

							larson
					what the hell is this

							jim
					this  this is where you surrender

			tense standoff  suddenly two of the men draw  jim fires 
			dropping the first before he can even get off a shot

			jim dives to one side to avoid the second mans shot 
			firing as he goes  its fast furious

			jim drills the second man who spins in agony colliding 
			with larson and slim  a third man draws and fires

			bullets ripping into the wagon around him jim coolly 
			nails the fool  leg chest head  the guy drops

			the remaining men throw up their hands

							larson
					were done  were done

			jim rises slowly pistols poised his eyes darting  the 
			bad guys dont move  they know this guy can go off at 
			any time  but now theres a weird sound  creaking and 
			cracking from below  just as jim glances down 

			the floor collapses beneath the weight of the safe and 
			the wagons  with a roar it all plummets into the 
			basement


			int  warehouse lower floor  night

			jim lies dazed in the wagon its wheels pancaked under 
			it  the massive safe has just missed crushing him  a 
			few barrels have broken open under him  in the darkness 
			whatever has spilled out feels like sand  jim gets to 
			his knees realizing  hes lost his guns in the stuff  
			then he notices the labels on the barrels  titan 
			blasting powder  hes kneedeep in explosives  as he 
			frantically digs in the powder he hears from above

							larson os
					get him  shoot the bastard

			the gang appears above him at the jagged hole guns 
			cocking  jim dives aside into the darkness

			hidden in the shadows he sneaks along the wall looking 
			for a way out  he spots a stairway leading up  he heads 
			for it but

			light hits him as the stairway door opens above  there 
			stands slim his gun drawn  he grins

							slim
					aww you lost your shooters

			slim gleefully cocks his gun but jim reaches into his 
			lapel pulling out a deadly throwing knife  swish  slim 
			is pinned to the wall by his ear  he screams in agony

			more footsteps above  in seconds the other men will be 
			upon him  jim backs up looking around trapped

			larson and his men clatter down the stairs  they fan 
			out warily looking for their dangerous prey  but theres 
			no sign of him  suddenly with a hiss a brilliant light 
			flares up  the men spin aiming their guns  oh shit  
			its a flaming trail of blasting powder  racing toward 
			the jumble of broken powder kegs

			the horrified gunmen yell in panic as they scramble over 
			themselves trying to get away  they dont make it


			ext  warehouse  night

			we hear the men screaming  then the whole place goes up 
			in a huge explosion

			the debris rains down all over the street  as the smoke 
			clears a stunned awestruck sheriff walters peeks out 
			from his hiding place then edges cautiously up to the 
			smoldering crater


			angle  crater

			down in the ruins nothing is recognizable except  the 
			scorched safe now lying on its side  its door thuds 
			open  and out rises dazed jim  he looks up at walters

							jim
					see  stand up to em and they go 
					all to pieces

			we hear the clink of wine glasses and a mozart quartet 
			and

													cut to


			int  mansion  drawing room  night

			super new york city

			this lavishly decorated room is filled with uppercrust 
			society people having their version of a good time

			among them is an elegant and dashing frenchman the baron  
			he wears pincenez glasses above a mustache and full beard  
			he walks with a pronounced stifflegged limp  at the 
			moment hes sniffing an inferior wine and scowling at a 
			really bad painting  he winces as a hefty margaret dumont 
			type society matron slinks flirtatiously up behind him

							matron
					oh baron so heres where youve 
					been hiding  all the ladies are 
					asking about you but i told them 
					you are mine tonight
						re the painting
					ah the baron appreciates a fine 
					painting nestcepas

			the baron tries to overlook her godawful french and 
			responds indulgently in a pepe le pew french accent

							baron
					incroyable

							matron
						translating
					incroyable  incredible yes

							baron
					incredible yes that this charlatan 
					has found anyone to buy these 
					paintings  ah but perhaps the 
					poor man is how you say paralyzed 
					and is forced to hold the paint 
					brush in his mouth non

			the lady is speechless  the baron notices a man urgently 
			beckoning to him from across the room  it is pomeroy a 
			shiftyeyed business tycoon

							baron
					ah  i am desolate to be pulled 
					from your large presence  but i 
					believe i am required uh you 
					would say yonder

			and he hurries away from the overheated disappointed 
			dame


			int  mansion  library  night

			pomeroy ushers the baron and three other distinguished 
			gentlemen into the richly appointed library  suddenly 
			serious he locks the door and crosses to a bookshelf

							pomeroy
					gentlemen down to the real business 
					of the evening  allow me to present 
					our
						american accent
					 piece de resistance
						to the baron
					is that how you parlay it baron

			the baron smiles graciously and corrects his french

							baron
					piece de resistance monsieur

							pomeroy
					uh yes

			pomeroy swings open a section of bookshelf revealing a 
			hidden compartment  and there stands  a gleaming brass 
			carriagemounted gatling gun  pomeroy proudly rolls it 
			into the room  the men are impressed

							pomeroy
					dr gatlings latest model  fires 
					eighty rounds without reloading

							gentleman
					how many of these do you have 
					sir

			pomeroy smiles as he moves to a side table and opens a 
			box of expensive cigars

							pomeroy
					sixteen  all of them freshly 
					shall we say removed from a 
					poorly guarded local armory  and 
					available to you at a very 
					reasonable price  cigars 
					gentlemen

			the three gentlemen gather round taking cigars

			unseen by them the baron has moved away and is pulling 
			something strange out of his pants leg  a loaded magazine 
			for the gatling gun

							gentleman
					mighty effective id imagine for 
					keeping the damn regulators out of 
					my business  lets talk money

			pomeroy smiles greedily and toasts them

							pomeroy
					my kind of music

			kerklatch  they all turn at the sound  the baron is 
			sliding the magazine into the gatling gun

							pomeroy
						nervously
					uh baron sir what uh  
					ne touchez la

			to their horror the smiling baron starts calmly cranking 
			away  blamblamblamblamblam

			pomeroy and his terrified guests hit the floor  but the 
			baron aims just above them strafing the oakpaneled wall

			the baron pauses  he now aims the smoking gun barrels at 
			the men as they poke their startled faces up from behind 
			the furniture

			then he notices another big awful painting by the same 
			notalent painter  he swivels the big gun 

			blamblamblam  and decimates it  he sighs satisfied

							baron
					art lovers will thank me

			he swings the gun back onto the baffled men  pomeroys 
			enraged client turns to him

							gentleman
					who is this madman

							pomeroy
					the the baron  he said he came 
					with you

							gentleman
					he most certainly did not

							pomeroy
					well then who the hell

			they stop in midargument wideeyed as they see 

			the baron removing his fake mustache and beard  he drops 
			his pincenez along with his french accent  he is in 
			fact

							artemus
					artemus gordon us marshal  and 
					you my good sir are under arrest 
					for possession of stolen government 
					property

			artemus takes a sip of wine wincing at the flavor

							artemus
					and for serving a decidedly 
					inferior pouillyfuisse


			ext  the white house  establish  day

			it looks pretty much the same except for the dirt driveway 
			and the herd of sheep tending the lawn


			int  white house  presidents office  day

			the doors fly open and in marches president ulysses s 
			grant a cigar in his teeth followed by colonel richards 
			a veteran lawman and grants diffident assistant pangborn

							grant
					dont try to bamboozle me colonel  
					has another scientist been kidnapped 
					or not

							richards
						apologetic
					well yes sir  a professor morton 
					but with just a little more time 
					sir i can assure you a breakthrough 
					on this case

			grant marches to his desk flinging his spent cigar into 
			an ashtray

							grant
					listen in two days im embarking 
					on a tour of the western 
					territories  and i want to know 
					at least one problem is being 
					handled competently in my absence

							richards
					of course sir thats why ive 
					assigned a new man  and hes no 
					ordinary marshal  hes quite 
					sophisticated  three college 
					degrees  a master of disguise  
					speaks french

							grant
						unimpressed
					french

							richards
					yes sir

							grant
					french  damn it i want my own 
					man on this case  somebody i trust  
					somebody who doesnt mind breaking 
					up the furniture

			crash  they hear a scuffle outside the door  the 
			president smiles  he glances at his watch

							grant
					sounds like him now

			the doors fly open  two guards are tossed onto the carpet  
			jim stands over them straightening his gunbelt

							jim
					sorry sir  whats this about no 
					guns in the white house

			grant walks over to greet him

							grant
					captain west

			they shake hands warmly

							jim
					mr president good to see you 
					again sir
						re the guards
					sorry about all that

							grant
						to the guards
					thatll be all boys

			the guards get up and leave  jim nods to them

							jim
					good work  really

							grant
					this is colonel richards

							jim
					nice to finally meet you sir

			jim shakes hands with a baffled richards who turns 
			helplessly to grant and blusters

							richards
					why surely mr president there 
					must be some mistake  i mean

							grant
					a mistake  to assign this case to 
					the man who blew up all the bridges 
					on the chattanooga river and single
					handedly trapped jacksons entire 
					cavalry  how is that a mistake

			richards stews but he knows when to shut up  grant turns 
			to jim and gestures to a pile of newspapers on his desk

							grant
					heres the problem james  somebody 
					has been abducting this countrys 
					best scientists
						pointedly to richards
					thats eight in the last three 
					years  its becoming a national 
					scandal and god knows ive had 
					enough of those

			grant goes to get another cigar but his humidor is empty  
			he starts searching the room for a cigar during

							jim
					eight  is there some connection  
					did they know each other

							richards
					no  no connection at all  other 
					than the fact that each one was a 
					top man in his field  a chemist 
					an expert on electricity

							pangborn
					 a railroad engineer a 
					ballistics expert

							grant
					etcetera etcetera  the terrible 
					thing of it is theyve all turned 
					up dead a number of months later  
					brutally murdered
						re the newspapers
					and i have little doubt the same 
					fate awaits this last poor fellow

			he opens another humidor  damn its empty

							jim
					but what would anyone have to gain 
					from all this  unless it were 
					a foreign power

							grant
					exactly  any number of nations 
					would love to cripple our scientific 
					growth  and what better way to 
					tip the scales in their favor than 
					by killing off the greatest minds 
					this country has produced

			he is now looking from one ashtray to another

							grant
					we find ourselves at the dawn of 
					the golden age of science  and it 
					is the godgiven destiny of this 
					glorious nation to carry the torch 
					that lights the way

							jim
						impressed
					nicely said sir

							grant
						tossing it off
					part of some speech they wrote for 
					this trip im taking

			grant fishes an unappealing halfsmoked cigar from an 
			ashtray then catches himself

							grant
					goddamnit  what am i doing
						to pangborn
					whats happened to all my cigars
						to jim
					colonel richards here has had a 
					dozen agents on these cases for 
					over a year  no arrests no leads 
					no clues

							jim
					and

							grant
					and now the jobs yours

			grant smiles for the first time

							grant
					you start in the morning  pangborn 
					here will make all the 
					arrangements as soon as he brings 
					a goddamned cigar for the president 
					of the goddamned united states

			as pangborn scurries out we hear a steam whistle blowing 
			and we

													cut to


			ext  the c street train station  platform  day

			the train platform bustles with travelers and porters  
			jim moves through it all his saddlebags over his shoulder  
			he stops short at the amazing sight of a strange vehicle  
			a heavyduty bicycle outfitted with an early loudly 
			roaring smokebelching internal combustion engine  the 
			harley hog of its day  the nitrocycle

			its highstrung inventor shouts at his assistant who is 
			trying to drive the vehicle up a ramp onto a freight car

							inventor
					gently gently  its not a horse 
					you idiot

			jim gazes at the amazing contraption but keeps moving 
			toward 

			angle  steam engine number four

			a gleaming steaming new stateoftheart steam engine 
			waits at the platform

			jim eyes the train  can this be the one  its just an 
			engine tender car and two custom private passenger cars  
			he pulls out his orders to doublecheck

			up in the cab is the engineer doyle a tough little 
			irishman whose chaw of tobacco gives him the look of a 
			chipmunk in a derby hat  jim calls to him

							jim
					im looking for a train  supposed 
					to be on track three  did it leave 
					already

			doyle spits out a stream of tobacco juice and smiles

							doyle
					yes sir and no sir  yes sir if 
					youre not who i think you are  
					and no sir if you are

			jim cuts to the chase

							jim
					look im captain james west

							doyle
					well captain then the answer is 
					your train is still here

			jim eyes the train  it doesnt look long enough

							doyle
					your private train sir

							jim
					private train

							doyle
						confidentially
					that would be correct  orders 
					from the president himself  trans
					portation at your beck and call  
					no delays
						shaking his head
					although the governments 
					generosity takes me a tad by 
					surprise as well

			he hops down doffs his derby and pumps jims hand

							doyle
					doyles the name sir  of the 
					connemara doyles  and theres not 
					a man riding the rails who holds a 
					candle to meself  that having 
					been said sir youre five minutes 
					late so lets be on our way  your 
					friends already aboard

							jim
					my friend


			ext  the wanderer  parlour car  observation deck  day

			jim reaches the end of the train and spots a plaque affixed 
			to the ornate railing the wanderer  not a bad name

			but as he climbs the steps he hears  violin music  
			its coming from inside  he swings the door open 
			curiously


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  day

			jim stands in the doorway impressed at the sight of the 
			richly furnished interior  a victorian parlour on wheels

			halfunpacked crates and steamer trunks are scattered 
			about  incongruously theres a work table in one corner 
			cluttered with tools and lab equipment

			the violin music continues and now out of the narrow 
			passage at the head of the car steps artemus  playing 
			the violin and not too badly  artemus spots jim but is 
			lost in the music

							artemus
					just three more measures

			finishing with a flourish he comes back to earth smiling

							artemus
					j s bach

							jim
					jim west

							artemus
					artemus gordon
						off jims confused look
					bach hes the composer

							jim
					i dont mind him but who the hell 
					are you my valet or something

							artemus
					valet  you jest of course  i am 
					a us marshal

							jim
					funny  so am i

							artemus
					congratulations  unfortunately 
					my train is about to leave and i 
					really must insist you disembark

							jim
					your train  listen friend youre 
					obviously lost
						pulling out his orders
					 ive got orders here to take 
					possession of this train and to 
					investigate a certain crime

							artemus
						pulls out his orders
					interesting  mine say the same 
					thing and they dont mention you 
					not even as a valet although we 
					could talk

			jim takes a glance at artemus orders and thrusts them 
			back

							jim
					just another bureaucratic foulup  
					you know how these pencilpushers 
					are  so why dont you just run 
					on back and explain what happened

							artemus
					funny i was just thinking you 
					should do the same  since i am 
					already in residence and am 
					obviously the man for the job 
					its been grand making your 
					acquaintance sir  and best of 
					luck in all your future endeavors

			artemus steps to the rear door and swings it open for jim 
			to leave  jim cant believe this dudes moxie

							jim
					youre quite the wordsmith fiddle 
					boy  but nobody smoothtalks his 
					way into my assignment

							artemus
					if youre implying our little 
					imbroglio has reached an impasse 
					whose only resolution can be found 
					in a more primitive fashion then 
					i for one am fully prepared to do 
					so al fresco

			and with that artemus throws open the door gesturing 
			outside

							jim
					suits me fine  im just glad you 
					got to the end of that sentence

			jim eagerly steps out ready to take this joker  artemus 
			pauses by the door to talk into the end of a speaking 
			tube

							artemus
					mr doyle  were ready  full 
					steam ahead if you please


			ext  the wanderer  parlour car  observation deck  day

			jim steps off the car pulling off his jacket  he spins 
			at the sound of the train whistle and is caught off guard 
			by artemus giving him a swift kick

			jim staggers back across the platform crashing into a 
			stack of luggage and is buried under an avalanche  as 
			the train lurches forward artemus calls pleasantly

							artemus
					and its not a fiddle its a 
					violin

			jim angrily tosses luggage aside scrambles to his feet 
			and sprints down the crowded platform  but hell never 
			catch the train

			as he slows angrily to a stop he hears

							inventor os
					throttle you damnable idiot
					more throttle

			the inventor is still browbeating his assistant as he 
			shows him how to operate the roaring nitrocycle

							inventor
					oh get off you useless nitwit  
					let me do it

			the inventor shoves the hapless man off the vehicle and 
			starts to climb on himself  but jim rushes over

							jim
					excuse me  i need this

			and he leaps onto the machine

							inventor
					what  get off sir  this is the 
					nitrocycle  the only one of its 
					kind

			jim fiddles with the controls

							jim
					is this how you do it

			jim twists the throttle and  varooom  up the ramp he 
			sails  right into the freight car  theres a brief pause

			then the nitrocycle blasts back out and takes off up the 
			platform  all the inventor can do is scream

							inventor
					unhand my machine you brigand

			jim wildly rockets along managing just barely to steer 
			the amazingly fast machine around the startled terrified 
			people who gape at the incomprehensible contrivance roaring 
			through their midst

			jim tests the throttle and cranks it all the way open  
			the nitrocycle does a wheelie as flames jet out its 
			exhaust

			he heads for the end of the platform  a four foot drop  
			he hangs on tight and goes airborne  the nitrocycle 
			slams down gravel flying wobbling wildly  but hes 
			able to get it back under control


			ext  railroad yard  day

			with his eye on the wanderer jim streaks down the tracks 
			leaving a cloud of blue smoke  the engine screams way 
			overcranked


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  moving  day

			artemus at his lab table works on an invention  a 
			derringer concealed in an ornate belt buckle  he hears 
			the peculiar roar of the nitrocycle and glances outside

			angle  artemus pov out window

			suddenly jim appears outside zooming along on the 
			inexplicable contraption keeping pace with the train

			he shoots artemus a look  youre mine buddy


			ext  the wanderer  observation deck  day

			jims racing alongside the parlour car  he pulls his 
			feet up onto the seat  then leaps across to the 
			observation deck landing gracefully

			the nitrocycle careens off and crashes into a field

			with a satisfied flourish jim yanks open the door to 
			find 

			artemus standing there with a big smile offering a glass 
			of chateau margaux 68

							artemus
					mr west i have underestimated 
					you

			jim out of breath fixes him with a cool stare

							jim
					a common mistake mr gordon

			he decides to accept the peace offering  jim takes the 
			wine and leans close deadly serious

							jim
					but dont pull that again

							artemus
					wouldnt dream of it


			ext  eastern countryside  the wanderer

			thunders across the bucolic farmland


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  moving  day

			jim is unpacking his few belongings  artemus smokes a 
			cigar as he studies the files on the dead scientists

							artemus
					eight scientists  eight different 
					fields of endeavor  hydraulics 
					optics ballistics

							jim
					put them all together and what do 
					we have

							artemus
						speculating
					a giant hydraulically operated 
					microscope that explodes
						shrugs
					or maybe just someone who hates 
					scientists

							jim
					then why kidnap them  why not 
					just kill them

							artemus
					ay theres the rub  take a 
					look at this file on professor 
					morton  quite a brilliant fellow 
					metallurgy

			but as artemus hands the file to jim  click  a 
			concealed derringer springs out of his sleeve aimed right 
			at jim  artemus embarrassed quickly slides it back up 
			his sleeve and apologizes

							artemus
					sorry  didnt mean that  just a 
					little device of mine

							jim
					wait a minute  now i know where 
					ive heard of you  youre the 
					gadget guy

							artemus
						indignant
					gadget guy  while i may not be 
					in a league with these unfortunate 
					geniuses i am sir in my own 
					humble way a man of science

			artemus proudly flings open a cabinet full of exotic 
			devices and weapons

							artemus
					my inventions an arsenal for 
					fighting crime

			he pulls out a vest adorned with metal buttons

							artemus
					attractive buttons yes  but yank 
					one off toss it and poof  it 
					emits a cloud of sleeping gas

							jim
					you need that real often

							artemus
					always hoping
						grabs another device
					or this

							jim
					no offense but all i ever need
						holds up his fists
					are these
						draws his gun
					and this

							artemus
					good lord man  the world is 
					changing  and mark me it is always 
					the criminal mind that is the first 
					to exploit modern invention  we 
					as defenders of the right must 
					keep pace

							jim
					all right if itll make you happy 
					ill try that

							artemus
					try what

			jim indicates artemus sleevegun

							jim
					your little jackinthebox gun
					that might be useful

							artemus
						hesitant
					well its the only one i have  
					its gotten me out of quite a few 
					tight spots

			then he gets an idea and hands jim the belt buckle he was 
			working on

							artemus
					but here  its yours  my latest 
					concept

			jim is dubious but takes the thing

							artemus
					now slap the buckle like this

			he demonstrates  jim tries it  sproing  a derringer 
			pops out wiggles on its mount  and promptly falls off 
			clattering to the floor

							jim
					that should put us ahead of the 
					criminals

							artemus
					ill work on it


			ext  professor mortons laboratory  night

			the remote laboratory sits beside a cornfield  a moving 
			lantern shines through the darkness carried by an old 
			watchman leading jim and artemus to the gate

							watchman
					thats the place  professor 
					mortons laboratory  ever since 
					he went missing ive kept it locked 
					up tight

			a single light goes on in the dark building

							jim
					so whos in there now


			int  professor mortons laboratory  night

			the door swings open and jim and artemus step into the 
			dimlylit lab  behind a lab table covered with a jumble 
			of equipment they spot someone moving about  whoever he 
			is hes muttering crazily to himself

			they draw their guns and ease around the table to find  
			a wildeyed unshaven man in filthy clothes squatting on 
			the floor  this is professor thaddeus morton  his shirt 
			is ripped open  tools are scattered around him  hes 
			desperately trying to pry open a strangelooking metal 
			belt locked around his waist

							artemus
					excuse me

							jim
					why  what is that

			but the professor just keeps wildly struggling

							artemus
					hold still  let me look at it

			the professor freezes but only because he hears something  
			his panicked eyes go even wider  then we hear it  a 
			highpitched oscillating whining noise coming closer

							morton
					oh god  the thing

			smash  the window beside them shatters and into the lab 
			flies a bizarre object  like a widewinged boomerang 
			sleek and black it spins through the air  it arcs high 
			then banks to one side and streaks with a pulsing ear
			splitting screech straight at dr morton  homingin on 
			the metal belt

							morton
					no  gotta get away

			he bolts out the door


			ext  professor mortons laboratory  night

			the professor scrambles out the spinning screeching object 
			following him like a bird of prey  jim and artemus sprint 
			after him

			the professor glances back  the thing is almost on top 
			of him  he hits the dirt  it blasts overhead barely 
			missing him then turns and shrieks back toward him  he 
			jumps up dashing for a tall stand of corn


			ext  cornfield  night

			the desperate professor dashes along between rows of corn

			the flying device whips along behind him slicing the 
			tops off cornstalks as it zerosin on its doomed target

			clank  the vicious thing slams into the professors metal 
			belt and locks onto it  he screams and  kabooom  an 
			explosion lights up the night

			angle  jim and artemus

			as they rush to the smoldering crater in the cornfield 
			staring in bewildered horror  gun drawn jim squints 
			into the darkness for any sign of a perpetrator  nothing

			frustrated he turns back to find artemus down on his 
			hands and knees beside the crater  must be sick to his 
			stomach

							jim
					yeah this kind of thing used to 
					make me sick too

			but artemus is fine  hes searching the ground  in a 
			moment he spots something and picks it up

							artemus
					aha

							jim
					aha

							artemus
					yes aha  a brass screw

							jim
					is this leading somewhere

							artemus
						trying to be patient
					potentially  this is the 
					painstaking process of piecing 
					together clues  the cornerstone 
					of the modern science of 
					criminology  piece by piece we 
					reconstruct the identity of the 
					villain

							jim
					starting with a screw

							artemus
						annoyed
					yes  starting with a screw  now 
					its not fair of me to expect 
					someone whos spent his life 
					wrangling with western desperadoes 
					to fully appreciate what im doing 
					here but

							jim
					what about the explosive

			artemus doesnt get it  jim picks up a stillsmoldering 
			shard of the flying bomb  he sniffs it

							jim
					its not black powder its one 
					of those new nitrocelluloses  
					should be easy to find out who 
					made it

			jim looks innocently at impressed artemus

							jim
					i think that beats a screw

			artemus has to agree but hes not going to say it

					does this thing shoot real bullets


			int  miguelitos mansion  front hall  night

			jim and artemus step into the huge entrance hall and survey 
			the unusual scene  not your average society bash  the 
			wellheeled crowd is a bit eccentric with a bohemian bent  
			whites blacks mulattos creoles and cajuns mingle  
			liberated ladies smoke cigarettes  a man saunters past 
			with a monkey perched on his shoulder

			servants wearing fezzes offer champagne  somewhere a 
			string quartet plays mozart

			suddenly a very large hand reaches down to jim and artemus  
			they look up into the ominous face of  voltaire at 
			nearly eightfeet tall hes the worlds biggest butler  
			they smile tensely hand him their hats and coats and 
			move off into the crowd

							jim
					thats a lot of butler

							artemus
					quite  come lets mingle

							jim
					do your own mingling  im not 
					hanging around with some dandy

			and jim swerves away  artemus shrugs

							artemus
					its lonely being a poet

			he steps up to a boisterous gentleman introducing himself

							artemus
					good evening sir  chauncey mcneil 
					armstrong

			the gentleman points off

							gentleman
					why yes  mr armstrong i believe 
					is on the veranda regaling the

			oops  artemus needs a new identity fast


			int  grand salon  night

			jim strolls along nodding pleasantly to the guests  he 
			pauses to admire a large painting  rembrandts david 
			slaying goliath  surprisingly the painting changes into 
			jacques louis davids portrait of the emperor napoleon 
			its some kind of lanternslide rearprojection system  
			its then he notices the mansion features a variety of 
			quirky inventions  but even as he studies the place 
			hes being studied as well

			we see her face through the crowd  cassandra thompson 
			a stunning southern beauty whose seductive charms mask a 
			singleminded toughness

			her eyes on the goodlooking stranger across the room 
			she listens with only feigned interest to the boring 
			chatter of the people around her

			jim continues through the room when from behind him

							cassandra
					taittinger

			he turns to her  this weird party has just gotten a lot 
			more interesting  she offers him a glass of champagne

							jim
					thank you maam but i never touch

			she smiles the kind of smile that makes a man forget his 
			name

							cassandra
					im miss thompson cassandra 
					thompson  can you pronounce that

			jims surprised by her forwardness but he rolls with it

							jim
					possibly  with some practice

			they stare at one another for a moment too long then

							jim
					my names tyler  frank tyler  
					pleased to meet you maam

							cassandra
					i get that feeling  you know mr 
					tyler im the kind of woman who 
					doesnt believe men are much more 
					than a complete waste of time  
					but after spying you across the 
					room im tempted to suspend my 
					disbelief at least for the evening

							jim
					you know maam you remind me of 
					a pearlhandled pistol i once owned  
					a beautiful thing to look at but 
					too hot to handle

							cassandra
					i dont recollect ever being 
					compared to a pistol before

			shall i take that as a compliment

							jim
					please do  im a man who 
					appreciates a good firearm

							cassandra

			jim studies her and smiles charmingly

							jim
					you dont know how wild

			angle  a hand

			stealthily snatches a gold pen from the pocket of a passing 
			guest  reveal the pickpocket is artemus who has abandoned 
			the chauncey disguise  hes ditched the wig grown a 
			goatee and grayed his hair

			he glides over to a cute maid setting the purloined pen 
			on her tray speaking in a seductive italian accent

							artemus
					please signora i have brought 
					this fine gold pen all the way 
					from milano  a little surprise 
					for my gracious host  but silly 
					me i am too embarrassed to give 
					it to him  so if you would only 
					for me put it on his desk in his 
					private office wherever that might 
					be then i giuseppe verdi am 
					your faithful servant

			the infatuated maid smiles hurrying off with the gift

			angle  jim and cassandra

			still moving through the party

							cassandra

					your guests maam

							cassandra

					oh dont worry  ive already

							jim
					well i owe you one dont i

							cassandra
					you most certainly do

			just then the room resounds with a trumpet fanfare

			angle  two uniformed trumpeters

			playing a fanfare as voltaire grandly swings open a set 
			of doubledoors

			cassandra escorts jim over

							cassandra
					come youre in for a treat

			a mysterious woman antoinette steps forward to announce

							antoinette
					ladies and gentleman  a man of 
					science invention and great

			angle  through the doors

			marching toward us like a king making a entrance comes 
			a tall elegant gentleman a glass of wine in his hand

			the party guests applaud delighted at the sight

							guests
					such a sense of humor what an 
					entrance  brilliant

			then strangely just as hes about to come through the 
			doors in from the side steps a little man  three and a 
			half feet tall identically dressed and also holding a 
			glass of wine  we realize weve been looking at his 
			elongated reflection in a warped funhouse mirror  this 
			is dr miguelito loveless whose genius refinement and 
			towering ego more than compensate for his lack of physical 
			stature

			he takes a bow  the guests all applaud  jim doesnt 
			know what to make of all this  miguelito greets his guests 
			as cassandra escorts jim over to him

							cassandra
					dr loveless allow me to introduce 
					mr tyler from texas

			they shake hands  miguelito scans jim with a studied 
			eye then smiles slyly at cassandra

							miguelito
					a new friend

							cassandra
					well see

							jim
					a pleasure dr loveless  youre 
					obviously a man of many talents

			miguelito eyes him with apparent suspicion

							miguelito
					yes and among them the facility 
					for seeing straight through a 
					person  indeed to know their 
					secret thoughts  for example i 
					can tell what youre thinking right 
					now

			jim tenses wondering if the little man is on to him

							miguelito
					youre thinking hes really 
					short

			a tense moment  then miguelito bursts into laughter

			cassandra and the guests join in  jim smiles

							jim
					i admire a man with a sense of 
					humor

							miguelito
					when youre three and a half feet 
					tall sir life turns you into a 
					comedian whether you like it or 
					not come with me wont you

			miguelito leads jim and cassandra toward the doors to the 
			veranda  jim is surprised when a wellmuscled brute 
			bruno falls into protective step right behind our host  
			jim glances back at the lug and smiles sweetly  miguelito 
			shouts off

							miguelito
					more mozart please

			another mozart quartet instantly fills the air  but we 
			now see its coming from an amazing contraption  an 
			automated string quartet machine


			ext  miguelitos mansion  veranda  night

			miguelito with bruno still shadowing him leads jim and 
			cassandra out onto the veranda crowded with more guests

							jim
					i must compliment you on miss 
					thompson an exceptionally 
					charming assistant

							miguelito
					thank you  i confess to a 
					preoccupation with acquiring 
					precisely that which the world 
					says i cannot have

			the veranda overlooks a pond surrounded by acres of 
			beautifully tailored gardens  party lanterns hang 
			everywhere lighting the whole area brilliantly

			as they walk miguelito seems to be getting taller  hes 
			actually walking up a ramp onto a platform  voltaire 
			steps over and silently hands him a doublebarrel shotgun  
			miguelito takes a deep breath and

							miguelito
					pull

			we see two servants standing by two unusual devices  
			all springs and levers  one of them pulls a lever 

			and a glass ball sparkling in the light of a hundred 
			lanterns is launched high into the night sky  miguelito 
			snaps the shotgun up and fires blowing the ball into a 
			million scintillating shards that splash melodically into 
			the pond

			oohs and ahhhs and applause  miguelito turns to a dapper 
			male guest and gestures to another shotgun being held by 
			voltaire

							miguelito
					be my guest

			the mans friends goad him on  he embarrassedly takes 
			the gun and assumes the shooting position

			another glass ball is launched  he shoots  he misses  
			his friends laugh  he hands back the gun  voltaire 
			reloads it  miguelito smiles pleased and looks around

							miguelito
					anyone

							cassandra
					here  mr tyler  he claims a 
					certain skill at handling firearms

							miguelito
					wonderful  our new friend from 
					the wild west  please

			jim steps up and takes the shotgun expertly testing its 
			balance  he nods to the trapmen  a ball is launched  
			pow  its history

			more applause  miguelito honors the shot with a slight 
			nod  jim hands back the gun to voltaire

			miguelito raises two fingers to the trapmen  they nod 
			and launch two balls simultaneously  pow  pow  he 
			expertly blows them both out of the sky  big applause

			all eyes shift to jim as voltaire again offers the gun a 
			clear challenge  jim takes it looking miguelito right 
			in the eye  then he turns to the trapmen

			two fingers  two balls  two shots  score tied  even 
			bigger applause

			miguelitos impressed

							miguelito
					very good sir  i think my guest 
					might be a sharpshooter by trade

							jim
					no sir just a businessman

							miguelito
					really  must be a dangerous 
					business

							jim
					i deal with some tough customers

			miguelito smiles  figuring he can hustle this cowboy he 
			lays a hundred dollar bill on the table  the crowd reacts  
			this is a lot of money

							miguelito
					continue doubles to the first miss

			the crowd watches  cassandra watches eyes flashing  
			she likes this action

			jim coolly matches the bet  cheers from the crowd  
			miguelito smiles and reloads

			miguelitos turn  boom  boom  the guy never misses

			jim nods graciously and holds up  three fingers

							miguelito
						snickering
					sir i believe you have only two 
					barrels

							jim
					how embarrassing  did i hold up 
					three fingers

			then he holds up  four fingers

			the rattled trapmen look to miguelito  what do we do  
			he scowls  is this guy for real  but he gives them the 
			nod

			four balls fly at once  jim snaps up the shotgun  pow 
			pow  thats two  he drops the gun and swiftly reaches 
			left and right pulling a sixgun out of voltaires jacket 
			and another one out of brunos belt  blam  blam

			he breaks the last two balls just before they hit the 
			water

			the crowd goes bonkers  cassandra stares at jim downright 
			hungrily  jim hands the guns back to their owners

							jim
					you know you really shouldnt 
					loan your guns to strangers

			miguelitos not having fun anymore  a servant rushes up 
			whispering to him urgently  miguelito nods to his guests

							miguelito
					will you excuse me  perhaps quick
					draw here can give you all some 
					pointers
						to cassandra

			with an apologetic smile to jim cassandra hurries to 
			follow them  jim tries not to be too obvious as he follows 
			them out


			int  miguelitos mansion  the grand salon  night

			jim glides into the salon catching sight of the hurried 
			group disappearing into a dark woodpaneled library  he 
			ambles over and develops a fascination for a chinese vase 
			near the open door  but bruno closes the door  damn


			int  upstairs hallway  servants stairway  night

			artemus peeks out the servants stairway into the long 
			hallway  he ducks as the pretty maid he spoke to earlier 
			comes out an impressive set of doors  she walks past 
			unseen artemus  the coast is clear  he strolls down the 
			hall

			he stops at the doors pulling a pensized object from 
			his pocket  he holds it up to the keyhole and squints 
			through the end of it

			angle  artemus pov  a fisheye view

			of miguelitos office

			back to scene

			artemus smiles and tests the doors  locked  no problem  
			out of his lapel he pulls a concealed lockpick  clickety
			click  doors open  he slips inside


			int  miguelitos office  night

			artemus locks the door behind him  an oversized desk 
			with a small thronelike chair dominates the office which 
			is cluttered with papers and books  a row of portraits 
			adorn the wall miguelito as ramses miguelito as caesar 
			miguelito as richard the lionhearted

			jim is still outside the library  the doors open and

			voltaire lumbers out  jim gets a quick look inside 

			miguelito sits at a writing table taking down information 
			given him by a tall imposing graybearded man to whom he 
			is unusually deferential  the man paces the room unhappy 
			about something

			jim eyes the man  he recognizes him but cant place him

			miguelito uses an ink blotter to dry the ink and thrusts 
			the paper at bruno who takes it and hurries out

			miguelito escorts the mysterious man out giving jim the 
			cold shoulder  cassandra smiles coming over

							cassandra
					you must excuse the doctor  no 
					one has ever beaten him at his 
					little game

							jim
					i dont like to lose either

			jim steps over to the string quartet machine now playing 
			a quadrille  he slides a control lever over to waltz

			the machine shudders and segues into the blue danube

							jim
					i assume miss thompson that you 
					waltz

			of course she does  jim whirls her off across the floor


			int  miguelitos office  night

			artemus notices on a shelf beside the desk  a scale 
			model of a cannon but its a cannon outfitted with all 
			manner of pistons gears and flywheels  a pressure hose 
			connects it to a small steam engine  intrigued artemus 
			gingerly throws the lever on the engine

			with a hiss the cannon comes to life automatically 
			pivoting as it rapidfires marblesized cannonballs with 
			steam pressure  foosh  foosh

			the balls fly across the room knocking over a row of tin 
			soldiers

			artemus is impressed  he spots a little brass plate on 
			the steam engine

			int  library  night

			the romantic waltz continues  jim dances cassandra right 
			out of the grand salon into the dark empty library

							cassandra
					have you taken a wrong turn mr 
					tyler

							jim
					you tell me

							cassandra
					im not so sure dr loveless would 
					like to find his social secretary 
					dancing in the dark with an 
					uninvited stranger

							jim
					forgive me but you dont strike 
					me as the social secretary type

							cassandra
					thank you  but the truth is im 
					a single woman in a mans world  
					that leaves me very few choices 
					doesnt it

							jim
					i suppose so  but life can be 
					hard for a man too

			they drift closer and closer  cassandra whispers heatedly

							cassandra
					oh i know well how hard things 
					can get for a man

			she presses against him their lips are only inches apart 
			when we hear a soft metallic click  her eyes widen with 
			interest

							cassandra
					speak of the devil

			she glances down surprised to see whats got her attention 
			isnt part of jims anatomy  its the concealed derringer 
			which has popped out uninvited  jim clicks it back into 
			place embarrassed

							jim
					just a little insurance against 
					the unexpected

							cassandra
					would that include me

							jim
					oh i would hope not

			he kicks the door shut  theyve both reached the boiling 
			point and theyre in each others arms in a flash  they 
			kiss greedily

			as she pulls jims jacket off hes backing her across 
			the dark room kicking chairs and footstools out of his 
			way until hes got her up against the end of the writing 
			table  she rips his shirt open and starts hungrily 
			devouring his chest  but jim is mixing business with 
			pleasure  over her shoulder hes trying to get a closer 
			look at 

			angle  jims pov  the ink blotter

			miguelito has just used  the reversed blotchy letters 
			of a name are soaked into it

			back to scene

			cassandra heatedly throws herself onto the table and 
			with one sweep of her arm sends everything on it cascading 
			to the floor  she grabs jim and pulls him down on top of 
			her  theyre going at it like sharks in a feeding frenzy

			whatever jims doing to her cassandra cant help but 
			start moaning  she comes up for air

							cassandra
					youve done this before

							jim
					ive had some practice

			and with that jim grabs her and rolls the both of them 
			off the table to the floor

							cassandra
					yes  i like it on the floor

			jims looking around and spots the fallen ink blotter 
			slowly swiveling to a stop beneath the table

							jim
					under the table

			he grabs her rolling with her under the table

							cassandra
					yes

			in her frenzy cassandra knocks the ink blotter skittering 
			off against the far wall  jim looks at it hopelessly 
			then  buries his face in her neck

							cassandra
					yes yes

			and he rips off her pearl necklace with his teeth  pearls 
			scatter everywhere

							jim
					oh i am sorry

			jim crawls straight for the ink blotter scooping up pearls 
			as he goes

							cassandra
					to hell with them

			and cassandra practically tackles him against the wall 
			rolling with him until she comes up astride her stud  
			she wildly yanks off his belt and tosses it  now jim 
			rolls on top of her making a lunge for the blotter  he 
			snags it

			and below frame cassandra has snagged what shes after  
			as jims face registers appreciation for her wellpracticed 
			ministrations he strains upward with the blotter toward 
			a mirror above him

			finally hes able to glimpse the reflection of the blotter  
			the letters now reversed can be easily read

			as it thunders across the delta


			ext  opelousas louisiana  establish  day

			the little town is a charming jumble of antebellum brick 
			and wooden buildings


			ext  opelousas  neighborhood  day

			artemus and jim hurry along a muddy street looking for an

			charges in we see artemus crouched in the doorway his 
			lockpick poised where the lock used to be

			the room is a cluttered topfloor workshop  nobody there  
			steam billows from a small test boiler  and the water is 
			pouring from a spigot in a holding tank left running 
			overflowing a bucket  artemus sloshes over and shuts it 
			off

							artemus
					seems like he left in a hurry

			outside they hear a scuffle  they dash to the window

			their pov  the back alley

			three floors below they see familiar faces  big bruno

			artemus races to the window relieved to see his partner 
			alive and dismayed that his partner is in fact his 
			partner  artemus turns and runs for the stairs


			ext  rooftops  day

			jim is already up and sprinting across the roof keeping 
			an eye on the carriage below  he races to the edge of 
			the roof and leaps into space again

			on he goes leaping from roof to roof but gaining on the 
			carriage


			ext  last rooftop  day

			jim gets ahead of the carriage but hes run out of 
			rooftops  he slides to a stop at the roof edge  now how 
			to get down

			beside the roof he spots the top of a railroad crossing 
			barrier  its in the vertical position letting traffic 
			cross the tracks below  and here comes the carriage toward 
			the tracks

			jim gets that determined look  hes got to time it just 
			right  he waits then leaps off the roof wrapping himself 
			around the tip of the barrier  it starts to swing down 


			ext  back alley  day

			with perfect timing jim arcs down toward the carriage 
			and wham  lands on the roof right behind the driver  
			as the startled man turns he gets booted in the jaw and 
			flies off the carriage

			jim pulls the team to a stop draws his revolver and leaps 
			to the ground  but the carriage door slams open knocking 
			his pistol off into a puddle and bruno launches out of 
			the cab into jim  over they go into the mud

			bruno pins jim beneath him sits up and cocks a meaty 
			fist to smash jim in the face  but jim jams two fingers 
			up brunos nostrils yanks his face close and slugs him  
			brunos head snaps back  jim yanks him in again  slugs 
			him again  bruno topples off

			one thug wielding a knife dives out of the carriage  
			jim straightlegs him in the crotch and pivots him straight 
			up and over onto his back  oof

			jim scrambles up  catches sight of voltaire through the 
			rear window of the carriage drawing a pistol  without 
			hesitating jim throws a pounding left hook right through 
			the glass  voltaire is knocked across the inside of the 
			carriage pinning the other thug beneath him

			jim yanks open the other door of the carriage  frightened 
			dr pemberton flinches  jim does a startled take  its 
			dr virginia pemberton a beautiful young woman  jim 
			glances around  nobody else it could be

							jim

							pemberton
					yes

			but bruno flies in tackling jim and pinning him in a 
			chokehold against the fence  jim manages to gag

							jim
					would you please run maam

			she happily obeys scrambling from the carriage and dashing 
			down the alley

							voltaire
					get her

			the two thugs scramble up and dash after her

			still pinned to the fence all jim can do is spit in 
			brunos eye  bruno flinches and jim knees him where it 
			hurts most  the big guy staggers back

			angle  dr pemberton

			dashing down the alley  the thugs are just about to grab 
			her when  a silverhandled walking stick thrusts out 
			tripping them  down they go  artemus steps from around 
			the corner squares off with them menacingly twirling 
			the walking stick

							artemus
					terribly sorry  im always sticking 
					this where it doesnt belong

							pemberton
					yes me

							artemus
					you  dr pemberton  of course

			the thugs jump to their feet one whipping out his pistol  
			wham  a flash of silver and artemus has knocked the gun 
			from his hand  he waves a finger at the guy

							artemus
					never shoot an unarmed man

			the other thug pulls a huge bowie knife  artemus strikes 
			an en garde pose and goes a few parries with the guy before 
			deftly knocking the knife from his hand

			enraged they both charge like bulls  wrong move  wham 
			wham  the walking stick is a blur as artemus hits both 
			dopes up side their heads  as they whirl for another 
			attack grabbing boards as clubs

							artemus
					tsk tsk

			he collapses his walking stick like a telescope and pops 
			the silver handle off the end  its still connected by 
			a two footlong cable  gripping the shortened stick 
			artemus swings the heavy silver handle like a crusader 
			swings a deadly mace

			spinning it in a blinding blur he wades into them bashing 
			and bruising right and left until the bad guys have had 
			enough and go running down the alley

			artemus is about to give chase when dr pemberton points 
			out

							pemberton
					isnt your friend in a bit of

			dr pemberton jim and artemus sit around the potbelly 
			stove  a bored deputy sits at a desk in background

							pemberton
					i only met him once but that was 
					enough  for such a little man he 
					had quite an oversized opinion of 
					himself  he offered me the rare 
					and unparalleled opportunity to 
					develop a new steam engine for 
					him  he claims to have some sort 
					of factory in texas i believe  
					said i could have the run of the 
					place  he had all sorts of 
					specifications  but when i 
					questioned him closely it became 
					obvious he was just another 
					mercenary businessman  both he 
					and his partner had no real love 
					of steam
						wistful
					its sad  so few men do

							jim
					who was this partner of his

							pemberton
					a southern gentlemen  i dont 
					recall his name  i suppose its 
					unkind of me to say it but he had 
					the most disconcerting glass eye

							jim
						suddenly
					a glass eye  thats who it was  
					oneeyed jack garrison  otherwise 
					known as general garrison 
					confederate third army  i saw him 
					at dr loveless party but i 
					couldnt place him  he used to 
					wear an eyepatch

							artemus
					garrison  then the president 
					was right  except its not a 
					foreign power its a bunch of die
					hard rebels trying to make the 
					south rise again

							jim
					and if theyve got dr loveless 
					building weapons like those flying 
					bombs they just might do it

			suddenly from outside they hear distant screams then the 
			echo of gunshots


			ext  opelousas city jail  night

			artemus and jim run out  a riderless buckboard races 
			past  at the end of the street they see smoke  more 
			gunshots and screaming

			they dash toward the sounds but slow down uncertainly as 
			they hear something else  something downright demonic 
			a deep ominous rumbling  then an eerie shriek as a cloud 
			of steam billows around the corner  and out of the cloud 
			rolls something big

			its a steampowered tank  completely encased in steel 
			and topped with a monitorlike gun turret  electric lights 
			glaring steam belching driven by ten foot high spiked 
			steel wheels the heavy metal beast clanks toward them

							artemus
					my god

			gun barrels slide out of narrow ports firing a volley at 
			jim and artemus  they dive for cover behind a stone wall 
			and come up with sixguns blazing

			from inside the jailhouse behind them deputies open fire 
			as well

			but the bullets only ricochet off the machines armor

							artemus
					could i just point out this is a 
					perfect example of the criminal 
					mind exploiting modern invention

							jim
						glares at artemus
					im going to hit you

			now the cannon in the turret opens fire  and its no 
			ordinary singleshot cannon  its automatic  and it 
			fires with a weird hissing sound foosh  foosh  foosh

			blam  blam  powerful explosive rounds start shattering 
			the wall behind which jim and artemus are hiding

							jim
					never seen a gun fire so fast

							artemus
					its a repeating steam cannon

			three more exploding rounds chew up more of the wall  
			jim and artemus dash along the wall as its blasted to 
			bits right behind them

							artemus
					pretty good one too

			now the steam tank veers off flattening a wagon and 
			crushing the boardwalk as it heads for the jailhouse

			deputies dive out of the windows in panic


			int  opelousas city jail  night

			dr pemberton and one loyal deputy stumble backward from 
			the windows terrified as the steam tank smashes right 
			through the wall  the hapless deputy disappears screaming 
			beneath it as it rumbles into the room debris cascading 
			off its sloping sides

			dazed dr pemberton is halfburied in the plaster and 
			wreckage  a hatch opens in the belly of the beast  
			voltaire drops out grabs the doctor and hauls her inside  
			the hatch slams shut


			ext  opelousas city jail  night

			jim and artemus watch in amazement as the metal monster 
			reverses out of the gaping hole in the building


			ext  opelousas  downtown  night

			the steam tank rolls brazenly right back through town  
			astonished onlookers have no idea what to make of it  
			dogs bark  horses bolt  women scream

			it moves at only the pace of a quick walk  its easy for 
			jim artemus and the deputies to overtake it  but so 
			what  theres not a damn thing they can do to stop it

			artemus grabs a thick beam from some stacked lumber and 
			jams it through the spokes of the massive rear wheel but 
			the beam is instantly ground to toothpicks

			jim runs ahead to a blacksmiths  he dashes out with a 
			heavy chain  he swiftly loops it around two iron lamp 
			posts stretching it across the street in the path of the 
			steam tank  he waits expectantly as artemus jogs up

							jim
						re the massive chain
					that oughta holdem  be ready 
					when they come out

			the tank rolls forward plowing into the chain  and 
			effortlessly rips the lamp posts out like weeds  gas 
			explodes from the severed posts  woomp  woomp  like 
			little oil well fires

							artemus
						sarcastic
					im ready  just say when

			as they dash after it

							jim
					at least i tried something

							artemus
					hey i tried the board


			ext  opelousas  edge of town  night

			the steam tank rolls relentlessly out of town  jim and 
			artemus jog along at a safe distance behind it

							artemus
					damn it this is ridiculous

							jim
					at least the things not that fast  
					we just follow it  whenever it 
					stops were there waiting

							artemus
					thats right thats good

			but the steam tank now swerves off the road and heads 
			toward 

			angle  railroad tracks

			it tips and sways as it clanks up onto the tracks  but 
			then it suddenly turns to align itself with the rails

			now a set of railroad driver wheels lowers down from the 
			undercarriage of the tank  clink  clang  the drivers 
			lock in place lifting the road wheels a few inches off 
			the ground

							jim
					oh no

			the tank starts rolling down the tracks picking up speed  
			jim charges after it  he grabs a sledgehammer from a 
			handcart beside the tracks and  bounds right up onto 
			the tank

			gun barrels poke out of slits and fire but he slams them 
			back inside like those popup gophers at an arcade  then 
			he starts pounding wildly on the top hatch cover

			artemus calls after him

							artemus
					jim for godsake  well get the 
					train  nothings faster than that

			smoke suddenly billows from two large tubes on either 
			side of the tank  jim coughs in the acrid fumes but 
			keeps relentlessly pounding smashing the hinges off the 
			top hatch  almost has it broken loose

			the insides of the tubes glow red  artemus realizes

							artemus
					my god  jim  theyre rockets
					get off  get off

			huge flames explode from the tubes  the tank blasts 
			forward jim is thrown off and the machine rockets down 
			the tracks like a ten ton roadrunner

			artemus rushes to dazed jim lying flat on his back 
			surrounded by glowing sparks hair singed clothes 
			smoldering

							artemus
					jim are you all right

							jim
					no im not all right  they got 
					away  and we cant even follow 
					them  they can get off the tracks 
					anywhere they want

							artemus
					which is why were heading to 
					houston texas
						off jims inquiring look
					home of the loveless steam engine 
					works


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  moving  night

			artemus bandages jims burns during

							artemus
					if you dont mind my asking were 
					you always the way you are

							jim
					what way is that

							artemus
					so spontaneous  all that leaping 
					off buildings and chinese fighting 
					and whatnot

							jim
					spontaneous  i like that  most 
					people say something like hare
					brained reckless sonofabitch

							artemus
					well that too

							jim
					nothing much to it really  when i 
					was younger i got into a pretty 
					bad runin with the wyler boys  i 
					saw them coming  but i didnt act 
					fast enough  secondguessed myself  
					and it cost me cost me dearly

			jim falls silent  artemus waits but finally

							artemus
					so what happened

							jim
					those kids they took my wagon  
					never got it back

							artemus
						playing catchup
					uh how long ago was this

							jim
					i was six  and ever since my 
					policy is act first and worry 
					later

			artemus lets this sink in

							artemus
					i see well the worlds lucky 
					they didnt you know shoot your 
					mother or something


			ext  steam works  wall  night

			camera moves along the high wall surrounding the loveless 
			steam engine works  we hear jim grunting and straining 
			on the other side as camera moves up  jims sweaty face 
			finally appears over the top

							jim
					dont see any guards

			artemus voice comes from out of sight below

							artemus
					neither do i

			jim wonders how artemus can see  then notices the top of 
			a thin periscope peeking up over the wall beside him

			down below artemus leans casually against the wall gazing 
			through the eyepiece in the bottom of his walking stick 
			which he has telescoped up

							jim
					you might have mentioned you had 
					that

							artemus
					i thought all you needed were your 
					fists and your gun

			he snaps the periscope shut


			ext  steam works  yard  night

			the guys drop down from the wall and dash across the yard  
			they reach the cover of a discarded steam boiler and 
			study the foreboding factory

							artemus
					strange youd think hed have 
					this place better guarded

							jim
					i find most criminals slip up 
					somewhere

			then they hear it  the ragged heavy breathing of 
			something headed their way  they look around to see 

			their pov  a pack of rottweilers

			gallops toward them lockedin on the scent of fresh meat

			back to scene

							jim
					but not all of them

			they dash for the factory

			as they run artemus rips off the second button on his 
			vest and tosses it back in the path of the pursuing 
			canines

			poof  a cloud of sleeping gas erupts  the first dog 
			races through it takes a few more steps and  splat

			artemus rips off and tosses a few more  the rest of the 
			dogs drop  artemus and jim reach the building glancing 
			back at the neat line of dozing dogs

							artemus
					theyre so precious when theyre 
					asleep

							jim
					you really enjoy yourself dont 
					you

			artemus just smiles as they move quickly to peer in through 
			grimy windows

			angle  their pov  inside steam works

			the large dimlylit space reverberates with the rhythmic 
			pounding of a big steam engine running an overhead pulley 
			system  a maze of pulleys and leather belts which in 
			turn power all the factory machinery

			miguelito stands with bruno and voltaire admiring a large 
			steel casting as its crated up by several factory workers  
			hard to say what the casting is part of


			ext  steam works  yard  night

			jim and artemus move along the windows toward an open 
			loading dock door when

							voices
					get them  stop them  who let 
					them in

			jim and artemus take cover and whip out their sidearms  
			but the shoutings about someone else

			hoofbeats approach  three mounted riders are galloping 
			from the main gate to the loading dock door  its general 
			garrison and two of his lieutenants chased by a couple 
			of shouting guards

			miguelito greets them at the door flanked by bruno and 
			voltaire  he calls off the guards

							miguelito
					leave them  leave them  these 
					are friends
						to garrison
					general my apologies  im sure 
					you understand the importance of 
					security

			hiding only a few feet away

						whispers
					thats him  oneeyed jack 
					garrison  perfect  two birds 
					with one stone

			angle  miguelito and the others

			garrison glances angrily into the factory

							garrison
					my weapons were to be delivered 
					three weeks ago as you well know  
					instead i have five thousand loyal 
					men ready to march north and hardly 
					a decent rifle among them

			miguelito maintains an air of innocence

							miguelito
					but delays are inevitable in an 
					undertaking of this size  surely

			the general angrily thrusts out several pieces of paper

							garrison
					i wont hear it sir  i have here 
					documents from this very factory 
					showing our weapons were never 
					even built
						glancing around
					and i dont need two eyes to see 
					its true  do you dare deny it 
					little man

			only miguelitos eyes betray any reaction to the insult  
			he remains totally pleasant

							miguelito
					and you want to know what i spent 
					all your money on  a fair 
					question with a simple answer  
					i bought a little something for 
					myself
						turning his back
					now please dont move because we 
					really must shoot you

			the bodyguards pull their revolvers and mercilessly open 
			fire  miguelito winces at the sound and again as the 
			three bodies thud to the ground  without turning around

							miguelito
					dispose of them quickly

			he scurries off squeamishly shielding his eyes

							miguelito
					oh i just hate killing people i 
					know

			bruno and voltaire drag the bodies inside

			angle  jim and artemus

			these are two confused guys

							artemus
					can you fill me in here

							jim
					sure  we have no idea whats going 
					on

							artemus
					thank you

							jim
					come on lets at least see if we 
					can find dr pemberton

			as jim starts off

							artemus
					you go ahead  ill stick with 
					loveless

			they sneak off in different directions


			int  steam works  night

			miguelito heads for a big work table impatiently clapping 
			his hands to assemble people  half a dozen assistants 
			gather round him as he unfurls a map

			camera tilts up to find


			angle  artemus

			now sneaking along a catwalk among the humming beltdrives  
			he can get near the table but not close enough to hear 
			over the pounding steam engine  but this doesnt stop 
			him

			he starts pulling mysterious machine components from his 
			pockets boots and inside his coat


			ext  steam works  railroad spur  night

			moving along checking windows jim rounds a corner

			a train waits on a siding its freight cars being hurriedly 
			loaded by more workers  at the end is a private rail car 
			opulent enough for your average emperor  a shapely 
			silhouette is backlit behind a window shade


			int  steam works  catwalk  night

			artemus has assembled a small windup machine from his 
			various concealed parts  he carefully rolls a precut 
			piece of paper into a small cone and slides its narrow 
			end into a metal ring with a diaphragm stretched across 
			it

			he fits this into place on the machine then adds the 
			final part  a foil recording cylinder the size and 
			shape of a toilet paper tube  he winds the handcrank

			next he pulls out his cablefiring derringer  he needs a 
			clear shot at a wooden column beyond the table  to get 
			it he has to lean way out from the catwalk propping 
			himself against one of the unmoving drivebelts

			he takes careful aim timing it just right with the steam 
			engines rhythmic pounding  just as it pounds he fires  
			the gunshots drowned out by the noise

			bullseye  the dart sticks in the column its cable 
			stretching back to the derringer  artemus hooks his 
			cylinder recorder onto it switches it on and lets the 
			thing slide down the cable until its dangling in the 
			shadows above the hanging lamp directly over the table  
			he hauls up on his end of the cable and ties it off

			he grins smugly  but thats when the drivebelt hes 
			leaning against starts moving  hes yanked off the 
			catwalk clinging to the racing belt  in seconds hell 
			be pulled into the big idler wheel at the end of the line

			hes got no choice  he drops down grabbing hold of the 
			lower part of the belt  instantly hes hauled off in the 
			opposite direction zooming along above the oblivious 
			minions below

			theres hope  the drivebelt carries him over a row of 
			unmanned machinery  no ones around  he lets go and 
			plummets to the floor in a heap  relieved he shakily 
			gets to his feet  a door opens behind him  he turns 
			just in time to catch sight of bruno and the incoming 
			fist that knocks him unconscious


			ext  steam works  railroad spur  night

			sneaking along jim rolls deftly under the train to avoid 
			the busy workers  he pops up at the rear door of 
			miguelitos private rail car  soft music plays from 
			within


			int  miguelitos private car  parlour  night

			jim slips in quietly  nobody there  he spots miguelitos 
			humidor opens it and pockets a few cuban cigars  not 
			too shabby  the music is coming from the next room  he 
			moves to the door  tests the doorknob  its unlocked  
			peeks in

			angle  jims pov  cassandra

			sits at her vanity brushing her hair wearing an alluring 
			red dressing gown provocatively dishabille an ornate

			int  miguelitos private car  bedroom  day

			cassandra gasps as jim bursts in behind her

							jim
					keep quiet if you know whats good 
					for you

			she manages a smile and looks him up and down hungrily

							cassandra
					well mr tyler speaking of whats 
					good for me

			she stands  jim cant help but notice her dressing gown 
			is barely doing its job  or maybe doing it too well

							jim
					im not mr tyler and youre no

					pemberton

			she turns back to the vanity pouting

							cassandra
					that straitlaced little prude  
					cant you forget about her  a 
					woman like that couldnt begin to 
					satisfy a man like you

			she selects a bright red lipstick and smooths it on slowly 
			and sensuously  but jims not putting up with this  he 
			grabs her wrist  the lipstick goes flying

							jim
						low and mean
					where is she

			she glares at him pulling away

							cassandra
					shes perfectly safe

							jim
					really  like general garrison or 
					didnt you hear all that shooting

			that rattles her a little

							cassandra
					the general  well dr loveless 
					is a very purposeful man
						softening
					but you certainly have nothing to 
					fear from me

			she leans closer her enticing red silhouette shimmering 
			through the dressing gown  then we hear a click from 
			below frame  cassandra steps back smiling

							cassandra
					where have i heard that before

			she glances down  but this time its jims pistol pointed 
			at her

							cassandra
					my  its gotten longer

							jim
					you bring the best out in a man

							cassandra
					i try
						suddenly desperate
					please if you promise to protect 
					me ill testify against him
					ill give you an ironclad case

			she steps even closer pressing herself against the gun 
			barrel turning her face up to him bringing her lips 
			closer and closer

							cassandra
					and as you already know i can 
					give you much more than that

			jims not about to trust her but he is after all jim  
			he pulls her body to him pinning her arms behind her 
			and gives her the kind of kiss that gives foreplay a good 
			name  then he smiles

							jim
					not a bad deal

			she smiles back  but its an eerie smile on those freshly
			lipsticked lips

							cassandra
					for me

			jim stares at her warily  then he realizes  hes getting 
			woozy

							jim
					what  how the hell

			he makes a desperate lunge for the door but in two steps 
			he drops unconscious  and she rushes back to the vanity 
			and starts wiping off the potent red lipstick  shes a 
			little dazed herself  is it from the lipstick  or him

												dissolve to


			int  steam works  machine shop  dawn

			close on jim as he blearily awakens  hes tightly bound 
			hand and foot  he looks around  hes in a large dingy 
			basement  miguelitos workshop  its filled with all 
			manner of frankensteinian equipment and inventions

			he rolls over and finds himself face to face with general 
			garrison dead eyes staring at him  jim wriggles away 
			only to find himself staring into the faces of the other 
			two dead men  jim twists away again struggling into a 
			sitting position  finally he sees

							jim
					artemus

			his partner is tied to a chair  piled nearby are artemus 
			jacket vest belt and sleevegun  artemus smiles weakly

							artemus
					i was afraid you were dead
						noticing something
					whats that all over your lips

			jim thinks  then remembers embarrassed  he lies

							jim
					blood

			from offscreen miguelito laughs sarcastically

							miguelito os
					blood  such vanity

			out of the shadows steps miguelito proudly twirling 
			artemus walking stick  hes followed by cassandra now 
			in a stunning red evening gown and bruno who stares coldly 
			at jim  his face is still colorfully bruised after his 
			lambasting from jim and he hasnt forgotten

			miguelito strides over to artemus toying with the walking 
			stick switching it into its mace mode

							miguelito
					i like a good concealed weapon  
					such a thoughtful gift  thank 
					you

			he turns to bruno

							miguelito
					any ideas

							bruno
					thought wed runem through this

			bruno indicates a big strange looking machine  
			miguelitos eyes go wide

							miguelito
					good god bruno  how grotesque
						smiles
					and yet brilliant lets do it

			miguelito whacks the machines lever with the walking 
			stick  steam belches from it  leather drive belts churn 
			to life  big pulleys whirl  a conveyor belt jolts 
			forward leading up into a massive hopper  we cant see 
			inside but from within the hopper we can hear the ominous 
			metallic clanging and gnashing of its inner workings  
			miguelito shouts over the roar of the machine

							miguelito
					one of my many inventions  a 
					watermelon juicer
						defensive
					yes  i admit the public did not 
					share my enthusiasm for the juice 
					of the watermelon  but what do 
					they know

			bruno grabs the generals body and heaves it uncere
			moniously onto the conveyor belt  swiftly the body is 
			carried up toward the hopper  at the last moment 
			miguelito notices a fine fountain pen in the generals 
			pocket and snatches it up for himself

			then he hurries over to cassandra almost hiding behind 
			her horrified and yet fascinated  cassandra just watches 
			eerily unfazed

			the body disappears into the hopper  we cant see 
			anything but we hear awful munching and crunching  a 
			spout tips down into a barrel and begins filling it

			jim and artemus watch grimly  bruno likes it  he shuts 
			down the machine and steps over to peer into the barrel

			then slams a lid down on it with satisfaction

							bruno
					wont be drinking this batch

							miguelito
					bruno please

			this whole demonstration makes jim and artemus decidedly 
			uneasy

							jim
					why dont we just cut this routine 
					short  whatever you do to us 
					were not going to talk

							miguelito
						genuinely confused
					talk  about what
						then he gets it
					oh  about who you are and all 
					that

			he laughs and turns to cassandra matteroffactly

							miguelito
					mr west and mr gordon are refusing 
					to tell us that theyre us 
					marshals  what are we to do

			he pauses to savor the moment

							miguelito
					i love when i get to do that
						smugly
					you see i have informants at every 
					level of government
						laughs
					ironically they werent able to 
					tell me a thing  but fortunately 
					mr west bruno finally remembered 
					you  it seems you arrested his 
					brother three years ago  hes 
					quite an asset to me

			he strides to the door then turns

							miguelito
					im sorry this is all so graphic
						casually
					just try to relax and think of 
					something else

			he marches out  cassandra starts to follow but notices 
			jim staring icily at her  she pauses to explain

							cassandra
					you see unlike most employers 
					dr loveless is actually willing 
					to give a woman power power over 
					men and machines  what more could 
					a girl ask for

			she exits  bruno drags the other two bodies to the 
			watermelon press and heaves them up onto the conveyor 
			belt  he turns to jim rubbing the bruises on his face

							bruno
					im putting you in like this feet 
					first  alive

			he turns back to the machine to restart it  it rumbles 
			to life

			while brunos back is turned artemus gets jims attention 
			by blinking one eye then the other  hes sending morse 
			code  jim stares trying to follow it

			even though bruno keeps glancing at them he has no idea 
			theyre communicating

			artemus keeps blinking

					subtitle push my left heel

			jim doesnt quite catch it all  he frowns

					subtitle huh

			artemus frantically resends

					subtitle push my left heel  on side

			jim gets it and peers at artemus boot tied tightly to 
			the chair leg  he glances at bruno still busy with the 
			machine  jim extends his leg and firmly presses the toe 
			of his boot against the side of artemus boot heel

			sproing  a razor sharp knife blade pops out of artemus 
			toe and locks into place  jim loves it  he wriggles 
			around to block brunos view of the boot and starts cutting 
			the ropes on his wrists

			the watermelon press finishes its dirty work  bruno rolls 
			an empty barrel under the spout then turns and lumbers 
			toward jim  he grabs the ropes around jims ankles  but 
			jims hands are free  he wallops bruno with a roundhouse 
			punch that sends the big man staggering

			jim goes to work on his ankle ropes  bruno roars and 
			comes charging back at him  jim rolls to one side and 
			bruno piles into helpless artemus  they both go over 
			backward in the chair

			bruno and artemus end up face to face  artemus bites his 
			nose  bruno screams and slugs artemus

			jim his ankles still tied somehow springs to his feet 
			and starts hopping toward the pile of artemus weapons

			bruno turns and charges at jim  this will be easy  but 
			he quickly finds himself lost in a flurry of martial arts 
			punches as jim pogos around to keep his balance  bruno 
			retreats and grabs a length of steam pipe  he circles 
			jim warily

			artemus can see that even jim isnt going to last long  
			still tied to the fallen chair artemus wriggles wildly 
			scooting himself closer to the churning machine

			jim sees the opportunity  dodging the swinging pipe he 
			maneuvers bruno so that his back is to the machine  then 
			jim does the simplest possible thing  he feints at bruno 
			causing him to flinch and step back  he trips over artemus 
			and  crashes onto the conveyor belt

			swiftly hauled up he clings desperately to the lip of 
			the hopper for a moment but loses his grip and goes in 
			screaming

			jim and artemus wince at the sloshing mushing and 
			crushing  then jim shuts down the machine

							jim
						re bruno
					liquidated that asset


			ext  steam works  railroad spur  dawn

			jim and artemus charge out of the building  miguelitos 
			train is gone

							jim
					damn  we go through all that and 
					does he even wait for us

			he turns to see his partner dashing back into the factory


			int  steam works  dawn

			artemus leaps up onto the work table and reaches up above 
			the hanging lamp  jim walks over leans against the table 
			wondering what the hell hes up to

							jim
					having fun  because we really 
					gotta catch this guy

			artemus unhooks the recorder from the cable and sets it 
			onto the table  he starts winding its crank  jim sure 
			looks confused

							artemus
						proudly
					know what this is

							jim
					sure  its a windup thing

							artemus
					a cylinder recorder  my own design

			jims about to say something  artemus holds his finger 
			to his lips for silence and resets the needle  he pushes 
			a lever and the cylinder spins  we hear scratchy static 
			and then miraculously  a voice

							miguelito vo
					 and do give me some room 
					voltaire  youre breathing on my 
					head  i hate it when you breath 
					on my head

							jim
					dr loveless

			artemus nods  jim is amazed

							miguelito vo
					now youre standing in my light  
					how many times must i tell you  
					very well gentlemen what is our 
					report on dr pemberton  is she 
					cooperating

							assistant vo
					theyve persuaded her

							miguelito vo
					good good  now everyone take a 
					look at this

			then silence for precious seconds  the needle has almost 
			reached the end of the spinning cylinder  artemus gazes 
			at it impatiently

							jim
					this is good

							artemus
					shhh
						to recorder
					come on  tell us something

							miguelito vo
					that is precisely where we will 
					find little willard  and 
					unfortunately willard will have 
					to be exterminated if we are ever 
					to be taken seriously  we must 
					move quickly  get everything in 
					order  and voltaire be a good 
					boy and find me one of those western 
					hats
						on second thought
					no no one of those attractive 
					pith helmets  its damnably hot 
					out there isnt it
						pause
					oh we are so close  so very close 
					to the grand culmination of my 
					dream  the entire world will 
					tremble when they see

			but the recording cylinder runs out

							artemus
					oh damn  thats it

							jim
					its better than nothing

							artemus
					it is

							jim
					hes going to put on a pith helmet 
					and kill some guy named willard


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  day

			the telegraph clicks away  find jim and artemus eagerly 
			decoding the message  then simultaneously they look 
			crushed  artemus drops onto the sofa as jim flops into a 
			chair

							jim
					no record of him

							artemus
					youd think if loveless is going 
					to kill him he could at least be a 
					prominent citizen

			artemus looks out the window as we hear a train clanging 
			and chuffing to a stop on a parallel track

							artemus
					whats this

							jim
					sounds like a train
						glancing over
					looks like a train

							artemus
					yes  and a much nicer one than 
					ours

			the door flies open and two bodyguards and two aides march 
			in  jim leaps up

							jim
					who the hell are you  ever hear 
					of knocking  you think you can 
					just barge in here like that

			the men step aside for  president grant who strides in  
			jim keeps on talking but a different tune

							jim
					 well of course you can  mr 
					president what a surprise  what 
					brings you here

							grant
					on my way to denver

							aide
					albuquerque is next sir

							grant
					whatever  my whistlestop tour of 
					the southwest  one godforsaken 
					cowtown after another
						sees artemus
					you must be gordon  speak french 
					huh  hope it helps

			grant doesnt pause reaching out to the aide who hands 
			him a telegram

							grant
					got a message from some crackpot 
					named dr miguelito loveless  
					ever hear of him  wants the us 
					to give him half the southwest  
					claims its his  if we dont sign 
					his cockeyed treaty hes 
					threatening to destroy an entire 
					town every day until we do

			jim and artemus are stunned

							jim
					whered he say he was going to do 
					this

							grant
					he didnt  thats your job  im 
					taking you off that other case 
					until youve nabbed this lunatic  
					good luck
						takes in the parlour car
					nice train  but mines nicer

			grant hands the speechless guys the telegram and instantly 
			marches out followed by his entourage

			jim and artemus take a moment to collect themselves then 
			brighten as they realize

							artemus
					willard

							jim
					its not a guy

							artemus
					its a town

			they race to the bookshelf pull down atlases and start 
			flipping through them

							artemus
					got to be somewhere thats hot  
					he said it was damnably hot

							jim
						scanning the index
					that rules out willard vermont 
					willard minnesota
						brightening
					willard new mexico

			jim flips to the right page 

			angle  atlas  map of new mexico territory

			move in on the map finding the tiny town of willard


			ext  the west  day  the wanderer

			churns across the majestic western landscape weve been 
			waiting for


			ext  the west  night  the wanderer

			is a tiny speck streaking through the desert darkness


			int  the wanderer  parlour car  night

			artemus lounges smoking a cigar his face hidden behind 
			a book a guide to the ancient fighting skills of the 
			oriental races

			jim on the other hand paces the room itching for action

							jim
					damn i wish this thing would go 
					faster

							artemus
					relax  were almost there

							jim
					we oughta get a couple of those 
					rockets  voom  were there before 
					we left

			as artemus lowers the book hes reading

							artemus
					ill work on it

			jim stares  artemus is in another disguise with a full 
			beard and bulbous nose

							jim
					what is that

							artemus
					this
						fingers the nose
					im testing a new spirit gum to 
					see how it holds

							jim
					and people are actually fooled by 
					that

							artemus
						offended
					my disguises have helped me solve 
					many a difficult case  i spent 
					three years on the stage you know
						standing and taking off 
						his makeup
					remind me sometime to regale you 
					with my lear

			the men get down to business strapping on their guns  
			artemus hands jim the infamous beltbucklederringer

							jim
					not again

							artemus
					i adjusted it

			jim reluctantly straps it on takes a fighting stance 
			and slaps the buckle  nothing happens  he tries a few 
			more times  still no gun pops out

							jim
					so the idea is if a guy punches 
					me he really hurts his hand

							artemus
						testy
					you said it popped out too easily  
					nothings ever good enough for 
					you is it

			the train brakes squeal and we hear doyle over the speaking 
			tube

							doyle vo
					willard new mexico i i think


			ext  willard  the wanderer  parlour car  night

			jim and artemus step out and freeze  smoke blows past 
			them  doyle hurries to join them and they all silently 
			stare  pan to reveal 

			the town has been utterly destroyed  its hiroshima  
			buildings are shattered rubble  blackened timbers claw 
			up at the night sky  embers smolder everywhere

			a twisted rifle lies in the dust  a pair of boots juts 
			from under a smashed wagon  a womans ragged dress 
			flutters on a splintered beam  theres not a soul around

			stunned jim and artemus stare hopelessly at the horrifying 
			scene

							jim
						grim
					when we find him he is mine

							artemus
					oh no we split him fiftyfifty

			jim spots something  points off

			angle  their pov  a lone figure

			on a nearby hilltop silhouetted against a rising moon


			ext  hilltop  night

			the figure is a native american an acoma brave  hes 
			utterly confused and stunned by what hes seen  jim and 
			artemus quietly approach

							artemus
					hope he knows some english

			but jim holds up a hand silencing artemus and sits beside 
			the man  jim uses sign language  the entire scene plays 
			in silence  we see subtitles for the following

							jim
						signs
					did you see the thing that did 
					this

			the man nods

							jim
						signs
					it was big

							acoma brave
						signs
					very big  made of iron

							jim
						signs
					a lot of steam and noise  with 
					big guns

			the indian nods

							jim
						signs
					where is it now  where did it go

			the man points off to some distant mountains

							acoma brave
						signs
					it lives there in the ghost 
					mountains where no living man 
					goes

							jim
					figures

							artemus
					what  what figures  what did he 
					see


			ext  desert hills  night

			jim and artemus now on horseback ride along an old desert 
			trail in the moonlight

							artemus
						derisive
					ghost mountains  no self 
					respecting ghost would live out 
					here

			jims been eyeing the ground

							jim
					awful lot of fresh wagon tracks 
					for a place no living man goes


			ext  near the mountains  day

			jim and artemus still follow the tracks

							artemus
					what if these tracks are just 
					leading us to an indian village or 
					some old coots mining claim

							jim
					not likely  there must be tracks 
					of twenty different wagons  freight 
					wagons carriages buckboards

			jim suddenly wheels his horse and stops

							jim
					look at that

			tilt down to see all the wagon tracks end abruptly along 
			a straight line  beyond the line is completely untouched 
			ground

							artemus
					well thats something different

			jim follows the tracks back from the straight line noting 
			that they all make a short detour to pass close to a lone 
			joshua tree

							jim
					and they all make this little turn 
					here to pass right by this joshua 
					tree

			jim rides over to examine the tree  he whacks it with 
			his pistol butt  we hear an incongruous metallic clank  
			jim and artemus exchange a look

			jim eyes a branch that extends over the trail  gives it 
			a tentative pull  it swings like a lever  machinery 
			rumbles underground

			artemus horse rears as a rectangle of desert floor thirty
			feet long lifts straight up

			its an underground elevator its roof disguised as desert  
			where the wagon tracks have all stopped is the point where 
			wagons ride onto the elevator

			artemus turns graciously to jim

							artemus
					excellent detective work sir
						re the tunnel
					you should have the honor of going 
					first

							jim
						sarcastic
					oh thank you

							artemus
					my pleasure

			jim rides onto the platform  artemus follows  he spots 
			another lever on the elevator wall and gives it a kick  
			the elevator rumbles and starts to descend


			int  tunnel  night

			jim and artemus are lowered into a long tunnel and start 
			riding cautiously toward dim light at the other end


			int  tunnel  other end  night

			reaching the end of the tunnel they find themselves 
			looking down on


			ext  miguelitos lair  establish  night

			in a hidden valley surrounded on all sides by forbidding 
			mesas sits a complex of buildings  its a selfcontained 
			manufacturing center for god knows what  freight wagons 
			rumble to and fro  steam shovels and traction engines 
			labor  electric lights cast an eerie glow on everything

							artemus
					it looks like a factory  and all
					lit with electrical lights

			the dismount and lead their horses into a stand of trees 
			during

							jim
					lets split up  itll double our 
					chances of finding dr pemberton

			artemus nods and they sneak off down the wagon road into 
			the valley


			ext  miguelitos lair  warehouse  night

			a giant warehouse dominates the place  steam rolls out 
			its windows  a deep rumbling comes from within

			out in front in the glare of the lights the steam tank 
			is being serviced by a crew of workers  its even more 
			menacing than before  fitted with a new turret featuring 
			a bigger steam cannon a motorized gatling gun and twin 
			rocket launchers

			angle  jim

			in the shadows stares at the machine with foreboding  
			now he hears harpsichord music  he looks off

			angle  jims pov  miguelitos factory office

			atop a three story factory building sits miguelitos 
			office its elegant windows and lavish curtains out of 
			place in this roughhewn environment  the musics coming 
			from there  this must be the place

			but between him and his goal are a couple of armed guards


			ext  miguelitos factory office  minutes later

			a big freight wagon rolls past between the guards and the 
			outside stairway up to the office  unseen by them jim 
			is clinging to the offside of the wagon  he hops off and 
			sprints up the stairs


			int  miguelitos factory office  night

			in a sumptuous heavily decorated room miguelito holds 
			court behind a vast desk  antoinette plays dreamily on 
			her harpsichord while cassandra and voltaire listen

			just as miguelito launches into the first few bars of his 
			anthem the office door swings open  jim steps boldly 
			in locking it from the inside

			everyone is dumbstruck for a moment  then voltaire lunges 
			for him but jims sixgun instantly appears leveled at 
			the big mans face

							jim
					youre not that big

							miguelito
					restrain yourself voltaire  hes 
					just the sort of coward who would 
					shoot an unarmed giant

			voltaire backs off glowering  but miguelito keeps his 
			cool turning back to jim

							miguelito
					why mr west  i am impressed
						suddenly noticing
					ooh a rhyme

			antoinette strikes a little ta da chord and smiles

							miguelito
						going on
					still alive  hmm  i suppose that 
					doesnt bode well for poor bruno

							jim
					he had a pressing engagement

							miguelito
						scowls at jim
					philistine

			jim now aims his gun at the little man

							jim
					you got that right  now get up  
					were walking out of here

							miguelito
						flaring
					has it penetrated that adrenaline
					addled skull that you are surrounded 
					by seventyeight of my loyal 
					followers  you are in my domain

							jim
					has it penetrated yours that im 
					holding a gun on their leader

			youre under arrest  now move

							miguelito
						bellows
					you have no authority here  you 
					are out of your jurisdiction

			jim thinks the little guy has lost a few more marbles

							jim
					the us is my jurisdiction

							miguelito
					exactly  you are on foreign soil  
					you are a representative of the 
					occupying forces  or havent you 
					checked a map lately

			he hits a switch  a large wall map of the united states 
			unfurls like a movie screen  but the southern half of 
			california and a chunk of arizona and new mexico are all 
			in one color and labeled loveland

							miguelito
					these lands were taken by force 
					from mexico in the illegal war of 
					american aggression

							jim
					that would be the mexican war

							miguelito
					call it what you like  the point 
					is i was heir to that land mr 
					west  it belonged to my beloved 
					grandmother  now i intend to have 
					it back  my own country

			he gestures to a flag on the opposite wall

							miguelito
					you see i have everything  a 
					flag  my own postage stamps

			he points out colorful stamps in a glass display case  
			then he digs in his jacket pocket  jim warily cocks his 
			pistol

							miguelito
					oh relax

			miguelito slowly pulls out paper money tossing the bills 
			on the desk in front of jim  they bear miguelitos 
			portrait

							miguelito
					ive even printed my own currency

							jim
						reading from a bill
					emperor miguelito

							miguelito
					the first

							jim
					well your highness what makes 
					you think well ever sign a treaty 
					with you

							miguelito
					because i am holding all the western 
					territories hostage mr west  a 
					town a day will disappear  willard 
					was merely a test run a stroll in 
					the park  next i level all of 
					albuquerque
						off jims reaction
					yes thats right  only yesterday 
					i learned what you undoubtedly 
					already know your own president 
					will be there  what an added bonus  
					the gods are shining on me  after 
					tomorrow every american citizen 
					will rise up and demand i be given 
					back my humble little empire

							jim
						looking to the others
					so im the only one here who can 
					tell the difference between an 
					emperor and a murderer

			miguelito glowers

							miguelito
					the definition of what i am mr 
					west depends simply on whether 
					or not i win  and guess what  
					im going to win

			with that he suddenly presses one of a row of brass buttons 
			on the edge of his desk  a trap door opens

			but not under jim  it opens a couple of feet away  jim 
			smiles  miguelito is abashed

							miguelito
					oh poo  dont you just hate it  
					i mean people are simply never 
					standing where theyre supposed to 
					be

			he sighs  then wildly punches several more buttons  
			trap doors open all over the floor  jim agilely leaps 
			from spot to spot  but he cant avoid the inevitable and 
			finally plunges from view

			as the last trap door snaps shut miguelito strides over 
			smugly then suddenly shouts at the floor

							miguelito
					you think im stupid
						to the others
					if he did i bet he doesnt think 
					so now  at least i hope he doesnt  
					hed better not


			int  jail cell  night

			were in a dungeonlike room set up as a laboratory  
			camera pans to a wall  in a moment the wall bangs open  
			and jim rockets out of a chute skidding on his back 
			headfirst across the room  the wall slams shut

			jim slides right under a womans flowing skirt

							jim os
					dr pemberton i presume

			he pulls his head out and finds a startled dr pemberton 
			staring down at him

							pemberton
					why mr west

			jim quickly gets to his feet  the room is full of 
			scientific equipment  a combo labprison

			dr pemberton looks like shes been through a lot face 
			dirty clothes torn

							jim
					are you all right

							pemberton
						sighs
					for the moment  but i fear not 
					for long  im of no use to him 
					now

			jim tries the bars on the window during

							jim
					you finished the work on his steam 
					engine

			she nods sadly her eyes misting

							pemberton
					they threatened to harm my father
						sudden anger
					and its my engine stolen from my 
					own patents  he put it in his big 
					war machine  but of course hed 
					installed the valves improperly  
					it works perfectly now

			dr pemberton sinks down in a chair hopelessly

							pemberton
					he hes planning to kill us 
					isnt he

							jim
					hes just full of plans that arent 
					gonna work out

			he looks around and grabs a small thickwalled metal 
			cylinder among the lab equipment  he examines it with 
			interest

							jim
					this is something

							pemberton
						not following
					its a smelting retort

			he unscrews the top of the cylinder pours out the sandy 
			contents

							jim
					now its a bomb

							pemberton
					it is

			he pulls a cartridge off his gun belt

							jim
					all how you look at things

			he works the bullet out of the end of a cartridge and 
			dumps the gunpowder into the cylinder  he hands her a 
			few cartridges indicating she do the same

							jim
					just have to get it hot enough 
					and take cover  come on help me 
					get the bullets out


			ext  miguelitos factory office  night

			from the top of the stairway outside his office miguelito 
			angrily berates a group of guards assembled below  we 
			notice among them one particularly fierce guard  a bushy
			bearded eyepatched roughneck

							miguelito
					 mr west strolled right through 
					your defenses again  ive had to 
					capture him again  and mr gordon 
					is undoubtedly lurking about again  
					so find him and shoot him here
						points to his own forehead
					with a big gun


			int  jail cell  night

			close on the metal cylinder we saw jim start to fill with 
			gunpowder  it is now capped tight and wired to the bars 
			on the window  a wad of flaming rags burns below it 
			heating it up

			pan to jim and dr pemberton hiding behind a barricade of 
			tables and equipment


			ext  miguelitos factory office  jail cell  night

			boom  bars and bricks fly


			int  miguelitos factory office  night

			ahead of them their winchesters aimed  a tense standoff  
			jims thinking about drawing when  click  a colt

			widen to see its the fierce eyepatched bearded guard

			he barks at the other guards

							guard
					what the hells a matter with you 
					yellabellies  orders is to shoot 
					gordon  goes for them too
						to jim and pemberton

			he shoves his prisoners marching them off behind a steam 
			shovel  almost immediately we hear two gunshots

			angle  behind the steam shovel

			close on jim waiting for the bullet  he looks over 
			baffled  the guard is holding the smoking pistol pointed 
			in the air  he speaks

							artemus
					go ahead make fun of this disguise

							artemus
						sarcastic
					oh well then lets kick some

			just then they hear a familiar nasty buzzing  its a 
			screeching boomerang bomb

			jim and artemus realize what that must mean  they spin 
			to dr pemberton  then look at each other  no time for 
			propriety  they grab her blouse and yank it up  she 
			shrieks  but there it is  a metal belt just like 
			professor morton wore  the deadly homing belt

			they throw the poor woman to the ground and dive for cover 
			just as the thing streaks overhead missing her by inches

							artemus
					you didnt tell us you had this 
					on

							pemberton
						gazing at the bomb
					my lord he was telling the truth

			the bomb loops high and dives on its final deadly attack

			miguelitos guards come running toward the action but 
			they scramble back and take cover as the buzzing bomb 
			whirls overhead

			jim draws his sixgun  he coolly tracks the bomb and 
			fires  boom  midair fireball  but they hear more 
			buzzing  another bomb  they look off to see 

			angle  voltaire

			high up on a catwalk loading a second flying bomb into a 
			weird crossbow like launcher  twang  the thing streaks 
			toward dr pemberton

			blam  jim nails this one too  voltaire snarls

			angle  voltaire

			he loads two bombs at once

			angle  the group

			blam  blam  jim blows both bombs out of the air

							jim
					hurry up artemus  im running 
					out of bullets

			two more boomerang bombs buzz angrily toward them  blam  
			jim gets one  but then  click  guns empty

			the second bomb keeps coming

			another click  but its artemus snapping the belts lock 
			open  he jumps up whirling like a discus thrower and 
			heaves the belt in a high arc

			the flying bomb does a screaming 180 to follow the belt

			angle  horrified voltaire

			sees the belt sailing toward him followed by the flying 
			bomb  oops  it lands right below him  he barely has 
			time to scream before hes blown skyhigh

			angle  the group

			jim lifts dr pemberton to her feet

							jim
					are you all right

			she nods uncertainly  but meanwhile miguelitos guards 
			and workers are rallying  two workers rush out of hiding 
			brandishing heavy hand tools as they rush jim and artemus  
			jim squares off to deal with them but before he can make 
			a move hes amazed to see artemus instantly dispatch 
			them  with a knockout doublesplit kick

							artemus
						shrugs
					it was in your book

							jim
						impressed
					well hell maybe we do have a 
					chance

			but now a nasty sounding steam whistle blares

			angle  the steam tank

			comes rumbling toward them from the warehouse  it opens 
			fire with its motorized gatling gun

			back to scene

			jim artemus and dr pemberton dive for cover  bullets 
			ricochet all around them  they scramble along on their 
			bellies behind stacked supplies  jim gets an idea looking 
			at the buttons on artemus vest

							jim
					are those just button buttons or

							artemus
					of course not

			jim rips one off

							jim
					stay down

			and he runs

							artemus
					jim

			angle  jim

			scurries along behind the row of supplies staying hidden 
			as he does an endrun around the approaching tank

			jim charges into the open beelining for the tank  he 
			grabs onto the massive rear wheel and rides it up  as he 
			comes opposite the turret he lobs the button in through 
			one of the gunports

			poof  sleep gas surges out from inside the tank

			gagging and choking the tankmen throw open the hatches 
			collapsing unconscious as they tumble out

			the machine keeps driving blindly forward  jim scrambles 
			up on top takes a deep breath and dives inside


			int  steam tank  moving

			holding his breath jim yanks levers madly trying to get 
			anything to do anything  the turret spins  okay got 
			that down  the gatling gun fires  thats good  more of 
			that


			ext  steam tank  moving

			jim spins the turret in a circle firing the gatling as 
			he goes  miguelitos men run frantically in all 
			directions diving for cover

			angle  artemus

			is also firing at the disorganized guards

			the steam tank rolls up offering a shield  jim pops up 
			taking a much needed gasp of air as the last of the sleep 
			gas dissipates  artemus and dr pemberton climb up into 
			the tank

							artemus
					my hat is off to you sir

							jim
					thank you

			they slam the hatch and theyre off

					right

			the steam tank gathers steam  frantic guards dive out of 
			the way  some fire wildly at the thing but of course 
			it does no good

			as jim struggles to steer the tank careens drunkenly 
			around the compound smashing into things while its gatling 
			gun blazes and steam cannon hisses  basically its a 
			rout  miguelitos panicked men are running everywhere

			come dashing through the turmoil headed for the warehouse

			rolls up and stops  jim pops up out of the tanks hatch

							jim
					its all over loveless  you might

			int  steam tank

			jim drops back down to his controls ready for action  
			dr pemberton seems concerned

							pemberton
					you seem so confident mr west
					do you really think we have any 
					chance in this little machine

			jim and artemus turn slowly to stare at her worriedly

							jim
					i beg your pardon

							pemberton
						realizing
					you dont know what hes built  
					surely you dont think he kidnapped 
					all those geniuses to have them 
					make something as rudimentary as 
					this

			jim and artemus glance at each other  well yeah we 
			sort of did  outside miguelitos men are laughing 
			derisively

			before dr pemberton can explain they hear a gigantic 
			rush of steam  with the eerie laughter echoing all around 
			them jim and artemus peer out


			ext  warehouse  night

			huge clouds of steam boil out of the warehouse  unseen 
			massive metal parts groan and creak  the walls of the 
			building shudder  the ground shakes

			the roof of the building is shoved upward  splintering 
			cracking  at last falling away to reveal the top of a 
			monstrous fantastic war machine

			we can see only the top deck  a hundred feet long 
			black brooding massively constructed of riveted steel

			at the forward end a raised bridge oversees all  it is 
			protected by unusual seethrough armor  curtains of 
			thick tightly woven chainmail which undulate weirdly as 
			the machine moves  through them we can just make out 
			cassandra and gleeful miguelito at the controls

			the machine lurches forward smashing through the wall of 
			the building  we finally see the rest of it

			it doesnt have wheels

			it doesnt have treads

			it has legs  the thirty foot tall behemoth stands on six 
			immense multijointed pistonpowered legs

			this is the tarantula

			its huge bulbous body three decks high is suspended in 
			the center of the radiating legs  the top deck is open  
			the center deck contains the engine room and gearing  
			the lower deck bristles with turretmounted gatling guns 
			and cannons

			the body is surrounded by a bewildering exoskeleton  
			a cage of crisscrossing riveted girders and beams  narrow 
			catwalks run helterskelter through the complex

			its intensely jules verne  everywhere things are moving  
			giant gears whirling flywheels gleaming pistons  steam 
			hisses from dozens of vents

			on the ground the remainder of miguelitos men come out 
			of hiding cheering wildly throwing their hats skyward

			angle  the steam tank

			jim artemus and dr pemberton gaze up at the thing in 
			absolute dumbstruck wonder

							artemus
					god in heaven what is that

							jim
					thats thats the criminal mind 
					about to stomp our sorry butts

							pemberton
						terrified
					he calls it the tarantula

							artemus
					but it only has six legs

							jim
					shut up

			angle  the tarantula

			it turns toward them giant clanking legs working in smooth 
			choreography  the eerie highstepping gait of well 
			of a tarantula  each huge foot kicks up a cloud of dust 
			as it slams down

			the tarantulas vast shadow falls across the hopelessly 
			minuscule steam tank

			jim artemus and dr pemberton shrink down into the tank 
			slamming the hatch


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  night

			levers steam valves brassrimmed gauges  cassandra 
			consults dials and spins valvewheels as miguelito works

			a big redpainted lever the master speed control

			the rest of the top deck is a maze of exposed machinery 
			pumping throbbing and spinning  osha was not consulted

			and the view is spectacular  a commanding 360 degrees 
			through the chainmail armor curtains

			miguelito smiles down at the puny steam tank

							miguelito
					aww  you took my little steam gun

					to get along without it

			but dont leave a scratch

			a cannonball from the steam tank strikes the chain mail 
			curtain  the curtain bulges inward but stops the shell 
			a foot from miguelitos head then springs back flinging

						exultant
					it works  did you see that

			thud  the bandleader glares at the bass drummer who 
			shrugs helplessly i aint doing it

					 it is with great honor i present 
					to you the president of the united

			the crowd cheers wildly  grant takes the stand  but 
			before he speaks he becomes aware of the eerie thudding 
			growing louder and louder

			more and more people hear it looking around falling 
			silent  the ominous sound permeates the atmosphere  
			wheres it coming from  what could it be

			a cry goes up  hands point  heads turn

			dust boils from behind it

			the tarantula marches slowly up into view  it pauses on

			the first rounds go wide and high blasting a water tower 
			throwing up geysers in the rio grande  but the townsfolk 
			get the point

			bedlam  screams  utter chaos

			the next rounds are more accurate  explosions march 
			down the street toward the bandstand  grant and the 
			dignitaries dive unceremoniously off as the bandstand is 
			shattered

			another blast shears a flagpole and the american flag 
			flying over the courthouse topples in the dust

			and the soldiers mount a hopeless defense  puny explosions

						to cassandra

					adios mr president

			but cassandra glimpses something to one side

							cassandra

			the wanderer is seconds from colliding with the tarantula 
			when the big machine leans crazily sideways  the two

			pivots back on course marching onward

					oh i see an easy plan

			artemus leaps into the wagon grabs the reins and charges

			into the basket

			the wagon races along artemus towing the balloon right 
			into the path of the oncoming tarantula  jim shouts from 
			the balloon

							jim
					all right artemus  get up here

			artemus reins in the horses and leaps into the back of 
			the wagon to untie the balloon

			but a withering burst of gatling fire tears up the wagon 
			literally cutting it in half  it collapses  artemus 
			falls with it  the balloons rope rips free

			bullets zinging around him artemus rolls for cover

			knows it  as the monster keeps veering away he lets fly 
			with a cowboy yell  and snags it

			whoosh the balloon is instantly taken into tow hauled 
			behind at a crazy angle  the worlds biggest kite

			without hesitation jim climbs out of the basket and starts 
			down the taut rope hand over hand  he reaches the criss
			crossing exoskeleton girders on the very stern and 
			gingerly begins to climb down

			miguelito brings the tarantula to a lurching stop  the 
			chainmail curtains whoosh aside  he and cassandra rush 
			out  they can see the balloon flying above the stern

					find west  find him  get him

			down below miguelitos gunners open up on grant and his 
			men with the turretmounted gatlings


			ext  albuquerque  central avenue  artemus

			sees the tarantula start to move lifting its legs out of 
			the rubble of the saloon  if hes going to act hed 
			better act now

							artemus
						psyching himself up
					oh all right  act first and worry 
					later

			he lunges for the massive foot and grabs on

			hes carried high in the air as the foot is raised to 
			clear the wrecked building  the foot starts back down  
			he braces for the shock clinging to the riveted cross
			members of the ankle  whoom  the foot slams down but 
			he hangs on

			the leg stays still for a moment while the other legs do 
			their thing  in this pause artemus scrambles partway up  
			avoiding thrusting pistons he can only climb during the 
			pauses but hes getting there


			ext  tarantula  top deck  day

			jim finally drops down onto the deck  its a nightmare 
			maze of air intakes reciprocating gears and pumping 
			pistons that protrude through it from the engine deck 
			below  jim eases along a narrow catwalk avoiding the 
			gyrating machinery

			he ducks as a big counterweight swings across the catwalk  
			the move saves his life as pow a shot strikes the bulkhead 
			where he was  he pops up gun drawn but hesitates for a 
			second when he sees its cassandra who fired  in that 
			moment the counterweight swings back knocking jims 
			pistol right out of his hand  it skids across the deck 
			and drops into a narrow grating  jim tries to reach it 
			but his arm is too big to fit through

			he jumps up as cassandra advances on him moving around 
			an immense reciprocating gear protruding up through the 
			deck  jim backs up punching the derringer belt buckle a 
			couple of times  no good

							cassandra
					i had hoped i wouldnt be the one 
					who had to do this mr west  i 
					usually dont mind killing a man  
					but in your case i find myself

							jim
					you know i really hate being toyed 
					with before someone shoots me

							cassandra
						with a shrug
					fine ill stop

			she fires  the shot hits jim in the stomach  right in 
			the derringer belt buckle  spang  the derringer flips 
			out and fires

			cassandra is hit squarely  pure shock and surprise on 
			her face she sags sideways toward the roaring gears  
			she weakly grabs onto a cross member  eyes wide with

			shriek cassandra pitches forward

			artemus has climbed up to the knee of the leg  here it 
			makes a sharp bend back down to pass through the wall of 
			the middle deck  when the leg moves back there is a gap 
			in the wall just big enough to slide through  when the 
			leg steps forward the gap closes

			timing it just right artemus slides down the leg and 
			through the gap


			int  tarantula  engine deck  day

			artemus drops onto a precarious walkway in the heart of 
			the tarantula a bewildering mc escher chamber of 
			whirling gears spinning flywheels hissing pistons 
			massive clanking drive chains

			hes spotted by a uniformed crewman across the chamber  
			they both pull six guns and rapid fire  but the 
			oscillating machinery between them blocks all twelve 
			shots bullets ricocheting everywhere  artemus and the 
			crewman blink at each other unhurt unbelieving

			then the crewman charges  they go at it hand to hand at 
			every moment in danger of falling into the works


			ext  tarantula  top deck  day

			jim works his way cautiously toward the bridge

			miguelitos voice comes over the speaking tubes

							miguelito os
					cassandra answer me


			int  tarantula  engine deck  day

			the powerful crewman has pinned artemus against a railing 
			choking him  beside them is a big whirling flywheel  
			artemus spots the mans long key chain hooked to his belt  
			he lets go of the mans arms for an instant and flicks 
			the keychain over into the spokes of the flywheel

			in a flash the startled crewman is yanked sideways and 
			instantly sucked into the machinery  artemus stands and 
			dusts himself off  problem solved

			then a door flies open  five angry crewmen burst in  
			coalstokers armed with wrenches shovels and whathave
			you  they advance menacingly  artemus gulps


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

							miguelito

			a voice comes back over the speaking tube

							voice os
					as soon as possible sir  we have 
					an intruder on board

							miguelito
					i know that you idiot  thats 
					why i want help


			ext  central avenue  church  day

			the tarantula ambles slowly down the street smashing 
			awnings stomping boardwalks shearing off signs coming 
			closer and closer to the church

			grant and his soldiers fire futilely at it ducking the 
			withering gatling return fire


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

			miguelito glowers as he deliberately steers the machine 
			left and right smashing whatever catches his eye

			suddenly hes scooped up and tossed aside  its jim whos 
			sneaked onto the bridge  he triumphantly steps forward 
			and shoves the master speed control shutting down the 
			tarantula  he turns to miguelito

							jim
					for an emperor youre one bad 
					driver

			but miguelito has grabbed artemus walking stick and comes 
			at him like a wildman  jim backpedals trying to fend 
			off the blows but finally he has no choice  he spin
			kicks the guy right out onto the deck

			the little man slides across the top deck slamming into 
			a bulkhead  the walking stick goes skittering away down 
			an access hatch  now defenseless he leaps up and runs 
			off  jim runs after him


			int  tarantula  engine deck  day

			artemus has been backed up to a wall by the five stokers  
			theyre about to do him in when ting tang clink 
			something comes tumbling down from above  it lands right 
			in artemus hand  he cant imagine how its possible 
			but its his walking stick

							artemus
					deus ex machina

			the tables are instantly turned  artemus snaps it open 
			into mace mode and attacks with a vengeance a wildass 
			oneman tornado

			he forces the stunned stokers out through a hatchway and 
			slams the metal door locking them out

			he spins and expertly assesses the complex of machinery 
			all around him

							artemus
					lets see that goes there so 
					that must do that so that has 
					to be connected to  ah hah

			he grabs a big wrench and begins unbolting one of the 
			long connecting rods


			ext  tarantula  top deck  day

			jim searches for miguelito in the maze of top deck 
			machinery  he spots him lying facedown on a grating

							jim
					its all over little guy

			but miguelito suddenly rolls over pulling his arm out 
			from the grating having found jims own sixgun which he 
			aims at him

							miguelito
					look what i found

			startled jim raises his hands backing up

							jim
					easy now

							miguelito
					easy  easy  on just what grounds 
					should i take it easy


			int  tarantula  engine deck  day

			artemus is merrily disconnecting connecting rods tossing 
			them out a nearby porthole


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

			jim is backed up against the control console totally 
			cornered  his eyes dart around as miguelito takes very 
			deliberate aim

							miguelito
					i will say this mr west i have 
					never had to kill someone so many 
					times

			jim suddenly shoves the master speed control full forward  
			the deck tilts wildly as the tarantula lunges ahead  
			miguelitos shot goes wild and the little emperor tumbles 
			backward away from the bridge again

			jim hangs on marveling at the power of the machine

							jim
					man i gotta get me one of these


			ext  tarantula  day

			the huge machine rears up like an arachnostallion and 
			then plunges down the street clanking hissing  
			accelerating


			int  tarantula  engine deck  day

			artemus hangs on as the room pitches and rolls doggedly 
			working to unbolt one last connecting rod  got it


			ext  tarantula  top deck  day

			miguelito skids helplessly across the rocking deck and  
			disappears howling down an air intake


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

			in the gyrating bridge jim fights to keep his balance 
			struggling back to the master control  he yanks it back 
			with grand finality  and nothing happens  the maniacal 
			mechanical menace keeps going  he frantically works the 
			lever back and forth  no good

							jim
					hey  stop

			just beside the bridge artemus comes up out of a hatch 
			proudly holding up the last connecting rod

							artemus
					jim  i did it  ive uncoupled 
					all the connecting rods  theres 
					no way they can control this thing 
					now

			he triumphantly flings this last rod overboard  jim stares 
			at him aghast  artemus looks around

							artemus
					why is it going so fast

			the tarantula keeps accelerating


			ext  central avenue  church  day

			grant and the soldiers eye the tarantula thundering toward 
			them  a steel tidal wave

							soldier
					it aint stoppin  it aint 
					stoppin

							grant
					get everyone out of the church  
					get them out  move

			the tarantula is fifty yards from the front steps  
			panicked townsfolk spill out the doors tumble out the 
			windows

			angle  rear of the church

			president grant climbs out a window carrying one last 
			person a laughing two yearold

			grant barely manages to dive out of the way as 

			angle  wide

			the tarantula plows through the church  the building 
			explodes into toothpicks

			pan with the monster machine as it pounds onward out into 
			the desert literally starting to gallop huge feet 
			throwing up truckloads of earth with every smashing impact


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

			jim and artemus argue as they spin knobs crank cranks 
			and try anything to slow down the galloping beast

							artemus
					the machine was stopped  it seemed 
					like a perfect time to disable it  
					whyd you have to throw it into 
					full throttle

							jim
					he was going to shoot me  do you 
					mind

							artemus
					all right all right itll be 
					okay  i mean eventually itll 
					just run out of steam

							jim
						pointing ahead
					in the next two minutes

			artemus looks  and goes pale


			ext  high and wide  deep canyon  day

			the tarantulas headed straight for it


			ext  tarantula  top deck  bridge  day

			jim and artemus stare at impending doom  then jim gets 
			an idea  he looks back to see the tarantula is still 
			towing the observation balloon

							jim
					come on


			ext  tarantula  top deck  stern  day

			jim and artemus race to the rope holding the balloon

			jim frantically tries to untie it

							artemus
					here

			artemus kicks the heel of his boot  out pops the knife 
			blade  its a ridiculously awkward task madly sawing on 
			the thick rope with his toe but its their only hope  
			strand by strand it gives way

			jim glances ahead  that cliff is coming up fast

			suddenly right beside them a hatch slams open

			miguelito pops out still brandishing jims gun

							miguelito
					now you die

			totally deadpan jim and artemus simply point ahead  
			miguelito turns and sees the onrushing cliff  he instantly 
			drops the gun and gestures desperately to the rope

							miguelito
					hurry  cut it  do it you idiot  
					do you want to die

							artemus
					can you muzzle him or something

			the rope starts to pop and unravel

							jim
					there it goes  hang on

			jim grabs the rope


			ext  deep canyon  day

			the monster machine plummets over the edge legs flailing 
			dragging the balloon behind it


			ext  albuquerque  day

			dr pemberton and doyle are horrified at the sight  are 
			jim and artemus goners


			ext  tarantula in freefall  day

			the three men are weightless with the flailing tarantula  
			jim still clings to the rope

			and it finally snaps  jim just manages to catch artemus 
			by the wrist  artemus just manages to snag miguelito by 
			the ankle and all three of them whip skyward

			up they sail hanging beneath the ascending balloon 
			miguelito dangling upsidedown  he covers his eyes as 

			angle  canyon floor

			the magnificent tarantula slams into the rocks like the 
			asteroid that killed the dinosaurs  it shatters into a 
			million fragments exploding in a volcano of steam

			angle  jim artemus and miguelito

			drift along staring down at the devastation  finally

							miguelito
					i dont suppose you have any idea 
					what that thing cost do you


			ext  albuquerque  day

			doyle and dr pemberton are horrified as a huge fireball 
			rises out of the canyon  how could anyone have survived


			ext  deep canyon  day

			then the balloon rises gracefully into view jim artemus 
			and miguelito dangling beneath


			ext  albuquerque  day

			doyle and dr pemberton are overjoyed to see them among 
			the living  tilt up to see

			the balloon drifting slowly down toward the amazed 
			grateful cheering townsfolk  and we hear

							miguelito
					i remind you all youre dealing 
					with a genius  already i am 
					analyzing my mistakes  i was 
					thinking too small  next time i 
					wont settle for just the southwest  
					oh no  next time

												dissolve to


			ext  albuquerque train station  day

			artemus walks slowly toward the station clearly dejected 
			reading a letter over and over

			a lonely steam whistle sounds in the distance  he looks 
			off  a train is coming

			but as the locomotive draws near he realizes  its an 
			exact copy of the wanderer  except the engine is number 
			5 the number the shows fans know and they thought we 
			had it wrong all this time  artemus is stunned

			as the train steams in hes further astonished to see 
			doyle leaning out of the cab with a big grin

							doyle
					a good mornin to you sir  have 
					you met my new fireman

			artemus does yet another take as he sees doyles new 
			fireman  beaming dr pemberton

			now jim comes hurrying along dressed in his western 
			finest carrying his saddlebags

							jim
					artemus  look at that  brand 
					spanking new  shes a beauty 
					huh  lets get rolling

							artemus
					what is this  a whole new train

							jim
					well sure  didnt you get your 
					orders

			artemus glumly holds out the letter

							artemus
					yes yes i did  im to take the 
					threethirty train to baltimore  
					ive been assigned a desk job in 
					the exciting mail fraud division

			jim studies the letter shocked  he hands it back to 
			artemus

							jim
					oh am i embarrassed  the 
					president made my assignment 
					permanent  new train two weeks 
					vacation and everything  i just 
					assumed i mean id never 
					have asked you to meet me here if 
					id known

			artemus tries to shrug it off

							artemus
					jim jim forget it  obviously 
					your work impressed everyone  
					certainly impressed me
						after a pause
					youre kind of unpredictable but 
					you are the best partner ive ever 
					had

			he gives jim a heartfelt handshake

							jim
					damn artemus im going to miss 
					you and your gadgets and your 
					disguises your smartass 
					sarcasm

			artemus smiles weakly  doyle toots the whistle

							doyle
					all aboard sir  got a schedule 
					to keep

			jim and artemus part awkwardly avoiding each others eyes

							jim
					well well stay in touch you 
					know

							artemus
					im sure we will

			jim boards the parlour car and the wanderer begins to 
			chug slowly away

			a young boy scurries up to artemus thrusting out an 
			envelope

							young boy
					mr gordon this is for you  
					envelope number two

							artemus
					number two

							young boy
					thats right  envelope number one 
					i am to give you at ten am this 
					morning which i did  envelope 
					number two i am to give you the 
					second that there train starts 
					moving which im doing  mr west
					paid me five whole dollars

							artemus
					he what

			artemus snatches the envelope rips it open  and scans 
			his real orders  he whirls to see jim waving innocently 
			from the train  artemus charges after him

							artemus
					you inconsiderate reprobate  it 
					was my assignment in the first 
					place  you were lucky i even let 
					you tag along

			jim is cracking up as he urges him on  artemus sprints 
			madly down the tracks and finally overtakes the train  
			jim extends a hand to pull him aboard and we watch the 
			wanderer steam magnificently off into the new

							wild wild west
