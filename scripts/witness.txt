               the faces of several young children are presented in closeup 
               as they walk toward us across a ploughed field on the sound 
               track the haunting sounds of a gregorian funeral chant the 
               camera pans up to the faces of older brothers and sisters 
               then to parents and grandparents these are not familiar 
               faces but faces from another age strong and open all are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the amish

               through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of blackclad figures make their way down a lane

               ext country lane – day

               an amish buggy black and highwheeled stark against the 
               landscape appears a spirited chestnut in the traces

               framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors the face of a boy attired 
               like his father peering out

               the horses breath smokes on the frosty air the buggy creaks 
               on its springs and theres the rhythmic clipclop of hooves 
               on the pavement

               another lane

               two amish buggies reach a crossroads join a procession of 
               three others they disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory

               valley

               a big shot now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies it is headed toward a distant farmhouse

               barnyard

               where literally dozens of carriages are parked the horses 
               have been taken from the traces removed to the shelter of

               fifty or more amish all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches a wooden coffin rests on a bench in the

               a young woman of perhaps twentyseven her face is pale and 
               drawn

               in happier circumstances although there havent been too 
               many of late in rachels life we would see a robust sensual 
               woman of full figure spirit and intelligence

               eightyearold samuel lapp flits next to his mother he would 
               appear stunned possibly not entirely comprehending events

               and the patriarch eli lapp his stubborn weathered – yet 
               not unkind – features griefstricken

               as he removes his hat as one the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also

               then the preacher begins to speak in a formal german dialect

               where rachel samuel and eli are sitting  sounds of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as

                         his voice will be heard no more he 
                         was needed in our presence but god 
                         needs such men too that one should 
                         be taken so suddenly treat sorrow 
                         still we would not wish him back 
                         rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him

               as the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave the preacher begins to read a hymn in german a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air

               its set a little high for samuel and it is making glugging 
               flushing noises that are at least intimidating samuel

               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters with some urgency 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser suddenly he glances up

               his partner is a caucasian in designer jeans half boots and 
               a short leather jacket

               they advance on the young man with unmistakable menace

               the young man whirls in terror his two assailants lunge for

               as the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door

               back to fight

               as the struggle builds to a climax ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt his face draining of color

               the two attackers step away the blade in the black mans 
               hand bloodstained his partner stares at what theyve 
               accomplished with a stunned expression

                                     partner
                         jesus

               the young mans hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood

               he stares at it staggers toward the sinks finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror 
               then he collapses to the floor

               the black man motions for his partner to watch the door 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser

               angle in samuels stall

               as he edges open the stall door a crack over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man his back to us rifling the 
               backpack but beyond him in the mirror on the far wall we 
               catch sight of the black mans face

               samuel

               as he stares out the narrow crack a beat then he closes 
               the stall door

               angle in stall

               samuel tries to make the latch work but its warped and 
               wont fall closed

               black man

               as he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket 
               his partner is covering the door an automatic in his hand

               the black man makes for the exit then on second thought 
               glances at the row of stalls

               his pov – stalls

               all quiet but

               back to scene

               the black man whips out a 38 caliber revolver and starting 
               at the near end starts pushing open the stall doors

               angle in sams stall

               as the black man approaches samuel working desperately on 
               the latch at the last minute he finally wedges it in

               black man

               he elbows samuels stall the door wont open

               angle in sams stall

               fighting back panic samuel has retreated as far as he can

               black man

               as he gives the door a kick it holds he swears under his 
               breath

               angle in sams stall

               in desperation samuel does the only thing he can think of 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out but he loses his hat in the 
               process his hand snakes back into frame to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges hes 
               framed there the big muzzle of the 38 revolver looking 
               down our throats

               angle

               as his partner snaps from the doorway

                                     partner
                         will you come on for christs sakes

               a beat then the black man holsters his weapon turns to 
               follow the partner out

               back to samuel

               as we hear the sound of the two men exiting the lavatory a 
               long beat then samuel opens the stall door a crack

               his pow through door

               samuels own face reflected in the bloodsmeared mirror 
               then panning down to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor

               bench waiting room – low angle – night

               samuel sits close to his mother his face pale his eyes

               obscuring the lonely couple there is considerable echoing

                              smiles

                         need to be kept after a little bit

               rachel means no harm by this but elaines eyes begin to 
               storm

                                     elaine
                         oh is that so

                         no offense lady but im not so 
                         sure i like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down

               rachels smile fades at elaines trembling outburst

                                     rachel
                         please i didnt mean

               abruptly elaine rises and snatches the mop from rachels 
               hands

               she mops furiously as she continues

                                     elaine
                         i know exactly what you meant listen 
                         maybe im not a worldclass housefrau 
                         but maybe i dont have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids
                              and
                         its none of your business but i 
                         dont happen to have a man around 
                         here full time so i sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         i can even pay the rent on time so 
                         maybe im not mary poppins but maybe 
                         i dont need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this

               she finishes the floor hurls the mop aside with a clatter

                                     elaine
                         there is that clean enough for you

               rachel is speechless elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears at which point fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt taking in the sparkling kitchen

                                     fred
                         jesus elaine somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom

               and bursting into tears she flees the kitchen fred stares 
               after her

                                     fred
                         whats bugging her

               unperturbed he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot 
               letting his eyes take in rachels full figure

               int elaines bedroom

               as rachel comes in with elaines coffee closes the door 
               behind her elaine is lying across the bed sobbing

                                     rachel
                         i brought your coffee

               she takes a seat next to the bed

                                     rachel
                         im sorry i didnt mean it that 
                         way

               after a moment elaine starts to pull herself together

                                     elaine
                         its okay

                         sort of made me face it

               she takes the cup sips the coffee rachel smiles at a private 
               thought

                                     elaine

                         screamed at him

                                     elaine

                         scream at a man that way

                         but i think it would have done me 
                         good if i could have screamed at

               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him before putting

               as the car pulls up in the barnyard and eli crosses to it

               suddenly the car door flies open and samuel jumps out races 
               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man

               angle at car

               as rachel steps out of the passengers side book remains

               rachel stares at him not sure what he means then backs 
               away closing the door book begins to turn the car around 
               in the barnyard

               eli is about to inquire further when samuel cries

                         momma – look

               they glance in the direction samuel is looking

               their pov – books car

               the car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field its knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside the car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth

               back to rachel

               she stares

                                                                    cut to

               as samuel races for all hes worth across the field 
               negotiates the creek via a fallen log – rachel now also 
               running toward the car

               ext stables – day

               eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon he 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot

               angle at books car

               we see that rachel has made book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron 
               momentarily he comes awake

                                     rachel

                              bewildered
                         but why

                         and when they find me theyll find 
                         your boy

               he slips under again rachel stares at him realizing the 
               price hes paid in returning them to safety

               she reaches out touches him gently

               but the moment is broken by

               another angle

               as eli reins up in the springwagon he climbs down crosses 
               to glance into the car

                                     eli
                         is the english dead

                                     eli
                         looks dead

               and together they begin to lift book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon and

               int lamp farmhouse

               where eli is looking out a window

               eli frowns at books holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed

                                     eli
                         that has no place in this house

               she picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest

                                     rachel

               as stoltzfus in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva continues the 
               examination

               finally he steps back

                                     stoltzfus
                         this man should be treated in town

                         of infection and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood

               rachel looks at stoltzfus then turns away torn by her 
               dilemma

               her eyes fall on samuel gently she ushers him from the room

               ext lapp farm – lancaster county – night

               reestablishing and tightening to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns

               int sickroom

               as samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan book is lying asleep 
               on the bed

               samuel puts the bedpan down checks to make sure book is 
               indeed asleep then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest

               angle

               books big 38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes

               fascinated samuel picks it up admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips unable to resist he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster then pauses to steal a look off screen

               book

               his eyes are open and watching samuel icily which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt

                                     book
                         give me that

               mutely samuel hands book the pistol from arms length he 
               looks on as book takes the pistol out of the holster shoots 
               the boy another look then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy copperjacketed bullets into his palm he 
               snaps the cylinder closed again then nods to samuel

                                     book
                         come here

               the boy edges closer

                                     book
                         you ever handle a pistol like this 
                         samuel

                                     samuel
                              swallows
                         no pistol ever

                                     book
                         tell you what – im going to let you 
                         handle this one but only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma ive got a feeling she wouldnt 
                         understand

                                     samuel
                              grins
                         okay mr book

               book smiles then he gives the boy a playful john wayne
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol 
               demonstrating the action

               he finally hands it over to samuel butt first

                                     book
                         call me john

               the boy tries to imitate books onehanded expertise but 
               his hands are too small book smiles

               samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked using two 
               hands and book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that its not pointed at him

                                     book
                         you dont want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name

               samuel levels the pistol at the door and just as he snaps 
               the trigger rachel enters pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her samuel blanches and 
               book winces knowing theres heavy weather ahead

                                     rachel
                              snaps
                         samuel

               samuel quickly hands the pistol back to book who holsters 
               it

                                     rachel
                         wait for me downstairs

               samuel quickly exits and rachel angrily advances on book

                                     rachel
                         john book i would appreciate it if 
                         during the time you are with us you 
                         would have as little to do with samuel 
                         as possible

                                     book
                         nobody meant any harm the boy was 
                         curious i unloaded the gun 

                                     rachel
                         its not the gun dont you 
                         understand its you what you 
                         stand for
                              and
                         that is not for samuel

               book looks at her thoughtfully

               rachel softens a bit

                                     rachel
                         please it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally

               he hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets

                                     book
                         put it up someplace samuel cant get 
                         it

               a beat then rachel takes the pistol and starts to go book 
               stops her

                         friends

               rachel glances back at him smiles and nods and

                                                                    cut to

                         you kill another man eh

               samuel stares at it not meeting his grandfathers eyes eli 
               leans forward extends his hands ceremonially

                         take into your heart

               a beat then samuel musters some defiance

                                     samuel
                         i would only kill a bad man

               now he meets elis eyes

                                     samuel
                         i have seen it

               eli expels a deep sigh then

                                     eli
                         and having seen you would become

               he breaks off bows his head for a moment then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity

                                     hochstetler
                         i came to see rachel lapp

                                     book
                         try the house

               hochstetler gives book a powerful clap on the shoulder

                                     hochstetler
                              genially
                         you bet you take care of yourself

               hochstetler heads for the house book stares after him with 
               some interest

               angle

               as rachel emerges from the house to greet him she also 
               catches sight of book and she pauses a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant

               and hochstetler doesnt miss it either

               then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome

               hog pens

               book having gathered up the pieces of the bird house is 
               headed toward the outbuildings passing by hog pens he 
               glances toward the house

               his pov – the back porch

               where rachel and hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade

               back to book

               thoughtful he glances at the hog pen as a huge sow squeals 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed

               buggy

               it fills the barn but book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and eyeing rachel starts moving with the beat its 
               his culture coming through loud and clear as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough philly cop decked out in

               as he goes into the barn

               book approaches lukes stall warily and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule reacting to form starts to skitter his 
               hooves cracking against the walls of the stall book flinches

               book starts to talk gently to the animal

                                     book
                         all right you nasty son of a bitch 
                         were going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not

               then summoning his resolve he carefully opens the stall 
               gate

               angle

               as luke eyes him balefully book reaches into his pocket 
               brings out some lumps of sugar

                                     book
                         see sugar you like sugar dont 
                         you for christs sake

               finally keeping a mistrustful eye on book luke condescends 
               to eat book nods with satisfaction

               arriving at the zook farm for a barnraising

               in the bg we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation

               elsewhere long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men

               more workmen and their families climb out

               eli appears with hochstetler in tow hochstetlers broad

               he pumps books hand with his usual vigor smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to rachel she looks on amused

               hochstetler gives rachel a look and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate book was no happenstance

               and book realizes it as well

                                     hochstetler
                         eli says youre a carpenter book

               on big sawhorses theres an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men which doesnt go entirely 
               unnoticed by the halfdozen or so other young men on the 
               gang

               or indeed by rachel in fact she seems – without leaning 
               on it too heavily – to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them

               eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of handdrawn sketches under their arms supervising

               the very elderly sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs

               them together prior to nailing them to the roofbeam they 
               are therefore crotch to the mast and facing one another 
               way out at the far end of the roof

               suddenly as hochstetler raises his hammer the studs start 
               to part threatening to deball the both of them

               hochstetler drops his hammer grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength and literally pulls it 
               back together

               book stares at hochstetler with nothing short of awe

               hochstetler straining and grinning looks to book

               and he does nail it while hochstetler grinning and holding 
               looks on

               determined it wont happen determined that he wont fall 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help hochstetler

               about him says nothing doesnt even look at book from 
               below someone tells them to hurry up

               gives his horse a couple of whoops the buggies are neck and 
               neck and the older people are not protesting loudly

               its all book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               rachel but shes something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of hochstetler to the cheers

               comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn looking toward 
               the sound of the bell but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure rachel and eli stay where they are 
               he still cant see samuel

               schaeffer quickly crosses to him grabs him by the back of 
               the neck tries to pull him off the bell rope samuel hangs 
               on grimly

               schaeffer yanks hard succeeds in yanking samuel free shoves 
               him roughly aside then schaeffer turns fires a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope it still hangs by several 
               threads so he fires again

               the rope drops to the ground schaeffer reloads turns to 
               look at samuel just getting to his feet a moment when 
               schaeffer recognizing samuel as the amish kid who saw mcelroy 
               kill zenovich perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there

               the coffee jar she drops several as she tries to figure out

               bullets are already clattering to the floor from her trembling

               mcelroy swats at him with the gun butt moves to the door 
               as he arrives he hears a noise – very slight – from the

               stall and there is fergie with luke the mule on top of 
               him schaeffer stares blinks moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork

               the amish beginning to arrive sam comes running pulls

               look at the shotshattered bellrope rachel and eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group

               side as best he can hangs there listening

               mcelroy

               rattling up the other ladder approaching the third kickboard

               book

               listening tensely hearing mcelroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard then deliberately book makes a fist 
               raps on the board smartly once

               mcelroy

               startled reacting he sets his feet leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well brings the shotgun up puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard clicks off the safety

               book

               we hear with him the thump of the muzzle the click and 
               with marvelous speed book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor

               mcelroy – flash cut staring in stuneyed already falling 
               forward having leaned his weight on the shotgun as book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel pulls inward

               another angle

               as mcelroy pitches forward through the opening screams and 
               grabs as he plunges past book the shotgun fires as mcelroy 
               manages to hold onto book and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo

               book

               he falls almost straight down lands on his back lies 
               stunned

               mcelroy

               his forward motion has carried him across the silo his head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up and he 
               falls in a heap blood gushing from his head as

               tight on book

               blinking groaning just beginning to stir and suddenly 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it the muzzle 
               is placed firmly against books temple

               wider

               schaeffer holding the pistol he cocks the pistol tenses as 
               if to fire and he is actually about to when there is a 
               sound behind him he snaps around

               what he sees

               old stoltzfus and samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo they stand solemnly looking on 
               as

               schaeffer

               he eases the hammer down on this pistol speaks softly

                                     schaeffer
                         okay johnny on your feet

               the scene

               as book struggles to his feet – schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to books head book turns sees samuel and stoltzfus 
               blinks

               schaeffer shoves book toward the opening as book moves toward 
               samuel he speaks quietly

                                     book
                         its okay sam

               another angle

               as book and mcelroy move out of the silo down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse stoltzfus and sam after a glance in 
               at the inert mcelroy follow and

               ext barn – day

               as first stoltzfus and samuel then book and schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against books throat just below his jaw

               schaeffer pulls up frowning

                                     schaeffer
                         hold it

               what he sees

               the amishmen gathered – the stoltzfus family the hochstetler 
               brothers et al all staring hard at schaeffer and book

               ext barn  drive – day

               from a high wide angle the final scene is played out 
               schaeffer and book now moving again slowly up the drive 
               the amish following along closely on both sides

               close on book

               as schaeffer prods book forward warily eyeing the amish

                                     schaeffer
                         get back you people
                              prodding
                         keep moving johnny

               book takes a couple of steps further then abruptly stops 
               the amish stand about close staring no one moving book 
               now slowly turns his head looks at schaeffer

                                     book

               eli steps forward bloody cloth held to his head

                                     eli
                         so will you kill us all then

               angle

               as schaeffers eyes waver between book and eli book slowly 
               turns until he is facing schaeffer the gun now leveled – 
               and almost pressing against – books chest book locks eyes 
               with schaeffer

               quietly

                                     book

               books right hand snakes out grabs schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist twists viciously schaeffer screams in pain the gun 
               falls out of his hand he starts to his knees under the force 
               of books grip

               another angle

               as book bends picks up the pistol releases schaeffer pushes 
               him away schaeffer staggers against hochstetler who – partly 
               to keep him from falling and partly it appears to 
               congratulate him on his surrender – wraps one brawny arm 
               around schaeffers shoulders gives him a short approving 
               nod holds schaeffer as

               book

               turning looking into the crowd finding rachel their gazes 
               meet hold for a long moment in the eyes of both we read 
               resignation whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged it is almost certainly over for them too

               ext barn – day

               high shot holding the moment

               ext lapp farm – late afternoon

               the door opens and book steps out looking somehow strange
