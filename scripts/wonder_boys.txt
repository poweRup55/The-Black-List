               all is a blur

               then words appear twisting and vaguely transparent 
               reflected on the window grady tripp stands before as he reads 
               from a sheaf of neatlytyped pages

                                     grady
                         the young girl sat perfectly still 
                         in the confessional

               int classroom  university  afternoon

               grady  45yearold novelist professor and insomniac  
               is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
               students who make up his advanced writing workshop

                                     grady
                         listening to her fathers boots 
                         scrape like chalk on the ancient 
                         steps of the church then grow faint 
                         then disappear altogether

               as he finishes grady ponders a pair of maintenance men 
               perched on ladders in the quad below stringing a large banner 
               between two bare trees the banner reads

                                   welcome to wordfest

               grady turns peers at his students they look as if theyve 
               been on a field trip to the dmv

                                     grady
                              a wave of the pages
                         so anyone

               a girl with jetblack hair turns to a pale young man sitting 
               at a desk in the back of the classroom he is james leer 
               19 like grady a moment before he is staring out the window

                         let me get this straight the girl 
                         with the big lips is depressed 
                         because each night when her father 
                         goes off to work at the bakery her 
                         mother sneaks some mysterious lover 
                         into the house not only does this 
                         girl have to listen to her mother 
                         working this guy in the next room 
                         she has to wash the sheets each 
                         morning before daddy gets home after 
                         a few weeks of this she starts to 
                         go a little nutty so daddy takes her 
                         to confession  only once she gets 
                         in the box she gets a whiff of the 
                         priest and realizes hes the mothers 
                         secret lover is that it

               james leer says nothing huddling lower in the patty overcoat 
               he wears

                                     carrie mcwhirty
                         i mean jesus what is it with you 
                         catholics

                                     grady
                         all right lets try to keep it 
                         constructive shall we howard what 
                         about you

                                     howard
                         i hated it

                                     grady
                         thats not exactly what i meant by 
                         constructive howard

                                     howard
                         i think james should try to be more 
                         constructive this is my second 
                         semester with him his stories are 
                         brutal man they make me want to 
                         kill myself

               grady glances at james but his face remains impassive

               then  with a visible sense of relief  grady notices the 
               raised hand of the achingly beautiful hannah green

                                     grady
                         yes hannah

                                     hannah green
                         i think maybe were missing the point 
                         it seems to me james strength as a 
                         writer is that he doesnt take us by 
                         the hand he treats us like adults 
                         he respects us enough to forget us 
                         that takes courage

               grady nods smiles subtly appreciative

                                     grady
                         well put hannah and a good note to 
                         end on i think
                              as the students rise
                         dont forget about wordfest this 
                         weekend and remember those of you

                         chancellors house no later than 
                         530

               hannah green gathers her things pauses by grady

                                     grady
                         thanks for that he all right

                                     hannah green
                         i think so what about you

                                     grady
                         me sure why

                                     hannah green
                         just checking

               grady watches her glide away in her cracked red cowboy boots 
               then starts to exit himself

                                     james leer
                         turn out the light please

               grady pauses studying the wan figure sitting at the back of 
               the classroom then  reluctantly  hits the switch on the 
               wail leaving james leer alone in the dark

               int stairwellcorridor  afternoon moments later

               grady hurries down the steps then spies sara gasksll 45 
               standing below she is talking to a boy with an armful of 
               slick programs

                                     sara
                              calm but firm
                         no elliot i said five hundred 
                         programs for today this means we 
                         have no programs for the weekend 
                         this means that tomorrow morning at 
                         9am several hundred people will 
                         walk into thaw hall and have 
                         absolutely no idea where they are 
                         going
                              shaking her head
                         its all right elliot ill take 
                         care of it

               grady watches sara take the programs turn and spot him

               there is the slightest of hesitations then

                                     sara
                         professor tripp

                                     grady
                         chancellor

                                     sara

                                     grady
                         i got the message you called too

               this hangs in the air awkward somehow then both nod and 
               continue on without so much as a backward glance

               int gradys car  moving

               the radio blasts as grady pops the glove box removes a joint 
               as big as his pinky and wheels his dark maroon 66 galaxie 
               ragtop away from campus cruising under another banner

               ext galaxie  moving  pittsburgh

               grady cruises past the three rivers and modest skyscrapers 
               of downtown sipping at the weed

               int pittsburgh airport

               grady rides the long automated treadmill that runs half the 
               length of the terminal until

               int arrival gate  pittsburgh airport

               terry crabtree  gradys editor and friend  exits the 
               tunnel with a stunning young woman in a skintight black 
               dress bright red topcoat and threeinch spike heels

               grinning devilishly crabtree whispers something in the 
               womans ear then spots grady

                                     crabtree
                         tripp

                                     grady

                                     crabtree

                         to tonights festivities you dont

                                     grady
                              a slight beat
                         the more the merrier

                                     miss sloviak
                         terry was telling me about you on 
                         the plane it was all so interesting

                                     crabtree
                         i was explaining to antonia how a 
                         book comes to be published what you 
                         do as a writer what i do as an

                                     grady

                         checks for spelling

                                     miss sloviak
                              indicating crabtree
                         thats exactly what he said

                                     crabtree
                         we know each other pretty well

                                     crabtree
                         perfect well then shall we

               grady nods but lingers briefly  studying the architecture 
               of miss sloviaks ankles as she clicks off in her spike heels 
               arm in arm with crabtree

               int baggage carousel  airport  moments later

               grady and crabtree watch suitcases tumble as miss sloviak 
               sits across the way inspecting her face in a compact

                                     crabtree
                         do you know how many times ive 
                         boarded an airplane praying someone 
                         like her would sit down beside me 
                         particularly while im on my way to 
                         pittsburgh

                                     grady

                         great cities

                                     crabtree
                         if it can produce a miss sloviak 
                         youll get no argument from me

                                     crabtree

               crabtree ignores gradys question smiling placidly as he 
               watches the carousel spin

                                     crabtree
                         so hows the book

               grady stiffens he had been expecting this but not so soon 
               he tries to act casual

                                     grady

                         fascinating things about marilyn 
                         monroe and who was it

                                     walter gaskell
                         joe dimaggio simply put antonia 
                         its my contention that their marriage 
                         tapped into the very id of american 
                         popular culture joe dimaggio 
                         represented metaphorically speaking 
                         the husband as slugger and though 
                         it may be controversial i personally 
                         believe every woman in some way 
                         desires to be marilyn monroe

               changes course directly ahead is an oddly commanding man 
               q from the behavior of the people in his vicinity its 
               clear he is someone of interest presently he is putting 
               the make on hannah green

                         40 weeks i cant help but lament 
                         that my first book which contains 
                         what i consider my finest writing 
                         was remaindered in less than five 
                         so i find myself conflicted

                                     grady
                         ask him if hes conflicted about his 
                         house in the hamptons

                                     hannah green

               as grady moves off he sees poe sniffing and goes the other 
               way heading directly into the crosshairs of a man in tweed 
               who is talking to another shorter man

               as grady flees he passes a woman holding a cigarette

                                     woman with cigarette
                         can take my word for it writers 
                         are lousy fucks poets arent bad

               ext rear gaskell house  night

               grady comes out the back door and ferrets a joint from his 
               pocket lights it he takes a long draw walks around the 
               side of the house as he passes a window a voice accosts 
               him

                                     mans voice
                         there you are

               grady starts but when he looks through the window he sees 
               that the voice belongs to walter gaskell and the person to 
               whom hes talking is sara they are standing in the kitchen 
               near an elaborate wine rack

                                     walter
                         i could swear i had a 63 chateau

                         latour if i was sitting on it

                                     walter
                         youd recognize it if you tasted it

                                     sara
                         i doubt it darling

                                     walter
                              angling  bottle to 
                              the light
                         well q certainly will and given 
                         that he will be addressing 500 people 
                         in little over an hour

                                     sara
                         you want to keep him happy

                                     walter
                         if hes happy
                              kissing her as he 
                              exits
                         im happy

               as walter goes grady studies sara as she stands alone in 
               the quiet little room looking small and tired finally she 
               takes a breath steeling herself and moves off returning 
               to the clamor inside her house

               grady sighs guiltstricken then detects a flicker of light 
               coming from the darkness beyond a figure is watching him 
               from the retaining wail that leads to the gaskells garage 
               grady blinks chagrined that hes been caught eavesdropping 
               then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch

                                     grady
                         james

               james leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class a green 
               knapsack hanging off one shoulder grady looks at what appears 
               to be a sliver of moonlight in james palm

                                     james leer
                         its fake

               james face betrays his own fragile chagrin and grady peers 
               more closely at what lies in his extended hand the sliver 
               of moonlight is in fact a shiny pearlhandled pistol

                                     james leer
                         it was my mothers she won it in a 
                         penny arcade in baltimore when she 
                         was in catholic school

                                     grady
                         its very convincing

                                     james leer
                         it used to shoot these little paper 
                         caps but they dont make them 
                         anymore the caps

               grady reaches for the gun but james closes his fingers and 
               slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat

                                     james leer
                         its just for good luck some 
                         people carry rabbits feet

                                     grady
                         you carry firearms

               as grady exhales a plume of smoke james eyes pass briefly 
               over the jay grady notices offers

                                     james leer
                         no thank you i dont like to lose 
                         control of my emotions

               grady nods accustomed to james weirdness

                                     james leer
                         im not supposed to be here in case 
                         you were wondering i crashed i 
                         mean not intentionally

               james nods toward the house where hannah green can be seen 
               in a window still fending off the determined q

                                     james leer
                         but the other night hannah and i 
                         were together at the movies and 
                         she asked me since she was coming 
                         so i ended up coming too

               grady nods ponders this overelaborate explanation

                                     grady
                         are you and hannah seeing each other 
                         james

                                     james leer
                         no what gave you that idea

                                     grady
                         relax james im not her father i 
                         just rent her a room

                                     james leer
                         she likes old movies like i do thats 
                         all
                              glancing back at the 
                              window
                         besides she doesnt really know me 
                         she thinks she does but she doesnt 
                         maybe its because shes mormon and 
                         im catholic

                                     grady
                         maybe its because shes beautiful 
                         and she knows it and try as she might 
                         to not let that screw her up its 
                         inevitable that it will in some way

               james looks away from the window at grady

                                     james leer
                         youre not like my other teachers 
                         professor tripp

                                     grady

                         james so what was the movie you two

                         power and frances farmer

                                     grady
                         she went crazy frances farmer

                                     james leer

                         sounds like a good one

                                     james leer
                              a crooked smile
                         its not bad

               grady considers james fragile face

                                     grady
                         listen james about this afternoon

                                     james leer
                         they really hated it i think they 
                         hated it more than any of the other 
                         ones

                                     grady
                         well

                                     james leer

                         an hour to write

                                     grady
                              truly impressed

                                     james leer

                         lying in bed i figure them out the 
                         stories

               as james gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse grady looks 
               down at the left front pocket of james overcoat

               like a nervous tic james hand  hidden  twitches against 
               the modest bulk of the cap gun

                                     grady
                         you cold james

                                     james leer
                              distant
                         a little

                                     grady
                         so what are you doing out here

                                     james leer

                                     grady
                              laughing
                         youre right

               james blinks startled by gradys laughter startled that 
               hes said something funny he looks back to the greenhouse

                                     james leer
                         actually i saw the greenhouse so i 
                         thought i thought id come out 
                         here and take a look at it you dont 
                         see one of those every day it looks 
                         like heaven

                                     grady
                         heaven

                                     james leer

                         place in heaven everyone wore white

                         that at least thats the way i 
                         remember it

               abruptly james glances at his watch

                                     james leer
                         i should be going

               james turns away then stops he stands like this a moment 
               then turns back holds out his right hand

                                     james leer
                         goodbye professor tripp

               grady hesitates then shakes james hand james moves off 
               then leaving the light of the house behind

                                     grady
                         james
                              as he stops

                         something i think you ought to see

                                     grady
                         this is worth it

               james looks conflicted

                                     grady
                         trust me

               int living room  moments later

               its quieter now the party winding down as grady sneaks 
               james past the departing guests and toward the stairs

                                     hannah green
                         hey you two

               grady stops sees hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer

                                     hannah green

                                     grady

                         here we are

               crabtree appears at the top of the landing with miss sloviak 
               her lipstick is blurry

                                     crabtree
                              spying james
                         nell hello there

               crabtree steps down the stairs hand extended james leers 
               pale fingers rise as if on a string

                                     grady

               the few people within earshot glance oddly at james but 
               crabtrees eyes glitter with intrigue

                                     crabtree

               james glances at the loose group of people around him 
               watching then

                                     james leer

                         you did them alphabetically

               james turns finds crabtrees laser eyes on him james blinks 
               as if he had forgotten about crabtree then shrugs shyly 
               looks away

                                     james leer
                         thats just how my brain works i 
                         guess

                                     crabtree
                         fascinating listen why dont you 
                         come out with us after the lecture 
                         theres a place on the hill i always 
                         get trip to take me

                                     james leer
                         actually i just want to go home

                                     crabtree
                         oh dont be silly no one your age 
                         just wants to go home besides 
                         faculty will be present just think 
                         of it as a field trip

               as he exits crabtree raises an eyebrow to grady as if to 
               say bring him miss sloviak follows eyeing james glacially 
               as we cut to

               black

               the dull purr of a combination lock is heard a door opens 
               and a triangle of light falls on a photograph of marilyn 
               monroes joe dimaggio on their wedding day

               int closet  gaskell house

               grady and james leer stand in the doorway just below the 
               photograph of marilyn and joe  hanging next to a pinstriped 
               jersey bearing the number 5  is a short black satin jacket 
               trimmed with an ermine collar

                                     james leer
                         is that really it

                                     grady
                         thats really it

                                     james leer
                         the one she wore on her wedding day

                                     grady
                         so im told

               james in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments 
               stands speechless

                                     grady
                         go ahead

                                     james leer
                         really

                                     grady
                         really

               james swallows then goes to the jacket carefully he reaches 
               out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar barely making 
               contact as though it might crumble to dust

                                     james leer
                         theyre glass the buttons

                                     grady
                         like the lady herself

               grady says this airily ironically riding his buzz a bit 
               but james nods solemnly eyes transfixed on the jacket as 
               if marilyn herself were inside it

                                     james leer
                         she was small most people dont 
                         know that the shoulders are small
                              touching the satin
                         it looks so perfect i bet its the 
                         only time she wore it that day she 
                         mustve felt so happy

               grady studies james as he takes the fringe of the jacket 
               lifts it lightly

                                     james leer
                         its feels unreal like butterfly 
                         wings or something it mustve 
                         cost dr gaskell a lot

                                     grady
                         i guess walter never tells sara the 
                         truth about how much he pays for 
                         these things

                                     james leer
                         youre really good friends with the 
                         chancellor arent you

               gradys eyes slide paranoid but james face remains 
               unchanged consumed with the jacket

                                     grady
                              carefully
                         pretty good im friends with dr 
                         gaskell too

                                     james leer
                         i guess you must be if you know the 
                         combination to his closet and he 
                         doesnt mind your being here in their 
                         bedroom like this

                                     grady
                         right

               a door slams downstairs and grady and james jump the click 
               of a womans high heels sends grady to the bedroom window 
               where he watches sara slide into a white citroen ds23 turn 
               on the ignition and motor away

                                     grady
                         we better skedaddle close that 
                         closet  james you all right

               james is slumped on the gaskells white linen bed knapsack 
               between his knees head in hands

                                     james leer
                         im sorry professor tripp maybe 
                         its seeing that jacket that belonged 
                         to her it just looks really 
                         lonely hanging there in a closet 
                         maybe im just a little sad

                                     grady
                         maybe im feeling a little sad myself 
                         tonight

                                     james leer
                         you mean with your wife leaving you 
                         and all
                              off gradys look
                         hannah mentioned something about it   
                         about a note

                                     grady
                         yes well its complicated james 
                         i think we should go now

               without thinking grady flicks out the bedroom light leaving 
               james leer in the dark for the second time today

               james just sits there a shadow in a room of shadows

               int hallway

               a low rumble freezes grady as he enters the hail a few feet 
               away poe lies belly to the ground his blind blue eyes 
               trained more or less in gradys direction

                                     grady
                         okay easy now eeezy

               grady starts to take a step when poe shoots forward and 
               sinks himself deep into gradys ankle

                                     grady
                         jesus

               grady hops gracelessly momentarily lifting poe off the ground 
               as he swings his leg up poe countering rolls his head in 
               a snapping motion and drops grady in a clumsy heap

                                     grady
                         get off of me you sonofabitch

               poe regains his feet but doesnt let go whipping his head 
               back and forth back and forth over and over growling low 
               dark and hideously from the back of his throat until there 
               is a sharp

               crack crack

               poe yelps goes perfectly still then topples heavily onto 
               gradys legs grady turns james leer stands in the doorway 
               posed with the little pearlhandled pistol like steve mcqueen

               grady looks at james then poe then back to james

                                     grady

                         out on me

               grady roils down his sock apparently poe went through life 
               with a slight overbite

                                     james leer
                         do you have a mirror its the best 
                         way to see if someones breathing

               grady rises awkwardly holds out his hand

               grady and james stare gloomily out the windshield

                                     james leer

               james glances in the backseat where poe lies strange blue 
               eyes gleaming

                                     grady

               ext parking lot  thaw hall campus

               as sporadic applause wafts from the high windowpanes of thaw 
               hall grady leans into the galaxies trunk creates a space 
               between the tuba and a zippered suitcase

                                     grady
                         okay

               james totters forward arms hooked under poes front legs 
               looking like a sorry marathon dancer grady frowns limps 
               forward and takes the hind legs

                                     james leer
                         hes still a little warm

               they lay him down push him deep into the trunk  until 
               there is a sound like a pencil snapping

                                     james leer
                         yuck

               grady grabs crabtrees garment bag frisks the pockets

                         a suitcase a dead dog and a garment 
                         bag almost perfectly

                                     grady
                              searching
                         thats just what they used to say in 
                         the ads come on crabtree i know

                                     grady
                         miss sloviaks

                                     james leer

                                     grady

               grady unravels a pair of boxer shorts finds an airplane 
               size bottle of jack daniels then grabs another pair of 
               boxers

                                     james leer
                         oh so is  is your friend crabtree

                                     grady
                         most of the time he is james some 
                         of the time he isnt now what do we 
                         have here

               grady rattles a prescription bottle then shakes out a pair 
               of white pills each etched with a tiny numeral 3

                                     grady
                         looks like our old friend mr 
                         codeine that should take the pinch 
                         out of my ankle
                              handing the bottle 
                              to james

                                     james leer

                                     grady
                         right thats why you were standing 
                         in the chancellors back yard twirling 
                         that little cap gun of yours tonight  
                         youre fine all right youre fit 
                         as a fucking fiddle

               grady opens the tiny bottle of jack with his teeth drinks 
               down two number 3s then looks at james

                                     grady
                         im sorry james im sorry i said 
                         that

               recklessly james takes a pill tosses it in his mouth and 
               tips back the tiny bottle of jack half a second later he 
               spits it all out grady looks down peels the soggy pill 
               from the lapel of his jacket

                                     grady
                         how bout we try that again

               int auditorium  later

               on the stage walter gaskell stands alone at a podium

                                     walter
                         really needs no introduction 
                         walk down the aisle of any airplane 
                         or by the pool of any hotel and youll 
                         see his face beaming back at you 
                         you all know the name you all know 
                         the books so welcome if you will 
                         the man those of us who know him 
                         simply call q

               as the audience thunders grady and james slink into the 
               auditorium its standing room only as they head for an 
               open space against the back wail grady squeezes past a kid 
               with a goatee who regards him warily

                                     q
                         good evening

               grady stares over the gleaming sea of heads before him 
               watching as q pauses for a very long moment waiting 
               until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy anticipatory 
               hush finally he speaks again

                                     q
                         i am a writer

               as the audience explodes with glee grady frowns he glances 
               to his right sees james left brow crinkled with a similar 
               look of bafflement

                                     q
                         as a writer one thing you learn is 
                         that everyone you encounter has a 
                         story every bartender every taxi 
                         driver everybody has an idea or a 
                         story that would make a great book 
                         or a great movie presumably each 
                         of you has an idea
                              gestures to the 
                              audience
                         but how do you go from there to 
                         here how do you go from having an 
                         idea to having a book how do you 
                         get across what is the bridge the 
                         bridge that allows you to walk on 
                         air from the shoreline of inspiration 
                         to the terra firma of accomplishment 
                         faith faith that your story is worth 
                         the telling faith that you have the 
                         wherewithal to tell it faith that 
                         the carefully woven structure you 
                         create wont collapse beneath you

               grady glances at james sees that his eyes are unblinking 
               and glazed then sees beyond him sara standing by the far 
               exit a blink later she is gone

                                     q
                         and faith that when you get to 
                         the other side someone will be waiting 
                         who gives a damn about the tale you 
                         have to tell

               grady leans back listening to the beating of his own heart 
               the soft glimmer of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty 
               feet above his head

               abruptly james laughs out loud  some private amusement 
               bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
               auditorium as q looks and four hundred other heads turn 
               james ducks down  mortified crabtree sitting a few rows 
               away studies james with amusement then winks at grady

               grady blinks turns to james

                                     grady
                         ill be right back

               int lobby

               grady bursts through the auditorium doors and into the lobby 
               a pair of local booksellers chatting quietly behind a table 
               arrayed with the books of attending authors glance up as 
               grady limps toward the restrooms

               int corridor

               grady stumbles down the sloping carper but the corridor 
               begins to turn sideways on him and he stops resting his 
               cheek against the cool cool wall as all goes

               black for a moment and then

                                     saras voice
                         grady grady

               grady opens his eyes finds saras face swimming above him 
               he is lying on his back in the corridor his corduroy blazer 
               bundled under his head like a pillow

                                     sara

                                     sara
                         almost want to sit up

                                     grady

               grady looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt

                                     grady
                         i have to tell you something 
                         something hard

               saras face stiffens becomes more chancelloresque

                         this rolling around on the floor

               glistening mormon skin  merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
               shrug and she points

                                     grady
                         come on crabs dont do this hes 
                         one of my students for christ sake

                         i think its more complicated than 
                         that besides hes a little 
                         scattered he almost did something 
                         stupid tonight at least i think 
                         so anyway he doesnt need sexual 
                         confusion thrown into the stew right 
                         now

                         on the contrary it could be just 
                         the ticket

               grady notices the waitresss nametag oola and realizes she 
               is conspicuously pregnant he watches her disappear beyond 
               the blur of bodies on the dance floor where hannah greens 
               slinky form seizes his attention

                              stumped
                         because because

                         his favorite horse he took the bullet 
                         himself

               grady and crabtree turn to look at james leer who opens one 
               bloodshot eye to regard them

                                     james leer
                         vernon over there was in on the

               james eye closes crabtree looks over at grady

                                     crabtree
                         that was good

                                     grady
                         he heard everything we were saying

               just then hannah green bounces up in her red boots

                                     hannah green
                         come on teach i want you to dance 
                         with me

               int dance floor  moments later

               grady and hannah reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 
               o lantern wall of mirrored tile slowdance to a sexy 
               measured blues

                                     hannah green

                         the downy innocents we can get

               grady spies the corner table watches crabtree say something 
               to q and then casually stroke a lock of hair from james 
               leers forehead

                                     hannah green
                         so what are you going to do

                                     grady

                         going to be there when you get home

               grady looks down into hannahs translucent face then catches 
               a glimpse of himself in the fractured wall the tile that 
               would reflect his head is missing

                                     grady
                         are you holding me up or am i dragging 
                         you down

               hannah snuggles closer lays her head on gradys chest

                                     hannah green
                         shush

               grady limping on his bad ankle carries james to hannahs 
               rumpled renault props him against the fender

                                     grady
                         look hannah when you get him home 
                         make sure hes all right before you 
                         leave okay

                         know where james leer lives

                                     hannah green

                         that strikes me as odd

                                     hannah green
                         james is odd i know he has an aunt

                         there or something i dont remember

               james mumbles starts to slide onto the hood of the car

                                     james leer

               grady glances at the idling galaxie across the street

               crabtree and q huddle inside

               grady frowns in annoyance opens the passenger door

                                     grady
                         all right take him to my place he

                                     grady
                         i dont think it really matters 
                         hannah we could probably stand him 
                         up in the garage with the snow shovels 
                         at this point

               as grady lowers james into the seat he whimpers curls into 
               a ball hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on grady

                                     grady
                         ail right in my office

               as grady starts to turn away hannahs fingers graze his 
               face

                                     hannah green
                         hey if you want to talk later

               grady watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive 
               away he sighs crosses to the galaxie and just has his 
               hand on the doorhandle when a tiny figure appears

               beams of light

                                     grady
                         whats this guys problem

                                     crabtree
                         just go around him

               grady taps the accelerator but each time vernon dances 
               back in front of gradys grille

                                     grady
                         shit

                                     crabtree
                         back up go out the other way

               grady throws the car in reverse backs straight up then 
               turns up a oneway street he shoots down the alley behind 
               the hihat turns onto the adjoining street and watches 
               in amazement as vernon materializes from behind the high 
               wooden fence that runs parallel to the galaxie

               as grady punches the brakes vernon grins

                                     grady
                         now what

                              mischievously
                         you could always go over him

               then as the three men watch vernon rocks back on his heels 
               and  with a gymnasts precision  pitches himself onto 
               the galaxies big hood he lands on his ass slides smoothly 
               off then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night

                                     q
                         what just happened

               grady peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood

                                     grady

               the knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs

               grady lifts the knapsack peers inside there is no title 
               page to the manuscript just the words the love parade and 
               then halfway down text

               grady steps outside closes the flap of the knapsack and 
               hunching his shoulders against the cold stops

               hondas best suited for sidewalk driving the backseat bulges 
               with a huge amplifier and bass guitar

                                     traxler

               seat between him and sam a book  bearing errol flynns 
               picture  is tucked into the side pouch

                         no my wifes out of town

               just then the honda fills with light headlights loom then 
               a police car sweeps into the gaskells driveway

               walter appears on the front steps

                                     traxler

               as traxler drives away grady mounts the porch with james 
               leers knapsack hanging from one shoulder he reaches above 
               the door feeling for a key but his fingers come away with 
               only dust he stands dispirited then an idea strikes he 
               takes the doorknob turns it it opens

               int hallway  gradys house

               grady enters closes the door quietly behind him

               int living room

               the room is dim but the tv is on throwing crazy slashes of 
               light onto the wails and ceiling as grady limps by he finds 
               a sleeping hannah green bundled in a blanket tshirt and 
               little else on the floor near her dangling hand woolfs a 
               common reader lays open next to a diet coke

               grady considers the smooth geography of her body but his 
               eyes are most powerfully drawn to her feet he steps 
               forward lifts the blanket gently but finds  to his 
               disappointment  only the red cowboy boots

               he picks up the remote turns off the tv and exits

               int gradys office

               james leer slumbers on a green sofa draped in an old sleeping 
               bag grady drops behind his desk lets james knapsack slide 
               to the floor he lifts his cuff inspects his ugly ankle 
               then glimpses something in the knapsack

               something yellow something soft

               grady reaches down and slowly  like a magician producing 
               a magical scarfextracts marilyn monroes wedding jacket 
               from james leers ratty green knapsack

               grady glances at the young man on his sofa then looking 
               very tired reaches for the desk lamp and turns out the 
               light on the both of them

               ext front porch  saturday morning next day

               grady steps outside in a womans chenille bathrobe and plucks 
               the pittsburgh postgazette from the second porch step he 
               fishes out a charred roach starts to light it then notices 
               the galaxie sitting in the driveway

               int guest bedroom  minutes later

               as crabtree snores thunderously grady eases open the door

               grady pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers 
               lets it glide open the room that is revealed is bright and 
               wellordered in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
               gradys office there is a drafting table and a computer 
               pads and pens neatly arranged alongside

               a bulletin board hangs on one wall bearing an intricate 
               mosaic of multicolored index cards there are prints framed 
               from various art exhibits and two of gradys dust jackets  
               including most prominently arsonists daughter

               with friends in a sundress with grady in a billowing

                         youre welcome

               grady sits at his desk pours himself a cup of coffee from 
               the thermos then sets the cup directly in the center of a 
               galaxy of previous coffee rings next he takes a clean piece 
               of paper balls it up and  with ritual precision  strokes 
               it into the miniature basketball hoop that crowns the rim of 
               the waste basket across the room

               all net

               a 9volt crowd roar belches from the hoop and without further

               grady peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of 
               the robe its overall fuzziness

                                     grady

               james nods down the hallway in another room the telephone 
               rings

               as james shuffles away in the sleeping bag grady rises 
               delicately and turns toward the window just in time to see 
               a police car roll slowly by on the screen below

                                     james leer
                         i thought maybe youd won a radio 
                         contest or something is that single
                         spaced

               james has noticed the towering stack of 20 lb bond on gradys 
               desk

                                     grady
                         afraid so

                                     james leer
                         thats a big book youre writing

                                     grady
                         i think its sort of writing itself 
                         at this point

                                     james leer
                         wow hannah always swore you were 
                         working but 

                                     grady
                         but 

                                     james leer
                         nothing its just that well its 
                         been awhile since arsonists daughter 
                         and some people  some of the kids 
                         in workshop  thought maybe you 
                         were

                                     grady
                         washed up

                                     james leer
                         blocked

                                     grady
                         ah i dont believe in writers block

               james takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript

                                     james leer
                         no kidding

               a loud hacking is heard grady and james turn watch crabtree 
               wearing only a pair of striped boxers materialize in the 
               hallway

                                     crabtree
                         good morning boys james

               james waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag

                                     grady
                              re james attire

                         breakfast id put on something a 
                         little less comfortable if i were 
                         you

               as grady moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
               page curling from the typewriter james continues to stare 
               into the emptiness of the hallway the sight of crabtree 
               seems to have made him suddenly queasy

                                     james leer
                         professor tripp

                                     grady

                                     grady
                         no one seems to know where you live 
                         james hannah thought youd like my 
                         couch

                                     james leer

                         anything anything bad

                                     grady

                         of the english departments dog and 
                         steal his most prized piece of 
                         memorabilia

               as james contemplates this the doorbell rings grady looks 
               up sees the police car he noticed earlier now parked at 
               the bottom of his driveway

                                     grady

               ext front porch

               a policeman not much older than james leer waits as the 
               door opens grady appears

                                     officer pupcik

               james lurks at the top of the stairs swaddled in the sleeping 
               bag straining to hear

                         saw anyone someone you didnt know 
                         who seemed out of place suspicious 
                         maybe

               ext front porch

               grady is scratching his head in mock thought

                                     grady
                         well theres always people you dont 
                         know at these things but i cant

                         guy tiny fella claimed to be a

                                     officer pupcik
                         a jockey you mean like

                         just kidding

               pupcik nods slowly as if refiling grady under dealing 
               with assholes

                                     officer pupcik

                                     officer pupcik
                         thats all right well find him

               pete pupcik smiles tips his big blue police hat and turns 
               away grady frowns starts to close the door

                                     hannah green os
                         there you are

               grady stiffens then turns to find hannah green across the 
               room in her tshirt and cowboy boots looking all dewyeyed 
               and delectable

                                     hannah green
                         i thought we were going to talk 
                         last night

                                     grady
                         oh well i

               hannah stretches and the tshirt slides dangerously up her 
               thighs

                                     hannah green
                         its okay im here when you want 
                         me

               grady stands frozen as hannah smiles sleepily pushes through 
               the swinging door into the kitchen a thumping is heard as 
               james tangled in the sleeping bag hitches down the last 
               few steps of the stairway he watches pete pupcik drive away 
               in his big police car

                                     james leer
                         what do we do now

               before grady can reply the telephone sitting on the table 
               next to him rings

                                     grady
                         hello

                                     grady
                         could you hold on a minute honey

               with a look of wonderment grady watches his hand everso 
               gently hang up the phone

                                     grady
                         how bout we get the hell out of 
                         here

               ext gradys house  morning moments later

               james now wearing one of gradys flannel shirts beneath his 
               ratty overcoat follows gradyto the galaxie knapsack 
               swinging from his shoulder grady tosses him a ring of keys

                                     grady
                         you start her up

               as grady runs a plastic wedge over the glaze of ice blanketing 
               the windshield james stares curiously at the keys as if 
               they were some strange artifact then slides behind the 
               steering wheel

                                     james leer
                              as the engine roars
                         hows that

                                     grady
                         well done james

               as grady works james face comes into view then the 
               wedge snaps splintering into the flesh of gradys hand

                                     grady
                         shit

               james blinks pokes his head out the window

                                     james leer
                         youre bleeding professor tripp

               int aisle  market  morning later

               grady and james stand in the sundries aisle of a neighborhood 
               market grady has a tin of bandaids open and is presently 
               plastering his ragged thumb

                                     grady
                         where exactly do you live james

               james in the midst of chugging from a 64ounce jug of orange 
               juice stops

                                     grady
                         apparently not even hannah green has 
                         a clue as to the location of your 
                         apartment

               grady tosses the tin of bandaids into a small plastic hand 
               basket begins to move down the aisle

                                     james leer
                         i got kicked out well not exactly

                                     grady
                         i guess theres probably a story 
                         behind that

                                     james leer
                         there is but its not that 
                         interesting

                                     grady
                         so where have you been staying

                                     james leer
                              a long pause
                         the bus station

               grady stares incredulously at james

                                     james leer
                         its not so bad i know the night

                              trying to fathom 
                              this
                         but james i mean how long

                              unconvincingly
                         me

               grady drops the basket at the checkout counter and abruptly 
               finds himself face to face with a baby lolling on the 
               shoulder of the woman before him the baby is staring 
               spellbound at a display of qs latest paperback

               grady frowns then detects the true source of enchantment a 
               spray of shiny mylar gift balloons

               a thought evolves

                                     grady
                              the balloons
                         what do you think of these

               grady squinting through the teninch panel of cleared ice 
               on the windshield rolls slowly up onto the curb in front of 
               walter and sara gaskells house then off

               int galaxie  continuous

               grady pops the glovebox takes out a pen and scratches 
               something on the gift card attached to the balloon james 
               glances briefly at a plump ziploc of pot stashed in the 
               glovebox then peers at the house

                                     james leer
                              the house

                         hm

               grady gets out then pauses glancing at the giant orange 
               juice jug between james legs its about halfdown

                                     grady

                         its pretty acidic

               james takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat studies 
               it curiously

                                     james leer

                         do you thinks the matter with you

               as grady turns away james ponders this then considers the 
               ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and resets the 
               donut in precisely the same place

               int greenhouse  moment later

               through the steamy panes we see grady approach with the 
               balloon enter he crosses to a high table sets the balloon 
               down and steps back considering the placement

                         navigating

               sara turns to leave then stops squinting far down the 
               street

                                     sara

                         isnt he lucky

               grady watches her ripple across the glass head for the house 
               and wave james slumped low in the galaxie offers a limp 
               hand in return but its too late

               shes already gone

               int galaxie  moving  later

               grady cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw while james 
               sits stiffly the orange juice jug bobbing between his thighs

                         she seemed to take it pretty well

                         itself

               james nods unsurprised then turns back to the window 
               staring at the landscape still sitting oddly still grady 
               glances at him at the orange juice jug

                                     hank
                         where you stand

                                     grady

                              frowning
                         nothings wrong they went to

                              sheepishly

                         ah right the book

               grady starts to continue then stops cowed by something in 
               hanks tone something dismissive instead he looks away 
               toward the living room and catches sight of james again 
               sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa

                                     grady
                         listen hank im sorry about all

                         why did you come here grady

               grady gestures vaguely

                                     grady
                         i  just wanted to see her i guess

                         thats happening  its not forever 
                         it doesnt mean goodbye

                                     hank
                         give me a break grady

               hank snaps off the tape slaps gradys ankle

                                     hank
                         youre done

               int galaxie  moving  dusk

               grady glowers darkly at the road then puts his hand up 
               against the heating vent which apparently is not putting 
               out any heat

                                     james leer
                         im having a really good time 
                         professor tripp

               grady glances over sees james burrowing into the ziploc

                                     grady
                         im really happy for you james but 
                         do me a favor will you lay off my 
                         dope that stuffs not for amateurs

               james looks at ziploc as grady fiddles with the heat lever

                                     james leer
                         i just wanted a little sip

                                     grady
                              squinting at him
                         i just wanted a little sip tell me 
                         james exactly what point was it 
                         that you turned into serpent boy

                                     james leer
                         probably about the time you gave me 
                         the codeine pills last night

               grady stops with the heater glances over at james whose 
               face bears not the slightest trace of irony

                                     grady
                         jesus
                              thinking then
                         look james you appear to possess  
                         like many an aspiring writer before 
                         you by the way  a rather ardent 
                         affinity for the stuff of which dreams 
                         are made however i think its best 
                         if for the moment at least
                              taking the ziploc
                         we abstain

                                     james leer
                         youre mad at me arent you

                                     grady

                                     james leer

                         girlfriends dog

                                     grady
                         it wasnt her dog its her husbands 
                              stopping
                         who said anything about girlfriend

               james eyes shift slowly as if to say who are you kidding

                                     grady
                         okay james i wish you hadnt shot

                         who took you up into the chancellors

                         you were thinking ive got to find

                                     grady
                         thanks for the halo james but ive 
                         never done that much thinking ahead 
                         in my life  ever

               james looks out the window pondering this

                                     james leer
                         so why did you take me up there

                         why do you wear that coat

               james looks down a little defensive

                                     james leer
                         its warm

                                     grady

                         class it was 95 degrees and you 
                         were wearing the coat

               james just blinks no ready answer available

                                     grady
                         thats why they all give you such a 
                         hard time in workshop

                                     grady
                         because you act like a goddamn spook 
                         all the time not to mention the 
                         fact that every last one of them is 
                         jealous of you

                                     james leer
                              smirking
                         jealous of me

                                     grady

                         go on the more annoying they become 
                         until finally you just want to grab 
                         something heavy and 

                                     grady

                         carrie and howard dont know what

                         one tenth of one percent the talent 
                         you have okay

               james stares blankly at grady then turns his face to the 
               window he ponders gradys words the praise inherent in 
               them a hint of pleasure glints in his eyes

                                     james leer

                              quietly

                                     grady

                         most of them havent thought in years

               james turns studies gradys face as it flickers in the first 
               headlights of the evening

                                     grady
                         let me spell it out for you james 
                         books dont mean anything not to 
                         anybody not anymore

                                     james leer
                         arsonists daughter meant something

               grady smiles contemptuously

                                     james leer
                         i mean it it means something to me 
                         its one of the reasons i came to

                         be taught by you
                              quietly
                         its one of the reasons i wanted to 
                         become a writer

               grady stares ahead watching the darkness tumble away before 
               the wide sweep of the galaxies headlights

                                     grady
                         well for that if nothing else 
                         james im sorry

               ext coffee shopmotel  off the highway  evening

               grady rolls into a space near the coffee shop and james slides 
               out grady stays put hands still on the wheel

                                     james leer
                         you coming

                                     grady
                         in a minute get us a table

               james nods pushes past the glass doors into the coffee shop 
               and a big redhead in a waitress cap leads him to a table 
               with a view of the highway grady watches james  stick 
               figure in black brogues  slide into the booth and open his 
               big laminated menu

               finally as if concluding some internal debate grady kicks

               gradys  mind races with unfortunate possibilities but only 
               briefly his immediate thoughts are elsewhere

                                     grady

                         crabtree said it sounded like 
                         something james would be messed up 
                         in

                                     grady

               as grady starts to turn away hannah hooks her finger inside 
               his belt buckle

                                     hannah green

               grady looks at hannahs hand where it rests he looks 
               terrified

                                     grady

               crabtree stops takes in the tableau before him

                         oh im sorry am i interrupting a 
                         studentteacher conference

               grady delicately removes hannahs hand from his buckle points 
               at crabtree

                                     grady

                         what ohhhh is that it

               crabtree cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on 
               gradys desk

                                     crabtree

               grady smirks glances at crabtree but gets a surprise 
               crabtree offers no snappy comeback no antic wordplay he 
               just stares out the window his voice distant

                                     crabtree
                         no i think i might be right ive 
                         felt it before

               grady and crabtree look at each other a moment then crabtree 
               smiles gives a little shrug and picks up james knapsack 
               rummaging through the contents

                         so modest

                              nosing around the

                         real important to you okay check 
                         this out

               crabtree leans over an old royal typewriter reads from the 
               freshlytyped page curling from the carriage

                                     crabtree
                         finally the door opened it was a 
                         shock to see him shuffling into the 
                         room like an aging prizefighter 
                         limping beaten
                              with an amused smile
                         sound like anyone we know
                              resuming
                         but it was later when the great 
                         man squinted into the bitter glow or 
                         twilight
                              frowning
                         bitter glow of twilight this kid 
                         definitely needs an editor
                              resuming
                         and muttered simply it means 
                         nothing all of it nothing that 
                         the true shock came it was then 
                         that the boy understood that his 
                         heros true injuries lay hidden in a 
                         darker place his heart

               crabtree stops abruptly

                                     grady
                         yes his heart

               crabtree hesitates then reads on

                                     crabtree
                         his heart once capable of inspiring 
                         others so completely could no longer 
                         inspire so much as itself it beat 
                         now only out of habit it beat now 
                         only because it could

               grady nods his face unreadable then james returns

                                     james leer

               poe  as hes lowered delicately onto james bed

               int james room  basement a few minutes later

               grady strategically arranges the coverlet gently adjusting 
               poes head so only a tuft of fur shows he steps back joining 
               crabtree and james for an assessment

                                     grady

               int living room

               a quiet disaster the only sound an lp playing meekly on the 
               stereo james passes through first ignoring the tortilla 
               chips popping under his shoes then crabtree and grady appear

               int hallway

               crabtrees door is closing as grady hobbles into view

               hannah green lies tangled in the sheets surrounded by little 
               colonies of gradys manuscript grady studies her then 
               detects something on the floor the red boots

               delicately he lifts the sheet hannah greens feet  finally 
               revealed in all their naked glory  prove to be thick wide 
               and ordinary grady sighs

               grady sits quietly on the porch steps a joint burning in 
               his fingers to his left perched atop a haagendazs 
               container is a telephone as he pulls it into his lap a 
               lamp in the living room pirouettes clumsily spins free of 
               the cord and shatters on the floor

               grady blinks looks away and dials just as the clattering 
               cough of an engine is heard and a van appears

               stenciled on its side panel is

                                 kravniks sporting goods

               the van slows almost coasting then abruptly bursts past 
               gradys house and disappears around the corner grady frowns 
               then realizes a mans voice is coming from the receiver in 
               his lap

               as the line goes dead grady stares at the phone wondering

               ext gradys neighborhood  sunday morning next day

               a car rattles down the street newspapers pinwheeling from

               int gradys office  same time

               a heavy thhnk hits the driveway outside and grady blinks

               sitting in his pink robe blearyeyed he reconsiders the 
               piece of paper curling from his typewriter

               gradys pov  of the page

               its obvious hes been sitting like this for some time

               just then the distinctive purr of an engine is heard

               grady peers through the window watches a cab glide to the 
               curb below a citroen ds23 sara

               ext front porch  gradys house

               grady steps onto the porch unintentionally punting a bottle

                                     grady

                         missing and his parents found a dead 
                         dog in his bed

                                     grady

                         gotten the police involved they 
                         seem to think james leer is somehow 
                         responsible for all of this you

                         over there in the backseat of the

               gradys hand hangs in midair gesturing pointlessly to the 
               driveway where the only thing that exists is an oil stain 
               roughly the shape of north dakota

                                     grady
                         someone stole my car

               int crabtrees room  moments later

               crabtree sits in bed flipping through the pages of the love 
               parade while stroking a tiny tuft of hair that is the sole 
               visible part of james leer

                                     grady
                              swinging in

                                     crabtree

                         standing on the porch and i dont 
                         think hes going away

                                     james leer
                              from under the covers
                         that same guy

               crabtree peels back the blankets and james leer opens one 
               eye

                                     james leer

               james swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
               bare assed across the room to retrieve his bvds

                                     james leer
                         its the chancellor

                         fiddle

               grady squints at james as he pulls on his pants

                                     grady
                         shut up james

                         was a problem

               as james head pops through gradys fullybuttoned flannel 
               he and crabtree exchange a knowing glance at once referring 
               to and excluding grady

                                     sara os

                                     grady
                         its walters dog and yes she does

                         bad not bad at all

               james stops considers this piece of news with a look of 
               deep seriousness then nods

                                     james leer

               as james shuffles off into the hail crabtree looks at grady 
               his eyes dancing with excitement

                                     crabtree

                         editorial guidance it could be 
                         brilliant

                                     grady

                         genet its been awhile since somebody 
                         wrote a good book in jail

               ext gradys house  moments later

               sara and grady stand by as pete pupcik deposits james in the 
               back of the squad car slams the door

                                     pupcik

                         to dr gaskell where we go from there

               grady nods leans in the window to james

                                     grady
                         dont worry james ill figure

                         well lets see if we can keep that 
                         from happening

               james nods and grady starts to step back from the car

                                     james leer
                         professor tripp

                                     grady

                                     james leer
                         even if i end up going to jail

               james smiles his crooked grin

                                     james leer
                         youre still the best teacher i ever 
                         had

               on this pete pupcik pulls away leaving grady standing on 
               the curb watching the back of james head framed in the 
               rear window of the police car growing smaller

                                     sara
                         this is not what the university has 
                         in mind when it promises a liberal 
                         education grady

                                     grady
                         would walter really press charges

                                     sara
                         its within the realm he takes his 
                         souvenirs pretty seriously and he 
                         was just a wee bit prickly this 
                         morning

               grady detecting something in saras tone turns watches 
               her take a drag on her cigarette

                                     sara
                         you didnt happen to call the house 
                         last night did you grady

                                     grady
                         i think i might have

                                     sara
                         and what do you think you might have 
                         said

                                     grady
                         i think i mightve said i was in 
                         love with you

               saras face remains unchanged

                                     grady
                         he told you

                                     sara
                         he told me

                                     grady
                         and what did you say

                                     sara
                         i said it didnt sound like you

               sara tosses her cigarette in the gutter gets into her car 
               and dives away grady looks after her sadly then turns 
               sees crabtree standing on the porch wearing a shirt which 
               claims ativan chases the clouds away

                                     crabtree
                         so  what do we do now

                                     grady
                         find the jacket

                                     crabtree
                         oh huh exactly how do we do that

                                     grady
                         first i see if hannah will let me 
                         borrow her car

                                     crabtree
                         it seems to me that girl would let 
                         you borrow her pancreas

               int hannahs room  later

               hannah wrapped loosely in cotton sheets smiles as she 
               listens to the goatee kid who sits crosslegged at the foot 
               ofher bed fully clothed

                                     goatee kid
                         im telling you the tango is all 
                         about latent homosexual love look

                         right anyway i was wondering if i

                         sure the keys are on the dresser 
                         next to to your book

               the hitch in hannahs voice hangs in the room like a cloud

                                     hannah green
                         i uh i didnt finish i fell 
                         asleep

                                     hannah green
                         no its not that its

               hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
               dresser then hesitantly looks back to grady

                                     hannah green
                         its just that you know i was 
                         thinking about how in class youre 
                         always telling us that writers make 
                         choices  at least the good ones 
                         and dont get me wrong im not 
                         saying the book isnt really great  
                         i mean really great  but at times 
                         its well very detailed you know 
                         with the genealogies of everyones 
                         horses and all the dental records 
                         and so on  and i dont know maybe 
                         im wrong but it sort of reads in 
                         places like well actually like
                              with trepidation
                         you didnt make any choices at 
                         all and i was wondering if it might 
                         not be different if maybe when you 
                         wrote you werent always under 
                         the influence

                              stung
                         uh huh well thanks for the thought 
                         but as shocking as this may sound 
                         im not the first writer to sip a 
                         little weed and furthermore it 
                         might interest you to know that one 
                         book i wrote as you say under the 
                         influence happened to win a little 
                         something called the pen award which 
                         by the way i accepted under the 
                         influence

               hannah nods averts her eyes and immediately grady feels 
               ridiculous he starts to say something but instead gathers

                                     crabtree
                         tripp run

               grady doesnt move an inch watching in mute amazement as 
               crabtree whistles by proceeds halfway down the block then 
               turns back for another pass

                                     vernon
                         who the hell is that

                                     grady
                         a manhattan book editor murdering a 
                         mormon girls clutch

               the car bucks crazily picks up speed and crabtree  swiping 
               aside a flutter of manuscript pages that have taken flight 
               inside the car  begins to veer right toward grady vernon 
               and oola

                                     vernon
                         woah

               vernon steps into the street levels the german nine

                                     vernon
                         pull off you crazy motherfucker

               frantic grady steps between vernon the german nine and 
               the oncoming crabtree

                                     grady
                         no dont shoot hes just a lousy 
                         driver

               crabtree fans the wheel wildly goes into a slide and the 
               passenger door snaps wide releasing what looks to be a flock 
               of white doves into the windwhipped sky

               only these aint birds

                                     grady
                         oh my god

               these are pages seven years of pages

               crabtree goes into another slide onehops the curb and 
               smashes flat into the weathered glove of bill mazeroski 
               painted on the front wail of kravniks sporting goods

               as hannah greens radiator explodes crabtree steps free of 
               the car and looks skyward its a tickertape parade all the 
               way down the street ending in the frigid waters of the ohio 
               river

                                     grady
                              to vernon
                         i take it back shoot him

               int galaxie  moving

               vernon drives oola at his side in the back crabtree puffs 
               philosophically on a kool while grady sits grimly with the 
               sad remains of his manuscript seven rumpled pages one of 
               which bears the watermark of a shoe print

                                     crabtree
                         naturally you have copies

                                     grady
                         i have an alternate version of the 
                         first chapter

                                     crabtree
                         youll be all right then look at 
                         carlyle when he lost his luggage

                                     grady
                         that was maccaulay

                                     crabtree
                         or hemingway when hadley lost all 
                         those stories

                                     grady
                         he was never able to reproduce them

                                     crabtree
                         bad examples look tripp i dont 
                         want to depreciate the loss here 
                         but perhaps  in a sense  this 
                              nodding to the pages
                         is for the best

               gradys eyes shift study crabtree

                                     grady
                         kind of a sign youre saying

                                     crabtree
                         in a sense

                                     grady
                         i dont think so in my experience 
                         signs are usually a lot more subtle

                                     vernon
                         let me get this straight all that 
                         paper that went into the river that 
                         was the only copy

                                     grady
                         fraid so

                                     vernon
                              glowering at crabtree
                         and youre saying its some kind of 
                         sign what the fucks the matter 
                         with you

                                     crabtree
                         im just saying that sometimes 
                         subconsciously a person will put 
                         themselves in a situation  perhaps 
                         even create that situation  in 
                         order to have an arena in which to 
                         work out an unresolved issue its a 
                         covert way if you will of addressing 
                         a problem

               vernon stares at crabtree as if hes from another planet

                                     vernon
                         ill tell you the problem you behind 
                         the wheel theres your fucking 
                         problem

                                     crabtree
                         thats pretty simplistic dont you 
                         think

                                     vernon
                         hey pal you dont start doing crazy 
                         eights in the middle of the street 
                         none of this happens

                                     crabtree
                         excuse me did you or did you not 
                         have a gun to his head

                                     vernon
                         he was trying to steal my car

                                     grady
                         ail right all right its done 
                         theres no need to talk about it 
                         its done

               they ride in silence for a moment then oola turns glances 
               at grady and his little sheaf of pages

                                     oola
                         so what was it about
                              as grady looks up
                         your book what was the story

               grady stares into oolas sweet brown eyes

                                     grady
                         i dont know

               oolas brow wrinkles crabtree glances at his old friend 
               genuine compassion in his eyes

                                     crabtree
                         what he means is its difficult to 
                         distill the essence of a book 
                         sometimes it lives in the mind

                                     vernon
                         yeah but you gotta know what its 
                         about right i mean if you didnt 
                         know what it was about why were you 
                         writing it

                                     grady
                         i couldnt stop

               ext campus entrance

               grady james leers hollow knapsack in hand stands with 
               crabtree at the campus entrance as vernon and oola prepare 
               to leave in the galaxie

                                     grady
                         hey vernon can i ask you a question

                                     vernon
                         shoot

               grady glances at little round oola

                                     grady
                         boy or girl

                                     vernon

                         care you know what im saying

               grady watches vernon give oola a kiss on the forehead

                                     grady
                         right well thanks for the lift

                                     vernon

                                     grady

                                     vernon
                         stop calling me vernon

               crabtree leans into grady whispers

                                     crabtree
                         the jacket tripp we need the jacket

                                     grady
                         oh right oola about that jacket

                                     oola
                         yea

               grady looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress snuggled 
               up in the silk wedding jacket

                                     grady
                         it used to belong to marilyn monroe 
                         she had small shoulders like you 
                         most people dont know that

               as oola smiles pleased vernon shakes his head

                                     vernon
                         man that book of yours mustve been 
                         one nutty motherfucking ride

               vernon points an imaginary gun fires a friendly cap into 
               grady and pulls away crabtree stands stunned

                                     crabtree
                         you mind explaining what you just 
                         did

               grady watches the shrinking galaxie sail under a drooping 
               nordfest banner lost in thought

                                     grady
                         came to my senses

                                     crabtree
                         ah well congratulations meanwhile 
                         what is james supposed to do pray 
                         for walter gaskell to come to his

                                     grady
                         walter gaskell isnt going to send 
                         james leer to jail crabs i know 
                         that

                                     crabtree
                         do you know he wont expel him

                                     grady
                         no but i dont think that matters

                                     crabtree
                         thats very enlightened professor 
                         its comforting to know that americas 
                         children have you for a teacher

               grady blinks ponders this briefly then looks toward the 
               buildings of the campus his voice still distant

                                     grady
                         nobody teaches a writer anything 
                         you tell them what you know you 
                         tell them to find their voice and 
                         stick with it because thats all 
                         you have in the end you tell the 
                         ones who have it to keep at it and 
                         you tell the ones who dont to keep 
                         at it too because thats the only 
                         way to get where youre going
                              ruefully
                         of course it helps if you know where 
                         you want to go
                              thoughtfully
                         maybe thats the only thing  that 
                         and sara  thats made the last 
                         seven years worthwhile

               grady slides james knapsack off his shoulder smiles 
               cryptically as he considers it

                                     grady
                         as for james he doesnt need me 
                         anymore

               without warning grady tosses crabtree the knapsack

                                     grady
                         hes got you

               crabtree stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands 
               watches grady walk away

                                     crabtree
                         me what can i do

                                     grady
                         gee i dont know crabs
                              over his shoulder
                         improvise youre good at that

               grady continues on leaving crabtree to stand alone as he 
               walks toward the buildings in the distance

                                     crabtree
                         im sorry tripp

               grady stops turns

                                     grady
                         you peeked didnt you

                                     crabtree
                         i peeked

               grady considers this nods it doesnt seem to matter anymore

                                     crabtree
                         it really had the makings tripp 
                         there was a lot to admire ive 
                         never read anything quite like it

               if there was a kentucky derby for editorial bullshit 
               crabtrees last three utterances would finish win place 
               and show and grady knows it

                                     grady
                         youre not just trying to make me 
                         feel better

               crabtree looks directly at grady his old friend

                                     crabtree
                         scouts honor

               crabtree and grady stare into each others eyes both are 
               acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation

                                     grady
                         well thanks for that crabs

               int hallway  english department

               dead quiet gradually steps are heard coming from the 
               stairwell then grady limps into view

               int gradys classroom  moments later

               grady surveys the room empty chairs empty desks

               he walks to a window the same window he stood at two 
               afternoons ago when reading james leers story a chill breeze 
               pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren 
               benches and icy walkways of the quad finally he turns away 
               settles behind his desk and reaching into his pocket removes 
               the seven remaining pages of his manuscript he considers 
               them then folds them in half lengthwise he continues 
               folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the 
               first crease

               ext quad

               a moment then  from the third floor window  a paper 
               airplane glides into view soaring then dropping soaring 
               then dropping again and again graceful as a dove

               int lobby  thaw hall  later

               grady hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium 
               doors swings open applause swells and he spies sara standing 
               inside talking to a student usher

                                     grady
                         sara

               sara turns as the door glides shut as grady hustles 
               forward q wine glass in hand intercepts him

                                     q
                         grady i have to tell you i took 
                         another look at arsonists daughter 
                         the other night theres a description 
                         of a bald cypress that left me 
                         breathless

                                     grady
                              pushing past him
                         thanks q i felt the same way about 
                         the bank tellers breasts in your 
                         last one

               int back row  auditorium  thaw hall

               grady enters but sara is gone he picks his way behind 
               the back row scanning the aisles

                                     girls voics
                         hey professor tripp

               its carrie mcwhirty james tormentor from workshop

               grady takes another look around then drops into the seat 
               next to her

                                     carrie mcwhirty
                         if youre looking for hannah shes

                                     grady
                         no

               but grady looks anyway hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
               aisle hair pulled back in a clip glorious skin gloaming

               the goatee kid sits close beside her

                                     carrie mcwhirty
                         whos that guy shes with didnt he 
                         used to be in workshop

                         jeff he comes from a long line of 
                         tango dancers

               int main stage

               walter turns over the last page of his prepared notes

                                     walter
                         and now as those of you whove been 
                         with us in previous years know we 
                         have a tradition of sorts here at 
                         wordfest im speaking of course 
                         of the plums

               an anticipatory buzz sweeps through the audience as walter 
               begins to read from a separate list

                                     walter
                         this weekend susan lowery of north 
                         braddock found a publisher for her 
                         childrens book the loneliest prawn 
                         susan stand up

               int back row  thaw hall

               as a chubby woman stands to acknowledge the applause grady 
               cranes his neck searching the sea of seats to his surprise 
               he finds crabtree sitting prominently in the front row in 
               his shirtsleeves smiling his spookily complacent smile 
               james is next to him now wearing crabtrees metallic sports 
               coat over gradys flannel shirt

                                     walter
                         and robert wilkenson  who many of 
                         you know for his city beat column in 
                         the postgazette  has found a home 
                         with putnam for his new three rivers 
                         thriller blood patterns robert

               a short balding man stands briefly then walters voice takes 
               a shift in tone

                                     walter
                         now this next one i think is 
                         especially exciting to announce 
                         because it concerns a student here 
                         at the university our own james 
                         leer a sophomore in english 
                         literature has found a publisher 
                         for his first novel which i believe 
                         is called the lovely parade

               grady blinks leans forward and watches walter smile warmly 
               toward the front row crabtree gives james a jab in the ribs 
               and slowly awkwardly james rises stunned carrie mcwhirty 
               turns to the girl next to her

                                     carrie mcwhirty
                         i have a class with him

               james hangs like a scarecrow from a nail waiting as the 
               applause slows then sputters then dies out altogether

                                     carrie mcwhirty
                         the guys kind of an alien probe if 
                         you know what i mean

               grady in a last attempt to save james from himself cups 
               his his hands around his mouth

                                     grady
                         take a bow james

               james turns spots grady in the back row then  a sheepish 
               grin on his face  spreads his arms hangs his head and 
               takes his first sweet public bow

                                     grady
                              softly
                         wonder boy

                                     walter
                         and finally  and perhaps not least 
                         importantly  terry crabtree of 
                         bartizan has also decided to publish 
                         my own book  a critical exploration 
                         of the union of marilyn monroe and 
                         joe dimaggio and its function in 
                         american mythopoetics  which 
                         tentatively ive entitled the last 
                         american marriage

               wild obsequious applause grady smiles cynically watches 
               walter take a brief dignified bow of his own

                                     walter
                         until next year thank you everyone

               the lights come up as the auditorium empties crabtree shakes 
               walters hand and jeff and his goatee escort hannah green 
               down the aisle where she drapes her lovely arms around james

               grady watches them all sitting alone in his row when 
               suddenly sara appears over james shoulder she says something 
               congratulatory turns and exits out a side door

               grady blinks scrambles up

               int corridor  thaw hall  moments later

               grady bursts into the corridor

                                     grady
                         sara

               its empty quiet grady pauses somewhere a heavy metal 
               door closes grady rushes on

               int new corridor

               grady limping badly turns a corner and sees a door he 
               moves to it pushes past

               int stairwell  continuous

               and finds himself standing in a stairwell he leans out 
               over the railing peers down its a steep drop very steep 
               ending in a small rectangular space a kind of basement 
               office with vending machines plastic chairs and a 
               collapsible card table

               grady turns back to the door he came through pushes against 
               it locked he sighs looks back at the stairs his ailing 
               ankle then sits he fishes out the ziploc of marijuana 
               considers the perfectly rolled joint floating atop the bag 
               of buds but for once isnt up to it the sound of footsteps 
               echoes far below and hopeful theyre saras grady pulls 
               himself up peers over the railing

               its traxler with a broom a big plastic bag

                                     grady
                         yo traxler

                                     traxler
                              looking up
                         hey professor tripp

               grady considers the ziploc in his hand looks down again

                                     grady
                         do you get high sam

                                     traxler
                         only when im working

               grady hangs over the railing and lets fly the ziploc it 
               pinwheels through the vortex of stairs lands at sams feet

                                     traxler
                         holy shit are you serious

                                     grady
                         as a heart attack

                                     traxler
                         thanks  whoa professor tripp 
                         careful here

               grady is still hanging over the railing but looking dizzy 
               now his eyelids flutter and he tips forward  a steinway 
               on a window ledge  and as he starts to drop

               there is a sharp jerk on his  collar a shirt button 
               caroms off his cheek and slowly he is hauled back

                                     sara
                         grady what are you doing you idiot

               grady looks up into saras freckled face

                                     grady
                         looking for you

               he wants to say more he opens his mouth but then all 
               goes black as saras voice calls

               faintly at first then more forcefully calling gradys name 
               calling so insistently that the earth seems to rush upward 
               until we see that she is

               kissing him or something and all goes softly blue

               int hospital room  day

               grady lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
               plastic curtains in a blue room through a gap in the 
               curtains he can see the bottle of glucose that drips slowly 
               into his arm and beyond a window flakes of snow fall 
               outside

               the door squeals a shadow ripples across the blue then the 
               curtains part and a resident with a clipboard appears

               his nametag says greenhut

                                     grady
                         i passed out

                         having these
                              grabbing james term
                         spells

                         thats probably not the problem 
                         then what about your lifestyle any

                         your life youre lucky she came 
                         along when she did

               grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement

                                     grady

                         ought to consider seeing a therapist 
                         as well

                                     grady

                         actually it was her husbands dog

               greenhut glances up looking grady in the eyes for the first 
               time and grady stops

                                     greenhut

                         experiencing lately

                                     grady

                         possible

               greenhut studies grady calibrating the desperation in his 
               eyes then takes a quick glance at his watch

                                     greenhut

               grady sits in a wheelchair watching the snow fail around 
               him as a nurse escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
               connects one building to another

                                     grady
                         i wonder if you could show me 
                         something

               ext nursery  hospital  moments later

               grady stares through the glass there are only two babies on 
               display heads dented from natural delivery skin purple and 
               crazy with veins

                                     grady
                         are these the only ones you have

               the nurses eyes crinkle

                                     grady

               ext gaskell house  late afternoon

               grady pays a taxi cab driver then turns looks at the gaskell 
               house

               ext front door  moment later

               grady knocks nothing peers into the living room window

               dark he stands helplessly then spies the greenhouse 
               standing ghostly across the yard feathers of snow drifting 
               onto its roof melting

               ext greenhouse  moment later

               grady hobbles to the greenhouse puts both hands to the glass 
               as he looks inside quiet empty dispirited he pulls away 
               but not before leaving

               the imprints of his hands perfectly etched in the frost 
               of the glass

               ext street

               the snow continues to fall as grady lumbers down the street 
               finally wearily he stops sits his crippled self on the 
               curb he plunges his fist into his jacket and

               straight through the lining james leers silly little 
               pistol at the end of his hand he considers the pistol then 
               looks up into the sky

               gradys pov  of the sky

               dark and menacing suddenly a thunderclap shatters the

               still sitting with the gun in his hand

                              as if addressing god
                         is that a suggestion

               grady sits blinking the snow out of his eyes then two shafts 
               of light dance across his shoes a white citroen ds23 appears  
               it passes slows stops

               grady stares at the car burbling at the curb then lifts 
               himself up and makes his way to the drivers window sara 
               makes a face bugging her eyes a little mad at him but not 
               without humor then she rolls down the window

                                     grady

               sara strokes his scalp takes a gray hair between her fingers 
               yanks

                                     grady

                         dozens its very sad

               sara smiles at grady but the mischief leaves her eyes when 
               she looks into his and she glances away

                                     grady
                         i went and looked at some babies 
                         just now

                                     sara
                         oh

                                     grady
                              trying to make her 
                              laugh
                         i guess you have to go on faith

                                     sara
                              she doesnt
                         some times

               grady studies her as she traces her finger around the hospital 
               bracelet still encircling his wrist

                                     grady
                         did you tell walter

                                     sara
                         i told walter

                                     grady
                         does he still love you

                                     sara
                         it didnt come up

               grady studies saras freckled cheeks her anxious profile 
               then turns her chin gently toward him

                                     grady
                         well i do ive always loved you 
                         sara i didnt know it at the time 
                         but id always been waiting for you 
                         my whole life because youre who i 
                         need because nothing makes sense 
                         without you because the best moment 
                         of every day is the moment i first 
                         see your face and because when you 
                         leave a room theres no reason to 
                         be in it any more its just a room 
                         again

               sara cocks her head

                                     sara
                         did you just make that up

                                     grady
                              shaking his head
                         in the hospital i was kind of excited 
                         about it at the time but then i was 
                         on pretty heavy painkillers

               she frowns goodnaturedly

                                     grady
                         even so its still true every 
                         word

               sara just nods looks away her face unreadable

                                     grady
                         sara i promise even though 
                         commonsense might tell you

               sara turns puts a finger on gradys lips

                                     sara
                         dont write a page when a paragraph 
                         will do

               grady nods takes her hand looks at it as he speaks

                                     grady
                         you dont deserve me you know

                                     sara
                         i know but sometimes

               sara turns looks at grady her eyes are glistening

                                     sara
                         you just go on faith

               grady looks into her eyes then rises and we do too drifting 
               above the streetlights as grady limps to the other side of 
               the car and gets in as grady snaps shut his door the car 
               drifts off gradually losing itself in the soft veil of 
               falling snow after a moment grady and sara are lost too 
               nothing more than a blur

                                         the end
