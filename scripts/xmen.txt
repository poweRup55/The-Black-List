munroe who will become storm one of the xmen is playing a 
game of tag using sticks with other kids in her tribe in a sandy 
field 

ororo is tagged and then shunned by the other children who begin 
to tease and taunt her their cries begin to turn increasingly 
cruel until they begin to hit her with their sticks 

the little girls eyes go white and it suddenly begins snowing 
copiously the tribes adults are terrified by this spectacle 
even more so when the snow turns into large hail  

ororo falls to her knees and begins to cry the tears run from 
her solid white eyes we see that the hail falls around her and 
does not touch her the image of the circle of hail which 
pummels the ground while leaving her within a safe 10foot 
radius is striking 


int high school in southern california  night 1986

a man named scott summers who will become cyclops one of the x
men is at his high school senior prom

bathroom he tries to follow but is stopped by a teacher

pot 

scott sits on the toilet and covers his eyes tears flow like a 
tap from between his fingers the guys in the bathroom ask him 
what he has been smoking 

	            scott 

	my eyes are killing me 

another boy offers scott some visine but it is too late scott 
raises his head and reveals his eyes which glow like embers a 
red beam shoots out from his eyes and blasts through several 
walls including the school gymnasium 


ext congressional hearing  day present day

a woman named jean grey member and spokeswoman for the xmen is 
speaking at a podium and briefing the audience about the mutator 
gene that exists in all humans and has remained dormant until 
recently she says that mutants are the next evolution of mankind 
and that they should not be feared 

senator kelly then stands and announces that mutants are 
dangerous and that they can not be trusted he riles up the crowd 
with frightening claims of what mutants can do there is a girl 
in indiana who can walk through walls  she would be a perfect 
thief there is a mutant who can disrupt computers possibly 
threatening wall street the list goes on and on

kelly then talks of a secretive school for mutants in 
westchester new york kelly believes that the school is a cult 
that trains mutants how to use their aberrant powers against 
mankind 

kelly then pushes his mutant registration act the crowd is 
obviously on his side not even listening to jean

jean then tries to calm kelly and the crowd when suddenly a 
bottle of water comes flying toward her head from the press 
gallery jean freezes the bottle in midair with her telekinesis 
and says 

                              jean

                  mutants are not the ones mankind should 
                  fear 

the bottle then falls to the floor the press and the senators 
erupt at the demonstration of mutant power 


professor charles xavier founder and father figure of the xmen 
sits in the audience shaking his head in disappointment at jean 
she should not have used her powers

xavier suddenly senses a disturbance in the room he turns and 
sees a man in shadow at the far end of the room in the doorway 
the man abruptly turns and walks out 

xavier in wheelchair follows the man out the man with his 
back to xavier stops in his tracks 

notice how the architecture in the in the background forms a 
series of  xs  a bit of symbolism

                             xavier 

                  max please give them a chance 

max lensherr magneto in an expensive suit turns around and 
expresses that it is too late for compromise the war has begun 
and max guarantees that he will win 

                              xavier

                  consider what were trying to accomplish 
                  here 

max is unconvinced he then winces in pain and shakes it off 

                             max 

                 are you trying to sneak around in my head 
                 charles what are you trying to find 

                            xavier 

                 hope 

max walks away and leaves xavier there alone 

the dynamics between the two characters is awesome the dialogue 
between max and xavier crackles even though they are briefly 
together onscreen 


int a basement in edmonton  evening

a 17 yearold girl named rogue who will become one of the xmen 
is with her boyfriend in the basement of his home they are 
watching the news conference we were just at 

the boyfriend leans over to kiss her and their lips suddenly lock 
in a death embrace as she begins to suck the life from him on 
accident the boy suddenly drops in front of rogue and the boys 
parents 

rejected by her family rogue runs away from home 


ext just outside a log cabin bar in alberta canada  later that 
night

a pick up truck sits axledeep in the snow outside the bar it is 
snowing heavily

inside the bar are a few drunk truckers and locals rogue enters 
the bar completely covered from head to toe and asks the 
bartender for a coke and some chips she has obviously run away 
from home 

a rugged man named logan who will become wolverine sits at a 
bar watching a different newscast of the mutant press conference 
he tells the bartender to give the poor girl what she wants she 
then proceeds to sit down in the corner and have her snack  


as logan watches the newscast it says that at the upcoming un 
world summit conference all the worlds leaders will meet in a 
few weeks at ellis island in new york to discuss among other 
things the mutant phenomenon 

one of the drunk truckers then goes over to rogue and begins to 
talk to her she ignores him and this causes the trucker to get 
pushy grabbing her hand there is a sudden flash of light and he 
passes out 

the truckers friends realize that she is a mutant and so they 
close in on her ready to get revenge until the local named 
logan speaks up 
they push him out of the way and then find themselves in a heap 
of trouble logan who is wearing a gleaming metal dog tag 
knocks out one of the truckers and a fight ensues

he then puts his fist against one of the truckers legs and we 
hear a sound that is described as shook in the script like the 
sound of sharp claws quickly emerging the trucker howls in 
pain logan retracts the claw and we see three deep holes in the 
truckers leg 


cut to logans truck as logan and rogue drive away the truck 
door reads firewood for sale 

as rogue and logan are driving rogue tells logan that he should 
wear a seatbelt before he can answer they suddenly hit something 
and logan goes flying through the windshield 

he then gets up unharmed rogue is amazed to see the large 
wound on his face heal before her eyes 

logan looks at the obstacle in front of the truck a tree has 
been felled in their path intentionally from the looks of the 
cut 

logan is inspecting it when suddenly a big furry hand slashes 
across his face a furious battle ensues between sabretooth 
magnetos lead henchman and logan rogue who can not undo her 
seat belt watches on 
 
sabretooth takes logan and slams him into the side of the 
roadside cliff logans dog tag comes off on sabretooths claw 
sabretooth then tosses logans unconscious body in front of the 
truck where two odd figures now stand silhouetted both wear 
strange formfitting uniforms 

one figure is a black woman with long white hair and the other is 
a man with a strange glowing visor on his face 

a rising gale wind created by storm begins to push sabretooth 
back 

but the feral mutant charges only to be met by an optic blast of 
red energy from cyclops sabretooth is blown off the hill 
cyclops and storm then turn toward a frightened rogue 

int odd laboratory  night  

toad a member of the brotherhood is hard at work in the 
laboratory 

in a nearby office sabretooth tells magneto that he lost logan to 
cyclops and storm he shows magneto that all he got was logans 
dog tag magneto fondles the dog tag while his holocaust serial 
number tattoo is clearly visible on his arm

magneto reads the odd word wolverine on the tag he realizes 
this is a strange dog tag it wont bend 

                              magneto

                  its just enough for my test


int the xmansion  night

the severely injured logan and rogue are rescued and brought back 
to the xmansion

inside one of the laboratory rooms logan lies on a bed still 
unconscious 

his xrays show an odd skeleton that almost appears to glow 
there is a strange almost machinelike bone structure 
especially around the forearms and knuckles 

jean then enters and prepares to stick an iv in his arm logan 
suddenly snaps out of it and begins to choke her he eventually 
drops her and as she gasps for air on the floor logan realizes 
that his dog tag is gone 

he rushes out of the lab in a hurry 

as he wonders through the mansion he finds himself in a locker 
room type area with odd black uniforms along the wall


he finds his clothes and continues to wonder through the 
underground facility
logan then ducks into a hangar with an oddlooking black jet in 
it 

he finds an elevator and takes it to the ground level where he 
finds himself in a stately corridor of the mansion he hears a 
voice from a nearby door and peaks in to see storm teaching a 
class of very unusual teenagers about the rise of christianity 

hearing footsteps logan turns and hides in a nearby office in 
this office he is surprised to be welcomed by a man who 
introduces himself as the founder of the school charles 
xavier


xavier explains to logan his own mutant gifts and how he 
telepathically lead logan to this office he also explains the 
conflict that the xmen have with magneto 

xavier then proceeds to tell logan about the xmen and how each 
of them have codenames and what they mean  cyclops storm etc 
logan the rudely asks

                              logan

                  whats yours  wheels 

logan then wants to get the hell out of there but xavier says 
that logans cabin in canada has been destroyed by sabretooth and 
he no where to go 

he appeals to logan to stop hiding because of the terrible things 
that have been done to him

                              xavier

                  if you leave now then whats to stop them 
                  from killing you

                              logan

                  me

xavier says he knows that deep down logan is a good man and 
continues to explain more about the reason for logan being 
there

                              xavier

                  nothing right now can change whats 
                  happening its how we deal with whats 
                  around us that helps things feel right 
                  thats why youre here

jean then enters the office with rogue 

xavier says that rogue is looking for a place to belong and that 
this school is just the place she has been looking for he briefs 
her about the school and explains what the mutants purpose is
 
                                                                            
                                                                           
                         xavier

                  were not what you think   

logan says that he will give the place 48 hours after that 
hes gone xavier agrees


int a limousine in washington dc  day

senator kelly is in the limousine complaining to his assistant 
henry guyrich about how the president wont see his position 

guyrich then suddenly transforms into the real identity of 
mystique she kicks kelly in the face knocking him out


int the xmansion  day

jean shows logan to his room at the school it is a basic dorm 
room with a simple bed and a desk she asks if he needs 
anything 

                              logan

                  a case of beer and some cigars 

she lightheartedly tells him no and then proceeds to asks him how 
he got his skeleton and who gave it to him he says he does not 
remember 

jean then suggests that xavier could help him with that by 
reading his thoughts he looks at her with interest and 
replies

                              logan

                  what if theyre naughty 

jean just smiles and starts out the door 

she then turns and only then does she realize that cyclops is 
standing there

                              jean

                  scott i 

cyclops starts down the hall jean follows

                              cyclops

                  he shouldnt be here

                              jean

                  what are you talking about

                              cyclops

                  hes dangerous you heard what happened at 
                  that bar theres no telling what a guy 
                  like that is capable of this is a school 
                  for gods sake

                              jean

                  if magneto is planning to use this man for 
                  some terrible purpose its our
                  responsibility to do something

jean stops cyclops from walking

                              jean cont

                  whats wrong theres something else
                  bothering you

cyclops gets closer to jean she affectionately places her hands 
on his chest 


cut back to logans room logans sensitive hearing has picked up 
the whole conversation between cyclops and jean

                              cyclops 

                  i have a bad feeling about this

logan shrugs

                              jean 

                  thats the difference between you and him


int the xmansion  later that night

jean shows logans xrays to xavier storm and cyclops 

she explains that logans skeleton is made of adamantium which 
she believes has been grafted onto his bones by someone 
adamantium is the strongest substance known to man 

xavier says that logan has no memory of who did this to him and 
that he is pretty sure that it is not logan the man that magneto 
actually wants it is his skeleton
int the xmansion  the next morning

scott approaches logan and tries to introduce himself to try to 
get off on the right foot but logan is not feeling too friendly 
logan tells scott to stay out of his way until he leaves


a montage of scenes then follow 

we witness the daily events at xavier school for the gifted 
students study play sports with their powers etc 

this is probably where a lot of young mutant cameos will take 
place


ext the xmansion  later that afternoon

storm explains the schools mission to logan logan wonders why a 
simple school needs hightech labs special battle uniforms a 
stealth jet etc 

storm says that xavier inherited a great deal of money as a young 
man and established the school to protect mutants while humans 
adjust to their presence 

as they walk they come across scott and jean wearing their 
costumes while practicing their powers some of the other 
students including rogue watch on 

scott is blowing the caps off coke bottles on a fence jean 
catches them and sets them up again 

logan makes another suggestive comment to jean and this makes 
scott a bit jealous angry scott completely obliterates one of 
the bottles 

we pan back to see that toad has been watching all along


ext forest clearing  late that night

senator kelly awakens to find himself strapped to a metal chair 
magneto wearing his costume and helmet is there still 
fingering logans dog tag 

magneto tells kelly that guyrich has been dead for some time and 
has been impersonated by mystique who then shows herself 

kelly tells magneto that his actions are only proving kellys 
views about mutants correct magneto replies 

                              magneto

                  i hope so

magneto then turns on some lights to reveal a large flamboyant
looking machine 


he then explains his war plan to kelly while mentally moving 
chess pieces on a chess board 

                              magneto 

                  humans invented god to explain away their 
                  fears now humans fear us so we must be 
                  gods

magneto is completely insane 

he and kelly continue to spar over the intentions of the mutant 
registration act magneto says he intends to help humans 
understand mutants better 

he then inserts the dog tag into the machine and raises his arms 
using his magnetic powers to activate it rings of light form 
around the dog tag spinning faster and faster the machine 
begins to work on its own and magneto leaves 

light begins to ooze out of the machine covering kelly 
the light spreads out into the forest and into the night sky 
shining like a beacon for miles around we see that we are on an 
island and the light that engulfs the island grows to about five 
miles in diameter and then vanishes 

we find that the dog tag has been reduced to ash by the machine 

kelly appears healthy pink and somewhat different 

                              magneto 

                  welcome to the future 


int the xmansion  later that night

logan sleeps fitfully in his room at the mansion 

he then discovers that he is an old lab with 1950s era equipment 
in it he notices that his body is covered in incision marks that 
match his skeleton 

faceless doctors take notes and prepare the dog tag marked 
wolverine the doctors with scalpels prepare to cut as logan 
screams at the top of his lungs 

logan wakes from his nightmare to see a figure standing over him 
this startles him so he reacts instinctively and aggressively

cyclops jean and storm then rush into the room to find logans 
claws deep into rogues chest logan pulls out the claws and 
rogue who is fading reaches out and touches him logan trembles 
and howls in pain as rogue absorbs his healing power her wounds 
then close 

she then takes on logans persona and begins to smash things 
raking the walls as though she has claws after a moment she 
finally reverts to her normal self

she then runs from the room and storm follows jean tends to the 
unconscious logan while scott fumes


int magnetos island  the next day

senator kelly is in a cell on a cliff on magnetos island there 
is nothing but rock and bars that surround him as he faces the 
ocean the entrance at the rear of the cell enters into a dark 
chasm with a retracted catwalk providing the only access 

kelly puts his face against the bars and presses his head cracks 
like an egg and slips through he is more in shock than he is in 
pain especially when his head snaps back into place he hears 
someone approaching 

magneto arrives to find kelly pushing his broken and rehealing 
body through the bars magneto sics sabretooth on him and 
sabretooth grabs kellys skull and squeezes the senators head 
collapses and he slips through sabretooths grasp and falls into 
the ocean 

sabretooth looks apologetically at magneto 

int the xmansion  later that day 

logan walks through the halls of the school everyone is keeping 
their distance from him after hearing about the previous nights 
incident 

this could possibly be the rumored scene where kitty pryde walks 
by logan in the hall and proceeds to walk strait through a door 
to the astonishment of logan

he then enters a gym with unusually large weights and finds jean 
working out she is wearing a large engagement ring 

she has some trouble with the weights but refuses logans help 
 and his invitation to go get a beer 

she spots herself using her powers to lift the weights back on 
to the rack 


ext a public beach  day

at a crowded public beach a strange object moves through the 
water as it gets close it appears to transform from a dolphin
like creature to a human as it nears the shore 


its fins morph into arms and feet as senator kelly searches 
for some clothes to wear 

the crowd flees in fear and a child asks 

                              child

                  mom is that a mutant 


int the gym at the xmansion  later that day

jean and logan continue talking she explains that she is engaged 
to scott she then asks if thats why logans interested in her 
he doesnt reply

she asks logan if he would have killed the men in the bar 

                              logan

                  they shouldnt step up if theyre not 
                  prepared to pay the price 

                              
                              jean

                  thats a pretty steep price

jean adds that that is the difference between logan and scott 

cyclops then enters the weight room still dressed in full 
uniform  logan takes him in obviously amused by the dramatic 
outfit

                              cyclops
                             to jean

                  would you excuse us please id like to
                  talk with logan for a moment

                              jean
                             beat

                  sure

she exits

                              cyclops
                       walking up to logan

                  i just want to make you clear on 
                  something personally i dont care what
                  magneto wants with you he can take those 
                  claws of yours and use them for barbecue 
                  skewers what i do care about is the 
                  safety of this group so for the 
                  remainder of your time here youre going 
                  to keep that killer instinct of yours 
                  locked down so no one else gets hurt

logan looks at cyclops appraisingly

                              logan
                             smirks

                  you know ive served with men like you
                  before methodical systematic 
                  naive you know what happens to those

                  shut up who are you talking to i got no 
                  interest in you xavier

he points mockingly at the xs on cyclops uniform

                              
                              logan cont

                  looking at your girl  or maybe you 
                  dont like the way shes looking back and 
                  maybe you think youre man enough to do 
                  something about it

cyclops is enraged a red light begins to glow around the edges 
of his visor and the rubyquartz lens brightens we can faintly 
hear the low hum of immense power that is now barely contained

before cyclops can even react logan puts his right fist against 
cyclops throat shook logan extends one claw up the side 
of cyclops neck he smiles

                              logan cont

                  cmon sport you think you can blow the
                  meat off my bones before i gut you lets 
                  find out

the air is now charged with tension we hear nothing but the 
sound of logans enraged breathing then cyclops turns away


int xaviers office  minutes later

wham logan slams open the door of xaviers office and storms in

                              logan

                  i have a question for you chuck  
                  whats the point making yourselves into
                  some sort of team of superpowered 
                  freaks teaching wayward mutants about
                  classical literature for what

                              xavier

                  logan when i 

                              logan

                  yeah i know i heard you were a rich
                  young mutant and the injustices of
                  society and blah blah blah

xavier tells logan that magneto is right humans will come 
after mutants 

                              xavier

                  but the choice is fight and be destroyed 
                  or fight for understanding 

xavier believes the latter response is the more worthy 

logan says they differ on that because if the people who put the 
claws in his arms were standing right there he would kill them 
 again logan then says the 48 hours are up 

xavier says he knows that magneto wants the adamantium in logans 
bones but he doesnt know for what purpose 

storm then abruptly enters and says that rogue has vanished 


logan xavier storm cyclops and jean then walk down a high
tech subterranean corridor to a big vault door xavier says they 
will use the device within to find rogue the same way they found 
logan the device is cerebro

a retina scan clears xavier to enter 

once in he puts on the chrome skullcap

xavier says that magneto helped him build the device back when 
they were allies 

xavier then activates the machine we see the earth from space 
approaching quickly we then hear the voices of everyone on the 
planet skimming through entire towns and countries until we 
see rogue in a train station
we close in on the back of her head until the screen goes black 
and we hear her voice 

                              rogue

                  i dont belong  theres no where to go

xaviers eyes pop open and he says that rogue is at the train 
station and doesnt know where shes going

logan wants to help her and asks to go along 


int another part of the xmansion  minutes later

scott and storm get into one of xaviers bentleys but logan 
chooses a harley from the garage and roars off ahead of them to 
the train station


int the solarium of the xmansion 

jean is in the solarium treating a small cut on a student when 
senator kelly suddenly appears he says he has always known about 
the school  but he is hurt badly barely making it water is 
oozing off his body 

jean takes him to the lab where she and xavier examine him 
kelly is barely coherent 

xavier then enters his mind and we see a quick recap of the 
movies events as seen from kellys point of view 


ext the train station 

scott and storm enter the train station going past logans 
parked cycle 

inside logan is tracking rogue and spots her get on a train he 
hops on a few cars and finds her sitting alone 

she explains to logan how her powers first appeared on her first 
date on her first kiss how she
nearly killed the boy and how her parents rejected her 

logan comforts her just as the train starts to leave he says 
that they will get off at the next station and give xaviers 
geeks another chance 

but the train suddenly stops magnetos boots can be seen 
walking down the aisle toward logan logan pops out his claws 

magneto reveals under his cloak five glass and metal syringes he 
then levitates logan

magneto uses his powers to launch the syringes at logan they hit 
and the plungers depress 


logan staggers taking swipes and cutting the seats in the train 
before he collapses at magnetos feet 


int the xmansion 

jeans tests reveal that kellys cells cant handle the change 
his body is going through his body is liquefying


int the train station 

at the station scott and storm spot where the crowds are fleeing 
from the car where the fight has occurred they head for the 
action 

sabretooth suddenly reaches out and grabs storm by the throat 
toad then reveals himself using his sticky tongue to steal 
cyclops visor 

surprised cyclops directs his beam up away from the crowd 
before he can close his eyes the blast
hits the ceiling and the entire building shakes 

int the xmansion

xavier detects storms distress telepathically he and jean race 
to join the battle


cut back to the train station

storm appears done but the hairs on sabretooths back rise and 
he is blasted away from her by a bolt of lightning that she 
creates 


storm is knocked out sabretooth is only stunned 

with his eyes closed a blind scott stumbles through the crowd 
looking for storm when a cop suddenly stops him and puts a gun to 
the side of his head


int the xmansion

at the gate to the mansion rogue appears she is admitted and 
finds her way to cerebro rogues eye morphs into xaviers eye to 
gain access through the retina scan 

once inside mystique resumes her normal shape


 and steals a small computer chip from the device 


int the train station

cops are everywhere at the station emts are examining storm 
scott is handcuffed and refuses to open his eyes or reveal his 
name to the cops who are questioning him 

the cops are about to get rough with scott when everyone in the 
station suddenly hears the word stop in their minds 

xavier and jean reveal themselves and everyone one but the xmen 
suddenly drop to the ground and go to sleep 

xavier calls to rogue who steps from the shadows scared stiff by 
what has happened 


int the xmansion  later that day

xavier and jean explain to the others that they know magneto has 
built a machine that will turn normal humans into mutants and 
that it uses adamantium as its core much like a light bulb uses 
tungsten as a
filament adamantium is the only known substance strong enough to 
contain the power the device emits 

jean then insists that what has happened to senator kelly proves 
that the machine does not work she believes that human genes can 
not handle the change meanwhile kelly is dying 

they believe magneto wants to use logans skeleton to power a 
larger demonstration of his device they realize the most likely 
place that magneto could do this would be at the un summit 
about to convene on ellis island 

suddenly kellys monitors go berserk and the xmen watch 
helplessly as kellys body liquefies before their eyes they 
realize they need to find out where logan is being held 


xavier then enters cerebro again but suddenly the machine goes 
berserk when he activates it xaviers back arches in incredible 
pain and he falls to the floor unconscious he is taken to the 
lab and they monitor his coma

jean then examines cerebro and realizes the neurofilter that 
allows xavier to filter out the billions of minds on the planet 
in his search for one mutant is gone 

they cant bring xavier back without cerebros help and they need 
to recover the filter for it to work properly 


jean then reassures a distraught cyclops that he is the leader 
for a reason that he can live up to xaviers expectations 


int  the war room in the xmansion  minutes later

examining a map of the new york harbor 

 they determine that the only place magneto could use his 
machine to maximum effect without being detected is the statue of 
liberty


before leaving cyclops promises the comatose xavier that he will 
look after the school and the students no matter what happens to 
xavier 

rogue then tries to talk the xmen into letting her come along 
but storm says that it is too dangerous rogue will not take no 
for an answer 

scott apologizes to jean for acting jealous as they suit up and 
join everyone else aboard the xjet 

the schools basketball court in the yard opens up to reveal the 
jet they then take off into the night sky


ext ellis island  night

at ellis island all the political dignitaries are arriving to a 
grand display of pomp 

away from the action two cops patrol the island toad descends 
on them incapacitating them with a sickening crunch


two more cops are on patrol along the sea wall at nearby liberty 
island one of the cops holds a lighter for the others cigarette 
when all of the sudden the flame goes out of control and engulfs 
them 

a police boat then approaches the island a cop in the foreground 
waves at the boat pilot then contorts in pain from sabretooth 
taking care of him the boat pilot shapeshifts to reveal 
mystique


magneto is standing on the boat as it docks  he pulls back a 
tarp to reveal the unconscious logan and the machine magneto 
prepares to raise the machine 


ext the xjet

on the xjet storm provides cover for their approach creating a 
dense fog in the harbor 

int the statue of liberty


logan wakes in a strange small room magneto is there logans 
fists are strapped to his body so that if he extends his claws 
hell puncture his vital organs 

magneto explains he intends to make the mutant cause the worlds 
cause in one fell stroke and logan¹s life is small thing to 
sacrifice toward that goal 

magneto prepares to drug logan again but logan suddenly kicks 
the syringe out of his hand indifferent magneto leaves and 
locks logan in the room 

magneto then stands on the catwalk around the statues torch 
savoring the moment mystique then reports that the president is 
late 

magneto spots the fog and realizes the xmen are coming he warns 
his brotherhood of mutants 


ext just off of liberty island

the xjet lands in the water the xmen open the hatch and jump 
down onto liberty island 

across the water at ellis island the dignitaries are taking 
their seats for the opening of the summit storm looks up at the 
torch and sees it has been replaced by the bottom part of 
magnetos machine 

cyclops finds the charred remains of a policemans hat 


inside the xjet the hatch pops open again a stowaway rogue 
hops out ready to join the mission and save her friend logan 
whos kicked away the glass in the torch and can see out 

at some point logan gets his uniform because he is wearing it as 
all of this is going on at this time i do not know how he 
acquires it

rogue then heads past a 6foot replica of the statue outside the 
structure the replicas eyes turn mystique red


int the statue of liberty

in a giant museum multilevel room that welcomes visitors to the 
statue scott jean and storm consult a map to figure out the 
best plan of attack and rescue 

rogue rushes into the museum when she suddenly hears footsteps 
and turns to find logan who we see from behind is really 
mystique trying to lure rogue away 

in the museum toad unexpectedly enters the fray leaping at 
storm cyclops fires at him but misses 
toad attacks jean using his tongueslime on her it covers her 
mouth and nose and then hardens she is unable to breathe toad 
suddenly disappears 

scott rushes to jean and tells her to lay still 

he focuses his beam tightly and cracks the adhesive on her face 
he is then able to pull it off and she can breathe again 


meanwhile storm is looking for toad he quickly pops up again

toad then spots cyclops and jean back on the lower level


to toads surprise storm appears again

 
she cranks up the wind to hurricane force so toad adheres 
himself to the deck until the deck finally gives way 

with the wind blowing harder he grabs on to the seawall railing 
with his sixfoot tongue and flaps in the wind storm zaps the 
railing with a lightning bolt and toad is then blown into the 
harbor sinking without a trace 

scott jean and storm then find the stairwell to the torch is 
blocked by debris

instead they head for the statues crown once they arrive they 
discover that the crown is empty but from there they can see and 
hear logan trying to escape from the torch 

suddenly the metal bracing in the room comes loose and wraps 
around cyclops neck storm and jean are also caught scott is 
held facing jean 

magneto floats into the crown this creates the hole in the roof 
of the crown and tears off cyclops visor leaving him unable to 
use his power without hurting jean magneto then puts the visor 
on his belt 

magneto takes the neurofilter from his belt and tucks it in a 
pocket on jeans costume saying they can try and save xavier 
once this is all over 

jean says that the machine does not work because senetor kelly is 
dead magneto says it does not matter and that he is the one 
holding the fates of the world leaders in his hands not vice 
versa 

sabretooth then radios in and says that the president has finally 
arrived magneto raises his arms and begins to power up the 
machine logans skeleton begins to glow through his skin 

mystique arrives and walks over to stand next to magneto the 
machine is fully charged 

jean pleads to mystique to stop this 

                              mystique

                  dont listen to her its a trap

                              magneto

                  what is
 
                              mystique

                  this is

mystique then kisses magneto deeply mystique is actually 
rogue who has acquired mystiques shape shifting ability and 
she is sucking the power out of him when rogue does this the 
immense power she gains from magneto creates the famous white 
stripe down rogues hair 

jean then tells rogue to destroy the machine but magneto is 
still conscious and begins to choke rogue 
rogue begins to lose consciousness and makes eye contact with 
wolverine from the torch his skin begins to smoke 

seeing no other way out wolverine extends his claws through his 
chest and roars in pain as he frees himself and pulls the claws 
from his own body


ext ellis island

the security on ellis island notices the catastrophy and begins 
to investigate they get in boats and speed over to liberty 
island 


int the statue of liberty

enraged magneto chokes rogue even harder 

wolverine stands free and leaps down into the crown he extends 
his claws and heads in to kill magneto who doesnt have enough 
power to defend himself 

jean pleads with wolverine not to kill him so he retracts his 
claws midpunch and merely knocks out magneto 

from the stairwell though sabretooth grabs wolverine and pulls 
him down a knockdown fight occurs in the narrow confines of the 
stairs 

wolverine uses his metal skull headbutting sabretooth with a 
sickening crunch 

but then sabretooth tosses wolverine through the whole in the 
roof onto the crown

sabretooth then climbs onto the crown grabs wolverines body 
and tosses him off of the head of the statue

in midair wolverine grabs one of the spikes protruding from the 
statues head 

and slingshots himself back onto the spike

wolverine extends his claws inviting sabretooth to come and get 
him

sabretooth accepts the challenge with a roar 

they continue to fight and wolverine even punctures sabretooth 
with his claws at one point but eventually sabertooth knocks 
wolverine unconscience 

sabertooth is about to finish off wolverine when his hair 
rises but this time sabertooth knocks out storm before she can 
strike again 

sabertooth then goes for jean but wolverine is there again 
standing over magneto wolverine takes cyclops visor from 
magnetos belt wolverine tosses it in the air and jean then uses 
her powers to quickly float it back onto cyclops face 

wolverine and sabertooth continue to fight in a logicdefying 
manner but sabretooths death does not come from wolverine it 
comes from cyclops who blasts sabretooth through the forehead 
of the statue of liberty

sabertooth lands on magnetos boat still parked next to the 
island 

rogue who still has magnetos powers frees the xmen and they 
flee the statue 

mystique who is tied up takes the form of a cop to escape when 
the authorities arrive they search magnetos boat but 
sabretooth is gone

something to remember sabretooth has the super healing factor 
just as wolverine does

magneto is then captured the police do not notice the shape of 
the xjet flying off in the distance 

int the xmansion

back at the school the neurofilter is reinstalled and with 
cerebros help xavier comes to


int the xmansion  a few days later

the schools students are watching the vote on the mutant 
registration act in the senate the bill fails on a 5149 vote 
the deciding vote belonged to senator kelly who now says that 
he fears the forces of fear and prejudice could tear the nation 
apart 

he then gets into a limousine and he is revealed to be mystique 
in yet another disguise 


int logans room in the xmansion

logan opens the blinds in his room at the school to find a box 
it is a case of odouls nonalcoholic beer and a card that reads 
welcome home x

xavier then appears and tells logan that they will miss him but 
as everyone prepares to say goodbye and thank logan for what he 
did he changes his mind drops his duffel bag and asks 

                                                               
                              logan

                  is there any real beer in the place 


int a special prison

in this special prison where the walls and everything inside of 
them is made of plastic xavier is wheeled in a special plastic 
wheelchair into the cell where magneto is being held 

magneto is playing chess he says that he would not have let 
charles die and that soon he will find an escape and the war will 
continue 

xavier says he and his students will be ready to meet him xavier 
then moves a piece on the chess board 

                              xavier

                  check 

xavier then leaves escorted out by a guard magneto smiles and 
levitates another piece on the board

                              magneto

                  and mate
