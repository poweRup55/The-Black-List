	a crack of thunder

	on a distant rainy hill the old frankenstein castle as
	we knew and loved it is illuminated by another bolt of
	lightning

	music  an eerie transylvanian lullaby begins to play in
	the bg

2	another angle								2

	as we move slowly closer to the castle  it is completely
	dark except for one room  a study in the corner of the
	castle  which is only lit by candles

	now we are just outside a rainsplattered window of the
	study  we look in and see

	an open coffin rests on a table we can not see its contents
	as the camera slowly circles the coffin for a better view

	then as of by force of will the skeletons fingers grab
	the box back and place it where it was

	now the hand  using its other hand  grabs the box
	back from the skeletons fingers  the skeleton no longer
	resists

6	cornelius waldman								6

	whose hands we have just seen now carries the box to a
	small table  he takes a tiny key out from his vest pocket
	and begins to unlock the metal box

	nine people watch him closely  they are seated on chairs
	in the study waiting to hear the contents of
	beaufort frankensteins will  their dress is turnofthe
	century transylvanian

	cornelius waldman fumbles with the lock emitting strange
	grunts as he tries to open it  with each grunt the face
	of a potential heir is seen squirming with frustration
	or anger

	cornelius waldman finally opens the lock  he takes out an
	old parchment puts on his glasses coughs and sputters a
	few times and then begins to read

					cornelius waldman

			last will and testament and i direct
			my executor cornelius waldman to

	at the words in my own voice the nine potential heirs
	exchange curious glances

			such disposition to commerce at
			the hour of twelve oclock of my

			how do you do this thing  where
			in here  just talk right into it
			all right am i close enough  all
			right all right  get the hell
			out of the way
				he clears his throat
				then speaks in a deep
				majestic voice
			the once proud name of frankenstein
			has been dragged by my only son
			victor into an abyss of shame
			there was a time when the name
			frankenstein conjured dreams of
			virtue of honor and devotion  now
			no guilt no malignity no misery
			can be found to equal mine  and
			the catalogue of sins of my once
			devoted son will not cease to
			rankle in my wounds until death
			shall close them forever  so
			supremely frightful is the effect
			of any human endeavor to mock the
			stupendous mechanism of the creator
			of the world
			did you get all that  are you sure
			you got rankle in my wounds  ill
			kill you if you screw this up  all
			right all right now as to the
			disposition of my estate

					helene
			i object herr waldman  this is a

			grandson cared anything at all for
			the house of frankenstein he would
			have shown it by being here with
			those of us who still have some
			respect  i think we should completely

20	int medical arena  day							20

	herr falkstein quietly enters into the balcony of an
	arena packed with young medical students  a lecture is
	in progress

					lecturers voice
				os
			if we look at the base of a brain
			which has just been removed from
			a skull theres very little of
			the midbrain that we can actually
			see

										cont

											10

											20 cont

	herr falkstein proceeds almost on tiptoe along the
	aisle towards a vacant seat  he is carrying a briefcase
	and a small metal box

					lecturers voice
				os
			yet as i demonstrated in my
			lecture last week if the under
			aspects of the temporal lobes
			are gently pulled apart the
			upper portion of the stem of
			the brain can be seen

	herr falksteins footsteps echo ever so lightly against
	the cold stone floor as he passes the faces of students
	intense with concentration

					lecturers voice
				os
			this so called brain stem
			consists of the midbrain a
			rounded protrusion called the
			pons and a stalk tapering
			downwards called the
			medulla oblongata which passes
			out of the skull through the
			foramen magnum and becomes
			of coursethe spinal cord

	herr falkstein finds a vacant place and sits down

					lecturers voice
				os
			which brings us directly to the
			demonstration prepared for today
			are there any questions before
			we proceed

					medical student
			rising
			i have one question
			dr frankenstein

										cut to

21	another angle								21

	our first look at the famous lecturer

					freddy
			thats fronkonsteen

					medical student
			i beg your pardon

					freddy
			my name is pronounced fron kon steen

					medical student
			oh  i thought it was dr frankenstein

					freddy
			no its dr fronkonsteen

					medical student
			but arent you the grandson of the
			famous dr victor frankenstein
			who performed such fascinating
			experiments in electricity and
			galvanism

					freddy
			thats true  but my grandfather
			victor was after all what we
			might politely refer to as a
			cuckoo

	polite laughter

					freddy
			i prefer by far to be remembered
			for my own small contributions to
			science  now if we can proceed to
			your questions

					medical student
			well sir im not sure i
			understand the distinction between
			reflexive and voluntary nerve
			impulses

					freddy
			very good  since our lab work today
			is a demonstration of just that
			distinction why dont we proceed

	behind freddy is a patient lying on an operating table
	carlson an assistant stands near the patient next to
	a small table of instruments

										cont

											21 cont

					freddy
			what are we actually talking about
			when we use the term brain  we
			are talking about a cauliflower

	freddy turns to carlson

					freddy
			may i have the cauliflower please

	carlson hands freddy a giant cauliflower

					freddy
			if we make a small slit down the
			center of this cauliflower

	freddy turns to carlson who hands him the scalpel  freddy
	makes a small slit down the center of the cauliflower

					freddy
			and then ever so gently
			gently gently pull it apart

	freddy has some difficulty pulling the cauliflower apart
	it begins to crumble but he goes on professionally

					freddy
			we should find with any luck
			at all a stalk of celery

	there is no celery inside the cauliflower  freddy flushes
	red 

					freddy
				to carlson
			where did you get this cauliflower

					carlson
			from your office sir

					freddy
			didnt you prepare it with the
			celery before my lecture

					carlson
			yes sir  but i must have taken
			the wrong one when we came up

					freddy
				in quiet rage
			are you trying to make me look
			like an idiot

										cont

											13

											21 cont1

					carlson
			no sir  it will never happen again

					freddy
				handing him
				the cauliflower
			here  this cauliflower is useless
			to me

	freddy turns back to his audience

					freddy
			with any normal cauliflower we
			would have found a stalk of celery
			or brain stem which brings us
			to the practical application of
			our study

	freddy moves behind the patient on the table

					freddy
			mr hilltop here  with whom i have
			never worked of given any prior
			instructions to  has graciously
			offered his services for this afternoons
			demonstration  mr hilltop

					hilltop
			yes sir

					freddy
			have we ever seen each other before
			this afternoon

					hilltop
			no sir
					freddy
			tell them

					hilltop
				turning to the
				medical students
			no sir  we havent

	freddy
				to his audience
			do i lie
				to mr hilltop
			would you be so kind enough to hop
			up on your feet and stand beside
			this table

	mr hill top gets off of the table and stands erect

										cont

											14

											21 cont2

					freddy
			mr hilltop  would you raise
			your left knee please

	mr hilltop raises his left knee

					freddy
			you have just witnessed a voluntary
			nerve impulse  it begins as a
			stimulus from the cerebral cortex
			passes through the brain stem and
			then to the particular muscle
			involved  mr hilltop you may
			lower your knee

	he lowers his knee

					freddy
			reflex movements are those which
			are made independently of the will
			but are carried out along pathways
			which pass between the periphery and
			the central nervous system  you
			filthy rotten yellow son of a bitch

	freddy pokes his knee close to mr hilltops balls
	mr hilltop reacts accordingly

					freddy
			we are not aware of the impulses
			neither do we intend them to contract
			our muscles  yet  as you can see 
			they work by themselves

	by this time mr hilltop has lowered his protective thigh
	 a little nervously

					freddy
			now then  modern research has
			shown us that by simply applying
			local pressure of  blocking the
			nerve impulse which can be done
			with any ordinary metal clamp

	freddy reaches out his hand  carlson hands him a bicycle
	clamp  freddy holds mr hilltops head and places the
	clamp behind mr hilltops ears

					freddy
			 just at the swelling on the
			posterior nerve root  for oh
			say five or six seconds

	a short pause  freddy looks at his watch

										cont

											15

											21 cont3

					freddy
			why you mothergrabbing bastard

	freddy once again jerks his knee close to mr hilltops
	balls  this time mr hilltop doesnt move  he is almost
	ready to pass out

					freddy
			all communication is shut off
			similarly damage to a nerve will
			mean that not all the impulses can
			get through and there will be
			weakness of a muscle

	mr hilltop collapses to the floor  freddy never looks down

					freddy
			or group of muscles with some
			loss of skin sensation on the area
			supplied by that nerve  in spite
			of our mechanical magnificence if
			there is not this continuous stream
			of impulses we would collapse
			like a bunch of broccoli

	a smattering of polite applause  freddy reaches down and
	removes the metal clamp from mr hilltops head

					freddy
				to carlson
			give him an extra dollar

					carlson
			yes sir

	carlson picks up mr hilltop and places him on the operating
	table

					freddy
			in conclusion it should be noted
			that more than common injury to the
			nerve roots is always serious
			because once a nerve fibber is
			severed there is no way to
			regenerate life back into it  are
			there any more questions before we
			leave

					medical student
			dr fronkonsteen

					freddy
			yes

					medical student
			isnt it true that darwin preserved
			a piece of vermicelli in a glass
			case until by some extraordinary
			means it actually began to move
			with voluntary motion

					freddy
			a piece of what

					medical student
			vermicelli

					freddy
			are you speaking of the worm or
			 the spaghetti

					freddy
			why the worm sir

					freddy
			ah  in science you must be very
			precise  it can spell the
			difference between life and death
				to carlson
			i dont want that fellow in class
			next semester

					carlson
			yes sir

					freddy
			he has a big mouth
				 to medical student
			yes  it seems to me i did read
			something about that incident as a
			student  but you have to remember
			that a worm  with very few exceptions
			 is not a human being

					medical student
			but wasnt that the whole basis of
			your grandfathers work sir the
			reanimation of component parts

					freddy
			my father was a sick man

					medical student
			but arent you the least bit curious
			about it doctor  doesnt the secret
			of life hold any intrigue for you

					freddy
			you are talking about the gibberish
			ravings of a lunatic mind

										cont

											17

											21 cont5

					medical student
			yes but sir if it could be
			accomplished wouldnt that
			eliminate disease from the human
			frame and render man invulnerable
			to any but a violent death

					freddy
			how old are you young man

					medical student
			nineteen sir

					freddy
			nineteen  my dear young man
			once the human organism has ceased
			to function nature has deemed
			that creature to be dead

					medical student
			but look at whats been done with
			hearts and kidneys

					freddy
			hearts and kidneys are tinker toys
			im talking about the central
			nervous system

					medical student
			but sir

					freddy
			i am a scientist  not a
			philosopher

	he holds up his scalpel

					freddy
			you have more chance of reanimating
			this knife than you have of mending
			a broken nervous system

					medical student
			but your grandfathers work sir

					freddy
			my grandfathers work was doodoo
			dead is dead  theres only one
			thing i am interested in and that
			is the preservation of life

	has plunged the scalpel into his thigh by mistake  no one
