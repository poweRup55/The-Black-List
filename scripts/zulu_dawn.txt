and zulu drums are heard

bull as they struggle to
bring the animal to the ground they are watched by a vast 
circle of warriors all
shouting encouragement

of fenility rite the
females stand opposite the men in rows chanting as they move 
in closer

tall beautifully
fat with a big intelligent face and superb dignity he surveys

and unjust oppression which the zulu people have suffered from 
their
own king cetshwayo

pausing frere looks up as if to meet his comrades gaze 
chelmsford

exercise of prudence
and by meeting of the zulus in a spirit of forbearance and 
reasonable
compromise it will be possible to avert the very serious evil 
of a war with
cetshwayo

lolling from the ropes that bind him evidence of the beating 
he has

as he passes mbilini on the ground the warrior thrusts his 
trussed legs
between the sentrys legs the sentry stumbles to the ground 
his
head near bayeles feet he immediately starts to rise but 
before he can
bayele has lifted his powerful foreleg waist high in stamping 
position and
brings it down with a sickening crunch onto the sentrys lower 
neck

now all is desperate speed under bayeles directions mbilini
stretches to the unconscious sentry and manages to take his 
bayonet
with his bound feet

to his feet
managing to get the bayonet blade to bayeles bonds

between them the first ropes are cut

as bayeles hands are freed the sentry on the ground starts to 
regain
consciousness taking the bayonet from mbilini bayele thrusts 
the
weapon into the sentrys back killing him he removes the 
bayonet
from the sentrys body and also takes a knife from the redcoats
scabbard which he hands to mbilini together they free the 
third zulu
tied to the other wagon

defeat our generals
convert our bishops and who on this day have put an end to a 
great dynasty
